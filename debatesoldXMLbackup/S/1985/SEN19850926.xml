      <P>I have notice from Senator John Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to improve the building of a special school in Carlow for the moderately handicapped.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Catherine McGuinness of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Department of Education to provide proper educational facilities for a profoundly deaf child who resides in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Browne's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senator McGuinness may give notice for another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Aid: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Ferris on 25 September 1985:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann recognising the tragic circumstances of farmers in the west of Ireland and in the Shannon basin resulting from the disastrous weather conditions, calls on the Government to ensure that, in making emergency aid available, farmers in all parts of Ireland who have also suffered losses are compensated under the emergency aid programme</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;calls on the Government to declare a nationwide agricultural emergency following the disastrous summer weather, and in conjunction with the EEC to implement with a minimum of delay a programme of measures to alleviate the fodder shortage, to stop the panic-selling of cattle, to tide grain farmers where crops have been lost over till next year and to provide assistance to farmers whose land has been flooded,&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator T. Hussey.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I come from a county that has been affected as badly as any other in the country by the bad weather we have had all summer.  There is no doubt that as far as my county is concerned an emergency situation exists.  The same obtains in the <Col N="131" /> rest of the country.  Even if the Government do not declare a nationwide emergency, my view is the emergency exists anyway irrespective of whether it is declared to be nationwide.  In many parts of the country, but particularly parts joining the river Shannon, there is flooding of a more serious nature than has ever occurred at this time of year.  It is to be expected in certain areas adjacent to the Shannon that flooding will occur during the winter months.  This year the flooding has occurred at a time when the land in those areas should be at maximum production yielding crops of hay and grass which would ensure that farmers would have adequate feed for their stock right up to the onset of winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the losses which the farmers in these areas have suffered as a result of flooding are unprecedented.  Many of the farmers in these areas are facing ruin and it will be impossible for many of them to survive in farming.  As well as the serious losses of fodder, many of them have had to dispose of the stock they had on hands at sacrifice prices.  There has been a suggestion that in the west, particularly in the worst hit areas, there has been panic selling.  I would suggest that it is not this that is taking place but that farmers have no choice but to dispose of their stock because their fields are flooded.  Any land which is above water is so waterlogged that it is unapproachable and there is no grass for ths stock.  Farmers have no choice but to take stock to the mart and sell them at whatever price they can obtain for them.  At the moment the prices which those farmers are getting for small cattle are in many cases lower than the prices that were paid for them when they were bought as calves.  Other farmers who up to now have managed to hold on to their stock will be forced to dispose of them over the next month or six weeks.  This stock, in most cases belonging to farmers in the west, would be unsuitable for slaughter &mdash; cows, calves, weanlings, unfinished stock, store cattle.  The farmers will have to take prevailing prices because they have no choice.  We know that prices for that type <Col N="132" /> of stock are very low, with the likelihood that they will get worse.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will be very difficult for such farmers to re-stock early next year when the growing season arrives.  The pressure on such farmers is intense and it is widely believed that many farmers will crack under that strain.  Farmers are facing ruin.  They will not be able to provide for their families.  They have no cash, no fodder and worse, they have no hope, without a chance of survival in farming.</P>
    <P>Tillage farmers throughout the country have suffered severe crop damage which will result in heavy financial losses.  Yields have been very low and the moisture content of the grain which they managed to harvest has been very high.  Farmers in the west have suffered most because the level of rainfall has been higher there. A higher proportion of the grain crop has lodged in western counties than elsewhere and it will not be possible to harvest some of it at all.  The grain growers also suffer the disadvantage of being unable to put in their barely and winter wheat crops for the coming year.</P>
    <P>It is therefore vital that the Government would make aid available to those farmers to tide them over to next spring. The Government must decide what form that aid will take.  I suggest that interest-free loans or loans at very low rates might provide a solution for many farmers.  I am sure it would be possible to obtain the necessary finance to fund such loans from the European Investment Bank. The exchange rates would be minimal because our currency has maintained a very stable position within the EMS and there is no danger that the exchange risks involved would be significant.  I ask the Minister to look at the position from that point of view.  It might help to maintain grain production at the high level of the past few years.</P>
    <P>There is an acute fodder shortage, particularly in the west and north-west.  I suggest that this fodder crisis is even worse than it appears.  A number of small farmers have land which is not suitable for silage making.  Many such farms are fragmented and traditionally have used hay.  Because of this year's weather many <Col N="133" /> such farmers were forced to attempt to make silage in order to provide some sort of fodder during the coming winter. Much of the silage was made in the most adverse conditions from the point of view of the ground and the weather.  Quantities of dirt were carried into the silage heaps on the wheels of machinery used to make the silage.  The heaps were covered simply with polythene.  Some heaps were treated with additives at considerable expense.  Such farmers had to pay the contractors who made the silage.  I am afraid that when many of the heaps are opened during the winter farmers will find that the quality is so poor in many cases that the silage will be totally unpalatable and useless.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister again, in addition to what he announced last night which should only be the start of the scheme of assistance for farmers, that he should provide extra help to ensure that farmers will survive&mdash; and it is a matter of survival in the cases of many.  The Minister should try to get some of the money in EC coffers to provide improved headage payments, even if they were to be paid on a selective basis to farmers who have been worst hit in this year's crisis.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, too, to urge his Cabinet colleagues to agree to a greater degree of flexibility in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance among small farmers in the west so that they will be able to provide for their families during the coming winter.  The Minister must press the financial institutions to be as sympathetic as possible to all farmers who are in extreme difficulties.  I know that individual branch managers of banks are sympathetic, but unfortunately credit policy is being dictated by regional and head offices.  It appears that in such offices there is very little appreciation of the crisis in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unnecessary to talk about the awful summer we have had because even non-farmers looking out at the weather day after day were driven round the bend.  The one bright spot was that the Minister was seen to be alive and active.  He was on the job and saw what <Col N="134" /> the problems were.  I compliment him on going into the country to appreciate the scene.</P>
      <P>I compliment him also on the action he has taken in dealing with these problems. It is all very fine for people to put up suggestions that are pie in the sky and sound very good, but in the end they are unworkable.  It is good to think that our Minister can go over to Brussels and have such standing that they will accept his word that things are bad, will come to see for themselves and take action.  The provision of £20 million is a good deal of money when money is scarce.  I am quite sure that the farmers will appreciate very much what the Minister has done.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the flooding along the Shannon valley which is a disaster in the west.  I am glad that fodder has been provided to help these farmers.  I know how they feel even in a normal summer if they have not all the hay or even silage they need.  They worry in advance about what a spring or winter might be like, so I can easily understand the panic that must be going through their minds as they see hay flooded and have no silage in many cases.  I do not come from an area that was flooded.  I come from an area that grows corn to a very large extent, and farmers there have had trouble with corn lodging early and then the winter wheat sprouting and finally the very high moisture content in the corn they cut.  Some of them have had severe losses.  In the fine weeks many of them were happy that they fared reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was mentioned at our meeting with the IFA a long time ago, it would not be possible to compensate farmers for complete loss of corn and many of them are realistic enough to know that they had a good year last year and will have to take a certain loss this year.  Some may have fared badly with their winter corn. I ask the Minister to try to use his offices to get loans at subsidised rates for these people.  They are not looking for charity. They are good businessmen who know that business goes up and down, that they will come back again, but it would be unfair to leave them completely on their <Col N="135" /> own to write off the loss and not make any effort to help them.  The Minister is probably pressing for this as best he can and I know the difficulty he faces in looking for all these loans.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat that the banks and lending institutions should be asked to take a realistic look at what is happening. Let me side track a little.  Yesterday two companies were in financial difficulty because of the actions of banks.  It appears from what I have been told by people who are dealing with this that the banks are beginning to be ruthless at this stage about getting their money.  A certain amount of losses can be written off, but our Government should ask the banks to take a much more lenient view and especially at this stage where farmers are quite clearly in difficulties.  It is not that they are pretending that they are in difficulty.  Anyone alive or alert can see that it is genuine.  I will leave the Euro loan to the Minister because he knows what is possible and what is not.</P>
    <P>In my area apart from corn, oil seed rape and peas in particular have been devastated.  I make the same appeal to the Minister on behalf of those who were affected here.  Some were very badly hit; some came out of it reasonably well; but perhaps he could try to negotiate loans for those who are really in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>I ask him also to consider the belt of land, some of it across my own territory, that was affected by the hailstone episode. Much damage was done by that freak occurrence.  I know that he has about £1 million for that need and I hope that he will be able to distribute it fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has helped the cattle trade by extending from 30 to 60 days the period for testing.  It is not so easy to manage everything.  Farmers should not panic or become too greedy and start to buy cheap cattle at the expense of other farmers.  It is not possible for the Minister to bring in headage payments on a selective basis as was suggested, but I am quite sure he is doing his utmost to help a market that can be affected very often <Col N="136" /> by the way farmers behave.  In all these circumstances I have the utmost confidence in the Minister.  He has delivered the goods very well.  I want to thank him for doing that and to ask him regarding the area that I am interested in, the corn belt, if he can get loans at subsidised rates for people who suffered losses of corn, and for those who lost on peas and oil seed rape too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As an urban dweller I wish to contribute to this very important debate.  I have studied both the motion and the amendment.  Our amendment as worded is quite wide ranging and is necessary at this time.  We are saying that, because of the year we have had, we should declare a nationwide agricultural emergency.  Certainly at the moment we are in a farming emergency.  We can all see that the farmers are facing financial ruin.  The year has been extraordinary indeed.  Never before have we witnessed such a summer and I hope that never again will we witness a summer similar to that of 1985.  For many farmers it means the loss of their livelihood, the end of the road, and everything we can do should be done on their behalf.  The urban dweller will say that the farmer is at it again, but as never before the requires the help that should be forthcoming from this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farming has long been recognised as our greatest industry.  We know that at the moment other industries such as the construction industry and the tourism industry are going through a lean period, but if farming collapses then the whole nation suffers.  That is why every possible help should be given in this instance. The reason for the terrible calamity the farmers face is the disastrous summer. Accepting that farming is our greatest industry I stress that never before has aid been so vital to the farming industry as now.  It amazes me that our greatest industry can receive a mere £20 million, or thereabouts and, yet, when an insurance company like the PMPA or the ICI and other industries like Irish Steel or whatever, are in danger of collapsing overnight millions of pounds are pumped <Col N="137" /> into them.  It seems inconsistent to say the least.  Far more financial aid should be given in this case in an all out effort to help.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more money being given to the farming community.  I am told that the losses could well be in the region of £300 to £400 million and therefore what we are getting is only a fraction of the losses we are talking about.  As the previous speaker said, every effort should be made to have low fixed loans available from the European Investment Bank. This is not being suggested at the moment &mdash; perhaps I am wrong, but the Minister does not seem to be working in that direction &mdash; but in six or eight months there will be a great need for that because then farmers will be in a very serious state indeed.  We must immediately restore and increase farm unemployment assistance, or the farmers' dole and assessments in this area should be at this year's level of income because this is the year that counts.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker requested a sympathetic approach from the various financial institutions &mdash; the banks, the ACC and others who loan money or are in the habit of giving finance to the farming community.  I plead with them to take a sympathetic view at this time.  The land tax suggested for 1986 should be postponed for one year at least.  We all agree &mdash; and the Minister said in his speech &mdash; that winter fodder and how to provide it for the year ahead is the biggest problem but very little has been said about compensation for the potato grower, the carrot grower or the vegetable grower in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred last night to the hopelessness of the pea crop for this year and that is not being considered to the extent that I think necessary.  People with that crop too, have real and serious losses.  The urban dweller will not recognise the importance of this year for the farming community until March or April of next year when the real crisis will hit him.  The spin-off industries will be hit. The various co-operatives, processing <Col N="138" /> factories and the retail trade will feel the effect and many job losses will result from this serious position we find ourselves in today.</P>
    <P>Overall what is needed is not just £20 million, but much more.  I hope the Minister will consider some other means of helping the farming people.  He referred to the extensive flooding in the Shannon valley.  I should know a good deal about this problem, coming as I do from the town of Athlone and living within a mere 100 yards of the start of this flood on the Clonown Road.  I have known these farmers all their lives.  They are quite content to live in a natural winter flood situation; they are used to it by now; it is part of their way of life.  Obviously something could be done in the long term that would be helpful, but they have lived their lives knowing that, come winter the flood will be on the road and the fields will be under three and four feet of water. This year is different.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor will remember a meeting in Clonown Hall in 1981 at which he was present.  On the way to Clonown Hall that day we noticed in the fields three or four inches of water.  That was in June. The weather improved, the floods went off the fields and the fields recovered. But 1985 is so different.  Three weeks ago I went to a funeral in Clonown and most of the people had to take a detour because the road was flooded.  That flooding should be on the Clonown Road, in August or September was unheard of in history for 100 years or more.</P>
    <P>When you walked on Clonown Road in 1983, 1984 and all the other years you saw beautiful green fields and cool grazing land for cattle for six or eight months and then the flood came and the animals were taken off the land.  This year is different.  One walks that road today and sees four and five feet of water.  One is looking at fields with bales of hay floating around.  It is a sad sight indeed.  One million pounds for such a situation is not enough.  In many ways I would say it is an insult to the people there.  The Minister says that the maximum payment is £500 in this area of compensation.  If 3,000 farmers in the Shannon valley are <Col N="139" /> getting £1 million, the maximum will be £500 and many of them will get as little as £200.  That is absolutely ludicrous and an insult to them.  I hope this figure will be revised drastically upwards because they have no crops, vegetables or turf. They have nothing.  They are absolutely on their own and the prospect for them must be very grim indeed.</P>
    <P>The flooding from the River Shannon is a long term matter for the drainage of the Shannon and all its tributaries.  It is very regrettable that the £0.5 million that was available from the EC some years ago was dropped by the Government and that they did not proceed with the feasibility study.  It would have been a start.  I know it will cost millions and millions to drain the Shannon and make it a free flowing river that will not flood but, if we were serious about it, we should have at least allowed the feasibility study to get under way and accepted the EC money that was available at the time.  That and indeed other schemes such as the western package and other important areas of work vital to the farming community were dropped by the Government.</P>
    <P>What the Government are offering here is really a drop in the ocean and it is very little having regard to the size of the calamity the farming people face.  My hope today is that they will go back to the EC and continue to fight the case for the farmers and to get more funds and financial aid for them in their greatest hour of need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I rise to agree with much of what Senator Fallon has said.  Both sides of the House agree that the situation this year is a disaster for farmers.  Small farmers are in a desperate way.  Not long ago the banks opened their doors to all farmers and invited them to take many credit opportunities which, in the economics of the situation, it should not have been done in the first place.  Now they have called <Col N="140" /> in their loans and many farmers are in a desperate position due not only to the very bad summer we have had and the harvest, but also to the policy of these banks.</P>
      <P>I agree that if anything were to go out from the Seanad it should be that there be an easing up in the attitude of the financial institutions to the farming community. The banks should, in effect, show a sympathetic view towards the farmers. Many small farmers live on very small incomes and, once their incomes are eroded, they are in a poverty situation.  I know some small farmers who are good friends of mine who in the past few weeks had to go to the marts and sell livestock and to go immediately to the supermarket to pay cash for their food, just to keep bread on the table.  They were not in a position to write any more cheques. I agree that the Government are doing what they can, and I applaud the Minister for Agriculture for the way in which he has pursued this matter at EC level and also at home level.  He has far outstripped his counterpart on the British side and he was applauded from both North and South of this country for the efforts he has made in a disastrous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Fallon said about the long term low interest rates from Europe and that we should go for them in a bigger way.  I do not agree with the proposition that we should postpone the land tax for a period of 12 months because of this situation.  Each one has to be taken on an individual basis.  Each farmer is like a business.  I have always maintained that farming is a business. Some farmers do very well in good years and do badly in other years but, all in all, it is a business.  The land tax is very good for the productive small farmer but it is bad for the big land owner who has hundreds of acres of land left dormant. A land tax would stimulate those farmers into production.  It would be wrong to postpone the land tax.  If we look at the situation on an individual basis, I believe the Government would take a very sympathetic view of land tax in the case of farmers who are nearly bankrupt.  How could one expect anybody to pay money <Col N="141" /> he has not got?  It is the same sort of situation as that applying to small businesses. I have always argued about the payment of rates on a small business.  If the business has no money it cannot pay and therefore nobody comes after it for that money.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the sentiments expressed regarding the Shannon area.  I have been on the Shannon many times and I have seen the good areas and the bad areas there.  There is no doubt that we are talking about a massive disaster area.  The Government acted swiftly and brought people over from Europe to examine the situation on the Shannon. They got a bird's eye view of the disaster. They were highly impressed and understood the calamity in the Shannon area. That is an area where things can be done on an individual basis.  For example, the idea of the EC subsituting grain for money was good.  I make a strong plea for the small farmers and particularly for the people who are in desperate financial difficulty at the moment.  Many of them through no fault of their own but because of the bad summer and through their intensiveness in terms of their land have not been able to accumulate any funds and therefore find themselves in a desperate situation and with families to look after.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to continue the good work they are doing for the farming community.  We have taken a lead in Europe.  The Government have identified the situation and have brought people from the EC to investigate it.  They have taken a strong lead with the ACC and have taken a policy decision with the banks to either restructure the loans for farmers or to go easy on farmers at the moment.  I ask for that to continue.  I have no doubt that it will continue.  The small farmer should be protected because, as Senator Fallon said, farming is the biggest industry we have.  It has many spin-offs and it has a massive employment factor. All of those matters have to be taken into consideration.  If anything happens to the farming community all the people are involved and all the people are associated <Col N="142" /> with it.  It would be in everybody's interest that the small farmer should be protected and should continue to grow and be productive in the way he has been in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with one of the worst crises in the agricultural area for many years.  Most of the hay crop has been lost and the quality of hay saved and secured is very mediocre.  Everybody is agreed that the disadvantaged areas are the hardest hit.  Smallholders are in a very vulnerable situation and, as we all know, hilly land is not suitable for silage making.  There are fears of panic selling of stock at giveaway prices as a result of no fodder being available in many holdings. The replacement cost of stock next spring will be prohibitive and beyond the reach of people who have to sell stock now.  At present many farmers are over-borrowed, with the capacity to pay further eroded because of this crisis.  The lending institutions will have to take a very sympathetic attitude and the Minister will have to use all his influence to see that this will come about.  It is vital that the Government should make low cost finance available to help farmers to ride out the storm in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tillage farming in every part of the country has suffered with yields well down on previous years.  With the high cost of setting crops and making loan repayments, the purchase of farm machinery this year would place a severe strain on farmers and leave them in extreme cases unable to set crops for 1986.  The quality of feeding stuffs is not known, but certainly it is not up to standards of previous years.  It is reasonable to assume that.  The increase in cow slaughterings has serious long term implications for the cattle industry and, when taken in conjunction with the serious restrictions the super-levy has had, it is obvious that the agricultural industry faces a period of contraction.  The smallholder who depends solely on hay as winter fodder is in a doomsday situation. I understand the first measure <Col N="143" /> introduced by the Government was a fertiliser subsidy of £35 which was insufficient. It was a once off payment of £35 not per acre or per ton.  Taking into consideration that fertiliser is about £140 per ton, this was of no value to the farmers in this category.</P>
    <P>We are saying as a party that maximum headage payment should be made to ensure that these people will be able to sustain themselves and their families. Grain instead of cash seems to be very unwieldy and of limited benefit.  Farms west of the Shannon are being destocked and I understand that calves are being sold in the dairying areas at relatively low prices.  The Minister should examine immediately the feasibility of special loans to farmers for calf purchases as a replacement of stock that has to be sold off.  The real impact of this fodder crisis will not hit many farmers until next February or March when they will be confronted with major decisions about the future of their holdings.</P>
    <P>In every crisis there are lessons to be learned and one obvious lesson is that some of our haymaking equipment may be antiquated and in need of replacement. In areas where there is available equipment for making round bales the problem has not been so acute.  There is a very strong case to be made for the introduction of a generous grant scheme to encourage small groups of farmers to purchase better and more modern equipment. Travelling through the country it is pathetic to see in the fields the amount of hay in square bales with their inability to stand up to the rain and effectively rotting away and useless.  Blight stricken potato growers are in for yet another bad year.  The blight on this very high production cost crop has led to many growers going into bankruptcy.  The exceptionally inclement weather this year has compounded the problem for potato growers who in normal times have to depend on their intuition to avoid the pitfalls that are caused by the cyclical nature of potato growing.  Vegetable crops are equally severely affected and this will be reflected in the volume of <Col N="144" /> Irish produce available and which will further aggravate the serious importation levels we have had in recent years.</P>
    <P>In my own county of Meath we have had serious problems some of which could have been avoided.  In know of an instance where 1,000 bales of hay were lost because of the failure of the Office of Public Works to finalise drainage operations properly.  This was an operation that would not have been very costly. Representations were made to the Office of Public Works many times and yet they did not see fit to have the small lot of work done and unfortunately one small farmer, who could very badly afford to do so, lost 1,000 bales of hay.</P>
    <P>To conclude and summarise what I have said, the measures needed include an increase in cattle headage payments, a moratorium on 1985 repayments, low cost finance at 5 to 6 per cent for a period of at least three years to help farmers recover from this situation and the introduction of a group fodder scheme to help with the purchase of such items as round balers and other machinery as well as social welfare payments for farmers seriously affected.  If all those things are not done the situation is that we could have a breakdown in the agricultural area which would have serious repercussions for this country for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from one of the counties that has been affected worst I must speak on this motion.  I know I have to be very brief and what I have to say probably will sound very truncated but initially I must welcome the Minister's measures as announced in the House last night, the substantial sum of £16 million of Exchequer funds towards the relief of disaster throughout the country, mostly to be made available in terms of subsidised grain to farmers who are badly affected by the fodder situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must put on record that I am disappointed by the amount of money made available by the EC &mdash; around £4.5 million.  I would have expected that it would have been much more and I do not know if anybody has made the point this morning but, as a representative from a <Col N="145" /> part of the country worst affected, I am very disappointed by the sum of money coming forward from the EC.  Had we got £16 million, the amount being made available by our own Exchequer, we would have a very substantial sum of money.  This would go much further than the amount being made available in alleviating the situation.  The grain subsidy goes to the very heart of the matter in the sense that it relates to the fodder problem.  The subsidy will provide grain for farmers who have a shortage of fodder.  I and some of whom have no fodder.  I would also suggest that it would be giving many farmers an experience of grain feeding their cattle perhaps for the first time and that they would find that in the long term a very beneficial experience as well.</P>
    <P>Coming from the Shannon valley I welsome the Government's decision to give an extra headage payment to all farmers within the Shannon valley up to a maximum of £500.  I would ask the Minister for the broadest possible interpretation of what the Shannon valley is.  I actually live in the Shannon valley because I live in the catchment of the Boyle River and its catchments and that is part of the Shannon valley.  I understand also that the River Suck is delineated as part of the Shannon valley but again I would ask for the widest possible interpretation because the River Suck stretches from Shannonbridge to Ballinlough and west of Ballinlough in County Mayo and it takes in all of that area that is broadly referred to in Roscommon as the Castlerea general area which also would take in part of east County Galway.  In all of these matters we need to have a special understanding because the west normally is the wettest area in terms of rainfall in the whole Community and normally we get far greater rainfall there than is experienced throughout mainland Europe or on the eastern coast of Ireland or indeed from the midlands towards the eastern coast of Ireland.  In the west normally farmers are prepared for higher than usual rainfall but there is no way that anybody could have anticipated the monsoon downpours which we <Col N="146" /> had to experience this year and which of course are now very evident on the ground all over the valleys of the major rivers in my region especially.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other small measures on which I would appeal to the Minister.  Two weeks ago he announced in regard to cattle headage payments that there would be no need for inspections for cattle sold after 9 September, that mart receipts would apply after that date because many farmers would be waiting until the end of September and perhaps October before their inspections could be carried out.  If they had animals disposed of before that time it would mean they would not be included for their headage. I would appeal to the Minister in this exceptional year to please backdate to August the date for which headage payments can be paid.  Many hundreds of farmers, maybe many thousands of small farmers in the worst affected areas, sold their small store cattle in the month of August.  I suggest to the Minister that the date be 1 August and that all mart receipts or receipts of where animals were disposed of in a meat factory would be made available to the officials of the Department of Agriculture and be accepted as proof that the animals were there.  The first proof is there &mdash; that the animal was entered on the farmers' original application and proof of sale one month afterwards or whatever should be accepted.  I would appeal to the Minister to adopt the suggestion.  If the Chair would allow me, I would make one other point before I sit down.  It is this: there is always remaining the danger of panic selling of cattle in this coming winter. Prices at present are quite good &mdash; there is no doubt about that &mdash; but the danger of panic selling remains.  We are now about to move into a period in which the EC are allowing the full intervention for full carcases for about three weeks.  This is not very satisfactory because last year the period of intervention allowed was six weeks.  I appeal to the Minister to go back to the EC Beef Management Committee and put our case through them to the Commission that this be extended to at least what it was at last <Col N="147" /> year's level.  We allow only about 50 per cent of the national kill to go into intervention and if we are having difficulty with the EC we must ask the Minister to lift the constraints which we operate here.  They are a good thing in themselves in the sense that they ensure that our meat plants sell their produce on the open market rather than dumping it into intervention but in an exceptional case like this if needs be we must look at the national situation for intervention.  I am very sorry that I have taken at least one minute of Senator O'Toole's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this debate. It is one of the most important and serious debates in this House in recent times.  I want to correct a remark made by Senator Ferris yesterday when he mentioned that we switched our amendment.  I do not know what he means by that.  We submitted an amendment; if it was switched it was not switched by this side of the House.  It is the same amendment that was submitted and I do not see any change in it.</P>
      <P>There is a difference that our amendment is a nationwide emergency amendment. I call on the Minister to declare a nationwide emergency.  He has not done that as yet.  I am speaking about the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.  I maintain, and I have evidence to back it up here, that there was nothing whatever in the Minister's speech yesterday.  He gave a run down about what happened. We are sick and tired talking about what happened.  I have sat on and have chaired agricultural committees at Oireachtas level, ACOT level and at various levels throughout the country since the emergency and since the weather got bad early in this year.  The situation is quite evident to everybody now and you do not have to spell out what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he gave aid in extending the 30 day test to 60 days. He said, &ldquo;To help cattle farmers we are speeding up the headage inspections&rdquo; which he has not done and also that he had extended from 30 days to 60 days the <Col N="148" /> period of pre-movement test for cattle under the TB eradication scheme.  I correct that and say it is for steers.  It is not for cattle.  It does not apply to heifers at all.  The Minister said that these measures are designed to give more flexibility to farmers in deciding on the disposal of their stock.  This should read disposal of their steers.  We still have the 30 days test for our heifers and they are creating a big problem in Senator Connor's county as well as in Mayo because it is a very intensive heifer area.  There is panic selling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>I did not refer to it, although I should have liked to refer to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not have the time.  However, there is panic selling and this measure will not discourage it.  The nitrogen subsidy was the greatest disaster of all time.  It came at a time of year when it was too late for the application of nitrogen.  In normal conditions where you would have a fairly good September you might have some results from nitrogen but the weather was very bad at the time and the nitrogen had not the desired results.  The Minister may have had good intentions but the results were disastrous.  It was impossible to make silage in the past month from that application for nitrogen.  The land is ruined for years after the cutting up it has got with machinery.</P>
      <P>Returning to the Shannon basin, £1 million is all that is allocated for the livestock units.  The Minister said he is going to introduce feed vouchers and we know what that will mean.  We know the abuses we had with feed vouchers in the past. They were the greatest rot this country has ever seen and I am totally against their reintroduction.  That is the total amount that is in that package.  There is no more aid for farmers in the Minister's speech of yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understood that the Government were making a major announcement yesterday in regard to aid for farmers.  I will refer to aid that was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government when we had only a minor crisis and a bad summer <Col N="149" /> in the 1981 period.  At that time many substantial measures were introduced. There was a new deal at that time for the western farmers and major benefits were secured as a result such as a comprehensive drainage measure including both farm and arterial drainage, improvement in the basic services of water supply, electricity and roads, on-farm improvements, raising incomes for small western farmers, additional facilities for agricultural education and training, higher grants for marketing and processing of farm produce, aid for calves to beef production, and for commonage and forestry improvement.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Government took steps to help farmers to overcome their difficulties and to solve their economic and social problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That was introduced by Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true, Senator.  A series of measures were introduced in the autumn of 1980 at a cost of £40 million.  There was a new winter fodder scheme to encourage silage making and the use of fertilisers, a new scheme to expand the beef herd, and additional £23 million for the farm modernisation scheme, the removal of the second moiety of the 1980 rates on medium-sized farms, special arrangements through the banks and the ACC to help farmers in financial difficulties and increases of up to 100 per cent grant under the cattle and sheep headage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further support for the farming industry was provided in the 1981 budget. There was full relief from rates for all farmers under £50 rateable valuation and the halving of rates for farmers of £50 to £70 rateable valuation, the abolition of the resource tax, the suspension of levies for disease eradication, the adjustment of the tax code to encourage investment in livestock and aid for the seed potato industry.  There was a grant of £60 for each additional calved heifer.  A beef farmer qualifying for the headage grants in the disadvantaged areas would get as much as £119 in respect of an additional <Col N="150" /> calved heifer while a beef farmer elsewhere would be able to get an extra £87. There was a fertiliser subsidy aimed at encouraging grass production and a further aid for silage making for farmers in 1980.  The total cost of that package was in the region of £300 million.  It was not a nationwide crisis at that time but it was aid to take the farmers over that period and crisis.  Aid of that magnitude should be put into effect at this time.</P>
    <P>It was not necessary to fly over the country to know the extent of the damage.  Everyone knew it was raining all year.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach had to take a trip to see the extent of the damage because he had his backbenchers in the Dáil and Seanad who were advising him.  Every farming organisation, the IFA, the ICMSA, the co-ops, Macra na Feirme and ACOT were trying to signal a red light in front of the Minister for Agriculture but no positive action has been taken to date.  We are still expecting the Minister to make a statement.  We thought he might do it yesterday.  Senator Ferris said yesterday in this House that this occasion was the making or breaking of him, that he had an opportunity on this motion to ensure that he made his name on this issue.</P>

      <P>We will let the farmers judge that in their own way.  The results of the aid to farmers will give an indication and will put him in the league where he is entitled to be put.  I got a document this morning from the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  They have spelled out a number of measures as follows: the bringing forward of intervention arrangements for carcase beef, the payment of maximum rates of headage grants to farmers in disadvantaged areas and the bringing forward of payments for the newly designated areas, EURO loans at low interest rates for cereal farmers to help them to re-seed, with Government underwriting exchange rates fluctuations and the banks waiving handling charges, four effective arterial <Col N="151" /> drainage schemes, Community intervention grain at a low cost and aid for the drying of grain.</P>
      <P>We submitted a document on this side of the House in which we called for increased headage grants to the maximum allowed, 50 per cent of the cost to be borne by the EC.  We asked that the calf subsidy be restored to its 1982 level for calves born before 1 October 1985, to speed up payments, if necessary waiving inspections so as to create immediate cash flow and to encourage the retention of stock and we wanted headage payments for the newly disadvantaged areas this year and not next year.  We asked for European investment bank loans at low fixed interest rates for farmers whose crops and fodder have been destroyed, the loans to be related to average costs of production per acre and realistic financial assistance for farmers severely affected by the disastrous weather particularly in the flooded Shannon basin.  We said that the 30 day test requirement be extended immediately to 60 days so as to ease the pressure to sell. We called for the reintroduction of full carcase beef intervention to maintain prices, the encouragement of the pooling and distribution of available surplus fodder by the co-ops and farming organisations, and we called for the restoration and increase of small farmers' unemployment assistance.  We said the banks and the ACC should play an active and positive role in helping farmers to bridge their present difficulties and we said they should waive any interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures, the measures in the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities document and the joint measures submitted by the farming organisations are identical in their own way.  After much discussion and long meetings they set out measures to aid the farming community but none of these has been accepted by the Minister.  All he will agree to is the subsidy on nitrogen, the measures for the Shannon area and the &ldquo;grain for rain&rdquo; scheme coming from Europe on the voucher system.  That is all we have got. <Col N="152" /> If anybody on the other side of the House can indicate to me that we have got more then they are quite welcome to do so.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the lime subsidies and of the AI scheme, the removal of the farm modernisation scheme, when arterial drainage work is being removed at a time when it is needed, the introduction of a farm tax now when farmers are in the lowest financial league will be disastrous.  I call on the Minister to shelve the farm tax until they get back on their feet.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the farmers I have not heard mentioned.  They are the hill sheep farmers from Donegal to Kerry and into Waterford and the Comeragh Mountains.  Normally, they would be selling off their store lambs to people in the midlands and on the east coast, to tillage farmers who use stubbles for lamb grazing but now there are no such sales taking place.  The animals live on the hills and they are taken down to aftergrass after the hay has been cut.  There is none of that now because of the damage to hay. Hay is lying rotten on the aftergrass, so that there is no grass for the animals. There is no sale for them either and many of them will have to go back to the hills. The mortality rate in a normal year on the hills could be up to 25 per cent but we envisage that if this type of lamb is not taken off the hills we could have from a 50 per cent to 75 per cent mortality rate this year.  Many of the hoggets will not be returning to the pins as a result of going back to the hills.  The hills are overstocked at the moment and the hill farmers from Donegal to Kerry and Waterford will suffer financially.  Some recognition should be given to the matter.</P>
    <P>Very few people have mentioned some type of subsidy for molasses.  Molasses makes fodder palatable.  When I visited a farm in Italy I learned from a man who was raising bull beef that processed plastic can be used as roughage in an emergency for animals.  Most people know that fodder is bad and was never as bad as it is this year.  Molasses is the best substitute.  It has a food value and has a substance that makes roughage palatable. A subsidy should be made available <Col N="153" /> to encourage the use of molasses this winter.</P>
    <P>ACOT are making their own arrangements in the west to ensure that fodder is taken from the east to the west.  I should like to pay tribute to the ACOT officials who have done a wonderful research job in the east and west in trying to identify the type of feed that is available in the east.  That feed is being made available to merchants in the west and ACOT are encouraging the distribution of it.  In my county we set up a monitoring system where ACOT people every week monitor price, availablity and quantity in an effort to ensure that farmers in the west get fodder.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we can tackle the cross-Border traffic but it is widespread at the moment.  Our good hay, straw and so on is going across the Border in sizeable quantities.  Bearing in mind that we are in Europe I suppose people from the North have the right to free marketing and can come across the Border to purchase here but they seem to be outbidding our co-ops and purchasers.  They are able to get hold of the bigger quantities and the better types of straw and hay.  Can the Minister do anything about this?  It cannot be easy to curtail.  It is a free zone but this is widespread at the moment. Had it not been as widespread there might have been greater availability of feed for distribution in the west and areas that are very much in need of it.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that the Minister has not taken more positive action in this respect.  He may come along with a further package but it is becoming evident as the days go by that the Minister is dragging his heels.  We do not think he got a good deal in Brussels.  He had a good case to make.  He had representatives from Brussels here to see for themselves the damage that has been caused. Some people might think that the people in the east got a few good weeks for barley harvesting and that everything is all right now but it is not all right.  I know farmers who have gone out of business for good and will never surface again. They will be unable to surface because they have lost everything.  No amount of <Col N="154" /> aid will bring them back again.  They were already going through big difficulties because of the financial constraints on them but the disastrous weather has put them out of business.  I am not blaming the Government because we cannot blame them for the weather but it was unfortunate that when the Government was at their lowest ebb ever that they got this belt of rain which is going to put the economy back by millions of pounds.</P>

      <P>I would not say that now.  The Senator is entitled to make such a comment but the position was never as bad in my time.  The Minister is not tackling the problem in full.  I call on him, as has the IFA, Macra na Ferme, and the other farming organisations, to do something about it.  All those organisations cannot be wrong.  They are independent bodies and they should get a hearing.  We have had discussions with all the farming organisations during the summer break and we are on the same wavelength as they are.  More should be coming from Europe.  Enough agitation has not been made in Europe.  The more we get from Europe the more we will have to match it here.  People feel that the Government are not too concerned because if we get more from Europe we will have to produce more within the State.  For that reason I say to the Minister that if he does not come up with some major package over the next few weeks he will have to accept the consequences from the farming community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to the speeches on this important motion.  I compliment Senator Ferris and his colleagues for giving the House an opportunity to consider in such depth the crisis that is not just in the west but throughout the country.  All Senators have clearly indicated the magnitude of the problems facing many farmers in every county.  They are not confined to the west or to any area.  I wholeheartedly welcome the amount of aid and assistance the Minister announced to the House last <Col N="155" /> night but I believe it is not possible to compensate people for losses arising out of the weather, flooding or the lack of growth.  Any Government &mdash; when we speak about any Government we are talking in the final analysis about the taxpayer &mdash; can offer only a measure of relief to persons who are most affected by these conditions.  Senator Fallon decried the measures that the Minister announced as absolutely inadequate and as too little too late.  I come from a constituency which is on the east side of the Shannon and this is the first time in the last six years &mdash; and elections were fought and won on draining the Shannon &mdash; that any Government have given a sixpenny bit to farmers whose land is flooded for at least five months of every year.  Prior to 1977 they did not even get a waiver of rates although they could not see their land for five months of every year.  That is the reality and that is why I welcome the Government's announcement.  I appreciate that it is not possible to compensate people for the huge losses sustained, especially those who lost hay.  Farmers have not been able to get silage and those who got first cuts where the soil was bad or wet were not able to go in for a second cut.</P>
      <P>Some Senators have called for a doubling of the headage grants in the west but I would prefer to see the Government seriously considering bringing forward the headage payments one year to the newly designated disadvantaged areas that are as equally disadvantaged as the places that have been enjoying those grants for a number of years.  I do not think it is appropriate to try to confine this debate to a small proportion of the country because the losses for every kind of farmer have been crippling.  I hope the Government will continue to try to find new ways to assist people, especially tillage farmers.  That can be brought about with co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was disapointing to hear the reaction of the farming organisations and to listen to the invective of the leader of the IFA. I do not think it is possible for any <Col N="156" /> Government in a country like ours to meet the demands of people like that.  In a campaign earlier this year it appeared that farmers were being asked not to contribute to the national coffers in any way.  Yet, when a disaster like this occurs the same national coffers are expected to come up with substantial funds.  The Government have done a good day's work in endeavouring to meet some of the problems of some of the people.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole dealt at length with the western development package announced some years ago.  I hope that the farmers in the west have been able to milk that scheme, to take it up but, of course, that is easier said than done because to avail of all those schemes individual farmers must be able to make their own contributions to them.  That is not always easy.  Most of the debate on this motion has been confined to the Shannon basis and the River Shannon, but that was not the only river that flooded its banks.  The Nore valley, the Barrow valley, and every other valley in the country, have had four and five feet of water on thousands of acres of land in their catchment areas this year.  It is unfortunate that the call for aid in the main has been concentrated on the Shannon area which, of course, is a very specific problem. It is an ongoing one although this year it is certainly much more acute.  It is not sufficient to have sympathy for the people whose incomes for the coming year have been wiped out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the aid the Minister for Agriculture has announced.  It will be welcome especially in Offaly where the Shannon damages many farms every year.  I welcome the £20 million package that will aid up to 60,000 farmers in one way or another.  The Government financing will be relief at a rate of three to one.  Over the last decade we have got used to trying to match the aid from the European Economic Community.  The £6 million grain subsidy will certainly be a help to the many farmers who are trying to maintain their livestock numbers over the winter months.  I know that over the past few weeks in many areas it has been possible to bring in some of the hay and <Col N="157" /> put it into cocks in the traditional method, but the feed value of that will be very questionable, if there will be any value in it at all.  It will certainly provide roughage and, therefore, if the grain subsidy and the amount allocated or offered to each farmer can be and is taken up, it will be able to assist people to maintain and sustain as many livestock units as possible over the winter months.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have the £1 million cash subsidy paid direct to farmers in the Shannon valley and I should like to place it on the record of the House that this is the first time farmers east of the Shannon whose land has been flooded to the same depth as the land on the other bank have got any sort of a blue farthing from any Government.  I know it is not enough but it is a help.  It is at least an indication that the rest of the population sympathise with the farmers.  I do not know how one can take measures against such a disaster and, thankfully, we do not have as many natural disasters as they have in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the fertiliser and silage subsidy.  I know it is not a lot, but it encourages people.  The silage subsidy has encouraged more than 6,000 new farmers to make silage for the first time this autumn.  That, in itself, is an improvement and it has been worthwhile. It is not so much that they have been paid to take on silage making, but it was an inducement and may have met some of the costs, because making silage is an expensive business.  It is an expensive fodder.  The ratio between hay and silage should be in favour of the 60 per cent silage made at present.</P>
    <P>The 125,000 tonnes of grain negotiated by the Government will make a significant difference this year and I know that the Minister will want to maintain a balance so as not to adversely upset the market as can very easily be done between the east and west of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government are responding to the predicament of the farmers and I hope the present relief will aid farmers, large and small.  It will certainly be a substitute for the feed problem during the coming winter.  However, I do not <Col N="158" /> think sufficient thought has been given to the possibility of coming to the aid of people who have incurred huge losses in the line of cereal production.  It is accepted that the pea crop was literally wiped out this year.  The cost of growing peas and the husbandry attached to it is quite exceptional.  Similarly, the losses in the oil seed rape crop are very significant, but in those two areas we are talking about a small number of tillage farmers who specialise in those areas.  Their losses are considerable, in absolutely thousands of pounds.  Similarly, those in grain this year suffered.  A young farmer who, perhaps, paid £100 for 50 or 100 acre of conacre to set barley or wheat will suffer losses this year running into thousands of pounds.  They must be carried over.  That is why I sincerely ask the Minister for Agriculture not to consider this as a final package.</P>
    <P>The problems of the tillage farmers right across the country are severe. People do not realise the costs involved in tillage farming, for example, oil, interest payments, seed, manure and sprays.  A considerable amount of money is spent in this area.  If the costs are not met, they are carried forward.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his efforts to get the banks to continue the interest subsidy scheme for a further year.  I hope the banks will accede to the Government's request to them to do so.</P>
    <P>The potato crop this year was disappointing. Farmers sprayed potatoes two, three and four times and the yields are disappointing, most of the tubers seeming to be damaged.  There is a cross section of farmers in costly production all adversely affected in the eastern part of the country. This will have considerable repercussions over the next year or so.  How can the Government find a way to ease the problem for so many people who have incurred huge financial losses?  Nevertheless, it must be possible to solve all problems. I earnestly ask the Minister to see in what way the burden can be eased even a little, to give hope to people who find themselves in dire financial straits as a result of the weather alone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Due to the lack of sunshine which ever-body missed, it is estimated that the yield from beet, which harvest only starts next week, will be down 20 per cent on last year.  Similarly, from earlier tests the beet sugar content is down six or seven points on the national average over a number of years.  This, of course, will mean that the amount of money accruing from that crop will represent a considerable loss in an area of farming which has very high overheads.  Due to the fact that the ground is so wet it will be extremely difficult for farmers with low-lying land to harvest the crop.  The agricultural sector at present are undergoing great difficulties.  It will be extremely hard for farmers to survive.  Therefore, we ask for the greatest co-operation between all the various agencies serving agriculture to try to salvage as much as possible from the present situation.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of this debate was that we were able to hear from practically every part of the country an up to date account of the difficulties facing so many people.  From that point of view, it will be of benefit to the Minister and his officials in their efforts to monitor the situation and see in what way they can bring aid or succour to those most affected.  It is appropriate that the Seanad should discuss this important problem and our thanks are due to our colleagues who put down this motion.  I hope the Minister and the Government will be able to adopt many of the ideas and suggestions put forward.</P>
    <P>I know that ACOT, the co-operatives and Department officials have been giving an excellent service and their prompt response to the problems rightly has been very favourably commented on. I have every confidence in the Minister for Agriculture who has been able to assimilate the problems and come up with a package that will be of great benefit to many people.  I do not think anyone expects to be fully compensated for the problems and setbacks he has experienced this year.  Nevertheless, it is important that every effort should be <Col N="160" /> made to give people hope, so that they may continue in the business of farming.</P>
    <P>I was interested to learn last week that the Central Bank have announced some coming changes in the movement of capital. It would be an appropriate time for the Minister at this stage to see if it would be possible to introduce capital into this country by way of loans at European rates so that our farmers, especially those who have been severely damaged by this season, would be able to avail of loans with interest at 4 per cent and 5 per cent, such as European farmers have at their disposal.  I know that the big problem lies in guaranteeing the various interest rates on the hard currency and repayments. Nevertheless, the situation is so difficult in every part of the country that the Minister should do his best to see if a special arrangement can be made to meet the specific problems of this time.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that some of the people who contributed to this debate availed of the opportunity to make political swipes of one kind or another.  I know it is part of the job here, but the problem is so serious that we must be aware of the great difficulty.  I compliment the Minister on being able to find the £20 million and hope that he will be able to get a greater measure of relief from the EC. From our own resources, it has been excellent to find so much money which I know is only a drop in the ocean having regard to the losses incurred by individual families and farmers.  It is a measure of the Minister's interest and his answer to his responsibility that he found this package that will be of tremendous benefit to the people who are experiencing difficulties with winter feed.  The outstanding problems rest with tillage farmers and I hope that at the very least the Minister will be able to come back to the House with some way of easing their financial problems.  Merchants charge 2½ per cent per month interest on the cost of seed, fertilisers and sprays.  If this interest is added on for a full year it will be a sizeable blow to the capabilities of farmers to recover from this difficult year.</P>
    <P>At the best of times, there is one bad season in every five when not much profit <Col N="161" /> is made.  This year everybody makes a substantial and devastating loss.  That is the kernel of this problem.  I wish the Minister well and I hope the Government will continue to look at this situation because it is not going to go away with the season.  The summer is gone but the damage is there.  The autumn is with us and as we move into the winter all these things will tend to increase the pressure that farmers will feel.</P>
    <P>The cattle problem is critical.  If the Government feel that they can extend the 60-day test to heifers, then it will be very welcome.  Even as it is, with a 60-day test for bullocks and with dealing with TB, it certainly will be of benefit to farmers who want to sell.  It gives them an opportunity of shopping around and seeing the way the market is going at a number of marts.  It is a help and a step in the right direction, as is the fact that the Minister is speeding up the payment of all the headage grants, calf subsidies and the suckler cow scheme.  In our area the inspections must be well under way or almost completed.  That, in itself, is <Col N="162" /> something many farmers welcome.  While individually they may appear to be small concessions to the farmer who finds himself with no income this harvest, with nothing to come from any source, the early payment of these grants is important. If the Minister ensures that every grant outstanding will be paid as a matter of urgency, he will do a great service in giving some sense of relief to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister and express confidence in the package that he has offered and is providing.  I express the hope that it will be possible to do something on somewhat similar lines for, or in some way to come to the aid of the tillage farmers right across the country.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Dooge on Thursday, 27 June 1985:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my third time contributing to this matter, on which I have already spoken for more than two hours.  This is a most important subject but I will be brief in my summing up.  I believe that our attitude to divorce is influenced in two ways &mdash; at least mine is.  First of all there is the general good &mdash; I think I have shown in my previous contributions that where divorce was introduced the number of divorces increased rapidly over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we must look at individual cases.  According to the report there have been 36,000 cases of marriage breakdowns here.  Other estimates double that figure.  People fear that if divorce laws were introduced the number of divorces would be great.  This would <Col N="164" /> lead one to infer that the problem is much more serious than it appears.  Taking the conservative figure of 36,000, we must remember that those involved have strong feelings on the matter.  I know of one case of a household in which the young mother has a small family whose husband has left forever.  In other cases men have been left.  I have great sympathy for those cases.  We must consider all the personal problems encountered by the 36,000 people involved.  Personally, I believe that any satisfactory solution must take into account the extreme circumstances which ended in breakdown after time, effort and patience had been exhausted.</P>
    <P>Nullity has been spoken about.  When a marriage is declared null and void by the Catholic Church the partners are not free to remarry.  There is something seriously wrong there.  Many of those looking for divorces are not radical; they are not trying to get themselves into a position to remarry.  They are entitled to expect more from marriage.  There is the paradox that those who are against divorce would favour an early refendendum because they believe that the longer it is postponed the greater will be the chances of having the referendum passed.</P>
    <P>We all know the phrase &ldquo;It takes two to tango&rdquo;.  It takes two to make a successful marriage.  Unfortunately, one partner can cause a marriage break-up.  While some couples coalesce in growing love, unfortunately others grow apart.  Education is important, particularly adult and continuing education, because some feel that people who want to opt out of a marriage should not be penalised for a decision that was made when they were immature or less mature.  Social conditions should also be improved.  This was dealt with in the report.  Nevertheless, it is important to point out again that the improvement in social conditions has been a cause of the increase in the divorce rate.</P>
    <P>The mother's role has been referred to.  Article 41.2.2º of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not <Col N="165" /> be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are many cases where, through economic necessity to pay the mortgage, the mother has to work.</P>
    <P>The increasing illegitimate birth rate has been referred to previously in this House.  It seems that in some cases this is becoming a career.  We have fewer marriages and more unmarried people living together.  Some people asked if marriage will become irrelevant if nothing is done.  We must take into consideration the changes in the social pattern. Generally everyone is agreed that married women have the right to work. There is no question about that but, at the same time, child care facilities are not provided to the extent that they should be.  In new housing schemes, for example, where there is legal provision to have facilities of this kind they are not provided. Even in existing housing estates there is provision for these facilities if the will is there.</P>
    <P>Marriage is all about relationship and sacrifice.  As I have said, perhaps some people are incapable of being compatible. Some couples seem to find it impossible to live together.  If one partner is willing to endure whatever conditions exist and has not a mind of his or her own, then you will not have a breakdown, but that is not a happy or healthy situation. A phrase in my part of the country which applies to somebody who has become involved in an unhappy marriage is: &ldquo;He has made his bed, now let him lie on it.&rdquo; That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Some people feel it is time for a new Constitution and perhaps an appropriate time for that would have been when we joined the EC.  The committee had an impossible task, and it is very easy to be critical in any situation but particularly here.  I may have said some things which appear critical but I did not intend them in that sense.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7.8.21 of the report states:</P>
    <P>It is the view both of the Committee <Col N="166" /> and of a great majority of those who have made submissions to it, that divorce rates of the kind that prevail in other countries would not be desirable in this country.</P>
    <P>I would have liked the report to expand on that and explain why.  We are all in agreement with that, but is it for moral reasons, social reasons, human reasons, or commonsense reasons?  If it could be proved that divorce is better than unhappy families with their consequent effects on the community and all the other issues that are involved, would the committee feel the same?  It is not simply the divorce rates.  It is the situations that lead to those problems that I would like to see eliminated.  If the situations were dealt with and eliminated, then it would follow that the divorce rates would fall. Everything possible must be done.  I do not want to delay the House by going into all the areas of mediation and other suggestions in the report.  It is worth while pointing out that in paragraph 7.8.14 the report states that it is inevitable that some marriages will continue to break down.  I would like to see something less vague and more definite, and perhaps statistics.</P>
    <P>Groups and individuals with vested interests or genuine concern should exert pressure and use the influence of the media as much as they can.  This is a democratic country.  It is important not to react solely to clamour but to research findings.  Scientific findings are important but these were beyond the scope of the committee.  Others have criticised the committee for the length of time they took; I would say that the committee did not get enough time.  This is an ongoing problem and the basis for any change should be a scientific approach to research findings and figures.</P>
    <P>Most people would favour a referendum at the appropriate time.  A referendum should not be held just as an exercise.  People should be given the right to decide, but before that there should be serious and widespread discussion so that the matter is understood fully, the problems, the implications and the history <Col N="167" /> of divorce in other countries.  All these aspects should be taken into consideration. It is the responsibility of the Government to come to a decision and it would be unreasonable to expect that the committee would do that.  They have been of great help.  Their report will be studied.  It would be very helpful for all of those involved in that area and for the Government but it is the responsibility of the Government to come to a decision.</P>

      <P>I am conscious, as I rise to speak, that I am the first member of the all-party committee to have the opportunity to speak in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For me it has been an enormous privilege to have been a member of what will be seen as an historic committee.</P>
      <P>The report, and just recently the minutes of evidence which have been printed, should be best sellers in this country if we care about marriage and if we care about our society.  It is my hope and my earnest wish that people who say they so care will go out and obtain both these important documents and will give the time to reading, analysing and reaching conclusions on the basis of fact and deliberation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise that all members of the committee applied themselves to the task in hand but I would like to pay particular tribute to the chairman of that committee, Deputy Willie O'Brien, who had a very difficult task indeed.  It was not an easy committee to be on and Deputy O'Brien handled his task with skill and a great deal of patience. I think he has a large reserve of that because the committee were under certain pressures.  We had a time constraint which was, perhaps, a mistake and I think the report shows the effects of that in certain weaknesses which I will comment on later.  There was a certain media interest which, as a politician, I cannot say I did not welcome, but nevertheless in the context of the delicate task which the committee were handling perhaps imposed an additional pressure to <Col N="168" /> members who were considering this matter.  I would also like to pay tribute to the clerk of the committee, Mr. McCabe, who rendered sterling service and, indeed, to Mr. Gerry Durkan a most competent legal adviser.</P>
    <P>It is important at the outset to mention the orders of reference the committee were given.  They were charged to consider the protection of marriage and of family life and to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage. Many people tend to dwell on this latter element, that is the breakdown of marriage, and in particular to focus on divorce. In relation to the task which the committee were set, this tends to distort their function and the pity of it is that that type of approach has the effect of dismissing the report.  That is a shame because the report is valuable and worthwhile. It is not as some initial commentators were inclined to think, a write off. It is worthy of study.  People who adopt this attitude perhaps have not read the report with any degree of care.  On page 120 under the heading &ldquo;Divorce&rdquo; it is stated that the opinion of the committee is that a referendum should be held.  That is a very definite and positive statement. I do not think the committee could be said to have shirked their duty in any way in relation to that decision.  We know that the decision as to whether Ireland will have a divorce jurisdiction rests with the people as a whole.  It can only be decided by referendum.  Some critics of the committee slated them because in their view the committee failed to make known their collective opinion as to whether they favoured divorce.  It is my view that that was not the function of the committee but in recommending a referendum the committee were surely indicating that as a whole, after 48 years the people should be invited to express a view on the matter.  One can ask whether, if the <i>status quo</i> of marital breakdown in this country was acceptable, would there have been a need to establish a committee in the first place?  The holding of a referendum is not in question because the committee have expressed their view on that but the matter of the timing of this referendum <Col N="169" /> which is referred to in the amendment before the House is in question and something of a wrangle has developed in relation to it which is regrettable.  This matter of the timing of the referendum is largely a matter of political judgment. There are many points of view about it and one hears them frequently.  There is a school of thought that says it will be defeated, that therefore we must not act now because in the event of defeat, the whole matter would be put back for decades. That is an excessively negative attitude. Opinion polls show there is a change in public opinion, that the incidence of marital breakdown is something that every person in the State is aware of and that there is the realisation that something has to be done about it.  The awareness that not all marriages are capable of being salvaged is growing in a greater number of people.  Another school of thought says that this is the only Government likely to handle this issue so they should move or the people will never have a chance to express a view, or certainly not for a long time, and so the issue will remain unresolved and fester.  There is another group who express the view that it would be better to do nothing, that this is a political time bomb, that the country has enough problems and that a referendum would be interpreted as a diversionary measure, that is not at the top of the political agenda and should be buried.  There is another group who say that we should have a debate on this issue, let the politicians show leadership, let them lead from Leinster House, let them examine all the issues, weigh up the situation, get rid of words like winning or losing in terms of this referendum, look at the needs of those involved, look at the needs of Irish society, examine marital breakdown, assess whether divorce is a necessary legal remedy for some people who are embroiled in a bitter marital situation, take words like &ldquo;divorce is good&rdquo; or &ldquo;divorce is bad&rdquo; and all sorts of value judgment out of the arena.  The questions, in my view, are whether this is a necessary legal remedy for some people and whether the denial of this legal relief has any social advantages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Politicians should stand up and lead and in so doing they would perhaps restore their own dignity which was lost in the past when they backed down in the face of pressure groups.  This dignity was very much eroded in a previous referendum of unhappy memory.  At that time, in the referendum to amend the Constitution in relation to the protection of the unborn, the people were rendered a disservice by politicians.  The whole business was ill-conceived; it was divisive, hasty and pressured and I would certainly not like to see a repeat of that type of debacle.  So confused were the public that the percentage turn-out was very low, which was a reflection of the confusion of the people.  At the end of the day what matters is the quality of the decision that we reach, not necessarily the speed at which it is arrived at, not whether it is done in the lifetime of this or any other Government or indeed who reaps the political reward or the castigation, as the case may be.  The issue is far more important than the political aspirations or sensitivities of a few.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is a problem.  It will always be a problem.  It cannot be ignored in the hope that it will go away because it will not.  There will be divorce in this country.  That is my view; it is the view of a great number of people.  Divorce legislation will be enacted in this State. The question is, what form is it going to take and when will it come?  To run scared in the face of what is a contentious issue does a great disservice to the many thousands of people who are involved in marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is time that we had legislative honesty.  Above all, we must not be paralysed into inactivity for fear of making a mistake.  It is true to say that the experiences of most countries or societies in which divorce operates indicate that it is a very stressful life event which, depending on the combination of the many factors existant, either economic, social or personal, is enhanced or diminished, prolonged or shortened in time.  My experience, albeit limited, indicates that marriage is not a simple social form and the difficulties encountered therein are <Col N="171" /> not limited to any one social class or to any age group.  The parties involved are not insane, drink-ridden, adulterers or people who engage in mutual violence. Children are not battered and bruised. More often they are bewildered and sad. The solutions offered at present are not sufficient for the needs of such people and I hope the report has indicated that clearly.  Also, I believe very strongly that as long as this divorce debate remains in the area of point scoring and in the accumulation of relevant pro and anti-divorce research and findings we miss the whole process underlying the need for a solution to marital disharmony and inevitably forget about the participants, the wives, the husbands and the children who continue to suffer real distress.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that divorce debates have tended to approach marriage as a homogenous entity and this sort of approach is particularly emphasised in Ireland.  Senators do not need reminding that during the discussions of a public nature surrounding the amendment I referred to previously, and indeed surrounding the Bill dealing with contraceptives this year, there was continual reference to the family and to marriage as if all families and all marriages were similar units regardless of their composition, age or their social status.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all people who will involve themselves in this debate to widen their perspective when they are considering what is a family.  Such a broadening of perspective may reduce the urge to impose narrowly based solutions on those whose relationships have strayed from what is, in most cases, a mythical norm. It is very hard to talk about a norm when we are dealing with human behaviour.</P>
    <P>It is important to discuss the role of pressure groups in this debate.  They exist and they are starting to emerge and flex their muscles.  It is their right to do so; we are in a parliamentary democracy and there is a role for pressure groups.  Two of the chief protagonists perhaps in this debate are the Churches and the Divorce Action Group.  One would expect that they would both make their views known <Col N="172" /> to the public.  I was heartened to think that some lessons had been learned as a result of the last amendment.  At the moment the annual general meeting of the National Conference of Priests is in progress and it was reported in today's paper by a spokesperson for that AGM that in the context of any referendum on divorce the Catholic Church would not engage in any secret lobbying and that there would be no demagoguery.  That is a very welcome development and I hope it will be the case.  I would like to see that type of approach as evidence of increasing maturity and of a lesson well learned on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>I uphold the right and the duty of the Churches to express their views on public morality but it must be said that statements of a kind coming forth from an episcopacy in Limerick &mdash; I refer to the statements of Bishop Newman &mdash; seek to undermine legislators and, therefore, by extension to undermine our democracy. The view that Catholic legislators are constrained by the teaching of their Church on the indissolubility of marriage is a very frightening one and it is one on which I am in total and complete disagreement. It begs the question that we have to be very clear in our mind about the relationship between Church and State.</P>
    <P>If we look around the world today we see various examples of possibilities of this type of relationship.  In Iran today, for example, and in other Islamic states we see that the doctrines of Islam as contained in the Koran have become the law of the land.  That is one way of accommodating the Church-State relationship but it is one that I do not favour and most thinking people would not favour it either.  In fact, the Irish people in a referendum removed the special position of the Catholic Church from their Constitution. It is true to say the kind of tie-up between Church and State that we see in Iran is one that would not be acceptable here.  At the other end of the spectrum we see atheistic states where God does not feature at all, where every aspect of life, social, political and moral is deterimined by the State and where any idea of <Col N="173" /> the intrusion of religion and its moral values into the body politic is absolutely rejected.  Both of these, the case of Islam and Islamic states and atheistic Communist states are the extremes.  We must ask the question for those of us who live in western Europe in democratic states and who are pledged to uphold the freedom of the individual and to promote tolerance and mutual understanding, where do we draw the line?  In the context of the debate which we will have on divorce, it is important that we should get our thinking very clear on this.</P>
    <P>There is a common or public morality which is recognised and enforced in all civilised societies, but this does not constitute the entire morality of any society. The morality of western society has been largely determined by Christian influence and there is a broad Christian consensus. While there is a large measure of agreement amongst Christians on many or most matters of social or public morality, there is also an area of disagreement. There are matters such as divorce, contraception and abortion on which Christians differ.  Within the basic framework of public morality on which there is a general consensus and agreement, each denomination must have the right to preach and practise its own faith and moral disciplines and to offer guidance to its members.  The State must not take sides and in a morally controversial issue enforce a particular moral view, even a majority one, on all its citizens.</P>
    <P>I contend that the sole function of the State for all within the context of a generally agreeed and accepted public order and morality is to ensure freedom.  It follows, therefore, that complex moral issues in which there are sincerely held but different points of view or shades of opinion should not be the subject of constitutional definition.  This is where we have the problem.  It is because the matter of divorce is a subject of constitutional definition that we face the need for a referendum and a consequent divisive debate.  In a pluralist State a constitution should express a general consensus, setting out basic human rights and responsibilities and steering clear of <Col N="174" /> controversial and divisive moral issues. These issues should not be the concern of the State, but rather the concern of the particular churches, each having the right to exercise its own moral discipline and not having the right to enforce this moral discipline on others.</P>
    <P>Only if we look at the matter in this way will we ensure that the Church does not usurp the functions of the State and that the State does not frustrate the role of the church.  That aspect of the argument is important.  The mark of a free or pluralist society is not that it abstains from making moral judgments or enforcing certain moral principles, but that it is prepared to submit its proposed or actual moral legislation to the most rigorous scientific and informed examination.  It should be continually open to serious and constructive views from whatever quarter they may come.  They must have a willingness to change laws if necessary in the light of experience and reasonable public opinion.  A healthy pluralist society will rightly be sceptical of authoritarianism or of pressure groups whether these forces are ecclesiastical, political or racial, and will keep its legislation on moral matters to a minimum.</P>
    <P>There has been in Ireland over the past 15 years a marked growth in tolerance and an endeavour to understand the other person's point of view.  This is in no small measure due to the ecumenical movement and the spirit of Vatican II, though one tends to think given some of the manifestations in the country at the moment that there might be a certain slide back to a more primitive, dare one say, view of religion.  Generally speaking, it is true today to say that for the most part we can freely discuss without fear of embarrassment such matters as a pluralist society and it is possible to put forward various different views on moral and social issues.  Most people accept the right to uphold and express these opinions. There is much less intolerance.  There used to be a cocksure self-righteousness, but that seems to have lessened to some extent.  There is less bitterness and more charity in approaching openly and honestly the matters on which we are divided. <Col N="175" /> I should like to see that continue and grow.  The old dogmatic idea that any one church had an absolute monopoly of truth is giving way to a new concept of the meaning of truth and it is recognised by thinking people that there are many insights and different aspects of the one truth and that in humility we must be willing to learn from each other.</P>
    <P>We need between the Churches a creative synthesis and I hope that this debate will not lead to a diminution of that. Members of the committee were inundated with submissions which they had invited in order to inform themselves more fully of what the position was in relation to marriage breakdown.  It is true to say that members of the committee were privileged in acquiring a body of information which is unique in the State. It is important that committee members should impart something of the flavour of what they learned to other Members of the Oireachtas because it is all the Members of the Oireachtas at some stage who will make the decision about this referendum and, therefore, the role of committee members in informing their colleagues of their insights is important. In addition committee members will have a function nationally in making sure that they inform the people as to what they have learned by virtue of being on the committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to go through some aspects of the report and comment on them.  It is important that it should be on the record of the House.  Chapter 2 sets out the legal and constitutional position of marriage and the family in our State. This reflects the importance which we give to marriage.  It is seen as a bedrock of society deserving of constitutional protection. All committee members had a tremendous regard for the institution of marriage.  I was pleased to hear Senator Fitzsimons recognise the fact that people who think that divorce is a necessary legal remedy do not in any way by holding that view undermine marriage or think any the less of it.  That is an important debating point and should not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the <Col N="176" /> submissions received by the committee referred to extra-marital unions which are occurring in the State.  These unions take many forms.  There are single people living together.  There are married persons who have separated and are living with single persons or with other separated persons.  There are people who have had their marriages annulled by the eclesiastical courts and who have remarried within the Church.  There are persons who have obtained divorces abroad which are not recognised by the State and who have purported to remarry.  All of these people are living in extra-legal unions and therefore they have only limited legal recognition and protection. One is tempted to ask in the context of all of this, is the common good being served by a proliferation of these type of unions?  In the absence of divorce legislation people do not have any other choice in the conduct of their relationships. It is quite clear that there are an increasing number of families forming in the State which under the constitutional definition of family have no protection.</P>
    <P>The committee expressed concern about the matter of illegitimacy.  I am pleased to see the Minister of State here because I know that she is involved with this legislation and would wish to see it speedily coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee noted that the courts have given the mother of an illegitimate child rights and constitutional protection but that no such rights or constitutional protection have been extended to the father of an illegitimate child.  The committee expressed concern at that anomaly.</P>
    <P>In chapter 3 of the report the prevention of marriage breakdown is dealt with. Members were acutely aware, from the submissions and from their own observations, that the disturbing social and economic pressures of our times have tended to heighten and indeed exacerbate the difficulties being experienced by people.  If you add these difficulties to an inter-personal problem within a relationship, you have a fairly explosive combination. It was a pity that the time constraints and a lack of resources <Col N="177" /> inhibited the committee from conducting research in this area, but it did in its report urge that steps would be taken to embark upon such research and, indeed, some of the people who made submissions to the committee called for an institute of the family to be set up.  It was generally felt that we pay tremendous lip service to marriage and the family and that the fact of having our regard for this in the Constitution lets us off the hook of our responsibilities for strengthening and affirming marriage and the family.  I must say that the idea of establishing an institute of the family, for having research and opinion within one area, appeals to me greatly.</P>
    <P>In chapter 3 of the report the committee deal with education and preparation for marriage.  It was generally agreed that the basis for all of this is in the home and that the primary responsibility for education and training and the imparting of values rests with the parents in the home.  But I think it has got to be recognised that we have changing patterns in society, that there are new stresses on people and that there is a consequent failure to impart the type of training that I speak of.  Of course, added to this are unemployment and financial difficulties and so forth.</P>
    <P>Moving on from the home, the next educational forum to which Irish people are exposed is the school.  The committee in a very firm statement said that the State should ensure that a cohesive and comprehensive educational programme designed to prepare people for marriage is provided for within the present educational system.  I know that the present Minister for Education has expressed concern about this and that there are pilot schemes in progress.  One of the chief people on whose wisdom the committee drew, Dr. Jack Dominian, who visited us in Dublin and gave an extensive oral submission to the committee, has something to say on this subject of education and training.  I think it is worth repeating. It is on page 12 of the report.  Dr. Dominian, who is clinical psychiatrist at the Central Middlesex Hospital and an expert in the area of marriage, said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> My image of the prevention of marital breakdown starts in the family.  I would like to see the family as being the model.  In regard to the schools, I have said again and again that in addition to &ldquo;The Three R's&rdquo;, I want a fourth &ldquo;R&rdquo; which stands for relationships to be an essential part of education in schools.  We are doing research at the moment.  I am not saying that you can teach boys and girls about marriage, because it is too big a leap for that age group, but you can teach them about personal relationships, about trust, about communication, about affection and about understanding.  I would like to see that, which is the infrastructure of marriage, being an essential part of education.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to disagree with that point of view and I think those of us who speak about education in this area are sometimes open to an interpretation that what we want to do is teach children the biological facts of life.  That is far too limited an approach and quite unsuitable, but at the same time it must be said that one must not hide the realities from children and one must not present them with something which is soft-centred and will serve them very badly when they leave school which I am afraid is perhaps something that is happening.  Our education system has got the emphasis all wrong.  There is this rat race for points and pressure and competitiveness and it has become something of a murder machine.  If we were really educating our children, education in relationships and in values would have a much higher priority as a subject to be dealt with in our schools.  Indeed, we would be moving perhaps towards more co-education and less single sex schools.  Our schools would become a mirror of society rather than being run on single sex lines.</P>
    <P>It is important that there should be adult involvement in all the activities of young people and I welcome the youth movement and the presence of youth clubs and societies which have a discreet adult involvement.  The business of <Col N="179" /> youngsters having all their social enjoyment in discos, dancehalls and pubs is a great pity because, apart from picking up values from each other, I feel that perhaps many of them suffer from a sort of arrested development if they do not have a broader forum for their activities.</P>
    <P>Our approach to education and preparation and training for marriage should be up-stream and developmental.  It should come through the home and the school and the youth clubs and societies and through third level education rather than coming down-stream and in a remedial way, which is what is happening at present.</P>
    <P>The committee then moved on to a consideration of pre-marriage courses and paid great tribute to people who provided these courses.  One must give enormous credit to all those who voluntarily involve themselves in this activity and who give of their time.  But really, pre-marriage courses, if all that I said before were in position, should only be the icing on the cake of preparation and training for marriage.  The committee felt very strongly that these pre-marriage courses should be expanded and developed and that people should be encouraged to avail of them.  Some commentators would suggest that there should be an element of compulsion, that you should have to attend a pre-marriage course.  I believe that motivation should be the key, rather than compulsion.</P>
    <P>Speaking of pre-marriage courses, I think it is important that they should be in scope multi-dimensional, that they should cover the obvious areas like finance, how to run a home, the legal aspects of marriage, but that they should also cover communication skills and the spiritual end of things as well.  At present our pre-marriage courses are in the main denominationally based and family planning, education, explanation and training in this area is also an important part of pre-marriage training.  At present, given the denominational status of these courses, emphasis is placed purely on the natural methods of family planning which are fine in their own way but I feel it is <Col N="180" /> not giving people access to all the information which they require so that they can make a choice which is right and appropriate for them in their situation.  If there was greater State involvement in the expansion and development of pre-marriage courses, that imbalance could be redressed.</P>
    <P>The committee moved on to consideration of marriage counselling and they are very firmly of the opinion that this is necessary and vital, that it should be easily accessible and, indeed, effective. It should be available to married persons who are experiencing marital difficulties.  It should be a quality service in addition to being expanded.  It is important to talk about the calibre of those people who will be involved in the counselling because this whole area is a minefield for amateurs.  The people who take it upon themselves to involve themselves in marriage counselling should be well trained.  It is important there should be a greater degree of professionalism in this area.  Indeed, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, in a submission on page 118 in the minutes of evidence taken by the committee, had something to say about the significant things that keep cropping up in marriage counselling. They say they get people who cannot communicate with one another that it is common to hear &ldquo;I never knew you felt like that,&rdquo; that people do not seem to be able to communicate on a feeling level nowadays, which appears to be very important, and that the old cliché &ldquo;My wife does not understand me&rdquo; has quite deep and tragic significance in the marriage counselling room.</P>
    <P>Along with other marriage counsellors I found that there are people whose expectations of marriage have been disappointed. It has not been what it was cracked up to be.  The third thing is that we find people who have made very poor choices of partner.  It is interesting to see these common denominators emerging in marriage counselling.  The committee were grateful to have their own instinct, confirmed by that contribution from the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council <Col N="181" /> people.  Obviously, to set up a nationwide system with well-trained people would take a considerable amount of State finance.  If marriage is so important and if the family has constitutional protection why are we not spending money in the remedial area or in the area of support rather than waiting for the problems to arise and then spending it?  The spokesperson from the CMAC indicated that their total operation cost approximately £500,000 per annum and made the comparison that this was roughly the cost of running one post-primary school.  That helps to put our priorities into perspective. It was interesting to contrast the position of the CMAC in the Republic with what obtained in Northern Ireland where they get about 75 per cent of agreed expenditure back from the Government &mdash; that in a jurisdiction where divorce obtains.</P>
    <P>The committee then considered the age for marriage and expressed the view that there should be a three month waiting period in civil law between the time the couple decide to marry and the date of marriage.  Many of the submissions we received stressed the vulnerability of marriages involving young persons.  All the social commentators are agreed on the statistical evidence that there is a more frequent incidence of marriage breakdown where marriages have occurred at a young age.  The committee examined existing legislation and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on this and looked at research in other countries and the conclusion was that the minimum age for marriage should be raised from 16 to 18 years and that special legal and parental permission should be sought if people under 18 wished to marry.  We also recommended that the marriage of persons under 18 years apart from those who had sought these special permissions should be considered null and void.  Not so long ago we debated the Age of Majority Bill in this House and that excluded any reference to the age for marriage.  The Minister at the time said that in view of the fact that the Committee on Marriage Breakdown was sitting it would be inappropriate for <Col N="182" /> reference to the age of marriage to be included in the Age of Majority Bill.  The committee have now reported and made known their view.  It should now be possible to introduce amending legislation to the Age of Majority Act so that the committee can have one of their recommendations implemented speedily.  This would not be costly.  The cost of not doing so is seen daily in the incidence of marriage breakdown among young people.  I would ask the Minister to hurry this up please.</P>
    <P>Chapter four of the report deals with marriage breakdown.  The committee examined in detail how and why marriages break down and it was recognised that marriage breakdown occurs to couples either in the early years of marriage, the first four or five years, where there is a failure to establish a basic minimum relationship, either emotionally, psychologically or sexually and in the later years of marriage, possibly because couples have changed, developed and grown apart.  Many women at this later stage suffer from what has been termed as the empty nest syndrome.  They have devoted all their energies towards rearing their children and when the children leave the nest, women who have not developed their own potential find themselves in an acutely distressing situation which often puts strains on marriages and explains why in many instances marriages break down in this age group.</P>
    <P>Another chapter dealt with personal and environmental factors affecting marriage and we have a comprehensive account of the varying situations which affect marriage.  The committee showed concern for the problem of alcohol abuse and its effect on marriage and called on the State to launch a campaign of awareness in order to draw attention to alcohol abuse.  I hope the Health Education Bureau, under the aegis of the Minister, will launch such a campaign.  We are too complacent about alcohol.  It is the socially acceptable national drug, but it has extraordinary effects on marriage and on marriage relationships.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware of marriage breakdown. There is not a street or a townland <Col N="183" /> or a village in which there is not a problem in a marriage.  Most people are acquainted with couples whose marriages are in deep trouble.  It is very difficult to quantify the extent and the nature of the problem, one of the difficulties which the committee experienced.  However, it must be remembered that the social and emotional costs to the individuals involved are very high indeed.  Couples who find themselves involved in a problem which they themselves cannot resolve find that the existing legal remedies are inadequate because they leave people in an adversarial position which has the effect of heightening the tension, the bitterness, the hostility and the recrimination.</P>
    <P>The committee state that many people find themselves in a legal limbo.  They are faced with a fiction of a marriage which, in social reality, they know no longer exists, yet they have no legal way out.  In human nature, it is inevitable that other liaisons will occur.  Some people do not bother with the fact that they are without legal protection &mdash; they never give it a thought; others desperately look for dignity and respectability and will go to great lengths to put an official face on their liaison.  Examples are given in page 29 of the report, and it is pathetic to see the lengths to which people will go.  The absence of divorce legislation forces this on people who want to have dignity attached to their relationships.</P>
    <P>It is important that I should put on record the ways in which people go about this.  On page 29, chapter 5, the report refers to persons domiciled in Ireland obtaining foreign divorces, with one or the other of the divorcees subsequently marrying another person and residing in Ireland with that person as if married, in circumstances in which Irish law does not recognise the foreign decree of divorce or the second marriage, still regarding the persons as married to each other. There are cases where people will have their names changed by deed poll so that both will have the same surname, to put a certain gloss on it, to show that they are in fact married.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> At the conclusion of that chapter the committee expressed the view that the present law leaves a lot to be desired, and they go on to suggest improved legal remedies.  Under the heading &ldquo;Statistics&rdquo; the committee expressed extreme concern at the absence of comprehensive detailed statistics.  Many of the submissions to the committee expressed this concern and worry.</P>
    <P>We are due to have a census taken in 1986 and I suggest we should not then avoid coming to grips with statistical information in this area.  I appeal to those responsible for the organisation of the census to address themselves to this.  We need precise data if we are to know exactly what we are dealing with, and a simple question on marital status does not give us the precision that we require. In the forthcoming census, questions should be asked such as Married, Widowed, Divorced, Separated, Deserted &mdash; any other such question that would give us precise information.  The Divorce Action Group suggest a figure of 70,000 people in marriage breakdowns. The Central Statistics Office Labour Force Survey gives another figure.  It would be a help if in some way we could quantify the matter.</P>
    <P>Chapter 7 of the report deals with legal remedies.  Committee members were fortunate to have among them people with legal expertise, such as Deputy Shatter and Senators Robinson and McGuinness, who gave unstintingly of their expertise, their talents and their experience which were of enormous help to the committee. Those of us without legal training found it very valuable to have these people as members of the committee.</P>
    <P>The chapter I refer to is a substantial one.  It sets out in a comprehensive and straightforward manner all the legal remedies available in the State.  Irish marriage law is something of a maze and the committee do not mince words when they come to assessing the value to couples in distress who seek to avail of the remedies. The chapter deals with the law of nullity. It is true to say that the public perception of this remedy is unclear.  Quite accurately, it is generally felt that it is difficult <Col N="185" /> to obtain, although a recent judgment indicated that it is becoming easier.  The procedure is lengthy and very costly: the report states that it can cost anything between £2,000 and £3,000 plus, of course, 23 per cent VAT.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there is confusion as between the law of nullity and Catholic Church annulment, an entirely separate matter.  The effect of the decree of nullity is to declare that no marriage ever existed between the parties.  The committee examined the matter in great detail and studied a 1976 paper from the Office of the Attorney General entitled &ldquo;The Law of Nullity in Ireland.&rdquo;  They also examined the Law Reform Commission report on nullity.  It is important that we should note developments and trends in this area.  Many of the submissions concerned themselves with this.  Until 1975 the Irish courts had few opportunities to develop the law of nullity because very few cases had come before them.  Of those few, a very small number of people had been granted decrees of nullity.  Only 25 cases came before the courts between 1970 and 1980.  Since 1975 the pattern had changed because the law has been extended and developed.  However, since 1870 there has been no legislative intervention.</P>
    <P>The consequences of a decree of nullity being granted are detailed on page 36 of the report.  The parties to the marriage which is annulled are treated as if they were never married.  They are free to remarry, but any children born of the marriage are illegitimate, the mother being the sole guardian of such children. The parties lose maintenance and succession rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> each other's estates.</P>
    <P>In the light of all that, the committee's opinions are progressive, They are given on page 115 of the report.  They state that the granting of a decree of nullity should not render the children of the parties illegitimate.  They suggest that the courts should be empowered to grant ancillary orders relation to guardianship, custody and maintenance when granting a decree of nullity.  The committee recommended that a separate part of the Church cermony of marriage should be set aside so <Col N="186" /> that civil aspect of marriage will be clearly set out.  That is very important because many people do not realise that they are entering into a legal contract.  This matter should be brought home to them.  It was suggested that we should do as they do in some continental countries and have a separate civil ceremony, perhaps in tandem with the Church ceremony.  The committee felt that this might be too cumbersome to arrange, but that it should be part of the religious ceremony and the legal nature of the contract should be brought home to people rather than having a separate ceremony.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the committee in relation to the law of nullity as it operates at present is that generally it is a mess, although more parliamentary language was used in the report.  On page 39 we mention why we think things are so bad in this general area.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The Committee notes that judicial developments over the past ten years have sought to update and modernise the law, but that in so doing they have created uncertainty and made it impossible for lawyers to advise couples of the exact parameters of the law of nullity.  This means that it is impossible for some couples to ascertain without court proceedings whether or not they are validly married. Judicial development has produced a degree of judicial subjectivity by which it appears that some judges are likely to interpret the law in this area more liberally than others, the effect being that a marriage may be regarded as valid or void depending on which member of the High Court hears the case.</P>
    <P>The committee, of course, did not mean this as any criticism of the Judiciary but merely wished to state that at present the situation is rather subjective.  The question must be asked then: is the public good being served?  There has been legislative neglect of this whole area and judges are trying to cope with 20th century marriage in a situation where the laws and the procedures are completely <Col N="187" /> outdated, so there is no question of faulting them in any way.  Legislators have a responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Many well-meaning people who are fearful of divorce in their desire to do something about marriage breakdown, would like to see the laws of nullity extended so that this legal remedy would become a substitute for divorce.  It would be like a divorce Irish style.  I abhor such an idea.  At a public meeting which I attended last night one of the speakers from Family Solidarity expressed this view and had a neat solution to the problem of Church annulments.  She felt that people should go on to get a civil decree of nullity and that would neaten things up in some way.  Of course the question was asked very quickly from the floor, &ldquo;What about those people whose Churches do not provide an annulment procedure?&rdquo; To introduce that approach would be blatantly sectarian and quite unhelpful.</P>
    <P>The effect of a decree of nullity or the granting of a Church annulment is to declare that no marriage ever existed.  It is to me, a student of human behaviour, inimical to any theory of relationship formation and maintenance.  In every individual's life certain events are of enormous significance and importance and bring about attachments and bonds. Among the many types of relationships practised marriage is the most important and the most significant.  It is a public expression of love and attachment, and it is a relationship which encompasses features of loyalty, integrity and genuineness and intimacy.  When that relationship is ended not all of those features automatically disappear.  They are not severed.  If you support a system such as nullity or annulment you are adopting a very mechanistic and legalistic interpretation of what marriage is all about and you ignore the personal and developmental aspects of it.  You deny the validity of a couple's experience.  Then they cannot translate the benefit of that experience into a new relationship or to their own advantage.  The whole business of annulment is a sort of casuistry.  I daresay that <Col N="188" /> it suits some people and that it is important to have it but it must never be seen as a solution to our problems.</P>
    <P>The committee went on to consider separation agreements.  This is a relatively straight forward and inexpensive way of dealing with marriage breakdown and of moving forward in a situation of impasse.  You do not have to go to court if you decide to have a separation agreement, therefore you do not have the same adversarial situation which very often worsens the bitterness and hostility between couples.  You can decide on a separation agreement as a result of mediation or conciliation.  It also has an advantage that you can have it reversed if you so wish.  However, the parties concerned who take out a separation agreement are not free to remarry.  It is important to remember that their marriage is still legally valid.</P>
    <P>The committee spent a great deal of time considering judicial separation or divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> and analysed this remedy in the light of the Law Reform Commision proposals and of the submissions to the committee.  We on the committee recommended sweeping changes which would more accurately reflect the problems being faced by people.  These changes would have the effect of simplifying the procedure and removing the adversarial or fault based procedure which presently obtains.  AIM, which is the group for family law reform, the law centre solicitors and the Incorporated Law Society members, all of whom appeared before the committee, all argued in favour of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a basis for these judgments rather than establishing and proving guilt.  The committeee make an interesting recommendation in that on the application of both parties a separation agreement can be converted into a judicial separation provided the court is satisfied that the interests of the family are safeguarded.  At a later stage in the report under the heading &ldquo;The nature of possible divorce legislation&rdquo;, the committee members suggest a link between judicial separation and divorce, given <Col N="189" /> that irretrievable breakdown is the recommended basis for the granting of both legal reliefs.  In the committee's thinking there the beginnings of an integrated approach to marriage breakdown can be seen.  I have not noted that as being commented on in critiques of the report and I would like to draw attention to it.</P>
    <P>The committee, over and over again when they discussed separation, emphasised the need to protect and safeguard the children in the relationship.  It was felt that their interests should be of paramount and overriding concern as they were vulnerable and innocent and must be protected.</P>
    <P>The committee dealt with maintenance and were reasonably satisfied that the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, operates reasonably well.  The committee were concerned that increasingly people default on their maintenance payments.  One category of people who are likely to do this are the self-employed because methods of enforcement are very difficult to establish in the case of the self-employed. Given that there is a constitutional obligation to protect marriage and the family, the committee felt that the State should pay maintenance in situations of default and that persons who default should be obliged to incur sanctions for refusal to meet the maintenance order.</P>
    <P>The committee also considered guardianship and custody and it went on to consider matrimonial property and barring orders.  I am conscious, of course, that there are many other people who wish to speak on this debate this afternoon and I do not want to take up too much time.</P>
    <P>I would like to make reference to mediation which, again, was a subject to which the committee devoted a great deal of time and attention.  It is one of the strong recommendations of the report that we should establish a mediation service here.  We decided to call this process mediation rather than conciliation as it is called in Britain and elsewhere, because it was felt that there is a certain confusion or could be in the public mind between <Col N="190" /> conciliation and reconciliation.  Of course if that occurs it is a happy situation, but if it does not the idea of mediation is to assist couples to resolve their difficulties on the basis of some measure of consent rather than on continuing conflict.  I am pleased to know that measures have been adopted by the Minister of State to set up a pilot scheme in the Dublin area for approximately a three year period to try out mediation and to see whether a substantial number of people benefit from it.</P>
    <P>We looked at the Bristol scheme in England which is very highly regarded. We had hoped at one stage in the committee that it would be possible for us to visit and to see at first hand what was being done in Bristol so that we would have a very clear picture of the experience of that area.  Again, the time constraints operated against us and it was felt that it would be more important to press on with the business of producing a report rather than having that direct experience.</P>
    <P>Chapter 9 of the report deals with a new family court structure.  I do not intend to speak on that myself because there are people here who know what this is about on a day-to-day basis and could, more adequately than I, express a view as to what they would like to see.  It is all contained in the report.  The idea is that we should establish a whole new system which would deal principally with marriage problems and marriage breakdown. At present we have a very splintered approach in the courts to these problems.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that this will be debated calmly, rationally, with insight, concern and compassion.  You cannot legislate people into morality.  I think it is true to say that.  You certainly cannot legislate people into a happy marriage; would that it were so easy to do.  We should try to avoid points scoring and we should also avoid drawing on experience which perhaps can be best described in the Irish seanfhocal, &ldquo;Dúirt bean liom gur dúirt bean leí&rdquo;.  We need research and we need evidence on which to proceed.  Perhaps the ESRI and the university departments could be urged to expend their resources in the area of research.  I hope we can <Col N="191" /> raise the debate above the purely morallegal axis.  I would like to think that we could introduce a psychological and a humanist perspective into it.  In the long run that would be the most hopeful path and the most appropriate way in which to conduct this debate.</P>
    <P>With that I will conclude and I look forward to hearing what as many Senators as possible have to say on this matter. If we really cared this House would be full this afternoon.  I say this not in criticism of my colleagues; I am sure they have things they must attend to.  I hope that the report will be speedily debated in the Dáil.  I call for a debate on it to be held in the next term.  It is important.  The fact that we were asked to produce the report speedily must mean that it should be speedily considered, otherwise, what was the point of all the pressure and the time scale which was given to this committee and which was not given to any other committee?  I am calling for an early debate in the Dáil, in fact, in the next term because it is a beginning.  It will be debated there.  It will be debated by the parliamentary parties and then a decision will have to be taken by Government as to how, when and in what manner it is going to proceed.  The next item on the agenda is the fullest possible debate of the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a pleasure and a privilege to listen to Senator Bulbulia's thoughtful and well-considered contribution to this debate.  I am proud that the first member of the joint committee to have contributed to this debate should have made a contribution of such rationality, good sense and quality as Senator Bulbulia's contribution to this debate.  I would also join with her in mentioning the people who helped out in the committee, in particular our chairman, Deputy Willie O'Brien, who endured a great deal and showed a great deal of patience.  He put up with a lot from many of us.  It was a somewhat thankless task for him and I had every sympathy for him when at the end of the deliberations of the committee he <Col N="192" /> indicated that the last thing he ever wanted to do again was to be a chairman of a joint committee.  I would also like to pay tribute to our Clerk, Rory McCabe, and also to our legal adviser, Gerry Durkan who put in way above the type of contribution which might have been expected from someone who is simply appointed as a legal consultant.  He worked extremely hard at the task that was put before him and with considerable commitment and enthusiasm and the committee owe a great deal to him.</P>
      <P>At the start of my own contribution I wish to say that I will be supporting the amendment put down by Senators Ross and Ryan calling on the Government to hold a referendum within the lifetime of the present Government.  At a later stage in my speech I will go on to some of the reasons why I am supporting this amendment at this time.  Basically I am supporting it because I feel that the referendum and the whole question of marriage and family law is an urgent matter.  The urgency of this matter was indeed reflected in the fact that the committee were given a short period of time for their discussions.  Very considerable pressure was put on them to come to a conclusion and it seems totally ridiculous having put so much pressure on the committee for everyone then to sit back and say what we need is time for an enormously long debate and so on.  I was very disturbed indeed to hear a statement in the last few days by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, that the Cabinet has not even discussed the matter of a referendum and that he did not know when they would be discussing it.  I very much fear that the whole question not only of divorce but of all the other recommendations of the committee which are positive supports of marriage and the family may very well be long-fingered because the Government think it would be awkward or difficult or would put them in a position of conflict to put forward a referendum.  Therefore, I am supporting the amendment proposed by Senators Ross and Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I am supporting this amendment and because the referendum issue <Col N="193" /> is probably the one that most attracts public attention in this report, I should like to deal first with the question of the constitutional prohibition on the enactment of any law on divorce in this country. It is no secret that I was one of the members of the committee who would have preferred the committee to recommend that it would be desirable to introduce divorce law.  Like Senator Dooge in his original contribution to the debate when he moved the motion, I find it rather strange that the constitutional committee of 1967 could unanimously recommend a change in this position. Here we are some 18 years later pussyfooting about and saying: &ldquo;We might recommend a referendum but we would not go so far as to recommend changing the law&rdquo;.  This is perhaps a comment on the lack of legislative honesty and legislative leadership in this country &mdash; that we are afraid to come out and make a decision one way or the other.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that that was the view I held during the course of the committee debates and which I put forward in my contributions.  It is a view I continue to hold, and will continue to hold as a legislator, as a practitioner in the family law area and as a citizen.  I hold it in particular as a citizen who belongs to a minority religion, one who was born and brought up in Northern Ireland and who has had over my lifetime a commitment to the unity of this country which would include a system of law which left open various rights, remedies and openings to all the different people in the thirty-two counties.</P>
    <P>I will now go on in some detail to deal with the arguments either in favour of or against the introduction of divorce and which are dealt with in chapter 7 of the report.  I am sure many Senators have had the opportunity to read the report. It has been available for some time but only in very recent days have we had the publication of the minutes of evidence of the various bodies which made oral submissions to the committee.  For those of us on the committee &mdash; and certainly I made a great effort to attend the vast majority of these oral submissions &mdash;<Col N="194" /> these were of very considerable assistance and were very enlightening.  We specifically chose to hear in oral evidence people who we considered to be representative groups, whether on one side of the argument or on the other, but in the main representative groups who were working in the area and who knew what they were talking about.  They were people who were involved in marriage counselling, family law solicitors, people from the Incorporated Law Society who work in family law, social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists who work with the family and all sorts of people who genuinely had something concrete to say which was based on their own direct experience and not from theorising which was drawn from various books on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>It was very interesting to find the kind of opinions that were put forward in this evidence.  I suggest that all Senators and also Members of the other House should study the minutes of evidence and the submissions in addition to the actual report itself.  Apart also from the minutes of evidence there were, as Senator Bulbulia has said, a great many personal submissions.  These, which came in large part from people who had gone through what one might describe as the murder machine of marriage breakdown and the court system as it now is, were documents which could not but move to compassion the members of the committee.  One would need to have been very hardened to read through these documents without realising the kind of suffering that is being experienced and the kind of suffering which lacks a definitive remedy.</P>
    <P>This lies behind the first argument in favour of divorce which is put in chapter 7 on page 75 of the report which is that the prohibition on divorce is an injustice to those persons whose marriages have irretrievably broken down and who have become involved or wish to become involved in other relationships, in particular, to those persons whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  It came out again and again in the submissions to the committee that a large number of people are living in a limbo of broken <Col N="195" /> marriage.  They cannot put an end to the marriage that is dead and cannot start clean on a second relationship.  Many of them are starting on second relationships and all the practical evidence in this area and all practical evidence of social workers and so on show that there are a very large number of these second relationships.</P>
    <P>Some of them are what one might call &ldquo;made respectable&rdquo; by the church by the fact that they are remarriages after Catholic nullity.  But they are nonetheless legally bigamous and carry all sorts of problems with regard to succession law, to even such things as mortgages, insurance, tax and so on.  For instance, the children of these marriages, however carefully one may arrange one's separation agreement so as to provide for succession Act rights, are not members of the ordinary family for tax purposes when they inherit.  They are therefore penalised in this way.  There are all sorts of practical problems like this which came up in the submissions to the committee.</P>
    <P>Very often it might be asked, &ldquo;what do you mean by irretrievable breakdown?&rdquo; This is a practical view.  People whose marriages have irretrievably broken down know perfectly well when that is so.  So do those who have to deal with them on a practical level.  I draw attention to what the then Church of Ireland Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, now Bishop of Meath and Kildare, Dr. Emphy, said in his evidence to the committee when he was asked by Deputy Woods about irretrievable breakdown. He said:</P>
    <P>Those involved in a pastoral ministry can see quite clearly when a marriage is dead, when there is no further communication of almost any sort, when people are living two separate lives, when they simply cannot bear the sight of one another.  This is in a household and not in theory.  It becomes perfectly obvious that there is nothing left in that marriage to retrieve.  There is not even respect for each other, and where there is no respect there is no hope of the <Col N="196" /> marriage ever coming alive again.  The whole idea of annulment deals with some vague factor that is said to have existed prior to the marriage, but we would say that in fact marriages break down when everything that has gone before seems to say that it was a &ldquo;valid marriage&rdquo;.  People will agree that marriages die.  A living relationship can die as well as grow.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is the more developed Christian view of marriage at present &mdash; and I asked this particularly of the theological advisers from the Roman Catholic Church who gave evidence to the committee, as well as of members of the various Protestant Churches.  Their view of marriage is no longer that of a simple contract but of a covenant of a living and growing relationship which will develop throughout life.  Once we begin to put forward the idea of a living and growing relationship we must accept that on some occasions a growing relationship can die.  My feeling is that at present we are surrounded by dead marriages but we are not prepared to offer a decent burial to these marriages.  We are keeping them alive in a kind of mummified situation, perhaps, where they have no reality and where they are not either a social or religious gain, or a legal or any other sort of gain.  They do not protect the family as it stands.</P>
    <P>The other difficulties of second relationships are set out in the report, that people in second relationships cannot achieve any recognition of their new relationship or any adequate legal definition of their status.  One gets anomalies like the fact that remarriages after unrecognised divorces abroad are not theoretically legally recognisable but, nevertheless, if one is dealing with the Revenue Commissioners one may find that one may be treated as a married person.  If one is looking for a local authority grant to extend one's house one will find that the income of the so-called spouse is taken into account.  There are numerous examples of the whole hypocrisy of our society on this subject where non-legal second relationships are at a <Col N="197" /> disadvantage both ways in the sense that where it is a disadvantage for them very often they are treated as a marriage and where it is also a disadvantage for them they are treated as not a marriage.  It is a very invidious situation for such persons. We would be making a grave error if we thought there were just a few of these. There are a very large number of them.</P>
    <P>The Law Centre solicitors, for instance, referred to this in their oral evidence and in their submission.  Miss Paula Scully, who is a very experienced solicitor in family law, said:</P>
    <P>We find people changing their names by deed poll to their boyfriends' names.  They are coming in wanting to know why their children are regarded as illegitimate in the law.  They are losing respect for the law.  These are people who are basically law abiding citizens and who have very strong religious views, but who find they have got themselves into second relationships. They feel that they want to marry.  They want the commitment of marriage and they do not have that right at the moment.  It is from the viewpoint of practitioners of family law that we have seen the problems that these second relationships cause &mdash; the fact that there is no legal protection for them and particularly for the children who are left and the women are left in a most vulnerable position.  We feel that if divorce was to be brought in they would have the option of remarriage which would in fact help the parties to have a greater commitment to each other and it would mean that the law would apply to and protect these relationships as well.</P>
    <P>The second argument which is taken up in the report is that all the minority Churches and religions, with exception of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, that is what is normally known as the Mormons, do not favour the retention of the blanket prohibition on divorce in the Constitution.  This is very important because in a sense this was one of the things that came up most in the discussion <Col N="198" /> on divorce in the debate in the New Ireland Forum report, in particular where the Catholic bishops gave evidence to the Forum and where Bishop Cassidy was questioned again and again about this. He said, basically, that if there was Irish unity there would be no diminution of the human rights or whatever of the people in the North.  Of course, this first of all begs the question of what does Bishop Cassidy regard as being a human right.  It was more or less assumed that it would be accepted in the case of a united Ireland that a divorce law would have to be allowed for and yet it is not accepted in the situation of the present State.  I suggest that this is an untenable position. Either the idea of a pluralist society, the idea of a society which recognises the conscience of all different religious groups, is a real one or it is not.  If it is a real one &mdash; and Senator Bulbulia has paid eloquent tribute to the necessity for it &mdash; then it belongs in this State and not just in some mythical all-Ireland State which we all hope will eventually come but which certainly is not coming the day after tomorrow.</P>
    <P>All the different minority Churches specifically drew attention to this.  Even while saying that they did not necessarily think that divorce was desirable or a good thing, they did feel that it was a remedy that should be available to the citizen through the State.  In particular the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, who do recognise limited rights of divorce within their own disciplines, are to a real extent being discriminated against by a system of law which does not allow their adherents to practise that position in this State.</P>
    <P>It was quite clear, as stated in the report, that all minority religions felt this: The Society of Friends, all those that gave evidence with the exception of the Church of the Latter Day Saints &mdash; and they, after all, are a somewhat special case because were it not for the law of the United States my understanding is that their religious belief is that polygamy is the correct solution to these matters and, therefore, it is simply that they are forbidden polygamy by the State law of <Col N="199" /> the United States.  Their standpoint is a rather specialised one and is not representative of the normal position of the minority religions.  I would point out that while saying this the question of whether we have divorce or whether we do not have divorce must not be reduced to a question of &ldquo;It is the minority religions who want divorce and the Catholic Church which is against it.  We are a country which is 95 or 97 per cent Catholic and, therefore, we do not have to have divorce&rdquo;.  It is quite clear to anyone who has talked to people in this situation, has dealt with the practical problems, has been to meetings of groups like the Divorce Action Group, that the vast majority of people who are seeking the remedy of divorce are not members of the minority religions, they are members of the Roman Catholic Church who have been brought up that way.  Many of them are devout, committed Christians but they cannot bring themselves to feel that the law of the State should in this case reflect the law of their Church.  If I might say on a personal basis, Senator Bulbulia and Senator Robinson, who are sitting here listening to me, are excellent examples of this situation &mdash; people who are by belief, by upbringing and by commitment members of the Roman Catholic Church, people who are excellent Christians and who, indeed, show forth by their fruits and their deeds their commitment but who at the same time are not prepared to accept that the fact that the Church opposes divorce should be reflected in the law of the State.  They are but examples of a very large number of people, and a growing number of people.</P>
    <P>Our Legislature tends perhaps to reflect, rather to over-reflect, a conservative point of view on this issue partly because we tend to be an older age group, partly because a large number of us come from rural rather than urban areas and because this problem is more acute in urban areas than it is in rural areas.  The divide in this is very much more a divide of age, a divide of opinion, a divide perhaps rural people and urban people, but much more that than a divide <Col N="200" /> between Catholics and Protestants.  Any debate on the subject of divorce in the General Synod of the Church of Ireland will show up exactly the same divisions as in the country at large.  There are many people within the Church of Ireland who are deeply opposed to divorce and deeply opposed to divorce legislation.  There are other people who feel that it should be provided.  The official view of the Church is that the State should provide this facility.  One will find the same divisions within the Protestant Churches as one will find within the Roman Catholic Church.  I would hate to see this becoming an argument where the minority Churches are, as it were, used as a lever saying this is a matter for the minority Churches only.  That is not so and the vast majority of cases dealt with before the courts of marriage breakdown are cases that have nothing to do with members of the minority Churches.</P>
    <P>The third argument put forward was that the constitutional ban on divorce and the absence of divorce legislation since the foundation of the State have not prevented marital breakdown from occurring and that in the past decade the level of marital breakdown had increased.  I feel very strongly that we have created a kind of shibboleth of Article 41 being and setting out to be a protection for the family whereas I would suggest that to a large extent it has been merely a pious aspiration.  First, we have done very little of a practical nature &mdash; and, indeed, the report of the committee and the various practical recommendations which I will be dealing with later brings this out &mdash; to protect the family, other than the negative prohibition of divorce.</P>
    <P>While, of course, I share the concern of the committee and of all the speakers that we have very little in the way of reliable statistics to show this up, and the concern that our next census should endeavour to find out as much as possible about this area, in so far as one can judge these matters it appears that the statistics on marital breakdown in the Republic are, by and large, comparable with the <Col N="201" /> divorce statistics in Northern Ireland which is a society comparable of ours. There really is not much point in comparing Irish society with the society of Western California because it is different in so many ways.  It makes much more sense to compare marriage in the Republic with marriage in Northern Ireland which is a roughly comparable society and which, with a divorce facility, seems to have much the same level of marriage breakdown as we have.  This, if anything, is proof that the constitutional prohibition has not worked to prevent marriage breakdown.  In particular in the past ten to 15 years this has been very noticeable.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kenny of the Supreme Court, who originally dealt with virtually all the family law cases in the High Court, stated in a lecture that when he started to deal with these cases there was a trickle of cases and later it became a river of cases and, by the time he gave up dealing with it in the High Court and moved on to the Supreme Court, it had become a torrent.  If it was a torrent at that stage, it is many times a torrent now.  Even within the lifetime of the committee, the number of cases dealt with multiplied considerably.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the deliberations of the committee, all the family law cases in the Dublin circuit area, for instance, were dealt with on one day a week, on a Monday but by the time the committee had finished deliberating, three days a week, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, were fully taking up a Circuit Court judge's time dealing with family law cases alone.  That has given rise to a system, to which I will be referring later, where far too many cases are listed before the one judge in one day.  There can be up to 50 or 60 cases listed on occasions before one judge in one day.  If anyone imagines that the whole future of a family can be dealt with in the ten minutes or so that would be available in that case, they have a very strange idea of what legal remedies should be.  The very level of marriage breakdown shows, first, that the constitutional prohibition does not necessarily protect marriage and, secondly, that we have not made any effort to fulfil the <Col N="202" /> pious aspirations in family terms in the Constitution, that we have not really tried to protect marriage and the family. It will, of course, be argued that perhaps if we did try a bit harder we might prevent marriage breakdown and, certainly, that if we tried a bit harder we would reduce it, but I do not think, with society as it is at present, that we could do away with marriage breakdown and with the necessity to provide a remedy for it.</P>
    <P>The next argument given is that the breakdown of a marriage is due to the collapse of the relationship between the parties and that divorce does not cause that collapse, but merely affords a facility to give legal recognition to the fact that a marriage has ended.  This was very much brought out by the evidence of Dr. Jack Dominian who is, as Senator Bulbulia has said, an expert in this field and not only an expert in this field but also a committed member of the Roman Catholic Church.  He felt that there was no way that divorce created marriage breakdown but that it reflected the marriage breakdown which occurred in society and that, therefore, the provision of a divorce facility gives legal recognition to a fact that already exists.</P>
    <P>This is allied to the later argument that to deny the right to remarry to a battered wife or husband has no social advantage to the State and is, in fact, detrimental to society in general and lacking in compassion. One might ask what good is served by continuing the suffering caused by tying together people who are involved in a dead marriage.  The answer we are given is that it will discourage the others from allowing their marriages to break down.  This is like saying that we should shoot one of them to encourage the others to behave themselves.  But really, we must ask ourselves what actual good is served by this &mdash; and it is not a case of hard cases making bad law, of a few cases being involved.  A large number of people are involved.</P>
    <P>I do not feel competent to comment on the following argument about the absolute prohibition on the introduction of divorce legislation imposing on Catholics regulations which are more rigid <Col N="203" /> than those required by the law of the Church.  I have had this point put to me and I realise that the canon law is as is stated in the report, but I do not feel that I am really the right person to deal with this.  More important still is the argument with regard to children &mdash; that it is the factual breakdown of a marriage and not the availability of divorce that has an adverse effect on children.  This is something that I would put forward very strongly, because one of the counter arguments against divorce is that children are damaged by divorce.  Of course, children are damaged by divorce.  Children are damaged by the breakdown of their parents' marriage; children are damaged by the break-up of their family.  We see this all around us every day.  Really, to a child does it make any difference whether you call this breakdown a separation agreement, an action for custody under the Guardianship of Infants Act, a decree of nullity, or a divorce?  It is the fact that matters to the child.</P>
    <P>What we should be doing is trying to have legislation which protects children, to have court structures which protect children, to have social back-up marriage counselling, all sorts of help to protect children, not to take up a false position by saying that if we introduce divorce we will damage children.  It is perfectly all right to have an extended and a greatly extended law of nullity because, of course, that is religiously all right.  In this case I would try to put myself in the position of, say, a child of ten, 12 or 14 years whose parents' marriage has broken up.  This is going to be a very traumatic situation for that child.  It is going to be a difficult, sad, damaging situation, but if I were the parent of that child I would find it very difficult to say: &ldquo;Your father and I can no longer live in amity and our marriage is going to break up.  We are going to separate.  Perhaps we are going to get a divorce.&rdquo;  I would, however, find it twice as difficult to say to that child: &ldquo;Your father and I were never married at all.  Our marriage is void; it is a nullity.  The courts have found that one or other of us, either I or your <Col N="204" /> father, was mentally incapable of forming and sustaining a marriage relationship. Everything that has gone before, your existence, your entire lifetime, has been a falsity and a deceit.  You are now illegitimate and the whole thing was a mistake.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is not damaging to children, what is?  How can anyone say that the provision of divorce law is more damaging than is, what is widely advocated by groups that oppose divorce, the extension of nullity so as to provide a kind of divorce, Irish style, that would be acceptable to the majority religion?  This is an issue which makes me very angry on behalf of children as well as on behalf of couples involved in marriage breakdown.  It is total hyprocisy to be prepared to say that nullity is fine and that it should be extended to such an extent that it would solve the problem, and yet say that divorce would so terribly damage children.</P>
    <P>The financial argument is factual and of course divorce will cause financial hardship.  There is financial hardship attached to separation agreements, however amicable they may be.  Financial hardship attaches to divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, to nullity and to all sorts of remedies which we already have.  For a family, the basic difficulty generally is that there is one family home.  They may have had one or two incomes, but the one family home is often the crux of the matter.  The difficulty is to provide a reasonable place in which two separated people may live, one of whom, perhaps, has the children.  The offer of a barring order which puts one person out of the family home is no solution because a person put out often has not the financial wherewithal to house himself or herself and the financial situation is made worse. There is no doubt that there will be financial hardship but it will not be all that different from the financial hardship that already exists.</P>
    <P>The fact that the parties will remarry will not add to this either.  Many are already illegally living with other people and these illegal second relationships are <Col N="205" /> recognised by the courts when maintenance is being assessed.  If there are children of the second relationship it is obvious that some provision should be made for them too.  I cannot see that the introduction of divorce will necessarily make a crucial difference to the financial hardship.  I agree with the recommendation of the committee which was highlighted here by Senator Bulbulia that it is up to the State to make good the shortfall if there is a default in a maintenance payment rather than leaving it to the dependent spouse to pursue the maintenance debtor through the courts, very often with failure, and to reach the position where the spouse hope that maintenance will not be paid so that the wife can claim the deserted wife's allowance in order that she will have money coming in regularly, if not in very great quantities. Maintenance orders are not necessarily fulfilled and the present remedies of attachment and committal, that is eventually to put the maintenance debtor into jail, are not at all helpful.  In the end, if the husband is in jail, where does he get the wherewithal to pay maintenance? Financial hardship will not be greatly altered by the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>Many of the arguments against divorce are from sociology and from what might happen.  It is suggested that the introduction of a divorce jurisdiction would open the floodgates and the rate of divorces and the incidence of marriage breakdown would be greatly increased.  This is supported by the experience of other states where divorce has been introduced.  Not all states necessarily reflect this pattern. Italy and Portugal perhaps are countries that might be somewhat comparable with Ireland where the figures do not necessarily bear out this argument.  It is interesting that in the minutes of evidence, Dr. Jack Dominian in particular denied this as being a natural progression and stated in his evidence, at page 40 in the minutes of evidence:</P>
    <P>We are starting with the key question. I am very conscious, when you ask me this question, about the <Col N="206" /> relationship of law and marital breakdown and the relationship of religion and marital breakdown, which are the two factors, I will try to be as honest as I can.  I think the law, as I understand it, can do very little to prevent marital breakdown in our society today.  In so far as the law and religion were influential factors which really influenced people's lives in the past, yes, it could do something about it.  But we are talking about middle ages.  At present I do not think I have ever seen a couple whose behaviour was in the least influenced by what the law said.  As to the other question, that if you permit divorce in a country are are opening the floodgates, there is no evidence that I can lay my hands on that people who divorce are in the least concerned primarily with the law.  They are concerned primarily with their relationship. When their relationship ceases to function then they start thinking about the law and what the law can do to facilitate them.  In other words, I have no evidence to suggest that the law acts in a preventitive way in Britain or, from what I read, anywhere else in the world.</P>
    <P>He then went on to say:</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the absence of divorce law in any way stops marriage breaking down.</P>
    <P>When we turn to the evidence of the Church of Ireland submission to the Committee on Marriage Breakdown, there was quite a long discussion between Deputy Flynn and Mr. Michael Davey, a solicitor from Belfast who practises largely in the family law area in Belfast. Deputy Flynn asked question No. 174, on page 137:</P>
    <P>Would you agree that in other jurisdictions where divorce legislation has been introduced over the years, it inevitably led to &ldquo;no cause&rdquo; divorce, irrespective of how it started off, and that it did lead in those jurisdictions to greater breakdown and subsequent divorces?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> Mr. Davey.&mdash;I would not agree. That is not a statement which is provable. In western society there is an increasing number of marriage breakdowns for a variety of causes.  More and more marriages are breaking down.  More and more are breaking down in this jurisdiction where there is no divorce law at all.  I gather that the statistics for breakdowns in the Republic are difficult to come by but there are a number of pointers such as the number of people drawing single parent allowance.  There are a whole series of indications that even in a society where there is no divorce, for any reason, more and more marriages are breaking down.  It seems to be one of the diseases of western society.  We will have that whether or not there is divorce.  Obviously, if divorce is available, people will use it.  There is no question about that.  It may even be that in a very small number of cases divorces will take place, which had there been no divorce might not have taken place.  It is not a valid statement to say that divorce is a cause of marital breakdowns.  Marriages are breaking down and that is the fact.  They are breaking down in every kind of society, regardless of the divorce laws largely due to peoples' expectations and in the whole change in the way that people see their position in society, their purpose in life, what they are entitled to, and what they expect.</P>
    <P>At another stage Deputy Flynn asked Mr. Davey:</P>
    <P>What you are saying is that if divorce legislation is introduced here, it would inevitably lead to widened circumstances being applied?</P>
    <P>Mr. Davey.&mdash;No, I did not say that. If the problem expands then the law will expand with it.</P>
    <P>He expands this by saying that any law which is introduced to meet an expanding problem will inevitably expand with the problem.  One can say that grounds for divorce have tended to get wider in all <Col N="208" /> societies in which divorce laws have been introduced, because if the problem is expanding the law will always expand to try to meet it.  The same would happen, for instance, if the grounds for nullity were widened in this jurisdiction &mdash; the laws would become wider as the problem expanded.  It is the classical response of the law to such situations.  The laws deal with problems thrown up by society, usually a bit slowly.  They take some time to catch up with what society is doing, but that is where the laws come from &mdash; they arise from the problems of society.  This is an explanation dealt with very fully in William Duncan's book, <i>The Case for Divorce in Ireland.</i>  It deals with the changes in divorce law and changes in society.  To say that divorce law begets changes in society begs the question.  I suggest it is an unprovable statement.</P>
    <P>Argument B suggests that the introduction of divorce would change the nature and perception of marriage fundamentally by making it a temporary as opposed to a permanent union of husband and wife.  A number of people giving oral evidence who had had experience in Northern Ireland were asked specifically did they think that couples in Northern Ireland approach marriage in a less serious, a less committed way than couples here.  Their answers, invariably, were that couples in Northern Ireland viewed marriage in virtually precisely the same way as couples here.  It was suggested that the provision of a reasonable divorce law did not create a position in which everyone went into marriage saying it was just a temporary thing.  I am afraid we must admit that in any society, regardless of which law we are talking about, there will be a few people who will enter marriage in a very lighthearted, childish, immature way, and their marriages may break up very quickly.  They may form second relationships, even third, fourth or fifth relationships, but that can very well happen regardless of what the law is.  I do not accept that if a reasonable limited law of divorce was enacted everyone getting married would <Col N="209" /> turn round and say: &ldquo;Well, this is temporary. If things get bad I can run home to mother and get a divorce&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All this is related to Argument D, that people having difficulties in their marriages would work less hard at achieving solutions to their difficulties.  In my experience people accept that there have been marriage breakdowns only as a last resort, after a great deal of trial and suffering and effort.  The number of people who come to me and say that they want to try marriage counselling and conciliation, who want to try to mend their marriages comprises a very large proportion of those having difficulties.</P>
    <P>The public view that if we had a divorce law everyone would cease to work at the marriage, would cease to try to solve marital difficulties is very insulting to ordinary society here.  It is insulting to ordinary people to say to them that if they were allowed a way out they would cease to take marriage seriously, that they would seek divorces at the drop of a hat &mdash; if your egg is boiled too hard you look for a divorce.  We should not accept that this is the sort of society we have.  If anybody suggests this is the sort of society we have, how have we allowed this to grow?  We who have been surrounded by this marvellous constitutional protection of marriage, we who have had a legal system which protects marriage by not having a divorce law, how is it that we now can say that if we introduce a divorce law the whole thing would fall apart?  I cannot follow that kind of argument.</P>
    <P>It is suggested as well that the introduction of divorce would reduce the protection given to the institution of marriage under Article 41.  I do not believe that the provisions of that article worked to protect the family, either positively or negatively, and I do not think the Legislature have done a great deal even to try to do it.  Any changes in family law have been in response to pressure groups who represented suffering people.  The introduction of the Maintenance Act, the Family Home Protection Act, the Family Law Act and the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Infants) Act has been in response to pressures thrown up by <Col N="210" /> marriage breakdowns and not to the high flown clauses of Article 41.  Let us not deceive ourselves about that.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with problems in relation to children, but a special point is made in the report that if one of the parents remarries it is argued that the situation is exacerbated, that the children have to cope with the problem of forming new relationships with step parents and step brothers and step sisters.  It is said that sometimes this can result in conflicts of loyalty and emotional tension between children and new and former parents. That is happening now because we have all these second relationships.  If Senators had listened to applications for access in family law cases they would realise that much of what the courts are asked to decide turns on whether the children who have been given access to their fathers should also meet their father's present girlfriend whom he is living with.  For quite some time the courts turned their face against it and said children should not have such access, that the children should not be asked to meet someone who is engaged in an adulterous relationship. But if we look at some of the judgments we will realise that the situation has changed radically and that normally the courts now say that the situation must be accepted as it is, that the children will get to know that their father or mother are living with somebody else, that they have half brothers and half sisters.  The children will have to cope with this situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is no point in creating a position in which access should be in the absence of the person with whom the spouse is living.  That may be putting it in a complicated way but it is a realistic way to approach things.  Therefore, I do not see that because a formal legal marriage does not exist between the father and his girlfriend or the mother and her boyfriend it will alter the situation greatly from the point of view of the child. Undoubtedly there will be a conflict of loyalty and emotional tension but they are there already.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> I have dealt with the financial argument. I will move on to another argument, that the introduction of divorce would be contrary to the religious views of the vast majority of the people residing in the Republic of Ireland and to the teachings of the Church of which the overwhelming majority of the population of the Republic of Ireland are members. I suggest this is the real argument and that all the other social arguments are rationalisations of this argument.  The arguments of most of the groups opposed to divorce are careful rationalisations of a position which, if you look into it, is this religious argument that because the Roman Catholic Church is opposed to divorce Ireland should not have a divorce law.  I do not like to put it as baldly as that but that is the way I have to look at it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the injustice of the situation and its illogicality, bearing in mind the sort of evidence given and the constitutional crusade which the Taoiseach introduced with such fanfare some time ago, the sort of Republican commitment given by Fianna Fáil, whose patron saint is Wolfe Tone and whose whole philosophy would have found this kind of attitude anathema.  We must face up to reality.  One person's interested party is another person's pressure group, and what you call a pressure group, depends on what side you are on.</P>
    <P>Let us accept that, say, the Divorce Action Group are a pressure group on one side and Family Solidarity and so on are pressure groups on the other side. The social arguments made by these pressure groups are very largely rationalisations of a religious position, and what I have said about the social arguments shows fairly clearly that that is so.  It was very noticeable in the evidence that the law centre solicitors who admitted that 90 per cent of their practice was in family law, the solicitors of the Incorporated Law Society who represented a crosssection of solicitors throughout the entire country who are practising in family law, the social workers and practical people <Col N="212" /> who have to deal with the dead relationships all favoured a change in the law. All of these people felt that, regretful as it might be, divorce would have to be brought in.  In particular, the solicitors of the Incorporated Law Society, who could hardly be described as an extreme radical body, dealt with this and these are solicitors living in rural or provincial areas rather than in Dublin.  Mr. Brannigan, who led the delegation said, and I quote from page 142 of the minutes of evidence:</P>
    <P>What we do say about divorce is that given the continuance in the rate of marriage breakdown that we have witnessed over the past 15 or 16 years and the social consequences which it is bringing about we can see no alternative to the introduction of some kind of divorce legislation of a strictly controlled nature&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Raymond Downey, who is not only a solicitor but also the marriage registrar in Dublin, explained how his mind had changed on this.  He said in his contribution, and I quote from page 146:</P>
    <P>May I come in on that?  I have been dealing with matrimonial cases and problems for a number of years.  I have seen them from the other point of view also because I was connected with the marriage counselling service, having been chairman of it for four or five years.</P>
    <P>Mr. Downey is still connected with the marriage counselling service.</P>
    <P>My attitude up to seven or eight years ago was that we did not want divorce, that it led to more evils than it remedied.  But in the last six or seven years or thereabouts I have changed my views on that point and I am coming around to the view that some rigid type of divorce is required here now.  We all know cases where there are problems and I know bad cases make bad law, but the numbers are increasing so rapidly that something has got to be done about it.</P>
    <P>All of these people who gave evidence had to deal with picking up the pieces <Col N="213" /> of these dead relationships and with the second relationships which result.  With regard to a divorce law being necessary in a pluralist society, I am struck by the attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the North.  He sees himself as a kind of Sir Galahad fighting discrimination against the Northern minority.  He is quite right.  He should fight discrimination against the Northern minority, but I suggest to him he might look in his own back yard and see how members of other religions in this State are affected by the actions of the State.  It is very difficult to ask the Northern Unionists or the Northern Protestants to, as it were, put their head in the tiger's mouth and wait to see whether it is bitten off.  What is the point of saying to them: &ldquo;We will keep your rights and so on&rdquo;, when they can see quite well that the situation has not changed here in the South and there is no sign that society is going to change here?  If anything rather it is going backwards.</P>
    <P>The fact that I have dealt with the divorce situation at such length should not be taken to mean that I do not think that the other recommendations are not of very great importance.  They would act as a protection for the family.  As I have said, Article 41 of the Constitution has been described as an empty formula by a much more eminent person than I.  For some odd reason putting off the holding of a referendum, putting off dealing with the divorce problem seems also to imply putting off dealing with all the other recommendations of the committee.  It is as though the fact that the Government did not want to grasp the nettle of the referendum meant that they were shuffling the entire report to one side.  Apart from the introduction by the Minister of State of a pilot conciliation scheme which predated the publication of the report, there has been very little word of any possible action on the many recommendations, such as the raising of the minimum age of marriage, some of which are easy to implement.  Education for relationships and for life is vital and all the submissions from representative groups stressed its importance.  It has been lacking in Irish education up to now.  One has only to <Col N="214" /> look at the sort of relationship that was pictured in the &ldquo;Ballroom of Romance&rdquo;, perhaps exaggerated, &mdash; but it is not very far away from some of the relationships between men and women in Ireland &mdash; to see that our educational system and the way in which we bring up our children do not necessarily make for the best possible relationships in marriage or the best understanding between the sexes.</P>
    <P>The provision of a much wider and more supportive marriage counselling service is of extreme importance.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable contributions made in evidence was that of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council who deliberately did not wish to discuss the provision of divorce but who dealt very thoroughly with the need for marriage counselling, the difficulties in marriage and the financial difficulties they were labouring under.  As Senator Bulbulia has said, it is very interesting to find that the despised Government of the North of Ireland provide such large financial backup for this Catholic body, whereas we do not do so.  The same applies to the marriage counselling service who are a non-church associated body who do the same sort of work.  When we are dealing with marriage counselling it is extremely important that we should have some way of setting standards of training for those giving marriage counselling.  Already some bodies are providing quasi-marriage counselling services which not only are not good in themselves but also cause real difficulty and embarrassment to those services which are professional in their approach and which are insistent on high standards of training for their counsellors.  The committee recommend that we should have some body regulating this.  We have seen difficulties arising in adoption because there are no statutory standards for adoption societies.  Even more so it is important to establish that there are high standards for marriage counselling.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the age of marriage.  The necessity to look at the environmental pressures that surround marriage breakdown is not particularly easy to deal with in a speech like this but <Col N="215" /> all of us are well aware of the difficulties caused by the abuse of alcohol, the difficulties caused by lack of housing, by unemployment and by all these other factors which put extreme stress on marriage. These are well dealt with both in the evidence and in the committee's report and demand action and not just acceptance that they exist.</P>
    <P>Tied in with this is the provision of a mediation service.  It must be stressed that this would have to have high standards and some connection with the provision of legal services because there are limitations to mediation services.  While mediation can accomplish a very great deal in agreements such as on the parenting of children where the parents have broken up, where they can both act as good parents even though they cannot live with each other, there are areas such as the disposal of property where mediation needs legal advice as well. Mediation agreements can be drawn up which will create enormous legal differences afterwards.  A mediation service definitely needs the help of a legal adviser before such matters are dealt with.</P>
    <P>On a practical level many of us have come up against this and it is very important that a mediation service should be able to see its own limits as well as its own horizons and the things that it can aim for.  Nevertheless, in the area of conciliating people who have differences which cannot be resolved by reconciliation but which can be resolved by rational discussion through a mediator, a good mediation service can achieve an enormous amount.  It is extremely important that we should proceed from the somewhat limited pilot scheme the Minister of State has introduced through to the setting up of a mediation service.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the need for &mdash; this is something which I think is rather a gap in the report &mdash; a means to implement the recommendations in the report, not simply to leave it to whatever Government Department may have to deal with it.  I suggest that the Government should consider in the immediate future setting up some kind of interdepartmental <Col N="216" /> group, or something of the sort which was charged with the specific task of responding to these various positive recommendations in the report, who would do something positive about bringing them into effect.  Otherwise we can all say: &ldquo;Yes we should have a better mediation service; we should have education; we should have counselling and so on.&rdquo;  No one will disagree with that but no one will necessarily do anything positive about it.  Therefore, I ask the Government as a matter of urgency, to set up a means of implementing these various recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report dealt fully with the various legal remedies available at present.  It is naturally a temptation to me as a lawyer to go into enormous detail about these. Perhaps the best way to avoid that would be not to argue greatly about them but simply say that the recommendations of the committee in this area are very helpful. I particularly welcome the recommendations on the removal of the adversarial area out of such matters as judicial separation and the various ways in which the court deals with marriage breakdown.  The ground of irretrievable breakdown is certainly more likely to be a fruitful way of dealing with it than the present situation where one side has to prove that the other side is totally black and with no redeeming features and then the other side comes back to say the opposite.  This leads to nothing but increased bitterness and difficulty and it is very difficult for two parents, for instance, who have got themselves into this situation to conciliate and try to deal with the problems of their children.</P>
    <P>I have to some extent dealt with the suggestion that the expansion of the law of nullity would solve the problem and I have made it clear that I do not think this is true.  One of the difficulties, and this was referred to by Senator Bulbulia, is that the law of nullity in recent years has developed very considerably and has set up an uncertain area which the committee's report highlights.  In recent judgments there has been a development from the idea that where either the wife <Col N="217" /> or the husband is, because of mental disease, incapable of forming and sustaining either a caring and considerate relationship or a normal marriage relationship, a nullity decree could be granted.  This has developed into the idea that if the person has a personality defect of a severe nature a nullity decree may be granted.  As the judgments go on the area is becoming wider.</P>
    <P>Also in the area of duress, which is another one which is difficult to deal with, there is a certain line of judgment from one lot of judges in the High Court which is enlarging this and then another line of judgments from other judges who are clearly trying to, as it were, hold what in other circumstances &mdash; if there were divorce &mdash; people would call floodgates but, of course, nullity is not referred to as floodgates.  They are obviously trying to hold the line against this.  It is already reaching the stage where many people might be in doubt as to the validity of their own marriage because determining of whether one is capable or incapable of forming and sustaining a normal marriage relationship in a marriage which may be 15 or 20 years old is very difficult and is very dependent on perhaps the right judge, the right psychiatric evidence and the right atmosphere for getting a decree. The committee are right in saying that we must have now legislative intervention in this area, regardless of whether we want to bring in divorce, regardless of whether we have a referendum.  We need clarity in the legislation with regard to nullity.</P>
    <P>In the Church of Ireland submission it was pointed out that we considered that nullity ought to be clear and well defined as to the circumstances where a marriage was void or voidable, and that it was important that people should know whether their marriage was valid.  This was reflected also in the remarks of Brian Gallagher, one of the solicitors who was involved in the submission of the Incorporated Law Society, when he was asked about nullity as a remedy.  Mr. Gallagher is a member of a firm who deal constantly with family law matters.  He said on <Col N="218" /> behalf of himself and the other Incorporated Law Society's solicitors at page 149 of the minutes of evidence:</P>
    <P>We would be totally against extending annulment as a substitute for divorce because it would fudge the issue. We are anxious that it be easy to ascertain on what grounds an annulment could be granted.  At the moment, as Senator McGuinness has said, the law has been extended by the courts, by judges interpreting the law, and by taking certain facts with which the judges were particularly sympathetic and fitting the law into those facts in order to be able to grant a decree of annulment, with the result that grey areas have developed.  That is incorrect. There should be easily ascertainable grounds of annulment.  One should be able to look at the law, which should be written down and codified and one should be able to see how to get an annulment.  There should not be any great extensions of the law.  The law should be clear.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>It is important that it be codified and that it take account of modern developments of psychiatry but under no circumstances should annulment become a substitute for divorce.</P>
    <P>Again, I would point out that Mr. Gallagher is a very committed member of the Roman Catholic Church and is involved in many of their bodies, for instance, the Commission for Justice and Peace on which he works very hard.  That does not prevent him from thinking that annulment is not a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>The chapter dealing with the family court structure &mdash; chapter 9 &mdash; grew very much out of the experience of the family law solicitors and the Incorporated Law Society solicitors and those of us who have experience in the situation.  There are very vivid descriptions in the evidence as to the quality of the service being offered to people involved in family law cases at the moment.  At the outset, this is not something that can be blamed on <Col N="219" /> the Judiciary or indeed on the people who are trying to administer the court system because the whole family law jurisdiction has been wished on them all of a sudden, in particular with regard to the Circuit Court which never dealt with these matters before the 1981 Courts Act. They were not given any extra staff, buildings or facilities and they were not given any extra time.  They were expected to take on this large and time consuming, difficult jurisdiction without any facilities to help them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that the system has turned out to be defective.  The Law Centre solicitors pointed out how difficult the situation was in the various courthouses. In one of the reports on courthouses which was prepared by members of the Bar it was pointed out that very few courthouses throughout the country have even a public lavatory, let alone waiting room facilities.  One can find oneself in a position where even in Dublin in the Circuit Court one is standing in a crowded hallway which is full of prison officers handcuffed to prisoners who are being brought up for indictment and criminal charges and squashed in with them are family law clients.  Then out of the back-room of the court comes the court crier who reads out in public the names of everyone involved.</P>
    <P>I might add that now and again there have been Members of these Houses involved in cases like this.  Great care has been taken that Members of these Houses are kept in cars especially around the corner from the courtroom lest it be embarrassing to them that they would have to appear in the same dreadful circumstances to which ordinary members of the public are subjected.  Perhaps some of us should think how we would like it if it was our marriage that was on the rocks and we had to stand in the midst of this kind of public situation and have our names shouted out so that everybody could hear that one of us was in trouble. I do not like to be as personal as this but this has occurred.  If it is a friend of the management, as it were, somebody who <Col N="220" /> is involved in the legal profession or politics, careful measures are taken so that they are not exposed to this enormous embarrassment but that help is not given to any ordinary person.  We must stand for the rights of the ordinary person in our reform of the family court structure. This has been gone into in considerable detail in the report.  There is neither time nor is it desirable now to go into it in detail but I think the recommendations are extremely good.</P>
    <P>I would like to go back to the issue of why I support this amendment.  I can understand what Senator Dooge and the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, mean when they say there should be an informed public debate on this matter and that there should be a rational discussion of the rights and wrongs of it.  At one stage I felt that I might very well agree with their position but on further consideration I cannot agree with them and I must support the amendment, partly because I think that kind of argument is being used as an excuse to put off indefinitely any actual dealing, not just with the referendum, but with any recommendations of the committee. Despite my normal admiration for the Minister of State this was made quite clear towards the end of her contribution where the argument was made that the time was not ripe.  The time is never ripe for any radical reform and change.  If we wait until the time is ripe we will certainly have a nuclear power station long before we have divorce.  I do not believe in that kind of argument.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I have come to believe that further debate among the public will not lead to rational discussion, unfortunately. It will lead to the building up of bitterness and pressure groups and perhaps an even more embittered situation than that which occurred in the previous referendum, with an opportunity for both sides to move into further entrenched positions and with a further firing of bullets of rhetoric by both sides rather than rational consideration.  Perhaps the discussions of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown were not always all that rational but they were as rational as we <Col N="221" /> are going to get.  Other discussions from now on are going to be more irrational, more bitter and more difficult if anything. I do not think we will have anything to gain by waiting for them.</P>

      <P>As the third member of the joint committee to participate in the debate this afternoon and also as it happens the third woman Senator to speak in a row, I would like to pay a firstly deserved compliment to Senator Bulbulia and Senator McGuinness for their superb contributions this afternoon. They were finely reasoned, comprehensive and very balanced.  If only the scaffolding was not here we could have had a full audience this would have been a very enlightening debate for anybody who was interested in this subject.  I have much more to say on it but I do not think I could embark on it in the two minutes left to me.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Bulbulia and Senator McGuinness in commending the Clerk of the committee who worked long hours with members of the committee over the 18 months which it took us to compile the report and in particular to the legal adviser to the committee, Mr. Gerry Durkan, whose contribution was quite exceptional.  I would like to pay tribute to the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Willie O'Brien, for his tolerance and kindness in carrying out his role.  I would be of the view that at times he was too kind and too tolerant.  There were times when a firmness of approach might have helped the committee to get over some of our earlier difficulties in coming to a final report.  It is much easier to spoil the work of a parliamentary committee than to ensure that a parliamentary committee comes to a coherent and comprehensive result on whatever tasks that have been assigned to it.  There were some very real difficulties on the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>

      <P>This matter deals with education.  At the outset, while the Minister is here, I should like to highlight a problem that has arisen in third level education where people are pressing for statements about Government grants from students who are enrolling.  A lot of difficulty is being caused because students cannot get such a letter.  In fact, the county councils who look after this affair have not yet got a confirmation of results from the examination centre in Athlone. This is causing an awful lot of damage and worry to parents.  Students who have to enrol cannot be guaranteed anything because the councils cannot give letters. Parents and students have enough problems without having this pressure on them.</P>

Students are enrolling now and the pressure is on them.  The colleges should be consulted and told not to ask for things that cannot be given.  I will return to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Minister of State for coming here tonight to deal with this serious problem as far as we are <Col N="223" /> concerned in Carlow, the question of the school for the moderately handicapped. I should like to thank the Minister of State for the interest he has shown, which I know is quite genuine.  He visited the school, St. Laserian's special school and he knows the conditions that exist there. At all times he has been very willing to help out.  What I have to say is obviously not concerning the Minister of State at all so much as the decision of his Department.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly what the position is in Carlow.  Back in the late sixties an application was made to have a school for moderately handicapped in the town.  This was changed later to a school for the mildly handicapped.  That, of course, is St. Laserian's special school, which has been a very good success, so successful that it is overcrowded.  However, at the moment we have handicapped children who are regarded as moderately handicapped travelling to Kilkenny by bus.  Those children have to spend a couple of hours going and a couple of hours coming because though the journey on a direct line may be about 24 miles they collect children here and there making it a much longer journey. Those children have enough difficulty in attending school and trying to cope with their handicaps besides having to spend so long on the journey.  The first week they went back this year the bus could not travel on two days because of its condition.  It broke down on another day. From what I can gather the bus, although we were assured it would be in good condition the second week, is in a deplorable condition.  It has not got heating and for long journeys in the winter this is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been going on for a long time.  The parents committee work extremely hard in Carlow.  They have even gone to the stage of drawing up plans which they presented to the Minister of State when they went on a delegation. To summarise, an inspector from the Department attended a meeting in Carlow with the parents of the children <Col N="224" /> who are going to different schools and discussed the problem.  There was discussion about a four or five teacher school but it was still a discussion.  After that the parents sent on a list of the 28 children who were going by bus to Kilkenny.  That did not include some who are moderately handicapped but who are in St. Laserian's in Carlow because the parents would not let them travel to Kilkenny.  There is also a pre-school in Carlow called the Holy Angels and there are some prospective pupils there also.</P>
    <P>As a teacher I know that there are certain things that one cannot be asked to do and one of them is that one cannot be asked to give confidential documents such as psychologists reports to people who have no right to them.  That is one of the things the parents were asked to do, to more or less decide whether these children they were talking about were in the moderately handicapped range or not.  Since the children they were going to be transferring were already in a moderately handicaped school it was completely unnecessary, in my view, to ask them for this.  One way or the other the inspector heard the parents.  I saw a report of the meeting and it was quite clear from all the parents who spoke that they were very anxious that the school be set up in Carlow.  They said they would go on supporting the school in Carlow. What really brought the crunch on &mdash; this is why I am raising it here &mdash; is that, after all the negotiations, and I have left out all the details in between, a letter was sent from the Department which offered the facility of temporary accommodation in St. Laserian's Special School which was, more or less, to prove that the school could be viable.  In my view, and in the view of the committee, this was the last straw because St. Laserian's is so overcrowded at the moment that the staff room is being used as a woodwork room, and the principal's office is being used as the staff room and the principal has no official room in which to work.  To ask parents to send their children, as a kind of experiment, to a school where there was no classroom for them was patently absurd.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I do not know where they were supposed to set up the school if the existing school was already so overcrowded that the staff room was being used for a woodwork room and the principal's office as a staff room.  Where were they going to set up the extra classroom or two for this experimental school?  I do not want to exaggerate but when a school is overcrowded the only place one can have a classroom is in the yard.  I do not know if somebody in the Department just went plain crackers or else they were treating the parents of this committee in Carlow with absolute contempt.  The parents see their children going off on the bus every morning.  Sometimes the bus breaks down and they come back.  It has happened at 7 o'clock.  I accept break-downs will happen.  The parents have paid a woman at their own expense money every week to travel with these children. They are very serious about what they are doing and very genuine.</P>
    <P>The final reply from the Department did not treat them as if they were genuine because they were asked to do what was impossible.  I am hoping the Minister will have some good news for us in Carlow that will show us that his officials are very serious in what they are doing.  As a teacher I have a good idea of what happens. We have had extensions to my school and I know that Departments cannot sanction buildings for fictitious numbers.  I have done surveys and we have gone from a three-teacher to an eight-teacher school.  I know the details of what goes on but a time comes when the Department must be asked to stop and be realistic in what they are asking parents to do.  The parents feel very upset.

      <P>I should like to deal now with the subject matter of the debate and say that the educational needs of mentally handicapped children in the area of Carlow town are served in the main by two schools, St. Laserian's special school for mildly mentally handicapped in Carlow town and St. Patrick's special school for moderately mentally handicapped in Kilkenny.  The latter school, which has been in existence for a number of years, serves a wide area including County Carlow and it has accommodation for both residents and day pupils.  The day pupils are transported there by bus.  St. Patrick's in Kilkenny is fully stafed and equipped for the needs of its pupils and, quite apart from the services provided by the Department of Education, has a range of services provided by the health board.  I should explain that the incidence of moderate mental handicap is considerably less frequent than that of mild mental handicap. This means that schools to cater for moderately mentally handicapped children, if they are to be of a size suitable for the provision of a full range of services necessary, are fewer and further apart than special schools and special classes for mildly mentally handicapped.  In fact there are 34 schools and seven classes for moderate mentaly handicapped as compared with 200 schools and classes for mildly handicapped.</P>
      <P>The probability that a moderately mentally handicapped child lives close to a suitable school or class is, therefore, considerably less than for a mildly mentally handicapped child.  The problems in regard to the transport of moderately mentally handicapped children to school are much more severe.  Both the time spent in travelling and the cost of transport are greater.  It is inevitable that some children live outside the range of daily transport, either because the time spent in travelling or the cost is excessive.  Residential accommodation may be the only answer for such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a growing tendency in <Col N="227" /> recent years for integrated local education. It is for this reason that practically all new facilities for mildly mentally handicapped children in recent years have been in the form of special classes attached to ordinary national schools rather than in special schools.  The seven classes for moderates mentioned were all started in recent years.  Indeed, two were started within the last two years.  The general intention is that children would be able to get their initial education as near home as possible, although as they grow older it might be necessary for them to transfer to larger and more central, possibly residential, facilities.  The main problems in providing special classes for moderately mentally handicapped children is in finding enough within reasonable transport range to justify setting up a class.</P>
    <P>The possibility of building a special school for moderately mentally handicapped children in Carlow was raised at a meeting on 1 February 1984, when I met a delegation of Carlow people, including Senator Browne, who has raised this Adjournment Matter this evening.  I was sympathetically disposed to the proposal. The subject of additional accommodation for the existing school for mildly mentally handicapped at St. Laserian's was also raised.  An outline submission for a special school for moderates, to be known as Dr. Cusack school, was received in July 1984.  This was a rather ambitious plan for a school of 1,550 square metres, incorporating four double classrooms suitable for 96 pupils plus a number of other rooms.  A staff of eight teachers was envisaged.  Other facilities which would be a matter for the local health board were also envisaged.  To put this in perspective, I might mention that St. Patrick's, Kilkenny, which serves, amongst others, the Carlow area, had a staff of seven and an enrolment of 69 pupils.</P>
    <P>It was clear that the proposal would involve a considerable capital outlay and it would be necessary, accordingly, to get a clear idea of the number of pupils who would, in fact, avail of the proposed new <Col N="228" /> school if it were provided.  An inspector of the Department visited the area after the recommencement of school in September 1984 with a view to ascertaining the need for the school.  He had discussions with the chairperson of the board of management of St. Patrick's, Kilkenny, with officials of the SouthEastern Health Board, with the person in charge of Holy Angels pre-school in Carlow town, with an officer of the planning office in Carlow County Council, and he also visited St. Laserian's Carlow.</P>
    <P>His report was examined in the Department and it was considered that, on the basis of the facts then available, a separate school for moderates on the scale proposed could not be justified.  It was felt that perhaps two classrooms attached to St. Laserian's and incorporated in that school would meet the needs. There was no clarity in regard to the exact number of children who would attend the facility if provided, so it was decided that a meeting of those interested, presided over by an inspector, might be held in order to get a more accurate idea of the numbers involved.  In December I visited the area and was impressed by the local enthusiasm shown.  I was favourably disposed towards providing some local facility in Carlow.</P>
    <P>A meeting presided over by an inspector of the Department was held in St. Laserian's, attended by 40 to 45 people in February 1985.  It was put to the meeting that the number of prospective pupils would be in the region of 36 to 46, but this was disputed.  No clear idea of the numbers who would actually enrol emerged from that meeting.  Following this, both the chairman of the board of management of St. Laserian's and the chairperson of the Carlow Parents and Friends Association seeking the new facilities for moderately mentally handicapped children were informed of the Department's view that the facilities for both categories of pupils should be in the one centre and were asked to furnish data relating to the potential enrolment in the new facility.</P>
    <P>The latter association, which was the main proponent for the new facilities, replied and, in general, insisted that what <Col N="229" /> they wanted was a separate school under a separate board of management, with four to five classrooms.  The Department offered to afford temporary recognition to a facility pending experience of the enrolment as part of the existing school for mildly handicapped.  The Department would, if the need were proved, provide permanent facilities at St. Laserian's. The chairman of the association replied that the proposal for temporary accommodation was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I have gone into detail to illustrate that I am not, nor is the Department, in any way antagonistic to the provision of reasonable facilities for moderately mentally handicapped children in Carlow. However, it is not practical to build a large and expensive independent establishment without having some assurance that the scale of the expenditure is commensurate with proven need.  In the current case, there are already sufficient places available in Kilkenny and other schools in the area to cater for the moderately handicapped.  There is no convincing evidence that there is a large increase in moderate mental handicap in the area.</P>
    <P>The main argument for the provision of a local facility in Carlow is that it would cater for local children and allow attendance on a daily rather than on a residential basis.  There are educational arguments in favour of this and there are also arguments in favour of a more integrated education than is possible when children are categorised in regard to handicap and educated separately.  For this reason I am still in favour of giving the Carlow project a start by providing facilities, with the agreement of the board of management, on a provisional basis in St. Laserian's for the education of moderately mentally handicapped children.  If and when numbers increase, the facilities can be improved and added to, if it is necessary to do so.  This is the way most new facilities start &mdash; small at first, with growth coming later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> I would like to refer to the argument that some children currently being transported to Kilkenny have to undergo long and tiresome journeys.  This is inevitable, due to the large catchments that have to be served in order to bring moderately mentally handicapped children to a school of any reasonable size.  It should not be assumed that this problem will vanish if and when facilities are made available in Carlow.  It would undoubtedly alleviate the problem for those in Carlow and the immediate vicinity.  At the same time I must say that if an enrolment of 96 were to be achieved, as projected in the association's submission, children would again be transported over very long distances at great cost in time and money.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in and anxious to provide facilities in Carlow.  I am subject to advice from people who are experienced in the needs and demands of handicapped children and the associations dealing with them.  There is a difference of opinion as to the need in Carlow town. There is no point in expecting the Department or the Minister of the day to spend large sums of money on facilities without first establishing the need for them.  I am opposed to children whom we should be regarding as special children having to travel long distances.  In the provision of a number of special classes in ordinary schools throughout the country I have proved that I am opposed to these children travelling those long distances.  I appeal to Senator Browne to accept the recommendations of my Department that we provide a facility in Carlow at St. Laserian's school and in the future if the need arose we would establish permanent facilities there and examine the proposals embodied in the motion before the House.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 2 October, 1985.</P>
