      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  No. 1 is the Social Welfare Bill.  Senators will recall that it is necessary that this Bill should be law before 1 April.  My proposal is that we should complete the Second Stage of No. 1; we should then take No. 2, which should not take too much time, and then return to the Committee and Final Stages of No. 1, following this by an earlier signature motion.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to take any break from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  It is proposed to interrupt business at 6.30 in order to take No. 6, which is a motion on Apartheid, a motion that has the support of all groups in the House.  It is not certain, since it is so widely supported, whether we will require the full three hours for the discussion of No. 6, but in any case it is proposed that when No. 6 is completed &mdash; that, of course, will be not later than 9.30 p.m. &mdash; we should return to the previous business and sit until 10 p.m.  In this way we will increase the chances of an early adjournment tomorrow and also a relatively short session on next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Bill in connection with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland is not scheduled to pass Dáil Éireann until Friday and accordingly <Col N="1358" /> it will be necessary for us to meet next Tuesday.  But I would, of course, hope that all of our business which has to be law before Easter &mdash; that is the Social Welfare Bill and the Local Government Bill which has to go into law before certain orders about the local elections can be made &mdash; should all be completed early tomorrow to leave the decks relatively free for next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Maybe it is the wrong time to do this, but I would like to thank all three parties for the support for No. 6.  Because of that I am not even going to mention the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill today.</P>

      <P>To my mind, it is thoroughly bad practice for Seanad Éireann to take a Bill from Dáil Éireann on the same day.  I would always tend to resist that.  At the very least we should have a Bill overnight.  If, however, it is the wish of the House that we should do that, I am perfectly willing to enter into discussions.  But I do not think there would be any point in holding discussions before tomorrow morning on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that many old people consider it important to put their money aside to ensure that they <Col N="1359" /> can have a proper and respectable funeral.  I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  Many people save because they do not wish to be an encumbrance on their families.  These old people are afraid of investing their money because of a fear that they may lose special welfare benefits.  Instead they keep their money at home thereby, I suppose, creating an incentive for criminals to attack and rob them or, as happened a short time ago, burn down their houses.  The Minister and the Government must take steps to deal with this.  If old people are under a misapprehension about the means test&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>If old people are under a misapprehension about the means test that should be cleared up.  Old people should be told whether they can invest money in banking institutions happy in the knowledge that they will not be depriving themselves of their social welfare benefits and that it is not necessary for them to keep their money at home.</P>
      <P>We must sympathise with the problems of single people who are living at home with their parents.  When they live at home with their parents they are considered to be receiving an equivalent of £28.85 per week because they are housed and fed by the family.  Yet the family cannot claim any allowance on behalf of the single person.  Since the single unemployed man is now entitled to £29.40 per week in unemployment assistance he receives just 55p from the State.  This is hardly enough, as we all know, to buy a bottle of minerals nowadays, if he feels himself entitled to such a luxury.  Surely a case must be made here for examining the assessments of means in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing emphasis is now being placed on another element which is becoming a matter of grave concern to our society.  This is the poverty trap position of an unemployed person who will <Col N="1360" /> be no better off by becoming employed because the level of unemployment payments is close to the net income for working. Some people, and I emphasise &ldquo;some&rdquo;, assess the unemployment trap here as being largely due to the fact that, unlike income from work, unemployment payments are linked to the number of children a claimant has.  As a consequence, the earnings from unemployment payments may be on a par with earnings of a low paid ordinary worker. The family income supplement was designed to boost the income of such low paid workers to remedy this anomaly. It has failed miserably to achieve this. Despite some people's assessment of how the unemployment trap is created I have no doubt its real base in our society is the cruel, insensitive and savage system of taxation being imposed on the PAYE workers.  Until this is remedied the so-called unemployment trap will continue.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo; situation in which persons at work could find themselves unable to increase their final income after tax, even if the gross earnings before tax increased, is primarily due to the imposition of taxes and the withdrawal of benefits as the income increases.  Families can lose many benefits even though the wage earner is obtaining an apparent increase in wages because of the increased taxation and the withdrawal of certain entitlements under their previous earnings, such as category one general medical card eligibility.  Local authority rents are based on the differential rents system and when people's earnings increased the rents rose accordingly. Their effective PRSI payments increased as a result of their increased earnings. This family have now got themselves into the so-called poverty trap.  This anomaly exists because the issuing of medical cards and taxation are dealt with by different administrations within Government Departments.  It appears that very little attention has been paid to the subject of the poverty trap.  This is mainly because the means testing schemes are spread through many different Government Departments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> I hope the Minister and the Government will bear in mind some of the comments I have made on the ever-growing problems which are arising day after day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Bill.  Much of what I have to say has to do with the contents of the Bill but also with aspects that are inter-related with the Bill's passing.  I suppose every Member of these Houses, and of this House in particular, in contributing or listening to the debate on this Bill has been struck by the extent to which the State is now involved in the social welfare area, the fact that about 1.4 million &mdash; or 35 per cent of the population &mdash; are in receipt of social welfare assistance or benefit at present, and that in the past decade there has been an increase of 30 per cent of recipients benefiting under the Department of Social Welfare.  It is no surprise to anybody in this House or outside that the volume of claims for unemployment benefit has increased by almost 70 per cent since mid-1981.  This all reflects the country in which we are living, a country which, not unlike many of our European neighbours, is suffering from a high level of unemployment in business and enterprise &mdash; although enterprise is being assisted in so many ways, not least by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, at the same time, a great difficulty for people who find themselves redundant, particularly those who are not young, in returning to viable employment in present economic conditions.  I do not say that this is any reflection on the present administration.  I do not think that any party or any Government at the moment have up their sleeve the recipe for getting the 200,000 or more back to work by a wave of a magic wand.  We live in conditions which may, over a period, prove to solve this matter.  There have been some solutions suggested, some proposals put on the table, such as the social employment scheme and the enterprise scheme.  Five thousand people have been employed in the enterprise scheme. This is providing worthwhile work in the <Col N="1362" /> community.  It is giving people the opportunity to start small industries and small service type activities that would not have been supported by the State up to now. In themselves those are a great benefit to the economy and certainly I support them.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a health board for some considerable time.  I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, has been a member of a health board but I think he has. Certainly he has acquired a great knowledge of the Department in which he has been for a short time.  I thought it might have been due to his being a member of the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>What I would like to mention first of all in this House are the difficulties the health boards have at present in receiving from the Department of Social Welfare moneys they have handed out in the form of supplementary welfare assistance through health clinics throughout the country.  The length of time which the health boards have to wait varies from health board to health board but it certainly can extend to a period of six months.  The response from the Department of Social Welfare takes that long. This puts health boards, who have other activities besides providing money to people, who have to run the health system of the country as well, under added strain in the present climate.  I hope the Minister of State, and the Minister for Social Welfare, who ultimately is responsible for the Department, will try to give some attention to the way in which the Department over a long period has been starving the health boards unnecessarily of money that could be there to provide other services which they are required to provide.</P>
    <P>Also in this context I would like to mention the inappropriateness, to a large extent, of the Eastern Health Board or the other health boards throughout the country being involved in supplementary welfare assistance at all.  I do not understand why, when a claim is being made to the Department of Social Welfare for a widow's pension, or for one of the very many benefits given by the Department <Col N="1363" /> of Social Welfare, it has to be the health board who deal with the temporary supply of money into the home in a period of unemployment, widowhood or a wide range of other necessitous situations which develop in the home.  I do not understand why the health board are involved as an agency of the Department of Social Welfare in this area.  It is the Department of Social Welfare who are ultimately responsible and who in the end cough up unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit or deliver a non-contributory or contributory widow's pension.  I do not understand why, for a period that often lasts for as long as two months, the health boards are involved in this area.  I do not think they should be starved of funds which could be available for other purposes.</P>
    <P>This is compounded by the delay in processing claims in the Department of Social Welfare, although the health boards are used as agencies to deliver the money.  I accept that inquiry officers or people who are processing these claims in the Department of Social Welfare are under great strain at the moment, given the increased extent to which social welfare is supporting the community.  Equally I think that the Department of Social Welfare may not be sufficiently aware of how great a strain is on the community welfare officer system in the health boards to administer this area, the personnel situation and the degree of queuing that is going on.  The level of difficulty faced by those involved in administering this service in the health clinics throughout the country is a cause of some concern.</P>
    <P>The main matter I want to raise today is one I have raised elsewhere and I do not see why I should not raise it here.  It is something that I believe is appropriate to a Second Stage speech on this Bill and it is in relation to the way in which the Department of Social Welfare look after widows in present day Ireland.  It does seem to be behind the time.  When a woman finds herself without her husband, when the husband dies suddenly, is involved in a car crash or in some other <Col N="1364" /> unfortunate happening which takes him away from her, and where, as in so many instances, the husband is the breadwinner for the family &mdash; although increasingly women are at work and providing for their homes and children &mdash; in a few instances recently I have come across the following situation.  Alongside a claim by a widow to the Department of Social Welfare for contributory or non-contributory widow's pension, we find the same widow who has recently suffered the death of her husband, either suddenly or after a tragic illness, is also caught in the position of having to claim supplementary assistance through the health board, or making an application for a funeral grant, or an application for a medical card, with the possibility of an application under the fuel scheme.  It strikes me that a way could be found to deal with such a situation and it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Department of Social Welfare to find it, given that all these benefits are within the area of health and social welfare.  One form could be used for a succession of applications of the kind I have mentioned.  One form could be designed and used in future to encompass all these areas.  That form may have to be a longer one than people have been used to but it could have sections taken out and sent to the appropriate places for processing.  It is not right that the widow in modern Ireland, following the death of her husband, and all the tragedy and problems that then arise, maintaining the children, the homestead, coping with new responsibilities, should also have to spend her time wondering, for instance, what the position is in relation to her husband's claim for contributory pension, whether he was or was not eligible for that.  She also has to handle four or five other claims that are all within the ambit of the Department of Health and Social Welfare or the agencies of the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>As I said, that is not right.  I make that statement in the hope that we can have an all-embracing attempt by the Department of Social Welfare to design a suitable form which would help that widow in <Col N="1365" /> an encouraging and compassionate way. That form could be used by the various agencies who have to process claims on behalf of widows.  This would at least bring some sensitivity to the situation of the widow.  I make that plea strongly and I hope the Minister, either today or in the foreseeable future, can bring a measure of interest to this area.  It can happen to our wives.  It can happen to all our families at an unknown time in the future. A step of this kind would be a sign to the people that we are interested in making the social welfare system more humane, and a system which provides sensibly and compassionately for sudden death or death after a long illness.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity of making that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief comments on the Social Welfare Bill, 1985.  We are told that this Bill has two main objectives. Firstly, to provide for the increases in the various rates of social welfare payments which were announced in the budget; secondly, to increase the penalities which the courts may impose on persons connected with or convicted of social welfare offences.  In addition, section 13 of the Bill gives increased powers to social welfare officers.  We have been given to understand that there is some urgency about having this Bill completed this week.  Why that should be the case I do not know, since the increases for which the Bill provides do not come into effect until July.</P>
      <P>As far as the least well off and most deserving recipients of social welfare are concerned, the increases do not take effect until the middle of July.  I am referring in particular to those in receipt of contributory and non-contributory old age, widows' and blind pensions.  Other categories of social welfare recipients will get their miserly increases a few days earlier, in the first week of July.  There is no doubt that the old, the poor, the sick, the unemployed and the handicapped are being treated in a most callous fashion by this uncaring Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> The increases, meagre though they are, were announced with a great flourish in the budget but the unfortunate recipients have to wait six months before they are paid.  Last year the increases came into effect in the first week of July.  This year they are being delayed until the second week of the month.  It could be the third or fourth week of July next year before whatever miserly increases are granted will take effect.  That is, of course, if the Coalition are still in office in 1986.  In the meantime all those who have to rely on social welfare payments will be hit by the increases in VAT on fuel, clothing and footwear.  The Government have made no attempt to cushion social welfare recipients against the effects of these increases which have seriously eroded the value of their social welfare payments.  Increases of 6 per cent and 6½ per cent in the weekly rates fall far short of what would be required to maintain the value of social welfare payments. Therefore, the sad fact is that persons who are depending on such payments will suffer a drop in their standard of living over the remainder of the year. The effects of the recently announced increases in oil costs have yet to be felt and seen.  Increased production and transport costs which will result from the increase in oil prices will lead to further increases in the cost of living over the remainder of the year and the hardest hit by these increases will be the social welfare recipients.  The tables which are printed in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with this Bill show the increases in the various rates of benefit and assistance.  Anyone who compares these increases with the increases in social welfare which were granted by Fianna Fáil in 1980, 1981 and 1982 will have to concede that &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; and &ldquo;miserly&rdquo; are the only words which describe them adequately.</P>
    <P>In each of the three years I have mentioned the rate of increase to social welfare recipients was 25 per cent.  The effect of these generous increases was that social welfare payments almost doubled in those three years with a consequent substantial improvement in the standard <Col N="1367" /> of living of the most disadvantaged in our community.  One would have expected that a Labour Minister for Social Welfare would at least attempt to protect the standard of living of these people instead of allowing it to be eroded and eroded substantially as has happened since he took office.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government decided once again not to increase children's allowances is further evidence of the anti-family attitude of this Minister and this Government.  For many of the poorer families in this country, children's allowances are a vital support and income supplement.  Yet the Minister could not see his way to grant an increase in children's allowances even to the poorest and most deprived families in the country.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the living alone allowance.  It is being increased by a few pence to £3.40 from next July.  That is the very small amount which is paid to those social welfare recipients who have attained pensionable age and are living alone. The first thing I want to say is that this allowance should be far higher than it is at the moment.  There is no doubt that the most deprived and disadvantaged of our social welfare recipients are those who are living alone.  The second point I want to make is that the living alone condition is being interpreted far too strictly at the moment by some, and probably all, social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>I know of the case of a pensioner who is almost 80 years of age who lives alone but whose grandson, aged 11 or 12, used to go to his house and spend the night there.  Apart from sleeping at night in his grandfather's house this child lived, had his meals, did his lessons and watched television in his own home, which is a short distance away.  Yet, the social welfare officer somehow became aware that the boy was sleeping at night in his grand-father's house and the pensioner's living alone allowance was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I also believe that in the case of other social welfare schemes, such as the free telephone rental scheme and the free electricity allowance scheme, the conditions <Col N="1368" /> of eligibility which require that the recipient be living alone, or with very restricted categories of persons, should be changed.</P>
    <P>We are all very conscious of the number of violent and vicious attacks which have been made on elderly persons over the past couple of months.  The majority of these attacks were on elderly persons living in remote rural areas.  They are the people who are mainly at risk as far as such attacks are concerned.  There is a reluctance on the part of such elderly persons to get a relative or a neighbour to stay in the house with them at night lest they might lose some allowance to which they are entitled and which is governed by the living alone condition. I would ask the Minister to relax this condition in relation to the relevant schemes.  I believe that if the living alone condition was relaxed, or even interpreted less strictly or in a more flexible way by the social welfare officers, many elderly pensioners would be more willing to avail of the company of a neighbour or relative who would stay with them at night.  As it is, they cannot risk losing allowances such as those to which I have referred, or the free fuel allowance since eligibility for it is also determined to a large extent by whether or not an applicant is living alone.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point relevant to social welfare that I want to make in relation to attacks on the elderly which have been reported in recent weeks. Many of the people who are at risk live in remote rural areas.  One of their difficulties is that they have no way of summoning help if they suspect that they are in danger.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices with Telecom Éireann to ensure that such people get priority in the installation of telephones.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill deals with the family income supplement.  It is obvious that this scheme, like the £9.60 scheme a couple of years ago for women in the home, has been a complete and total failure.  When the family allowance scheme was introduced we were told that up to 35,000 families would benefit under it.  I understand that to date only approximately <Col N="1369" /> 10,000 applications have been received by the Department.  One-third of these applications have been refused and one-third of them are still being processed so that only approximately one-third of the applications received to date have been granted.  This is a scheme which was supposed to cushion the least well-off sections of the community against the hardship caused by the 50 per cent reduction in the food subsidies last August.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the family income supplement scheme may have helped the Labour Party in their hour of need but it certainly has done very little, and will do very little for the thousands of families who are on, or below the poverty line today.</P>
    <P>Coming from a rural constituency in the west, I feel I must refer to the scheme of unemployment assistance to small farmers, or the small farmer's dole as it is commonly known.  This scheme was introduced as an income supplement for small farmers in the most disadvantaged part of the country.  Means were assessed on a notional basis, having regard to the poor law valuation of the holdings of the farmer concerned.  This meant that these farmers could increase production on their small holdings without fear of interference from the social welfare officers, or without fear of losing the social welfare payments without which they could not manage.  This scheme, of unemployment assistance enabled the small farmers to remain on the land and to eke out a living for themselves and their families.  For many of them it was the only thing that stood between them and the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Many such smallholders tried to improve their lot.  They availed of various schemes to improve their farms.  They carried out drainage and reclamation work.  They applied lime and fertiliser to their land and many of them participated in the small farm incentive scheme. Some, on the advice of their agricultural adviser, became involved in milk production, often with fewer than ten to 12 cows since their holdings could not carry any more.  Then this Government came into <Col N="1370" /> office and under a Labour Minister for Social Welfare, the notional method of assessment of means for small farmers' dole was abolished.  The social welfare officers were sent out into the highways and byways of the west to carry out what is referred to as a factual assessment of means.  Thousands of smallholders lost their unemployment assistance or had it reduced to a pittance.  The &ldquo;dosser&rdquo;, namely the fellow who stays in bed all day, or spends the day in the pub, has come into his own again and the unfortunate small farmer who is prepared to expend blood, sweat and tears in an effort to improve his own lot and that of his family and to give a reasonable standard of living to his family, is once again back on his knees.  These unfortunate people have in many cases lost in the region of £40 or £50 a week.  They cannot manage without this supplementary income.  For many of them the emigrant ship would once more be a harsh reality if they had anywhere to emigrate to.</P>
    <P>All of us, as public representatives, are conscious of various anomalies in the social welfare system.  I am not going to go into all the anomalies in the system but I want to refer to one category of social welfare recipients who in my view are very badly treated and this is the category referred to by Senator FitzGerald, namely widows.  Senator FitzGerald referred to some of the problems with which widows have to cope in the early weeks or months of widowhood.  I want to endorse the suggestion which he made in relation to how the social welfare system could be streamlined in order to facilitate such people.  I want to refer in particular to widows under 66 years of age whose late husbands had been in receipt of old age pension and who were eligible for the free electricity allowance. After the death of the husband the widow, because she is under 66 years of age, loses the free electricity allowance and with it her entitlement to the free television licence.  I feel that this is very unfair and I ask the Minister to look at this situation and see if an exception could be made in the case of widows under 66 whose husbands were entitled to <Col N="1371" /> these allowances.  These women in many cases have to survive on the widow's small pension after their husbands have died and the loss of these allowances can be a very big blow to them.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides for increased penalties for persons convicted for social welfare offences and it also strengthens the powers of social welfare officers.  I agree that as far as possible abuses of the social welfare system must be eliminated but social welfare recipients, like all other human beings, have their dignity.  The vast majority of them are honest, God-fearing people.  Very many of them are victims of a recession which they do not understand and have not come to terms with.  All of them are under extreme pressure.  Therefore the Minister should ensure that in any campaign to stamp out abuses of the social welfare system, the ordinary rank and file recipients of social welfare will not be subjected to harassment by social welfare officers or treated as if they were all rogues and thieves.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that this Bill certainly does nothing for the Government's reputation in the area of social welfare.  This Government are callously uncaring and insensitive as far as the most deprived and disadvantaged sections of the community are concerned.  I certainly could not support the Bill which does not provide increases which are at least sufficient to maintain the standard of living of people in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would say that this Bill goes as far as possible to alleviate the problems that are confronting the very needy at this time.  I would agree with Senator Mullooly that in fact it does not extend far enough or go far enough in giving benefits and concessions but let us realise there are very definite restrictions and limitations on the availability of money at this time.  I believe that all social welfare recipients will be getting an increase in their payments from the State &mdash; and this is as it ought to be &mdash; to keep them in line as much as possible with increased costs of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose and philosophy <Col N="1372" /> behind any Social Welfare Bill &mdash; and this Bill is no exception &mdash; is to ensure that the living standards of those who have no other income, through no fault of their own, are protected.  This Bill does that; it helps to keep up the living standards of the needy, those who are unfortunate enough to be relying on social welfare as their sole income.  It gives those persons sufficient, and I would underline the word &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;, to live on.  I do not think one can say that social welfare recipients are too highly paid.  Of course, one very quickly sees a situation where efforts are made by some people &mdash; limited and all as they may be &mdash; to beat the system. Some people endeavour, one way or another, to get money by certain fraudulent and devious methods while not entitled to it.  In 1983, approximately £2.3 million was received by persons in a fraudulent manner.  That would represent approximately one-eighth of the total social welfare commitment at that time. This is something that all will agree is undesirable and that nobody would support.</P>
    <P>Ireland is no exception these days and in Europe we have a great reliance now on social welfare payments as a means of livelihood.  This is a very serious situation. Hopefully, it can be remedied not alone in Ireland but throughout the entire European scene and further afield, throughout the rest of the world.  It is a fact of life that the social welfare system as we now have it is very much the lifeline of people and we have to accept it as that.</P>
    <P>The recession, which unfortunately is with us for a far longer period than anybody would have liked or indeed expected, has been a major contributory factor to this very heavy reliance by people on social welfare payments as a means of existing.  This is something that we cannot forget.</P>
    <P>We have an increase on a very steady basis in those persons relying on social welfare and this is something that indeed is very unfortunate.  We are in a situation that must be examined very, very carefully. It is in regard to the margin of <Col N="1373" /> benefit for those in receipt of social welfare compared with those who are working in certain jobs or who are self-employed. Whatever advantage some persons may have by working over persons in receipt of social welfare it is so small that it does tend to lead to a danger of persons opting for social welfare when in fact that might not be totally essential; there would be other options.  I am not saying that is commonplace but the Government and the Minister must monitor it very carefully.  There must be an incentive for persons to work if and when &mdash; I emphasise this &mdash; work is available, because work unfortunately is a scarce commodity and one has to acknowledge that as a fact.</P>
    <P>It is very regrettable that we have 1.4 million persons, approximately 35 per cent of our population, in receipt of social welfare in one form or another.  That is an alarming percentage relying on social welfare for their livelihood.  We have seen that between the years 1974 and 1984 the total number in receipt of social welfare increased by 30 per cent.  That again is a very startling kind of a situation and very telling.  If one takes 1981 as a further base we find that the volume of claims for unemployment benefit has increased by 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>More and more persons are becoming absolutely and totally dependent on social welfare for their livelihoods.  It is true to say, in the same context, that while we have this massive unemployment figure the Government have created a great number of jobs in the last 12 months or 18 months &mdash; take any period that one likes &mdash; but, unfortunately, many redundancies have taken place over the same period.  The end result means that we have a growing number of persons unemployed which leads to a growing number of persons relying on social welfare.</P>
    <P>We also have this category of people to which reference has been made, the small farmers and those in receipt of what is known as the small farmer's dole. There is no doubt that, whether the person resides in Clare, Galway, Limerick, Tipperary or anywhere else, if he has <Col N="1374" /> a holding that is not capable of producing an income adequate for his basic needs to live, his family must be looked after. It is clearly apparent that in many parts of the country, whether in the west or outside the west, farmers cannot eke out an existence from farming as such and this is something that must be very strongly borne in mind.  At present, practically right across the spectrum everybody is going through fairly difficult times.  We have a greater percentage of society now relying on social welfare than ever before.  It is an ever-increasing responsibility for the Government and an ever-increasing problem for the Government to make sure that these are looked after.</P>
    <P>The Government must be commended for this Bill in general because it does in fact improve the position of people generally.  There are certain matters in the Bill which it would be more appropriate to raise on Committee Stage but I would like to make one point in regard to the contributory widow's and orphan's pension scheme for health board doctors and dentists.  Widows of doctors and dentists in health boards are not provided for in the same way as Army doctors are provided for.  This will arise on Committee Stage but I hope it will be attended to.</P>
    <P>I share the concern expressed regarding old people, their vulnerability to attack in their own homes and their practice of keeping money in their own homes.  Every effort must be made by whichever Department can help in this regard.  The Government at various levels, in the Department of Justice and so on, are doing what they can to ensure that old people are secure and safe.  There is an accepted belief that old people, particularly in the western areas, tend to keep money at home.  I am not sure that the money is kept in people's houses because of social welfare considerations because there is a certain tradition there and a certain category of persons wish to keep their money in cash form in their own houses.  This has gone on for generations, in certain parts of the country especially.  Perhaps it is not as closely <Col N="1375" /> linked with social welfare payments and assessments and so on as some in this House would suggest.  Many people &mdash; and I do not agree with the practice &mdash; keep money in their houses for different reasons.  Further, I believe that while people ought not do this, it is a serious state of affairs if one is denied the privilege &mdash; if one can call it a privilege &mdash; of having a few pounds in the house.  With rare exceptions, by and large one is talking about relatively small sums of money.</P>
    <P>We, as Members of Seanad Éireann and as public representatives generally, have a responsibility to ensure that there is a clear understanding by all concerned that we are not dealing with a bottomless well here in the context of the payment of money in the form of social welfare. It would be erroneous for anybody to believe that the Government were intentionally not paying what they could pay because, quite frankly, the Government have done a great deal to alleviate the problems of the people in need.  But the Government are conscious and must be conscious of their responsibility to make certain that they pay what they can afford to pay.  Indeed, when people criticise the level of payment etc., they might remember that more than £2.25 billion is paid on an annual basis in various social welfare allowances.  I would remind the House that that represents one-quarter of all current expenditure.  That is a very sizeable proportion and it is something the Government must weigh up very carefully. It would be very nice for the Government if they were in the position dramatically to increase the various payments to the various people in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State responsible in the social welfare area are conscious of the needs of people but at the same time they have to act responsibly and the Government must act responsibly. People too often forget that the Government can only pay out as much money &mdash; or perhaps a little bit more &mdash; as they take in the form of taxation.  A point that is very often overlooked is that a good Government, such as our present <Col N="1376" /> administration, living as far as possible within their means, must manage the affairs of the nation and can only pay out a certain limited amount in social welfare benfits, educational grants, money for law and order and so on, in areas that are not in themselves producing areas.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Social Welfare Bill there are good signs emerging now from our three-year plan and our most recent budget that our economy will begin to move forward in the right direction. Once that happens and once light emerges at the end of a very dark tunnel &mdash; because we have been going through a very dark tunnel in the economic and social senses in the last couple of years&mdash; we will see some positive improvements. The development of our agriculture has enormous potential.  The application of added value in agriculture and indeed the substitution of a good deal of our agriculture imports, foodstuffs generally, whether for human consumption or animal feeds &mdash; we can reduce by approximately £300 million per year the £800 million spent on food imports &mdash; will do something to boost our economy.  This is all very relevant to social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, I believe our tourist industry has fantastic potential.  The development of many of our industries would benefit the country's economy quite well.  It would enable the Government to do the sort of things in a social welfare context and, indeed, in other contexts, in the way of services to the people of the nation which they are inhibited from doing at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to commend the Government for this Bill and to emphasise again that it is a Bill which may fall short of what we would all like in certain areas in regard to adjustments of payments or allowances.  However, let me remind all concerned that it is limited only by the sort of restrictions and positive financial limitations that surround our Government's entire scenario.  I am confident that with the development of our economy in the next 12 months we will, I hope, have fewer people relying on social welfare and, indeed, that we <Col N="1377" /> will be in a position to give more to those who are relying on it.</P>
    <P>We must at all times be very conscious of the needs of the old, the young, the disabled and those people who are not fortunate in having a means of livelihood. We must all be very conscious of them.  I believe that we are.  I am satisfied that the Minister and the Government are doing whatever is within their power to alleviate the difficulties and hardships that many of those people presently have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long with my contribution on this Second Stage.  I also welcome this Bill as far as it goes.  We, on this side of the House feel &mdash; and it has been expressed already by some of our Members &mdash; that the Bill does not go far enough, or nearly far enough.  Many problems have been discussed.  I do not intend to repeat any of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his introductory speech stated &mdash; and I quote a sentence about the Government's concern;</P>
      <P>The first is a determination to protect the living standards of those, who, through no fault of their own, have no other source of income for their livelihood.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, I do not agree entirely with what he states there although I can agree with the implication. There is no doubt that people should not be denied benefit, even if they are in a situation which was caused by themselves, through some fault of their own. The Minister's implication is that poverty is not simply an individual condition.  It is not a failure on the part of an individual. It is not an expression of somebody who is a misfit.  In fact it is a social problem and it is a phenomenon of the working classes.  I agree with that.  I am also of the opinion that to correct the situation requires a massive re-distribution of resources away from the wealthier classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister at this stage, in case I might overlook it, whether he would consider on Committee Stage extending section 10 to include registered <Col N="1378" /> medical practitioners and registered dentists. I should like to ask him why he did not extend the Bill to cater for those classes seeing that he did include registered medical practitioners and dentists in the Defence Forces.  This is something I would like to bring up again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the statement by the Minister where he reminded the House that there is a Bill before the Dáil at present to provide for equality of treatment between men and women in matters of social security arising from the EC directive on this matter.  With regard to this, many families will be worse off because of this legislation.  What provision is made for this situation?  At present an unemployed man, if his wife goes out to work through necessity to supplement the income, can claim in respect of his wife and his dependent children for 15 months.  He qualifies for this benefit automatically.  The wife cannot do so unless her husband is an invalid and she is restricted to 12 month's benefit at a reduced rate.  Under this new legislation the wife will be able to claim for herself and half the dependent children for 15 months.  We all agree with the removal of the discrimination and that it is most desirable.  I believe that this should have been done before the end of 1984 through an extension of time by the EC.  There is no provision for an increase in the Estimates.  Many people believe that this will result in a saving to the State.</P>
    <P>In general, I approve of this change because nobody would feel that a retired bank manager should be able to claim for his wife, or indeed anyone with a high pension should be able to claim for a wife who might have another income or indeed might have a good job.  But the situation with regard to a wife who is out working at present and where the husband would then look for benefit would mean that there would be a decrease in the family income.  I would ask the Minister to state whether this situation has been taken care of and what expenditure is involved.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to the extension of treatment benefits to expectant wives.  It <Col N="1379" /> has been pointed out that the scheme at present provides optical, dental, medical and surgical benefits to qualified insured workers.  These benefits will be extended from July next to the expectant wives of such workers.  The Minister explained that in practical terms this means that all basic dental treatment will be available to women who qualify.  I have mentioned before in the House that this must be the only country in Europe where a married woman would have to become pregnant to qualify for dental benefit.  This is an unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that to extend the service to all married women would amount to £6.75 million per annum.  The State could not afford this expense.  It is my belief that this is most important.  Personally I have always felt that oral hygiene is very important from many aspects in other areas of health and that, in fact, the State cannot afford not to provide dental benefit for all these people.  By not doing so the State will have to pay out more money as a result of the health problems which may follow from this neglect.</P>
    <P>The Minister also told us with regard to grants to voluntary organisations that there was an increase of £150,000.  While in percentage terms this amounts to quite a sizeable figure &mdash; 30 per cent &mdash; yet with the added pressure on these voluntary organisations the total figure of £650,000 is quite inadequate.  The Minister listed some of the areas which were being helped, such as the day care centres for the old, meals on wheels, services for the physically handicapped, youth club facilities, day care centres for the homeless and help for unmarried mothers. Everybody would agree that these are all very deserving.  With regard to the 6½ per cent increase in the weekly rates for long term recipients and 6 per cent for short term payments, the Minister's claim that there is an increase in the purchasing power for all social welfare recipients is starting off from an improper datum line because we are dealing with relative deprivation. This is a changing situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think any surveys have been <Col N="1380" /> done of the poverty problem.  This is something that we will have more time to go into when discussing the Combat Poverty Bill.  We need proper evaluation by the experts.  For example, what is included in determining the datum line? Do we include such things as colour television sets and central heating?  Of course some heating is necessary but all these things, I feel, have to be taken into consideration. My own view is that recipients should get sufficient help to be able to develop their full potential throughout all stages of their lives.  At present nobody is content to be a second class citizen. This is different from the position many years ago when people were prepared to be second class and third class citizens. That has changed and I am glad that it has changed.</P>
    <P>Members have spoken about the problem at exchanges where many people are queuing up outside in inclement weather. I would be very critical of this.  I have spoken about that on previous occasions. Also, I am critical of this clause about being available for work where no work is available.  I think that this situation is promoting idleness.  I have recounted before that two years ago I met a young county councillor whose wife was a nurse and was unable to get employment so she decided to do a secretarial course while she was drawing unemployment benefit and when it was discovered that she was doing a course she lost her benefit.  This is wrong because in the long term the State would be benefiting.  This young lady would get a job as a secretary.  The situation should be that all these people should be encouraged to work.  They should be encouraged to organise schemes.  This is a possibility.  I mentioned this before and I feel it should be explored.  Nobody wants to get money for nothing.  People want work and dignity and they want work satisfaction. Work satisfaction is a measure of the gap between expectation and achievement. For many people their expectations are not great.  I believe there is alienation because of this problem and I quote a very short paragraph from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 March of this year:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> The income tax take is reduced. While the young men deprived of the dignity of work roam the streets crimes of all kinds increase.  More and more people are becoming alienated from a system in which they find no work, no respect, no home.  It is easy to talk of alienation in other jurisdictions.  What action is being taken to stem the mounting alienation, frustration and anger of the unemployed in the Republic?</P>
    <P>I think that is a very important question. People who are unemployed could be organised to work in the area of the provision of housing, roads, the provision of fuel from bogs and, indeed, to establish new industries.  In addition to their benefit they should be paid a percentage to represent whatever profits accrue from their work.</P>
    <P>We can take a simple situation to illustrate what I want to say.  If, say, £100,000 is put aside for ten people and that is put into a draw and the money is paid out every week it will run out in a certain time.  But if that money is put to some kind of productive use naturally it will last longer.  This is what I am advocating. I mentioned before the situation of walking into houses and seeing young men who are unemployed and they have not got the interest to shave themselves. Young girls are disillusioned.  There is the drink problem which comes as a consequence, as well as drugs and crime.  I ask the Minister to look at that situation to see &mdash; and I have mentioned this before &mdash; if something could be done to solve the two problems of housing and unemployment at one stroke.  Something will have to suffer in the conventional manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that fundamental questions are being asked urgently about the overall effectiveness and relevance of the social welfare system all over Europe. The Minister went on to say that a radical re-shaping and reduction of the welfare state is a necessary condition for reducing unemployment and relaunching economic growth.  Something on the lines of <Col N="1382" /> what I stated would explore that possibility. The Minister went on to state that the welfare state is as much a producer of pressure groups as the product of pressure groups.  I feel that in the area of social welfare there are many groups who could not be regarded as strong pressure groups.  Perhaps the elderly, the ill and the unemployed, because of their sheer numbers, may be taking on the mantle of a strong pressure group.  It is necessary for those who represent these people to exert pressure to try to get their rights for these people.  It is a sad reflection on the situation that we have 1.4 million people or 35 per cent of the total population of the country depending on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Rent allowances are important.  As regards the family income supplement, I do not think this has done as much as was claimed for it.  I would have the same reservations about it as Senator Mullooly. As the Minister pointed out, the administrative costs are very small.  It is unfortunate that it has not been possible to prevent a deterioration in the quality of service which is showing up in longer average times taken to process claims and answer queries and representations.  I feel that in this delicate area where a question has to be asked, the benefit of the doubt should in all cases be given to the people who are claiming.  The appeals system has come in for criticism.  Some people, and even Members on the other side of the House, have agreed that this is right. In some instances the delays have been unacceptable.  I would hope to see greater progress in this area.  I agree with previous speakers that the elderly people are in a very special category and everything possible should be done for them.</P>
    <P>As regards the handicapped, I believe there is a reduction in the funds from the EC for these people.  This is unfortunate at this time because great progress is being made in sheltered workshops around the country.  I would like to ask the Minister if something could be done to replace the funds which were available from the Social Fund for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that two books which I found very helpful in this <Col N="1383" /> area are the Directory of the National Voluntary Organisations by the National Social Services Board, which costs only £1, and the recently published Directory and Guide to Social Welfare, Health, Housing, Legal Services and other Social Services in Dublin, which costs only £2. I would recommend those two books to anybody interested in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Donnellan) Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on this Bill.  The debate gave us all an opportunity to reflect on the performance of the social welfare system.  I can assure Members of the House that my Department will give full consideration to the constructive suggestions and valid criticisms which have been made.  The number of staff available is, of course, a very serious constraint. The Department of Social Welfare are aware that there are problems in processing claims.  The workload has increased enormously.  In the employment payment area alone, the volume of claims has increased by over two-thirds since mid-1981. Significant increases in workloads have also occurred in claims for disability benefit, widow's pensions and allied payments and in various free schemes and other areas.  The embargo under which only two in every three vacancies in the Civil Service are filled applies to the Department of Social Welfare as well as to other Departments.  The Government recognise the particular problems faced by my Department and some staff have been redeployed from other Departments to the Department of Social Welfare. As a result the overall number of staff in the Department is some 4 per cent higher than the mid-1981 level.  This is not to say that the present staffing provision is satisfactory from the Department's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of staff available is a very serious constraint on the Department's ability to cope with the huge increases in the workload, the Department have made very considerable progress in their computerisation <Col N="1384" /> programme.  This is resulting in significant administrative savings and higher productivity.  It is worth repeating that administrative costs as a proportion of the total expenditure of social welfare only amounts to 4p out of every £1 spent. Staffing costs represent less than half of this.  The Department of Social Welfare are pressing ahead with further computerisation to the extent that manpower and financial resources permit.  They will gradually make more staff available to improve the overall quality of service and provide the human touch which a social service of this nature requires.  We are also aware &mdash; and I am sure Senators who deal with inquiries about social welfare will know this &mdash; that the present system is fairly complex and it is difficult for our clients to understand it.  Neither do the complexities in the system make for efficient administration.  Accordingly, it is part of our strategy that the social welfare system should be made as simple as possible over the coming years.  A substantial increase in the number of claims is the main cause of delays.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a number of other specific reasons which are not often appreciated by the public at large and, indeed, by Members of the Oireachtas. Let us take employment benefit, for example.  Delays arise where an applicant is unable to furnish the correct PRSI number, and again where an employee's record is incomplete and inquiries have to be made to establish contribution records.  There are delays where an employer has failed to make the necessary payment of contributions, where an employee fails to furnish sufficient details to enable his entitlement to unemployment benefit to be determined <i>vis-a-vis</i> availability for work, his efforts to find employment etc.  A particular problem affecting payment of unemployment assistance is that claimants who were advised to apply for a qualification certificate before their payment benefit runs out do not do so in some cases.  Means testing by its very nature cannot be done overnight.  The people who delay in applying for unemployment assistance must resort to supplementary welfare <Col N="1385" /> allowances while awaiting the decision under unemployment assistance claims. The involvement of supplementary welfare allowances adds another layer of work to my Department.</P>
    <P>Great improvements have been made in the application forms and explanatory literature covering the various schemes and it would be in everybody's interests if applicants for benefit could do their best, first of all by applying in advance where possible and, secondly, by giving full replies to the various particulars sought in the claim forms.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the reasons for delays in processing claims and I would now like to mention a few measures which have been taken by the Department to expedite payments.  Many people have the impression that the Department spend much of their time sending files from office to office down the country and then eventually to head office in Dublin. This is no longer the case.  Many decisions previously referred to headquarters are now taken at local level, including the determination of means for unemployment assistance purposes.  This policy is being extended to an increasing number of employment exchanges.  A number of local offices now have direct links with the central computer in Dublin and this allows very quick access to the claimant's insurance record.  I might mention that the Department have taken a very flexible approach about signing-on arrangements where factories close down and large numbers of workers are involved.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has also been made in eliminating delays in paying disability benefit and in providing greater access to information to members of the public.  Disability benefit claims are divided for payment purposes into two classes, long term and short term.  Long term claimants, comprising approximately 55 per cent of the total beneficiaries, are paid regularly on the same day of each week, Monday, and no delay of payment occurs.  Medical certification is required only at monthly intervals from such claimants.  Short term claimants are paid as soon as the Department receive <Col N="1386" /> medical evidence of incapacity, correct identifying of particulars, PRSI number etc., and, provided the claimant is qualified on his or her insurance record for the receipt of benefit, the payment cheques issue shortly after the Department receive the second and subsequent medical certificates.  No payment is due on the first certificate as this certificate merely indicates the date incapacity began.  Any delay or irregularity in the submission or delivery of medical certificates to the Department inevitably delays the issue of payment.  These are matters over which the Department have no control. Similarly, delay in the completion and return of claims for dependants will result in the delay of payment of increases of benefit for them.  Delay in the issue of payment can also occur when a claimant is not qualified on his insurance for payment due to non-payment of contributions. In such circumstances time-consuming inquiries have to be undertaken to establish the extent of the person's insurable employment so that contributions may be credited to him for benefit purposes pending their collection. Delays of this nature which apply to a greater or lesser degree to claims under all of the Department's schemes are unavoidable.  Nonetheless, the Department issue disability benefit cheques within a day of receipt of adequate medical certification in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>The Department have begun to provide an approved local inquiry service for disability, injury and maternity benefit claims by extending computer facilities to various local information centres. Because of staffing and other resource constraints it will be some time before this service can be extended to all offices. The object is that the computer communications network when fully developed will enable persons calling at any of the Department's information offices to receive an immediate response to their inquiries.  The staff in these offices will, by means of the computer link-up, be able to see the up to date position in regard to claims.  The possibility of providing further facilities at local offices will <Col N="1387" /> be considered in the light of experience of the inquiry service.</P>
    <P>The major complaint from disability benefit claimants has been inability to inquire about their claim because of the difficulty in contacting the disability benefit section in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada.  This situation has been improved considerably in the last year by installing additional telephones.  A new private automatic branch exchange to be installed this year will further improve the servicing of public inquiries.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith referred to the assessment for unemployment assistance purposes of single persons living at home. The requirement to take account of the value of board and lodging has always been a feature of the unemployment assistance.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants whose parents are in comfortable circumstances and those whose parents are in poor circumstances.  Otherwise persons living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    <P>The legislation does not specify the method by which this item of means should be calculated.  Each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant. Administrative arrangements were devised for setting standards for dealing with this matter with a view to ensuring that the standard of living enjoyed by the applicant would not be affected in the formula used.  In the case of wage earning families the method of calculation is to deduct from net parental income, that is gross income less tax and PRSI contributions, the amount to cover rent or mortgage repayments and also a set parental allowance.  The remainder is then divided among the non-earning members of the household including the applicant and the sum arrived at is taken as the value of the applicant's board and lodging subject to a maximum limit of 12½ per cent of the net income.  Where the applicant's parent is a farmer the procedure is to estimate <Col N="1388" /> the yearly income from the farm and divide the amount between the parents and all dependent members of the household on a weighted basis.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the question of benefit and privilege assessment was examined by a Department of Finance analyst who calculated that the abolition of the assessment would increase the live register by 18,000 at an annual cost of £21.5 million. The numbers and cost now could be expected to be much higher.  The whole question of benefit and privilege assessment is one of the matters which the Commission on Social Welfare will include in their examination of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The availability for work conditions for employment payments was also mentioned in the debate.  In determining claims for unemployment benefit or assistance deciding officers to satisfy themselves that the claimant concerned is available for work must try to ascertain all the facts in the case.  If there is any element of doubt in the matter the deciding officers are obliged to query the position by asking the claimant any questions which they feel may be relevant to the case.  Information may, therefore, be sought about what efforts the claimant has made to obtain employment since becoming unemployed, whether he or she is registered for work with the National Manpower Service, what type of work the claimant is seeking, whether there are any factors which would prevent the claimant from taking up work if it were offered etc.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith suggested that the rules might be relaxed and that the Department are too rigid in their approach.  The application of the availablity for work conditions is not easy from the client's point of view or for the officials who are obliged by law to satisfy themselves that the person concerned is genuinely available for work.  To understand the need for such conditions we must look at the fundamental principles underlying the entitlements to unemployment payment. The first principle is that the person must be unemployed and payment is not made for any day on which the claimant is <Col N="1389" /> following an occupation from which he derives remuneration.  The second fundamental condition is that unemployment should be involuntary and the person concerned must remain available for work.  Furthermore, it is not sufficient to be available in a purely passive sense and the claimant is required under the Act to be making positive efforts to find employment.</P>
    <P>What would happen if the Department watered down these fundamental conditions for unemployment payment?  I suggest that we would see an increase in the numbers of people working and signing, because the objective of the schemes in question would become blurred in the eyes of the public.  If people were to be allowed to engage in work on the side while drawing unemployment benefit these benefits would in effect change their nature from an income maintenance to that of subsidising employment and topping up wages.  It is vital to control abuse of the unemployment schemes so that people are in no doubt that they cannot work while claiming.  The integrity of the unemployment schemes must be preserved.  For this reason people going on the enterprise allowance scheme are taken off the live register and paid under independent arrangements.  The same conditions apply in that participants in the new social employment scheme cannot draw unemployment benefit or assistance in respect of any week in which they are working under the scheme.</P>
    <P>To conclude on this point, I would like to mention that people in receipt of unemployment benefit are not necessarily required to be totally idle.  For example, measures have been taken to encourage unemployed persons to become involved in voluntary work with local voluntary organisations and community groups without raising questions regarding their entitlement to benefit. The essential feature of arrangements of this kind, however, is that the person concerned must continue to fulfil the availability condition and must be ready <Col N="1390" /> to take up any offer of suitable employment. Persons who propose to do voluntary work must, however, give notice of their intentions to the local office.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon, Senator Ferris and Senator Hourigan referred to the social insurance position of doctors and dentists. At present social insurance applies to virtually all employees.  Employed doctors and dentists are one of the exceptions. This exclusion goes back to the original Social Welfare Act, 1952 and was re-enacted in the 1981 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act as a first step towards bringing all employed doctors and dentists into insurance on the same basis as all other employees.  Section 10 of the Bill brings in commissioned Army officers who happen to be medical personnel. It is intended that the remaining doctors and dentists in both the public and private sectors who have employee status will also be covered for insurance purposes.  This matter will be put before the Government as soon as consultations with the representative bodies concerned have been concluded.  Self-employed medical or dental personnel will not be affected by this proposal, at least until such time as social insurance is extended to the self-employed in general.  It is only fair to say that Senator Fitzsimons mentioned that point.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of criticism of the limited scope of the new dental and optical benefit to pregnant wives of insured workers, but it is, I hope, only a first step in providing full eligibility for these.  To the people who are being critical of it, it is only fair to say to them that other people in Government had the opportunity to do exactly what we are doing now on the basis that we have been doing it and did not avail of the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald made a suggestion about the claim form which a widow fills up and asked whether the form could be changed to include other services which a widow might also be seeking.  At present one form covers both the contributory pension and the non-contributory pension and is already fairly long.  For that <Col N="1391" /> reason I acknowledge the merit of Senator FitzGerald's suggestion.  We will examine it in the Department to see if we can satisfy him in what he wants us to do. He also indicated that there seems to be undue delay in the Department reimbursing the health boards for the supplementary welfare paid by the health boards. There is no undue delay in this.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators were critical about the increases.  When a 20 per cent increase was given inflation was running at over 20 per cent at the time.  Inflation today is less than 6 per cent and the increases being given more than cover that.  If it was necessary to give 20 per cent increases that was done by a party who were responsible for that rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy referred to old people, particularly those along the western seaboard and the holding of savings etc. The Department through An Post sent leaflets to all non-contributory pensioners recently informing them about the amount of savings they can have and still qualify for pensions of one description or another.  I have said many times over the past couple of weeks, and for the information of the House I repeat that, for instance, a non-contributory single old age pensioner can have savings of £2,987.50 and still qualify for the full non-contributory old age pension.  A married couple can have £5,975 and qualify similarly.  A widow receiving the non-contributory widow's pension can get the full pension with £5,400 in savings.  A single person could have £22,747.50 and still qualify for the minimum old age pension. A married couple could have £45,495 and qualify for the minimum old age pension.  In a widow's non-contributory, the minimum would again be paid if the savings were in the region of £44,920. That is a substantial amount of money. In most of the cases of hooligans robbing old people and creating terror and generally frightening the life out of them, the amount of money that the old people had in the houses was very small.  We could send a message forth from here, if people would pay attention to it, that they could <Col N="1392" /> put the few pounds that they have into savings of one description or another. Public representatives who seem to be more in touch with the public in general than any other people in the country could go on an exercise next Sunday or the following Sunday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that he will.  There was a certain amount of criticism about the way unemployment assistance for smallholders is assessed. Senator Mullooly from Roscommon complained about it.  He complained about the manner in which smallholders are being assessed.  It is a factual assessment system no different from that being used in the rest of the country.  The PLV system was abolished effectively as a result of a High Court decision in July 1982.  Incidentally, I point out that we were not in Government at the time lest it be inferred that we interfered with the courts.  As a result of that decision the Department of Social Welfare took legal advice.  That legal advice was sought by the Department when the party opposite were still in Government.  They did not last too long in it.</P>

      <P>The advice received by the Department at the time was that it was necessary factually to assess the smallholders living in Donegal, Cavan, <Col N="1393" /> Monaghan, Longford, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare, parts of Limerick, all of Kerry and parts of Cork on the same basis as applied in the rest of the country.  Therefore, the people in these areas are being treated no differently from people in the rest of the country.  Some of them have got increases and some of them decreases, based on a factual assessment, related to income and expenditure.  We made a number of changes and we supplied a new list so that it was clear what they could claim.</P>

      <P>We also notified them of the week the social welfare officer would call on them.  That was also a change.  In the past they could be jumped on at any time.  They get advance warning so they can be there to meet the social welfare officer and provide the required data.  After all that, people who had received payments under the PLV system were no longer entitled to payments under that system and generally objected to the factual assessment.  The Taoiseach promised in Tralee in 1983 that he would arrange for appeals officers for oral hearings. A decision has been made within the Department that eight appeals officers be made available along the western seaboard so that people who are dissatisfied with the decision of the deciding officer in the first instance and later with the decision of the appeals officer can apply again and have an oral hearing.  At that oral hearing if they think they cannot represent the case as fully as they would like they can bring any amount of help along with them to help them to represent their case adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to decisions by deciding officers on claims for disability benefit.  Claims for social welfare payments are decided by deciding officers who are appointed for that purpose under the social welfare legislation.  Any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of the deciding officer has the right of appeal to an appeals officer.  Appeals officers are also appointed by the Minister for Social <Col N="1394" /> Welfare and they are senior officers with a great deal of experience of social welfare matters.  An appeals officer is free of any direction or influence in making his decision.  He can decide any case and he is not confined to the grounds on which the original application was made.  In the case of disability benefit the initial medical evidence is supplied by the claimant's own doctor and a certain proportion of such evidence is sent to the Department's medical personnel for a second opinion. If a person is not happy about this second opinion he can appeal and a second examination is arranged without delay.  In arriving at his decision the appeals officer will take into account any further medical evidence provided by the claimant's doctors. Naturally, there will be cases where the medical evidence will conflict.  This can be resolved only through the judgment of the appeals officer having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the amount attributed to known fraud was something over £2.3 million, just over one-eighth of 1 per cent of total expenditure.  The figure for 1984 is not yet available but the indications are that it will show an increase.  Quite a number of people make fraudulent claims to the Department of Social Welfare.  For instance, 4,300 people made fraudulent claims for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and pay related benefit.  We had at least 1,000 fraudulent claims for unemployment assistance, 270 for contributory old age pension, 500 for social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers.  One could be forever critical of the Department of Social Welfare and it is the easiest thing in the world when in Opposition to say one should pay more here or there or in every other direction. The amount of money paid out by the Department of Social Welfare is £6 million for every day of every week of the year.  It is a colossal amount of money. Whereas the percentage rate of increase this year may have been modest it would be fair to say that in comparison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following regulations in draft&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1985</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft was laid before the House on 6 March, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, that the Minister for Health may, by regulations, vary the income ceiling up to which health contributions are payable.  Subsection (5) of section 9 of that Act provides that a draft of any such proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  It is not proposed to vary the rate figure which has remained at 1 per cent since 6 April 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income ceiling is at present £12,000.  It is proposed to raise this to £13,000 with effect from the beginning of the next contribution year, namely, 6 April 1985.  In determining this, I have taken into account &mdash; as required by the Act &mdash; the latest information available regarding changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods <Col N="1397" /> industries since the last income ceiling was adopted.  The effect of the revised ceiling is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £120 to £130, an increase of £10 per annum.  The increase will be collected from most contributors towards the end of the 1985-86 contribution year, that is, in the first quarter of 1986.  While the total estimated annual additional yield is £2 million approximately, only about £200,000 extra will be realised in the current financial year ending 31 December 1985.  The balance of £1.8 million will come in the first quarter of 1986.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free hospital consultants' services. I am not in a position as yet to say what this limit will be.</P>
    <P>A total of £70 million was collected from health contributions in respect of the year ended 31 December 1984.  This represents about 7 per cent of the total health budget for the year.  The health contributions scheme is, therefore, an important source of revenue for the health services.  The vast majority of this was, of course, contributed by the PRSI workers in whose case the health contribution system is integrated with the pay-related social insurance contributions which are collected through the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is more difficulty in collecting contributions from farmers and other self-employed where the contribution due is based on income assessments. It will be agreed that &mdash; from the viewpoint of equity alone &mdash; every effort should be made to ensure that the self-employed pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>Since 6 April 1984 the Revenue Commissioners have taken over responsibility for the collection of health contributions from farmers, in addition to their previous responsibility for collecting contributions from the PRSI workers and the self-employed.  The only involvement of the health boards now in the collection arrangements relates to the collection of arrears due for periods up to 6 April last. The cumulative total of these arrears is now assessed at about £10.5 million.</P>
    <P>I am extremely anxious that these <Col N="1398" /> arrears should be collected and used to relieve somewhat the extremely tight budgetary situation in which the health boards now find themselves.  It is manifestly unfair that a situation should exist whereby persons who have reneged on their obligations in this regard should be able to obtain health services without penalty.  I advised health boards to make full use of every enforcement procedure available to them in the collection of outstanding amounts.</P>
    <P>I understand that final demands have issued in most cases and that some boards are now in the position of considering which cases will be selected for proceedings if the demands are not met.  I shall be keeping a very close eye on the situation.</P>
    <P>As an added means of ensuring that all persons liable for contributions do, in fact, discharge their liabilities fully and promptly, I introduced regulations, in operation since 1 June 1984, providing for a hospital admission charge of £100 in the case of persons seeking in-patient services in public hospitals who have not discharged their liabilities for health contributions. This charge is additional to any payments for private or semi-private accommodation.</P>
    <P>When these regulations were introduced last year they received considerable publicity in the national and local newspapers and among the farming organisations.  It would be difficult therefore to accept a plea from a person on whom the £100 charge was being imposed that &ldquo;he did not know&rdquo;.  It should be noted that there is no provision in the regulations for waiving the charge in a case where a person's liability for health contributions has been determined.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these regulations were beneficial in inducing defaulters to meet their commitments, but it is not, of course, possible to quantify the results. Up to 31 January 1985, £6,600 had been collected under the admission charge scheme.  This figure is not significant and, in fact, bears an inverse relationship to the fundamental objective of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this motion is simply to raise the ceiling level for health contributions from the current figure of £12,000 <Col N="1399" /> to a new figure of £13,000.  I now ask the House to approve the regulations before it in draft form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving approval to the draft it is only right that we should make some comment on these regulations.  As the Minister said, we know the purpose of this draft is to raise the ceiling from £12,000 to £13,000 with effect from the beginning of the next contribution year of 6 April 1985.</P>
      <P>The most important point that can be made is that whilst the ceiling is being increased the level of services in the health services generally has been drastically reduced.  We have had a debate in this House on the cutbacks in the medical services generally.  We are aware of the number of wards that have been shut down from Donegal to Cork.  We know of the reduction in the level of meals in various hospitals.  The cutbacks have eaten into the whole system with the result that we have a very much reduced medical service today.  One has to ask is it appropriate and right that we should, as the Minister says, take an extra £2 million from the public at large as it were for what is, in fact, a reduced service?  As the Minister pointed out, and as we know from 1984, the system of collection of this levy from the farming people and the self-employed will be by the Revenue Commissioners.  There is much confusion among those people.  On the one hand, they are getting demands from the health boards for arrears which include the youth levy and the other special levy and at the same time they are going to get a revenue demand for the up to date levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of confusion and the position should be spelt out as clearly as possible.  One would have to support the case that the Revenue Commissioners should collect, and ask the question whether the health boards were ever the proper agency for the collection of this amount, bearing in mind that the Minister has informed us today of a staggering figure of £10.3 million outstanding. That is, as the Minister will agree, a staggering figure by any standards.  In my own health board, the Midland Health <Col N="1400" /> Board, the figure outstanding is something like £3 million.  We know that £3 million would go a long way towards improving the services and the facilities generally of the Midland Health Board, or indeed of any health board.  I hope the money is paid but it is going to be difficult. Arrears are hard to get and people will be aware that this is the position.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to an aspect which is somewhat unfair.  A farmer approached me a month ago.  He has 20 acres of land and is also working with a company in Athlone.  He is paying PAYE and PRSI at that level.  He gets two bills. I do not think this is fair.  Perhaps a mean rate or something like that would be appropriate but it is unfair that he has to pay on the little income he gets from his farming activities and also as a PAYE worker in a semi-State organisation.  I would say there should be the one rate but obviously if a mean rate or something slightly above the existing rate were applied in circumstances like that it might be fair.</P>
    <P>In the farming sector in particular there is confusion and it is going to continue. We know that from next year we are going to have a land tax and that payment of tax will be on the basis of the adjusted acre.  Am I now to assume that for this health contribution in order to tell the Revenue Commissioners how much a farmer has actually earned he will have to have accounts?  Surely this would be defeating the whole purpose or one of the purposes of the land tax?  This is something that the Minister may wish to reply to.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the high cost of hospitalisation.  Again, this is part of what is got out of the health contribution. We must remember that the costs for private hospitals and semi-private wards have increased remarkably since Christmas last.  The Minister is taking in an extra £2 million per year, the services are reduced and this is a situation that people will consider as being most unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to vary the income ceiling up to which health contributions are payable <Col N="1401" /> under the 1979 Act from £12,000 to £13,000.  I do not think anyone can quibble with that increase.  It is realistic in view of all the circumstances.  I disagree with the point made by Senator Fallon that this is unfair in view of the fact that there are severe cuts in the health services.  The word &ldquo;cut&rdquo; is unfair in relation to the services being provided by the health boards and I am glad to see that the health boards are assessing the type of services which they are providing.  I also welcome the fact that the Government are making so much money available by way of capital expenditure in relation to provision of hospitals such as the new county hospital in my own county of Mayo.  But I do agree with the point that Senator Fallon makes that the regulations and operations might not be effective in some respects.  The situation exists whereby people who are subject to these regulations do not understand them.</P>
      <P>Certainly the self-employed and particulary the farmers, do not understand these regulations and how they operate. They cannot comprehend or understand the method of assessment used.  A public relations exercise is required to make these regulations effective and to make them understandable.  I am disappointed that the Minister in his speech should use words like &ldquo;defaulters&rdquo;, &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;, &ldquo;obligations&rdquo; and &ldquo;penalties&rdquo;.  That kind of language is typical of the bureaucracy we have in this country now that is motivated by the computer and has no understanding whatsoever of how people on the ground live.  The Minister should direct his officials and the health boards to get in touch with the people who are assessed.  He should direct them to make the people understand what these regulations are about.  He should make them advise people as to the methods of assessment being used and rather than having computerised print-outs issuing to every small farmer in rural Ireland it would be much better if there could be a personal call and a personal contact indicating firstly, what these regulations are about, secondly, what the contribution is payable for and, thirdly, the manner of assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> If somebody disagrees with the assessment there should be some effort made to reach agreement with that person on a particular figure because my understanding of the operation of these regulations, in west Mayo at least, is that people are receiving these computerised print-outs and they are not making any response whatsoever.  People are prepared and willing to pay for a service but the PR exercise, the attempt to sell what is being done, is absolutely minimal and I blame that on the convoluted bureaucracy that is behind this computerisation which people do not understand.</P>
    <P>I support what the Minister is doing in this motion but if what the Minister is doing is to be effective the people, certainly the self-employed and the farmers, who are affected by these provisions must be made to understand what it is all about and that can only be done if a proper PR exercise is embarked upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the raising of the ceiling to £13,000.  I proposed at a health board meeting some time last year that an approach should be made to the Minister to raise the ceiling from £12,000 to £13,000.  I am glad that he has acceded to our request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at Senator Durcan standing up in this House to tell us that all is well with the health boards when we know it is not.  The big question at the moment is how much longer the nursing staff employed by the health boards will be able to stand the strain or when will they break under the strain.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at the health services and to do something about removing the embargo on recruitment to the service.  There are areas in the health boards where improvement was necessary and the Minister will agree with me that improvements have been carried out.  I am glad there is more emphasis being put on community care.  However, there are areas in our service which needs specialised care.  I refer specifically to the areas of geriatric care and psychiatric treatment.  The embargo is having a terrible effect in those areas.  This scheme when it started was a very welcome <Col N="1403" /> scheme.  It catered for sections of the community who could not avail of hospital services without paying through the nose &mdash; members of the farming community who had not got a medical card, the commercial sector and the working sector whose income limits were such that they could not avail of free hospital services.  I would like the Minister to take particular note of this.  This scheme began in 1971 when farmers whose rateable valuation was £60 or less were asked to pay an across-the-board fee of £7 per annum.  That £7 remained static until 1975.  What has happened since then? In 1975-76 the fee was increased to £12 which we would agree would take inflation into account and would be a fair increase.  In 1976-77 the fee was increased to £15; in 1977-78, to £18; in 1978-79, to £21.  In 1979-80 the fee was changed to the rateable valuation by the multiplier or notional system, with a ceiling limit of £55.  In 1980-81 the fee jumped to £70; in 1981-82, to £85; in 1982-83 to £95; in 1983-84 to £110; in 1984-85 to £120 and now it has gone up to £130.</P>
    <P>My main quibble is that we are here talking about the health contributions yearly reckonable income regulations.  At the same time there is a youth employment levy of 1 per cent and the latest Government levy of 1 per cent.  I think the Minister would agree that the big quibble is with the 3 per cent levy in 1983-84 and 1984-85.  The farming community did not pay their contributions for two years because there is a pending court case.  I believe, and I said it at that time, that the farming community were so advised. However, the fact that they did not pay in those years means that the farmers, at a time when they have other financial commitments are saddled with a bill for three years.  I would ask the Minister to direct the health boards to make an arrangement with people who have extensive arrears whereby the arrears can be cleared over a period of, say, six months.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous goodwill towards this scheme but the problem is that the <Col N="1404" /> average farmer's net income is usually 30 per cent less than his gross income, allowing for all his commitments and for depreciation.  An example would be a farmer with £10,000 income who is now being asked to pay £800 in one year which would be approximately 12 per cent to 15 per cent of his net income.  This is in addition to paying his taxes.  I am totally opposed to a system whereby a youth employment levy of 1 per cent has been foisted on the people and a Government 1 per cent levy for God knows what.  The people have not a clue as to where this money is being spent.  It is equivalent to putting your hand in somebody's pocket and taking money out of it.</P>
    <P>The bills issued in November 1984 are based on gross income.  I would ask the Minister to consult with the health boards.  I agree with Senator Durcan that there should be a better approach to the people involved.  They should be invited into the health boards and where there are arrears arrangements should be made whereby they could be cleared over a six-month period.  The imposition of £100 admission charge reminds me of the system that operates whereby county councils are cutting off water supplies, bringing in bulldozers and cutting the pipes into somebody's house and charging them £100 reconnection fee.  It does not make sense.  It is not the proper approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The content of the regulations before us is inevitable because with the changing rate of inflation the ceiling had to be raised from £12,000 to £13,000 income per annum.  I am amazed that neither the Government nor the Department have seen fit, despite the fact that glaring inequities were shown to exist and have been highlighted on many occasions over the last two to three years, even at this stage, to try to remove those inequities. As Senator Lynch has said, with the change from the notional scheme to the assessment scheme, the sluice gates were opened for abuse, particularly where sections of the community had the opportunity of assessing themselves.  People in the PAYE system and other areas where the <Col N="1405" /> taxation applies have no say, they are caught; they have no choice; they pay their contributions.  The farming community in particular had the opportunity of self-assessment.  The option was to assess themselves on either gross income or disposable income.  They opted for the easier assessment, the assessment on disposable income, which was nothing short of being notional again.  A procedure was compounded that had shown itself to be useless for the purpose for which it was intended.</P>
      <P>On various occasions health boards sent out assessment forms on which farmers could declare their income.  A broad guideline was given as to what income could be included and should be excluded.  The recipients duly assessed their incomes so as to produce contributions far less than their previous contributions. It was unfair to burden health boards with the situation where they were to be revenue collectors for the Government in collecting health contributions and the youth employment and special employment levies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned that there is in the region of £10.5 million still outstanding.  I would question that figure because the haphazard method in which the procedure was carried out leaves itself open, not so much to abuse as to inaccuracy in that the assessments and demands were sent out on old rate demand books that were available.  When one looks at the rate books it is obvious that they are out of date.  Many people I have met as a public representative received demand notes.  Those demand notes still exist.  Many people long since gone to their reward are still being sent final notices.  That shows lack of communication. I do not believe that it is the duty of the health boards to bring this to the notice of the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Finance or whoever else the revenue is collected for. The basis on which these assessments were originally carried out and the list of people who were to receive the assessments were inaccurate.  Once there is inaccuracy or a flow at the beginning people will tend to abuse the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> People may lambast farmers who are not paying their contributions.  There are cases where non-payment is due to neglect and there are people who will abuse any system.  It is wrong to generalise and promote the idea that contributions are not coming from the farming community, especially having regard to the fact that the original assessment was wrong and in many cases assessments were sent to the wrong people.  It is regrettable that even at this stage the parties concerned have not seen fit to change the whole system even though there has been direct demand from April 1984.  That has changed the position somewhat.  An opportunity has been lost to make amends for neglect on the official side.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the suggestions that were made with regard to the £100 on demand charge imposed at entry if you have not paid a contribution fee. Many people are willing to chance the £100 charge because if they are admitted to hospital all the £100 does is maintain them for one day in a hospital.  A £100 charge would be reasonable for one day's maintenance and medicine requirements.</P>
    <P>I believe with other Senators that health boards should not have been asked to collect levies.  The inequities that exist will not be rectified by this regulation. Examination of cases and deciding on court action or otherwise is a very tedious and costly process and I am not too sure if it is as effective as the consultation suggested by Senator Durcan and Senator Fallon.  The responsibility for collection of health contributions should be left to the local body.  We talk about decentralisation.  The ideal opportunity exists to leave the health boards in contact with the community which they serve and to let them collect the health contribution. Let the Department of Finance or the relevant Department make assessments as they seem to have the intention of doing.  I would like the Minister to take note of this point in particular because I hope to make a contribution on the Social Welfare Bill later &mdash; if the Department of Social Welfare officers <Col N="1407" /> assess self-employed persons as keenly as they assess social welfare cases, the Department of Social Welfare will be compensated very adequately by the contributions they will get under this regulation. It will be very foolish and will look ridiculous if the health boards institute proceedings against a few people chosen at random to be made scapegoats for those guilty of not paying their contributions. I am not trying to condone non-payment. I do not think it is the proper way to deal with a situation that has existed for years.  If the health boards were to collect the health contributions and the other relevant Departments were to collect their contributions, the process would be simpler, there would be less hassle involved and in the long run it would be less expensive to the State.</P>

      <P>Senator Fallon talked about increases.  This applies only to people with incomes in excess of £12,000.  The incomes of the vast majority of contributors are under £12,000.  If you have £12,000 or £13,000 you pay accordingly but if your income is over £13,000 or between £12,000 and £13,000 it is only an extra £10 anyway.  A farmer who is also employed must pay on both sources of income.  The maximum, regardless of the two sources, is £120. The health boards have to collect all arrears up to 5 April 1984 and the contributions will go to the Revenue Commissioners after that.  Senator Fallon mentioned the amount outstanding in the Midland Health Board.  There is a total of £3 million outstanding but it would appear that some of this is youth employment levy and income levy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the Senator did not but the point has been made by other Senators and indeed it was raised in this discussion earlier today.</P>
      <P>Generally, for the benefit of Senators here, I will give the figures in relation to the amounts paid, not alone by farmers but by other people as well.  The average contribution in 1983 from insured workers and pensioners was £63.94.  The average contribution of the self-employed was £24.74.  The average contribution of farmers was £6.92.  That improved a little, if one could call it an improvement from the farmers' point of view, in 1984.  It went from £6.92 to £21.86 and the other figures stayed pretty much the same with the exception of the figure for the self-employed, whose average contribution fell from £24.04 to £17.66.  Taking the total receipts into consideration, in 1983 £62,000,537 was collected from insured workers and people of that nature, £2,597,330 from the self-employed and £726,423 from farmers.  In 1984, £65,845,000 was collected from insured workers, £1,854,781 from the self-employed and £2,295,768 from farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an open invitation by health boards to farmers to come in and talk about the situation and agree on the figure that they could pay.  This was largely done by people who came in relation to the £100 charge.  The main reason for the charge was to place a threat over people.  Some 66 people paid it.  This cannot be waived.  A person on whom this charge is imposed would have to pay it and would also have to pay the arrears. How is it that we are always talking about farmers contributions to things like that?  I am aware of the plight of the agricultural community just as much as anybody else.  For the charge you are getting free hospitalisation, a massive cover.  The services, regardless of how they are criticised, are very good.  Rather than be providing some kind of hope for people who have not paid their health contributions, I think if Members of the Oireachtas got together and said: &ldquo;You are required to pay your contributions; <Col N="1409" /> it is necessary for the running of the system&rdquo;, they would be doing a good job. When the final figure of the Department of Health is taken into consideration, it is approximately £1,100 million per year.  If that were to be broken down further it means a cost of £337 for every man, woman and child in the country.  By any standard that is a great deal of money to be spending on the health services.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan spoke about development. There is £177 million to be spent on capital development for the three years 1985, 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying that I would like to thank all Senators for their contributions. If I failed to answer any of the points that have been made, then I am sorry.  It was not done on purpose.</P>

I should like to refer again to that section and make the point that it has failed and failed miserably.  It reminds me and other people of the famous £9.60 a week that was promised some years ago.  We know that when the family income benefit was introduced we were told it would be the saviour of the whole nation.  We would have 35,000 families applying for it.  Up to now, fewer than 5,000 families have benefited.  I do not know what one can do; I know it has been suggested you advertise.  There is a lack of communication somewhere because obviously one would imagine that more than 5,000 families should be in receipt of this benefit &mdash; not that it is going to save them for the rest of their lives but it certainly would be of some help.  As we know, when the food subsidies were halved some time ago we had Deputies from both parties saying: &ldquo;We must bring forward the family income benefit&rdquo;.  That in itself is not going to do anything.  At the moment the halving of the food subsidies is costing each family £5 or £6 per week extra.  For that reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On that section, I would like to support Senator Fallon very strongly.  This family income supplement was a rushed job.  When the Government halved the food subsidies during a recess of Parliament, members of the Labour Party made public statements that they were responsible for pressuring the Government to bring forward the family income supplement.  This was in order, they claimed, to offset the loss to people in the lower income group caused by the removal of the food subsidies.  To say the least, the family income supplement is a flop.  Perhaps the Minister will re-examine the scheme as it stands to find out the reason more people in hardship cannot avail of this income supplement.  Many people were surprised to find that, unless they were actually working, the family income supplement was of no benefit to them.  There are people who are not working through no fault of their own who are finding it very hard to survive.</P>
      <P>At the time this measure was introduced the Tánaiste stated that poorer people could not afford butter.  Butter is one of our natural foods and to find that we have arrived at a stage where we have priced our people out of the purchasing market is a scandalous state of affairs.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at the family income supplement to see if something can be done for these people.</P>

      <P>I would like to state that the family income supplement scheme was the subject of an intense advertising campaign during November 1984.  Some £64,000 was spent on media advertising campaigns.  Advertisements appeared in five Sunday newspapers, three evening newspapers, provincial newspapers and local Dublin <Col N="1413" /> newspapers.  The scheme was also advertised on radio and TV.  A second campaign of advertising commenced the weekend before last with advertisements in the four Sunday newspapers, in last Wednesday's daily newspapers, in the three evening papers and in the provincial papers.  It is intended to distribute posters to post offices, health centres, employment exchanges and the Department's public offices.  In other countries with similar schemes the take-up has only been about 50 per cent of what had been estimated. For some reason this has been a feature of the scheme as experienced in other countries.  Everything possible will continue to be done by the Department to get the necessary information about the scheme to the people who qualify for it.</P>

      <P>Section 11 (e) refers to employment under the scheme administered by the Department of Labour and known as &ldquo;teamwork&rdquo;.  I should like to raise the point that these types of projects all over the country are experiencing great difficulties regarding public liability insurance.  They must have public liability insurance and some form of employer's <Col N="1414" /> liability insurance.  This is similar to the problem referred to this morning regarding ICI.  Problems exist in teamwork and other similar projects because of the failure to get public liability insurance and employer's liability insurance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fallon in this regard.  The youth employment scheme as it has been presented to the many groups, public, private and social, that have benefited from it throughout the country, are finding it practically impossible to take up the grants that are given for local facilities in so far as the contribution for the public life insurance liability has to come from their own funds and it cannot be drawn from the funds being granted to them for whatever environmental works they are engaged in.  Locally it is felt that many brokers are having a certain &ldquo;cream-off&rdquo; from it.</P>
      <P>This is an area which requires thorough examination in consultation with the Department of Labour.  The charges for insurance are excessive.  Many companies do not wish to take on this liability, despite the fact that many of the people who are involved in this work are in no way liabilities greater than the ordinary members of the workforce; they are able-bodied young people.  They are young unemployed people getting experience, probably their first experience.  Perhaps there is a risk factor in this but it puts undue hardship on organisations and on groups that are trying to get youth schemes off the ground.  It is doing untold damage by holding up the work because insurance cover is not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section updates the fines in respect of summary conviction and conviction on indictment to the levels which are not acceptable, and in respect of summary conviction to the levels which have been accepted in recent times in legislation to keep those fines within what is constitutionally permissible and in respect of conviction on indictment to bring the fines to a level which has been included in legislation recently in respect of offences of this nature.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that increasing fines in respect of social welfare offences is, the best way of dealing with offences of this nature.  My understanding is that under the Principal Act somebody who commits an offence of the nature which section 12 is envisaged to cover will also lose entitlement for a six month period.  The Minister might confirm if I am correct in my understanding in that respect.  Rather than increasing fines for an offence of this nature there should be a further provision that, say, for a second six month period the payment would be at a reduced rate.</P>
      <P>An increase in fines can be an academic exercise because a court, in considering a charge against any person and imposing a penalty will naturally bear in mind the person's ability to pay.  In this type of case, ability to pay would be minimal. That is why I say that increasing the fine is purely an academic exercise.</P>
      <P>Some other deterrent should be introduced to prevent further abuse of the social welfare system.  That is why I would like to know if the Minister thinks that the six months disallowance is sufficient or whether the deterrent should go beyond the six month period, for instance, a reduced rate of payment for a further six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> There are two questions which can appropriately be asked under this section. I do not know if the Minister has the information available but if he has not I would like if he could get if for me. First, I would like to know how many people have been prosecuted in respect of social welfare offences since the enactment of the principal legislation. Secondly, I would like to know if the Minister has any information on the average fines which have been imposed.  My own experience in this area would seem to suggest that fines have been pretty low, but of course bearing in mind the fact that there is a consequential penalty that will affect the defendant.  That is the comment I would like to make in relation to that section.  I would like to have the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask another question as I see the Minister's officials are here ready, willing and able to help on obtuse points.  I notice that the Schedule refers to an existing fine of £5 in respect of summary conviction under section 185 (3) of the Principal Act.  Perhaps somebody might be able to tell me what offence is covered by that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In all the Social Welfare Acts and in the 1981 Consolidation Act there was provision for penalties.  There was always the fine element in the penalty. This section does two things.  It updates the amount of fines having regard to the value of money.  Also, because of the increased level of abuse of the social welfare system it is necessary to have some serious expression much as is contained in this section of the Bill.  We would hope that fines of this nature and the penalty of six months without benefit would be sufficient to convey to people who are tempted to break the law in this regard that it is serious, that they should think twice about it and that they should not do it.  The withholding of a claim to benefit for a period of six months is serious.  There is also an automatic disqualification for six weeks.  The penalties should be a sufficient deterrent.  I have not got the exact number of prosecutions and convictions.  All I can say from my own <Col N="1417" /> information and from the media is that they are ongoing.  Maybe they do not get the publicity that they should get. Publicity might act as a deterrent.</P>
      <P>The information that has now been given to me about the amount of overpayments raised from unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit for the period of 1980 to 1984 is as follows: for unemployment benefit, in 1980, it was £90,000; 1981, £152,000; 1982, £204,000; 1983, £378,000; and 1984, £284,000.  The figures in respect of unemployment assistance are: in 1980, £148,000; 1981, £184,000; 1982, £266,000; 1983, £351,000; 1984, £245,000.  The average overpayment was approximately £155.</P>
      <P>These figures do not give an accurate indication of the actual amount of fraud detected or indeed the potential fraud prevented through special interviewing of claimants by the SIU and local office staff. The SIU, which is a special investigation unit, estimates that in 1984 as a result of interviewing by their officers a considerable number of people signed off.  The unemployment funds were saved the equivalent of £6,350,000 annually. In addition, local office staff interviewed nearly 15,000 claimants.  As a result over 1,500 signed off.  The question of overpayment is not normally raised in cases where people sign off following interview. There may be no hard evidence of fraud at time of interview.  However, the fact that people sign off is a saving.  Prosecutions are made where a charge of wilful concealment or knowingly making false representations can be sustained.  Within these constraints in all possible cases of prosecution the courts adjudicated on 120 cases in 1984, 78 of which related to unemployment benefit and 42 to unemployment assistance.  All these cases concerned working and signing.  In a number of cases where it would have been desirable to prosecute proceedings were not taken for one of the following reasons; expiry of the time limits or insufficient evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a general view of the position. The present £5 fine referred to relates to <Col N="1418" /> offences in connection with widows' noncontributory pension and social assistance allowance.  The increase of £500 brings it into line with fines for summary convictions in respect of all other social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 has not got very much publicity.  It is a section which when I read it and re-read it worries me considerably.  The section is described as a section dealing with the appointment and duties of social welfare officers.  It starts off very innocently, indicating that &ldquo;the Minister for the Public Service may appoint as many persons as he thinks proper to be social welfare officers for the purpose of this chapter&rdquo;.  One would welcome that and one would hope that the Minister for the Public Service would give his sanction to the appointment of more social welfare officers to deal with appeals.  There is considerable concern in the west of Ireland where the method of assessment of small farmers for unemployment assistance is absolutely unsatisfactory. There is considerable concern that there are not sufficient people available to carry out oral hearings.  I would hope that the Minister would urge the Minister for the Public Service, if he has not already done so, to sanction the appointment of such officers.</P>
      <P>What I worry about in relation to this section is what is stated first in subsection (3) (c).  It would appear that the social welfare officer will now have the option to examine alone every person that he requires to examine.  This is an appalling provision.  It is a provision that defeats any justice in the social welfare system. It is a provision which leans absolutely against those people who cannot deal at arm's length with bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants for social welfare payments are usually the less well-off.  Normally, they are people who come from a section of society which does not have benefits <Col N="1419" /> in a broad sense.  These people can now be examined alone, if the social welfare officer so opts.  It would appear to me that the option for the examination to be in the presence of another person is an option that lies, not with the examinee but with the examiner.  My understanding of the section may be incorrect but if it is correct, I totally oppose the provision.  If I am wrong, I stand corrected.  Anybody who is subject to examination for social welfare purposes should have the right to be accompanied by another person, whether that other person is a member of his family, or a political, legal or social adviser.  One of the problems that we have in dealing with the social welfare code is that the people who are subject to the code do not understand it.  They do not know what their rights are and they are very frequently faced with people who implement the code and certainly do not advise them of their rights.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to say that the investigating officer can require &ldquo;every such person to sign a declaration of the truth of the matters in respect of which he is so examined&rdquo;.  We have the situation where the examinee, the unfortunate person who cannot be represented, must now go even further and sign a declaration of truth.  If I am right in my understanding of the purpose of this subsection, that subsection should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where people are assessed for small farmers' dole in the west of Ireland and where they appeal against that and where appeals officers call on their houses in a most peremptory manner and certainly do not advise them of their rights and certainly do not advise them of the matters which are allowable as farm expenses in respect of their claim or in respect of their appeal.  If such people, who are not to be advised of their rights, do not have the right to be accompanied by any person in respect of their examination and if that becomes law it seems to be a totally improper situation.  I would ask the Minister for the reasons I have mentioned to review that provision again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1420" /> There are other aspects of this section that I am unhappy about.  We have the phrase &ldquo;wilfully delays or obstructs&rdquo;. This is double phraseology.  Wilful obstruction encompasses wilful delay. There are many situations where delay may not be wilful and it would be sufficient for the purposes of the Department of Social Welfare if subsection (5) (a) simply read: &ldquo;wilfully obstructs&rdquo;.  That would be adequate.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the section there is the addition of a phrase which I find quite offensive in social legislation, and that is &ldquo;but no one shall be required under this section to answer any question or to give any evidence tending to incriminate himself&rdquo;. I find that appalling in social legislation. That phrase is proper in legislation dealing with crime.  There is the right of an individual to give evidence or to refuse to give evidence tending to incriminate himself in relation to the investigation of a criminal matter or in relation to proceedings in which he is giving evidence dealing with the prosecution of a criminal matter.  That phrase cannot properly be used in relation to the investigation of a social welfare matter.  I cannot see how a person shall not be required to give evidence tending to incriminate himself.  Does the section mean that somebody has the right to remain silent?  If that is so, then I cannot see how subsection (5) (a) can be included.  If one is entitled not to give evidence tending to incriminate oneself then one is entitled to refuse or to neglect to answer any questions.  Unfortunately subsection (5) (b) makes that a statutory offence.  Subsection (5) (a) makes wilful delay or obstruction a statutory offence.  On the other hand, there is the apparent contradiction that if one actually does these things they are, by statute, in order.  This whole section would need to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>When I am talking about this section and the type of examination that goes on &mdash; because this section deals with the appointment and duties of social welfare officers &mdash; I want to put into the record that I believe there are many excellent social welfare officers.  I believe the <Col N="1421" /> majority of social welfare officers are excellent.  I believe a little PR is necessary from the Department of Social Welfare in approaching people &mdash; I am speaking principally of the smallholders in my part of the country who are being scalded in relation to incorrect and improper assessment of small farmers' dole.  The social welfare officers should receive some minimal training not merely in the individual's rights under the Act but in ordinary courtesy.</P>
    <P>Recently a small farmer came to me and said &ldquo;I am in about the appeal&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;good&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;she was out last week&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;good&rdquo;.  I asked him what happened.  &ldquo;I was having the dinner and it was a very wet day and I heard a horn of a car hooting outside and I went out and she wound down the window and that is where the re-examination took place&rdquo;.  That kind of thing is appalling. That is one example.</P>
    <P>The rights of the smallholder in relation to appeals and assessment must be examined.  This is an issue about which I and my colleagues on this side of the House have spoken to the Minister and to the Minister of State, Deputy John Donnellan.  If there is to be confidence in the system the method of assessment must be improved.  I do not complain about the factual as distinct from the notional system.  In many ways the factual system is a good system but the operation and administration of that system are very bad.  This does not instil confidence in the people who are subject to the system.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to speak on the inadequacies of the system in relation to this section. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the points I have raised specifically and also on the wider questions which the section raises.</P>

      <P>Briefly, having regard to the fact that Senator Durcan has appealed so strongly about the Bill I wonder what attempts, if any, he has made to formulate policy in regard to this section at his own party meetings, or to introduce an amendment.  Obviously, the Senator feels very strongly about the matter.  I <Col N="1422" /> recall his criticisms in the past about social welfare officers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I make is that this is the place for determining the terms of reference of social welfare officers.  It is the Minister, and subsequently the two Houses of the Oireachtas, that decide and define their terms of reference.  I would accept that in an army of social welfare officers there are bound to be 4 of 5 per cent who may well deserve criticism from time to time and who may let the force down.  Some officers may lack courtesy or diplomacy and may let the side down. I stress that it is here we decide on the terms of reference, and once we decide on the terms of reference and the way these people are allowed to carry out their functions then we should allow them to get on with the business which they were appointed to do, and that is dealing with the public in the best way possible and determining the facts in the kindest way possible so as to decide a suitable rate for them, whether it be on appeal or on the original application.</P>
      <P>It is unfair, and I accept Senator Durcan's point, for anybody to criticise social welfare officers for doing their job.  If the terms of reference are given to them and if more training is required, then let them have more training, but it is only right and proper to emphasise that these social welfare officers have a job to do. At times it is an unpleasant job, but they are endeavouring to do it to the best of their knowledge under the terms of reference given to them by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my comments on section 13 will not be interpreted by the Opposition as criticism of social welfare officers.  It is rather glib to suggest, following Senator Durcan's contribution, that Senator Fallon said that Senator Durcan criticised social welfare officers. Unfortunately in debates on topics such as this very often the Opposition have latched on to and misrepresented the contributions of many people in this House, and on occassion on questions such as the health board situation we have debated long into the night.  I hope that Senator Fallon and other Opposition Members will not interpret what I have to say as criticism of social welfare officers.  I do not intend it to be taken in that way.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about many aspects of section 13.  When social welfare officers assess persons and go into the details of their income, then self-employed people, and within that section the farming community, particularly in the west, who apply for unemployment assistance, or dole as it is locally known, have no means of finding out the details of the assessment.  If the assessment is in excess of whatever guidelines might be relevant to an applicant he or she cannot get from the social welfare officer the actual details of what was assessed.  Therein lies much of the confusion that exists between social welfare officers and applicants for unemployment assistance at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> I would like the Minister to state whether a person, alone or in the presence of another, has that facility to get from the social welfare officer what is being allowed as part of income or what is not being allowed.  I do not care what PR job must be done, the person should be told frankly, but that has never been the case.  The whole issue is fudged whether by design, accident or incompetence on whose behalf I do not know, but it needs urgent attention.  I ask the Minister to comment on a way in which the applicant can find out exactly how the assessment has been done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the assessment structure if it is done properly.  Previously I think legitimately, urban dwellers could point the finger at rural people and union leaders in particular said that farmers were driving up in their cars and getting unemployment assistance, they were better off than town dwellers, and so on.  That kind of perception was creating an urban-rural divide.  When the new method of assessment was introduced most people welcomed it and I think most people would still abide by it and be very happy with it if they knew exactly what was being assessed, but the divergences seem very great. I have seen the details from the Department of Social Welfare of young persons living at home in rural Ireland.  One person may be assessed as having an income based on his lodging at home of £29 and another person also living at home whose parents' circumstances may be different would have an income assessment of £19.  To the ordinary person who has not recourse to the information there is no logical reason for that difference.  I could bring into this House bales of replies from the Department of Social Welfare to questions on this.  Some unemployed young people living at home are not getting anything at all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in that it will allow the Minister in spite of the embargo, if he sees fit, to appoint additional officers to avoid delay in dealing with these matters.  An applicant may wilfully obstruct the social welfare officer.  I understand that the processing of an ordinary appeal can take up to 16 <Col N="1425" /> to 18 weeks, at the last count.  Therefore, I welcome the facility to employ additional officers to speed up the process.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to overpayment in 1984 in unemployment benefit of £284,000 and unemployment assistance of £245,000 and the element of fraud within that.  In relation to section 13 (4) which states, &ldquo;The occupier of any premises or place liable to inspection under this section...&rdquo; the way I interpret the position is that there are throughout the country many unemployed people whose employers obviously know or may not know, that they are claiming to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>This is a very questionable section in so far as social welfare officers may go into places of employment where people are legitimately employed and find that there is a person employed there who is at the same time drawing unemployment assistance.  Certainly it beats the fraud element in it and for that reason it is important in that instance but there is social embarrassment.  I would give the House an instance that happened only last week of social embarrassment that was caused to all employees.  I am not talking about the person that has offended, if there is an offence there in any instance; I am talking about where a social welfare officer walks in and is recognised as a social welfare officer on the one hand, or is in disguise, as has happened in the instance to which I will relate further.  If that happens it creates a very bad feeling within the workforce. It is important.  I would like to ask the Minister another question directly related to that.  Is it a fact that the Department of Social Welfare call in the assistance of unauthorised local people by way of getting information as to the actions or whereabouts of particular people who are under the suspicion or under investigation by the Department of Social Welfare?  Are the Department of Social Welfare at present availing of these local, unauthorised personnel but who are secretly there?  There are rumours rampant and I call them nothing else at present.  There are people <Col N="1426" /> who will believe them.  It is very important to retain the dignity of the Department of Social Welfare and their officers. If such people have been used in the past they should be dropped instantly.  The Department of Social Welfare's investigation processes should go on legitimately and be carried out by authorised persons and not by what I would call backdoor methods, if that is the situation.  I am not too sure, but I want the Minister to leave me without any doubt in my mind that no such personnel are being utilised by the Department and ultimately by the Government and this State.</P>
    <P>I would ask therefore that the practice of a social welfare officer going into a place of public employment be stopped. If a person has to be investigated the provisions within this subsection are that he be notified and met at home on a particular date or at an appointed place. Other employees are embarrassed by a social welfare officer going to their workplace and their presence there is questioned under those circumstances.  I would ask that that be discontinued if that is the intention of that provision.</P>
    <P>I will instance a case in my own area recently of people who are full time self-employed getting timber from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, and providing that timber under contract on to the roadside for delivery to processing plants.  A fortnight ago cars parked on the side of the road in the forest were spotted by social welfare officers.  They disguised themselves with boiler suits and wellington boots and proceeded through the forest with axes and saws where they came upon a group of people working legitimately.  They asked them to identify themselves.  They had the names of the people and that is the important part about it.  They said, &ldquo;Are you X, Y or Z?&rdquo;  The people had to identify themselves and they all returned home.  I must say it was a very effective way.  Certain other people did not return to work the next day.  It was a good operation in so far as it found people that were prepared to deceive the Department of Social Welfare. It goes back to the entering of the <Col N="1427" /> place of residence but I believe there is some other method whereby the social welfare officers can do it in a more authoritative way.  That is the point I make.</P>
    <P>Those people who are in authority must do their job in an authoritative way and not devise such schemes.  I do not intend to draw in in my contribution in any way and I would ask the Opposition Members who are present not to say that we are slating the social welfare officers again.  These are instances that I have seen in everyday practice.  These are the once that I presume need to be investigated more thoroughly and more fully in a more professional way.  There are people within this scope who are not professional. This professionalism is certainly lacking in that many young people are not geared for the work.  Let me say I have nothing at all against people from Dublin, Cork or Galway city being social welfare officers.  But I would say the people from the biggest urban area we have, without naming it, investigating in the west do not understand the whole situation with regard to farming and how to assess the farming community.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan mentioned that there is a need for training and assessment. Training they have, but not the experience of contacting and being able to converse with people.  A small farmer might feel intimidated by somebody, might not necessarily understand the terms being used to try to explain the position and the roundabout way the person might use in explaining it.  Tempers could become frayed on both sides and that might be interpreted in many cases that people were refusing to answer questions directly when they did not intend to do so.  That is referred to on the top of page 7, paragraph (b).  Very many interpretation of refusals to give information are not correct but are due to a breakdown in communication between the officer and the applicant.</P>
    <P>There is a very great need for the Department of Social Welfare in this instance to have people who are capable of extracting the information in a more pleasant way, in better surroundings, in <Col N="1428" /> so far as it is not necessary to go into places of employment or where they suspect that people are employed.  There is no doubt, going back to a previous point, that the building and construction industry has been singled out as an area where much abuse of this nature has been going on.  I am sure that in the great urban areas that can happen.  I would hope that there are other ways of investigating cases than social welfare officers going in on a site and embarrassing legitimately employed people.  I hope that the reason for this section being included is not a direct response to the criticism that might have been made over the past 12 months or two years of social welfare officers.  I can see in it many direct responses to criticisms which have been made in public and in private by other people.  I would hope that as they have not had all these facilities up to the present that this section will not give them additional powers where they can dismiss legitimate claims of applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be right in saying that this section is there specifically to deal with people who are working and drawing social welfare at the same time? What extra powers are being given to social welfare officers to deal with applicants for old age pensions?  Last year the old age pension committees were abolished. I was surprised that this was allowed to happen and that that section of the Social Welfare Bill went through nearly without mention in the Dáil.  There was appreciation in this House of the role of the old age pension committees. I asked at that time what recourse an applicant for an old age pension or an increase in pension would have when the old age pension committees were abolished. Has the social welfare officer a role in determining the amount of pension or pension increase?  To what section of the Department, apart from the appeals officer, does the social welfare officer apply when in doubt about the exact contribution? In other words who is to fill the gap created by the abolition of old age pension committees?  Who will advise <Col N="1429" /> the social welfare officer and the applicant as to their rights and entitlements and provide other information to help the officer to decide on the merits of an application?</P>
      <P>The old age pension committee played a very important role in helping applicants and the social welfare officers.  They educated the social welfare officers in how to go about their duties.  Could the Minister tell me how many extra staff were recruited to deal with problems in this area?  Could he also tell me how many applications were made to the Ombudsman by old age pension applicants who were not satisfied with the results they achieved from the Department of Social Welfare in determining the exact amount of their pension?</P>
      <P>From my experience the social welfare officers play a very important part and a very difficult role.  I have found them to be very fair while very dutiful.  The social welfare officer would refer any case where there was doubt to the local pension committee.  This system got the social welfare officer out of conscientious trouble in determining the exact amount in a particular case and gave the applicant the right of appeal to the appeals officer. I am very curious to know what section of the Department will act on behalf of applicants for old age pensions and what improvement, if any &mdash; and I doubt if there has been any improvement in the system &mdash; has occurred since the abolition of the old age pension committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, in support of some of the points that have been made already, if it would be possible to have a more accessible and more open system of determining income for the purposes of unemployment assistance. Most of the provisions in this section are geared towards assisting social welfare officers to establish whether or not individual applicants satisfy the means test for the purpose of payments of one kind or another.  There is not available to public representatives or indeed to the public at large a means by which we can be satisfied that the conditions are met by the social welfare officers.  I <Col N="1430" /> mentioned in the course of my contribution at Second Stage that a totally different system is being operated by the ACOT services in determining real farm income and a separate system is operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  I spoke to a social welfare officer recently, a man for whom I have the highest regard, who makes a very genuine attempt to be sympathetic to cases where there is need, and he asked me a simple question as to whether the Department of Social Welfare were totally wrong in the system they were operating in determining farm income.</P>
      <P>The point I made was that circumstances can change quite dramatically. They have changed dramatically in the last couple of months in relation to beef prices and the curtailment imposed by the super levy and there is not the same scope for improvement.  A person could have a reasonably good income if he had sold his animals in January of this year and a disastrous income if he is selling them now after feeding them for the whole winter.  What kind of openness is there to cope with fluctuating and changing circumstances which make the job for everybody more difficult?  To be fair, one has to interpret and adjust as circumstances change.  What we have here is a rigid and in many ways an inoperable system.  Social welfare officers are viewed in a way they should not be by the public. Individuals may be incapable of coping with the system.  As a public representative, and I speak for some of my colleagues in this House, I find it extremely difficult to advise constituents in what circumstances they would qualify.  After a year in which their income happened to be reasonably good they would be over the limit.  Within six months or perhaps even within three months of that time their circumstances could have changed quite dramatically.  Is there anything that the Minister can suggest that would make it easier for all concerned so as to avoid this combination of legal constraints and additional powers which do not help the people we are genuinely trying to support.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty because many of the points raised by Senators were dealt with by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, who replied to the Second Stage debate this evening.  He dealt with many of the points raised under section 13 and similarly the point raised by Senator Lynch about the old age pension committees. I was in this House some months age when the change was made.  There were many questions raised and answers given in the debate when the old age pension committees were being abolished. I pointed out at that time that they were being replaced by deciding officers. There is also the facility of appeal to an appeals officer.  There is no change in the function of social welfare officers in regard to old age pensioners.  They simply interview the applicants to find out their means and their findings are passed on to deciding officers.</P>
      <P>Section 13 is more or less on the same lines as sections in the Consolidation Act which have stood the test of time in the courts.  This section is designed to strengthen the powers and duties of social welfare officers in relation to the unemployment assistance scheme in particular and in relation to control of abuse by the insertion in the relevant chapter of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 of a specific provision in this regard.  At present an applicant for unemployment assistance is required under section 136 of the Act to show in the prescribed manner that he fulfils the conditions for entitlement to a qualification certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The onus, therefore, is on the applicant to prove his entitlement by providing the Minister with all the information necessary to determine his claim.  However, in the area of control of abuse of unemployment assistance such as working and signing, there are no specific provisions laid down in Chapter 2, Part III, governing the investigation of such cases by social welfare officers.  There is no obligation on the employer in such circumstances to give details of such employment to an investigating officer for the purpose of disqualifying the person concerned from <Col N="1432" /> unemployment assistance and taking appropriate legal proceedings.  Heretofore, it was possible to carry out such investigations and inquiries by the exercise of the powers of inspectors contained in section 114 of the Act for the purpose of social insurance.  It is considered doubtful, however, if information obtained in this manner could be used for the purpose of bringing legal proceedings against offending claimaints.  For these reasons it is now proposed to insert a new provision in the Bill setting out the powers and duties of social welfare officers for unemployment assistance purposes, in particular in the area of fraud prevention and detection.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>shocked at the vicious clamp-down on the leaders of the United Democratic Front (UDF) in South Africa, which has used only peaceful means to oppose apartheid;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>appalled at the arrests on charges of high treason of 15 leaders of the <Col N="1433" /> UDF, prominent trade unionists, and officers of the Release Mandela Committees;</P>
    <P>expresses solidarity with all those arrested and with the many others detained without charge or trial in the course of the past three months;</P>
    <P>calls for the release of all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, without condition, in South Africa and Namibia;</P>
    <P>condemns the shooting of black demonstrators by South African police on the 25th anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre; and</P>
    <P>calls for measures which will increase the pressure on South Africa to abandon the apartheid system and institute constitutional arrangements to include all South Africans fully and equally in the political process.</P>
    <P>I would like to begin by thanking all the groups in this House for agreeing, and indeed enthusiastically, to a common motion being put before the House.  I would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his obvious interest and for being here.  Without his goodwill we would not be discussing this as an agreed motion.  It is perhaps a small but significantly historic event.  As one who has been involved, like many other Members of this House in the anti-apartheid movement for the greater part of adult life, I think to have a motion as strongly worded as this unanimously agreed by all the Members of this House of the Oireachtas represents the historic creation of a very important consensus in Irish politics. Apartheid is no longer an internal issue in this country; we are all united in our views on apartheid.  That is a small but very significant step on the way to our completing our commitment to the destruction of that system and the regime which perpetrates it in South Africa.</P>
    <P>It would probably not be necessary in this House for me to detail the realities of South Africa but since the motion is of great significance I will have to at least <Col N="1434" /> put some of the appalling facts about the nature of apartheid firmly and clearly on the record.  First of all, 72.7 per cent of the population of South Africa is black. Only 15.5 per cent is white.  That does not, of course, include Namibia which is illegally occupied by South Africa.  If that were to be included the population proportion would obviously be even more extremely in favour of the black population.</P>
    <P>Blacks have nothing more than a tolerance in most white areas.  There are, of course, window dressing proposals advanced from time to time to remedy that situation.  Nevertheless the realities are that black women and children, the old and the sick are confined to the bantustans, the areas created from the most unproductive land in the whole territory of South Africa in order to accommodate the black majority population.  On average black industrial workers receive only a quarter of the pay of whites and are restricted to menial positions.  Expenditure education on each white child in 1983 was £787; for each black child it was £95. Black children in the bantustans are 20 times more likely to die before the age of five than white children.  For every 10,000 whites there are 20 doctors; for every 10,000 blacks there is less than one doctor.</P>
    <P>Such a system, which is so inequitable, which destroys the entire rights to participate in their own country of the vast majority of its population obviously cannot sustain itself without massive repression.  South Africa is ruled, not by consent, but by force.  The Internal Security Act of 1982 gives the Minister for Law and Order the power to declare organisations illegal, to ban individuals, to ban meetings and gatherings, to ban newspapers and other publications, to hold people on indefinite preventive detention without charge or trial.  Since 1948, over 1,500 people have been banned; in 1960 the African National Congress was banned; in 1977 alone 18 black consciousness organisations were banned; 16,000 people were detained in 1960.  Since 1963 about 60 people have died in detention. One thousand people were killed in the <Col N="1435" /> 1976-77 student uprising.  In addition to that the black population of South Africa are subjected to forced removals on a most extraordinary scale.  Three-and-a-half million black South Africans have been forcibly removed since 1960.  A further 1.5 million removals are expected. The pass laws are part of the ritual of indignity that is imposed on the majority population in South Africa in the interest of sustaining the privilege of the few.  The black trade unions, grudgingly recognised, are still far from free to operate. Indeed, we will be referring again to the detention of some trade union leaders in recent times.  For instance, the black trade unions are legally forbidden from picketing or from incitement to strike &mdash; an extraordinary provision for a union that is supposed to be defending the interests of its members.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal more to say about South Africa, about land distribution where the population who are white, who represent less than 16 per cent of the population, occupy 85 per cent of the land, where any attempt at democratic participation is ruthlessly suppressed. There is, of course, a fashion in this country which suggests that we do not really know what is going on there.  People who have lived there or indeed, occasionally and tragically, sportsmen who have visited there have come back and told us that things have changed.  I have here in front of me a brief but remarkable and eloquent testament of what the reality of life in South Africa is.  I will identify the author at the end.</P>
    <P>Having worked in Soweto at the Baragwanath hospital for six months and at the King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban, both hospitals for non-Europeans, I had opportunity to meet many Africans, Indians and coloured.  I feel I can therefore refute the viewpoint of so many Europeans who visit South Africa that there has been substantial change in relation to the appalling plight of the Africans.  Europeans by and large live with luxury and certainly with privilege.  Africans live in poverty <Col N="1436" /> with little legal possibility of improving their dismal lot in the land of their forbears.</P>
    <P>In addition to poor housing, poor health, inferior opportunity, inferior education Africans also suffer from the attempts by the minority population to cast them in the role of inferior human beings.</P>
    <P>The problem of colour is a white man's problem.  If he is to expurgate his guilt before it is too late the whole apparatus of apartheid must be dismantled now.</P>
    <P>That statement is from another Member of this House, from Senator Robb, who cannot be here but whose personal experience of working as a medical doctor in South Africa he has asked me to put on the record of this House.  That in a very blunt and, in Senator Robb's characteristically honest way, describes the reality of life in South Africa very effectively.</P>
    <P>In the face of this apparatus of repression the majority population have endeavoured by many methods and many means to resist.  Every effort to develop resistance, whether it be non-violent, passive or violent has been equally and ruthlessly suppressed from the time of the massacre in Sharpeville 25 years ago, through the arrest and detention for the last 20 years of probably one of the great heroes of the twentieth century, Nelson Mandela, through the murder of Steve Biko in 1977, through small things in terms of world history but awful human tragedies like the assassination of the wife and child of Marius Schoon now a citizen of this country, thanks again to the good offices of the Government, on through the Soweto uprisings, on into South Africa's continued illegal, violent and cruel occupation of Namibia.  On every occasion ruthless force has been used to suppress all forms of dissent, all forms of criticism of the regime.</P>
    <P>There has been an increasingly effective and an increasingly active world campaign of pressure on South Africa. Because of this, because of the pressure from business organisations and because <Col N="1437" /> indeed from some pressure within the country there have been some attempts at reform.  This has been brought about not because of any goodwill but because of political pressure, economic pressure and indeed very effective sporting pressure, the pressure of a sporting boycott which has been enormously successful and needs and deserves to be sustained, expanded and made even more effective. Because of this there has been some window dressing reform, the most recent and the most vivid being the so-called <Col N="1438" /> constitutional reform which gave certain limited rights to certain groups excluding the majority black population.</P>
    <P>As a response to that attempt at constitutional reform the United Democratic Front was formed in 1983.  I want to read on to the record of the House the declaration of the United Democratic Front in South Africa, largely because it demonstrates the moderate tone, the moderate nature and the moderate objectives of the United Democratic Front.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Whereas democracy is the means by which the free will of the people is expressed in electing their chosen representatives to govern, in the processes through which they rule and in the allocation of resources for the benefit of all the people;</P>
    <P>and whereas, these truths are cherished by the whole of the civilised world and are goals for which women and men have given up their lives and are willing to die;</P>
    <P>and whereas, the constitutional reform proposals devised by the minority white government for South Africa, avoid recognition of these fundamental needs of democracy in that:</P>
    <P>&mdash; they have been imposed without genuine consultation with and active participation by the people of this country.</P>
    <P>&mdash; they make race and ethnicity the only criteria for the right to take part in government.</P>
    <P>&mdash; they do not begin to redress the intrinsic economic and social inequalities which have been the deliberate result of centuries of white domination.</P>
    <P>&mdash; they, in fact, perpetuate and consolidate economic and racial exploitation and entrench the apartheid state.</P>
    <P>and now therefore we, democrats assembled on this 23rd day of January, 1983, at the Selbourne Hall in Johannesburg, South Africa, do hereby unanimously:</P>
    <P>&mdash; reject in their totality and without qualification the constitutional and reform proposals</P>
    <P>&mdash; form ourselves into a united democratic front (UDF) to oppose the implementation of this devious scheme disguised to divide the people.</P>
    <P>We declare that the broad principles on which this (UDF) is constituted are:</P>
    <P>&mdash; A belief in the tenets of democracy referred to in the preamble</P>
    <P>&mdash; An unshakeable conviction in the creation of a non-racial, unitary state in South Africa undiluted by racial or ethnic considerations as formulated in the bantustan policy.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An adherence to the need for unity in struggle through which all democrats regardless of race, religion or colour, shall take part together.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A recognition of the necessity to work in consultation with, and reflect accurately the demands of, democratic people wherever they may be in progressive worker, community, and student organisations.</P>
    <P>We further undertake to work according to the following guidelines:</P>
    <P>&mdash; The mobilisation of our people for the rejection of these constitutional reform <Col N="1439" /> proposals should complement and reinforce the ongoing day to day struggles on basic issues which face workers, communities and students.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A firm acceptance of the existence of dangers at the local council level in the proposals which entail the retention of the Group Areas Act, maintenance of racially exclusive local areas, concentration of control in favour of the rich and exacerbation of poverty.</P>
    <P>&mdash; An acknowledgment of the threat to the attainment of decent living standards by the African majority by these proposals which would facilitate forced removals, aggravate impoverishment in the bantustans and allow the continued escalation in rents, transport costs and food prices.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A clear understanding of the utter failure of these proposals to address the problems of rising unemployment, low wages, poor working conditions and weakened collective bargaining powers.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A true appreciation of the inability of the reform proposals to restructure and redirect education in this country to conform to the demands of democracy.  In fact they maintain and consolidate racially separated and unequal education.</P>
    <P>and now therefore</P>
    <P>We pledge to fight together side by side against the government's constitutional and reform proposals.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the House that they are remarkably moderate in their tone and represent nothing more than the commitment of democrats to democratic government in their own country.</P>
    <P>The UDF campaigned with extraordinary success in the election in South Africa last year, the so-called elections. They were so successful that they achieved massive boycotts among the so-called Indian and so-called coloured populations, boycotts arguably of the order of between 80 and 85 per cent by those populations, boycotts which totally undermined any credibility which this further extension of racialism in South Africa could perhaps have had.  The response of the South African racist regime has been, as always in their history, to launch a vicious campaign against this further attempt to bring about change in South Africa by arrests, detentions and spurious charges of high treason. Among the people arrested are the treasurer of the UDF, the leader of the UDF, the President of the South African Allied Workers Union, the chairman of the Natal Release Mandela Committee and the President of the Transvaal Indian Council, a leader of the South African Allied Workers Union and so on.  Sixteen people among that group who were <Col N="1440" /> arrested have been charged with high treason.</P>
    <P>There is something painfully ironic about people who have no right to participate in their own country's activities or their own country's processes of government being charged with high treason within that country.  There is something particularly offensive about it even by, I would suggest, South African standards. The response of the national executive committee of the United Democratic Front to those arrests and charges and their analysis bears repetition because they, better than I or anybody in this country, reflect the reality of what is going on in South Africa;</P>
    <P>The treason trial is a means of reducing the efficiency of the UDF.  The State is only prepared to accommodate the UDF as a weak organisation whose existence can be exploited by State propaganda agents as a sign that it is democratic and allows for public opposition.</P>
    <P>That the State is avoiding overtly repressive measures, such as banning and restriction orders but instead criminalises anti-apartheid activists to give the international community a false impression that only law breakers are punished.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> There the detention of UDF leaders is intended to create an opportunity to build credibility for the unpopular Bantustan leaders;</P>
    <P>That this trial will be further used to smear the UDF as a subversive and violent organisation;</P>
    <P>That the arbitrary arrests together with mysterious violent attacks on the homes of UDF members are intended to intimidate people from associating with the UDF.</P>
    <P>Finally, because the UDF have already pronounced against participation in the State President's informal forum there is a concerted effort to smash the front in advance so that it cannot actively campaign against this sham forum.</P>
    <P>They are not my views; they are not the views of anybody in this country; they are the views of South Africans themselves facing up to the realities of their Government's repressive politics.</P>
    <P>Having arrested, detained and charged the leaders of the latest in a succession of attempts to bring about change, the South African regime revealed itself again last week.  Even moderately minded people &mdash; people perhaps a bit unhappy about some of the language some of us might use about South Africa &mdash; were appalled by what happened last week in Langa.  I want to quote briefly from <i>The Observer</i> of Sunday, 4 March, 1985, describing what happened in that massacre at Langa.  There was a march which was intended to be a funeral of a student who had died in a violent confrontation. That march took place because a motorised procession was stopped by the police.  That march was confronted by a police-carrying vehicle. I want to quote what people on the spot said in sworn affidavits presented to members of the parliamentary opposition in South Africa:</P>
    <P>As the column of people approached the &ldquo;hippo&rdquo;, a shot rang out and the boy on the bicycle fell dead, his head burst open by a rifle bullet.</P>
    <P>The witnesses insist there was no order to stop and that no warning shot <Col N="1442" /> was fired.  The first warning they had was when they saw the cyclist shot.</P>
    <P>A second later volleys of gunfire rang out from both the &ldquo;Hippos&rdquo; parked on top of the rise and the other vehicle which had driven up behind the procession. The people were caught in a withering crossfire.  I turned and ran, says one man who was walking near where the cyclist fell.  Everybody ran.</P>
    <P>Other affidavits gathered by the MPs gave similar accounts of the shooting. All said there was more than one volley fired and that the shooting continued after the people fled.  The conclusion must be reached that the action was punitive and not preventative, says Errol Moorcroft, who has prepared the MPs report from the affidavits.  Moorcroft adds in his report that the MPs examined the scene of the shooting and could find no evidence to suggest that the police vehicle had been surrounded or attacked.</P>
    <P>There were no burn marks to indicate that petrol bombs had been thrown.  Although a fire engine had been used to hose the blood from the road, there were still many traces of it and these indicated that the people were about 20 yards from the top of the rise where the Caspir was parked when they were shot.</P>
    <P>There were no blood marks beyond the truck itself which one might have expected if the police had fired on a crowd that was surrounding and attacking them from all sides, Moorcroft notes.</P>
    <P>If that was not enough, about the same time in the same area in Uitenhage, two members of a brave predominantly white organisation called the Black Sash who campaign for equal rights for black South Africans, happened to visit the police station in Uitenhage.  They went into a room they were not intended to be in.  What they saw inside the room was horrific; a burly black policeman was standing over a black youth, flogging him savagely with a leather lash known as a sjambok.  The young man was lying on <Col N="1443" /> his side with his hands manacled to a table leg.  There was blood trickling from a gash in his head, his wrists were lacerated from the steel manacles and his face was badly swollen.</P>
    <P>Along one wall, three other young black prisoners were sitting on a bench. One of them also had a badly swollen face.  But what above all else appalled the two civil rights workers ... was the attitude of the other policemen in the room.</P>
    <P>One was sitting at a table eating his lunch, while the others sat around casually observing the scene.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of life in South Africa today, of policemen who apparently can ignore savagery in their own presence and continue eating their lunch.</P>
    <P>That is the context in which the continuing detention of somebody I described earlier as probably one of the great heroes of the twentieth century, Nelson Mandela, continues.  This man was locked up 20 years ago because of his alleged high treason in a country in which he had no rights.  As recently as last month he was offered conditional freedom. With that extraordinary unbroken spirit that he has shown for 20 years he refused.  He is, as an opinion poll showed, the acknowledged leader of the vast majority of black South Africans. There was an opinion poll conducted and close to 75 per cent of black South Africans identified Nelson Mandela as the person they recognised as the leader of black South Africa.  He is there for 20 years.  He is the acknowledged leader of his people and the authorities are apparently afraid even now to release a man who is admittedly an old man but who is also an extraordinarily brave man.</P>
    <P>At this stage in this country and in the world at large we do not have a choice about whether or not South Africa will change.  We can sit back and watch the change be achieved inevitably and with awful violence or we can increase economic, political, cultural and other pressure and hope to minimise the need for violence and to achieve change by other <Col N="1444" /> means.  We can temporarise and rationalise. I do not think we in this country can be accused of indifference but there are areas where we need to improve our campaigning and our conviction.  The basic issue for the western world generally is whether we temporarise, rationalise and ensure that when change comes, as it will inevitably, it will be violent, bloody and savage.  A people who have suffered so much cannot wait any longer.  On the evidence we have had in recent years, the fear of repression will not suppress that people any longer.  I do not think they will capitulate and bend again before repression.  Because they have suffered so much, they will tolerate it no longer. In spite of the repression a new generation of leaders has surfaced.  It would appear, irrespective of the activities of the security forces, irrespective of the murders of people like Steve Biko, new leaders surface, among the most obvious being Bishop Tutu.  The old leaders seem to survive with their spirit intact as evidenced by the courage of Nelson Mandela. There seems to be a new spirit of resistance among the majority population of South Africa which reflects the spirit that the authorities have attempted to break every five years for the last 25 years. There seems to be a new courage abroad.</P>
    <P>What we must do is to increase our actions and activities.  In trade, we have to think about ending imports from South Africa and exports to South Africa either indirectly or directly from companies working in this country, some of them multinational, some of them regarded as major employers.  We are getting to the position now where the fundamental moral question of the nature of South African racist policy is such that the fact that certain companies in this country do business with South Africa must be a major concern to us and to the Government.  Many of us would need to do more about the bravery of those ten people who have taken a stand for their conscience in Dunnes' Stores in Henry Street, Dublin.</P>

      <P>We must continue to challenge the Irish-based companies which are involved with South Africa. There are suggestions that Irish companies are indirectly conspiring to participate in the arms trade in South Africa. Everything must be done to dissuade the Irish Rugby Football Union from any further contacts with the racist regime in South Africa.  We must look towards trade boycotts and at the general campaign in this area, because whatever our merits in the past, our position must be strengthened heavily.  This is a moral issue.  The choice is not about change, or no change: it is about possible routes to inevitable change.  We can minimise the agony of black South Africians now by, if possible, encouraging non-violent change.  If the just war doctrine as articulated by my Church has any meaning, armed resistance is justified in South Africa in the context of that just war doctrine.  It may well still be possible to avoid that.</P>
      <P>I should like to conclude by reading from a rock song by Peter Gabriel.  This song is in memory of Steve Biko.  I will read one verse:</P>

      <P>But you can't blow out a fire,</P>
      <P>Once the flame begins to catch</P>
      <P>The wind will blow it higher.</P>
      <P>The wind is blowing in South Africa: we can prevent the flames taking over and play our part in a contribution to non-violent change.  Without non-violent change the flames will take over and the change will still be inevitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening's debate takes place at a time when world attention is once again focused on South Africa, this time because of the shocking events of last week.  On Thursday last, on a hill <Col N="1446" /> between the township of Langa and the suburb of Uitenhage in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa, South African police killed 19 mourners on their way to a funeral.  The names of Langa and Uitenhage thus join those of Sharpeville, Soweto and so many others in the catalogue of oppression of the black population of South Africa in the name of apartheid.</P>
      <P>The Uitenhage killings have been widely and rightly condemned by governments and by the United Nations Security Council.  The universal shock which they caused was due not only to the large number of people killed but also to the fact that they occurred on the 25th anniversary of Sharpeville Day.  On behalf of our own Government and people, I have already expressed our abhorrence at and condemnation of this outrage.  I welcome the opportunity provided by this motion to repeat my condemnation, to restate the policy of the Government in our opposition to apartheid; and to announce further measures which we are taking to help bring about an end to this system.</P>
      <P>It is a reflection of the state of South African society that the killings fitted into a pattern in which over 240 people have been killed since last summer when the South African authorities sharply increased their already high level repression of political opposition.  By the end of 1984, in addition to the numbers killed and injured, twice as many people had been detained as in 1983; many hundreds had been arrested and numerous meetings had been banned or restricted.</P>
      <P>Attempts to suppress opposition to apartheid have been stepped up in parallel with the growth of organised opposition to the system.  Throughout 1984 the level of this opposition was demonstrated by:</P>
      <P>a schools boycott by hundreds of thousands of students protesting against inequities in the education system;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>demonstrations against rent increases imposed by local councils which are seen as mere tools of the government; <Col N="1447" /> a two-day stayaway from work by over one million workers protesting at rent increases, demanding the withdrawal of the armed forces and police from black townships and calling for the release of political prisoners;</P>
    <P>the extremely low turnout in the elections in August for the coloured and Indian chambers of the racially segregated Parliament.</P>
    <P>A feature of all the demonstrations of opposition which I have mentioned is that they have been met with violence by the South African authorities.  This violence is itself directly responsible for the deaths of large numbers of people as last week's events clearly demonstrate.  However, it has the additional effect of building on and increasing the frustration already felt by blacks because of the denial of their political and human rights and the lack of adequate political means to obtain redress for their grievances.  In turn, this frustration has flared into destructive violence and killings in the townships.</P>
    <P>The violence in the townships underlies the alienation of South Africa's black population caused by the apartheid system.  It is idle for the South African Government to claim, as they do, that they have embarked on a process of reform of the system when what is required is its complete abolition.  One cannot merely reform a system which, purely on the grounds of race, excludes men and women from meaningful participation in the political affairs of their country.  Nor can one merely reform a system which, again on racial grounds, denies them access to the basic facilities provided to others in the same society. This is the reality of apartheid.</P>
    <P>To take a few examples:</P>
    <P>the South African Government spend on the education of each black child from one-tenth to one-eighth of the amount they spend on the education of his white compatriot;</P>
    <P>a black South African child has, because of discrimination against his <Col N="1448" /> race, poorer access to doctors, hospitals and other medical facilities than does a white child;</P>
    <P>a black child has more limited access to basic nutrition, Recent studies have shown that in parts of South Africa, black children suffer the effects of malnutrition which would be expected only in poorer economies.</P>
    <P>It is idle to claim, as South Africa does, that its black citizens enjoy better living conditions than do many others in Africa. That is to miss the point that South Africa is the richest of the non-oil-exporting states in Africa; that it has the resources to treat all its citizens equally; that it chooses to discriminate against some sections of its population in order to favour others; and that it chooses to exercise this discrimination on the basis of race.  The system which perpetuates these inequities must not be reformed: it must be abolished.</P>
    <P>The need to abolish it becomes even more imperative when we examine the so-called reforms proposed by the South African Government.  In no way do these proposals put right the wrongs of apartheid. Nor do they address the legitimate political expectations of the majority of South Africa's population.  Indeed, the changes being made can be seen as reformulating and entrenching apartheid rather than reforming it.  The new constitution adopted by white South Africans continues to exclude the black community from parliamentary representation and gives to coloureds and Asians only a very circumscribed franchise.  Limited relaxations in the laws of tenure as applied to some black South Africans are offset by the forced removals of others from the homes they have enjoyed for generations.  The removal of the displaced black communities to the so-called bantustans creates further pressures on these lands which comprise only a small fraction of the land of South Africa and which are unable to support the large numbers of people assigned to them.</P>
    <P>The opposition to all aspects of apartheid including the new constitution has been led by the independent trade union <Col N="1449" /> movement and by the United Democratic Front.  It is the success of these organisations over the past year in mobilising peaceful protest which has led to their continued harassment by the authorities. Their premises have been raided, their leaders have been arrested and detained and many now face charges of high treason. This use of the judicial process appears to be a further attempt by the South African Government to stifle all opposition to its policies.  In addition to the concern we feel for those who face charges, we must also fear that the repression of peaceful protest will lead to the further alienation of the black community and to more violence.  For these reasons and for their principled stand against the apartheid sytem, those who now face trial must receive our full support.</P>
    <P>This country's concern at the continuation of apartheid is founded not only on our abhorrence of a system of institutionalised racial discrimination and on our concern at the denial of human rights to South Africa's people.  It is also based on the fact that apartheid and South Africa's aggressive defence of its system lie at the root of many of the problems of Southern Africa.  It is part of this country's foreign policy to address these problems and to assist in solving some of them through political persuasion and through our support for economic and social development. Our policy covers not only opposition to apartheid but also support for the independence of Namibia and for the general development of the region.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports the economic and social development of the Southern African region through bilateral aid to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Lesotho, the last two countries being priority targets for Irish aid.  We also support the work of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference, which aims to further the development of Southern African countries and to lessen their dependence on South Africa.  Our support is dictated not only by the needs of the area but also by the recognition that South Africa pursues a policy of economic and military destabilisation against <Col N="1450" /> its neighbours and that outside support for them is, therefore, all the more necessary.</P>
    <P>On Namibia, we condemn the illegal occupation of that country by South Africa and strongly support its early accession to independence in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 435.  In the event of the implementation of Resolution 435, we are prepared to participate in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group which will supervise the country's first elections.</P>
    <P>On apartheid, the Government support the peaceful ending of the system in the following ways:</P>
    <P>(i)  we regularly and strongly condemn apartheid in international fora;</P>
    <P>(ii)  we support sanctions against South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Government support and implement the arms embargo against South Africa in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 418 and 558.</P>
    <P>We also support the imposition by the Security Council of effective mandatory sanctions on South Africa and we co-sponsored a resolution to that effect at the last session of the UN General Assembly.</P>
    <P>We do not encourage trade with South Africa and we actively discourage sporting contacts;</P>
    <P>(iii)  we support the code of conduct for the subsidiaries of EEC companies operating in South Africa.  The code seeks to alleviate some of the features of apartheid in the workplace;</P>
    <P>(iv)  we provide assistance to victims of apartheid bilaterally and through the United Nations;</P>
    <P>(v)  we strive to maintain in Ireland a climate which is inimical to the idea of apartheid.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances it is particularly appropriate for me to concentrate on our assistance to the victims of apartheid. We have accepted that such aid <Col N="1451" /> should be included in our programme of development co-operation and we contribute to the United Nations funds which channel our assistance to those in need. In 1985, our assistance to the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and to the United Nations Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa will amount to £50,000.</P>
    <P>I have also been considering for some time how we might best expand the assistance we give to those who suffer under apartheid.  Together with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I have already expanded the remit of part of our bilateral aid programme so that non-governmental organisations in South Africa, working for the benefit of those discriminated against by apartheid, can qualify for assistance from our programme of co-financing for non-governmental organisations.  The first grant under this heading has already been approved for payment.</P>
    <P>Under the same part of the bilateral aid programme and in response to a request for assistance which Bishop Tutu put to me during his visit to Ireland last year, my Department will explore with the South African Council of Churches the co-financing of development projects organised by the SACC to assist the victims of apartheid.  As soon as it has been determined which projects we might co-finance, a further announcement will be made.</P>
    <P>At this time when our attention is focused on the forthcoming trial of political opponents of apartheid, it is right that I should announce our practical support for those on trial.  I propose to provide grants to two funds which help to provide legal defence in political trials in South Africa and Namibia.  The first of these is the International Defence and Aid Fund whose objectives are:</P>
    <P>to aid, defend and rehabilitate the victims of unjust legislation and oppressive and arbitrary procedures in South Africa;</P>
    <P>to support their families and dependants;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> to keep the conscience of the world alive to the issues at stake.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that annual conferences of the IDAF were held in Dublin in 1975 and 1983 and on the latter occasion I met the delegates and learned of their work at first hand.  I am pleased to announce that a sum of £10,000 will be granted to the International Defence and Aid Fund from the bilateral aid programme this year and also that the Government will continue to support the work of the fund in future years.</P>
    <P>The second fund which I have decided to support is the Asingeni Fund of the South African Council of Churches.  The aims of this fund are similar to those of the IDAF and I have approved a grant of £4,000 for its work.</P>
    <P>Some of the victims of apartheid and of other South African policies now reside outside the country as refugees.  Ireland has, over the years, received a number of these for training in economic and social development under the auspices of programmes run by international organisations, particularly the International Labour Organisation.  The bilateral aid programme will, in conjunction with the Department of Labour, consider expanding our co-operation with the ILO with a view to participating in that organisation's programme against apartheid.</P>
    <P>Many South African and Namibian refugees are settled in Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho, which, as Senators know, are target countries for Irish bilateral aid. In the development of our programmes of assistance to these countries, my Department will investigate the possibilities of including projects specifically designed to assist some of these refugees.</P>
    <P>In order to complete the picture of Irish assistance to the victims of South Africa's policies, I should like to mention our assistance to Namibia.  Our 1985 contribution to the United Nations Fund for Namibia is £21,000.  We shall also continue to receive for training fellowship holders sponsored by international organisations and, in addition, we have offered two fellowships for third level training to candidates sponsored by the <Col N="1453" /> South-West Africa People's Organisation.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain pressure for the abolition of apartheid, Ireland contributes to the United Nations Fund for Publicity against Apartheid.  As I have already said, it is also one of the aims of Government policy that we maintain a climate in Ireland which is inimical to the idea of apartheid.  In order that Irish people should become even more aware of the reality of apartheid, I have decided that it is a subject which ought to feature in my Department's programme of development education.  This programme is run jointly with Irish non-governmental organisations and my Department will consider for inclusion projects submitted by them on the subject of apartheid.</P>
    <P>Apartheid will not be easily ended.  We can expect it to be abolished only when the white minority in South Africa come to understand that their future and wellbeing is inextricably linked with that of all others in their country.  Any such realisation will be forced on them only by a combination of increased difficulties in maintaining the present system in the face of black expectations and by sustained international pressure to replace it with a system which guarantees justice and equality to all South Africans.</P>
    <P>The longer the delay in creating a just society in South Africa the more will we see incidents like that in Uitenhage. Shocking and distressing as they are, such incidents will not stop the march to equality of people who are prepared to make every sacrifice to achieve their rights.</P>
    <P>Our support is needed in their struggle for equality.  I have outlined this evening the support which we are presently providing through political pressure and also through practical assistance to those opposed to apartheid.  I have also outlined the further steps, such as effective sanctions, which we hope the international community will adopt.  And finally, I have indicated the direction in which our practical support for opponents of apartheid will be developed.</P>
    <P>In demonstrations yesterday, South Africans of all races showed yet again <Col N="1454" /> that they are prepared to make sacrifices in order to achieve justice and equality of treatment.  On behalf of the Government, I reaffirm our support for their struggle to create a free, just and equal society which can be enjoyed in peace by all in South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much pleasure in supporting this resolution.  I have listened with great interest to the two speeches that have already been made.  I sometimes find when I criticise the regime in South Africa that people are inclined to say perhaps it is not the worst regime; perhaps worse things are happening in the USSR or Chile or the Philipines or somewhere where things are bad at that particular time.  Many people do not appreciate the unique difference between what is happening in South Africa and what is happening anywhere else in the world, no matter how bad the regime may be in these other places.  The governments in all these countries oppress those who oppose them politically or militarily or who appear to be in some way a threat but in a sense, the people who are oppressed have an option: if they stop opposing the regime, they stand some chance of no longer being oppressed.  In South Africa the position is completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blacks in South Africa are discriminated against and oppressed merely because of the colour of their skin.  No matter what they say or do, because they are blacks they are, for that very reason, the subject of oppression and of injustice. In that way it is a completely different case from any other oppression of any kind throughout the world.  That is what is so utterly reprehensible in South Africa, which is characteristic of the position in South Africa at the moment.  It is that which makes the regime there a class apart and the most odious regime in the world today.  Only in the Nazi regime 40 years ago in Germany did we have anything similar to it.  That again was a similar situation.  The Nazi regime singled out the Jews who suffered similar treatment, again not because they were opposing the German Government, not <Col N="1455" /> because they were doing anything in particular but merely because they were Jews.  They were oppressed because of that; they were discriminated against and ultimately something of the order of six million of them were murdered.  They had no options.  It was not anything they were doing wrong; they were wiped out because they were not members of the master race and consequently could not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>It is only in these two cases that there is the same kind of approach.  Certainly, what happened in Germany at that time has shocked and shamed the conscience of the world and what is happening in South Africa at the present time is of the same order.  There is no doubt whatever that this oppression and injustice in South Africa is continuing at the present time not merely as bad as it was but in many ways worse.  Again and again, people try to persuade us that things are not really as bad as we think, that we are misled by propaganda and so on.  We know that the United Nations have again and again condemned what is happening in South Africa and have condemned it by huge majorities.  Usually the condemnation is unanimous; sometimes there are a few abstensions but in most cases these condemnations are of the order of 150 to nil. I regret to say that the UK and the US on a number of occasions have been the only countries which have refused to condemn the situation in South Africa.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that, in spite of this widespread condemnation which has been expressed again and again in the United Nations, the regime in South Africa can continue with their evil ways. It can only happen because in spite of these votes of condemnation some of the big powers are less than enthusiastic in implementing sanctions and so on.  They are less than enthusiastic in using their muscle to try to achieve some reform of the position in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Of course I have to say also that many people, particularly some people in this country, some of our sportsmen and businessmen, are less than helpful by their association with the regime.  I find it very <Col N="1456" /> difficult to believe that any person, sportsman, businessman or anybody else who really understood the magnitude of this problem, the injustice of it could continue to associate with this regime because by associating with it they certainly give encouragement to apartheid. This association on their part boosts the morale of the South African people and in effect tells them that we have no real objection to apartheid, that we are quite happy to associate with them in spite of that.  That is what these people do who go to play games in South Africa or associate in other ways.  The excuse usually given by those who go there is that they are building bridges, that when they meet South Africans they talk to them and try to persuade them to see the error of their ways and to persuade them to modify apartheid.</P>
    <P>This is a completely useless approach to the subject.  The South Africans are fully aware of the error of their ways. They have not the faintest intention of changing and they use these visits by people who are perhaps sometimes well-intentioned merely to prove the acceptability of South Africa and to show that people are more and more playing games with them or associating with them in one way or another.</P>
    <P>South Africa has been trying to give the impression recently that they are introducing reforms of one kind or another.  Of course, anybody who examines the position realises that this is merely window dressing.  The black citizen &mdash; and it is hard to call him a citizen &mdash; has really none of the rights of a citizen; he has no vote; there is restriction on the type of job he does and consequently restriction on the amount of money he earns; there is restriction on the area in which he can work and notorious pass laws are part of that system.  There is restriction on having his family to live in the same area as he works.  There are so many restrictions on liberty, on having meetings that he is circumscribed in every single way.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that far from there being an easing of the position in regard to detentions, in 1984 there were <Col N="1457" /> twice as many detentions as there were in the previous year.  Political trials seem to be more numerous than ever.  I suppose in a sense people who are sent for trial could be regarded as lucky because usually they are merely detained without being tried at all.  It is hard to say which is the worse situation to be in.  Certainly those who are sent for trial are usually sent on the most nebulous charges, on charges of something which is called perhaps public violence which really means that they merely took part in some kind of a peaceful protest.  Most convictions when they do take place are on statements which they made while in detention.</P>
    <P>Political activity generally is so restricted as to be almost useless even within the permissable areas of political progress and, of course, they are very, very limited indeed.  However, in spite of how little they can do, we cannot but be full of admiration and respect for those people who continue to do their best, who continue to stand up for their rights, stand up for their liberties and, if necessary, fight for them in spite of the immense difficulties and the immense repression and injustice which surround them on every side.  We must be full of admiration for the efforts they make to free themselves from this odious tyranny in which they live.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in this country to do everything that lies in our power to help the oppressed people of South Africa. There is not much we can do, unfortunately, but certainly anything we can do we should do.  In international polities this Government and previous Governments have done everything they could to make their position clear.  They have taken part in resolutions and supported most of them and made quite clear what we think of apartheid.  The Government of the day, the Members of this House, every citizen in every way no matter how small the effort may be must do their best to lessen the effectiveness. to lessen the inhumanity of the South African regime.  We must condemn it; we must undermine it; we must ostracise all those concerned with it and, hopefully, <Col N="1458" /> this in the long run will bring it to an end. As I say, we cannot do much but that makes it all the more necessary that we do everything that lies in our power to help in the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like on behalf of the Labour group to support this resolution which is in the name of all the groups and individuals represented in Seanad Éireann.  I would like to re-emphasise the point made by Senator Brendan Ryan that this is one of those occasions on which there is a consensus among all shades of opinion in Ireland on a matter of foreign policy.  I would like to bring the debate just a little bit further. Before I do so I would like to welcome all the new initiatives the Minister has announced in relation to the two dimensions of continuing our opposition to apartheid as a principle, opposition to the South African apartheid State and, secondly, the new measures which are gestures of solidarity with those who are victims of oppression in apartheid.  When such consensus exists it behoves us to use our time effectively in posing questions as to the effectiveness of our policies directed against apartheid in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take up a point that the previous speaker made.  I very much endorse the comments that Senator Eoin Ryan made about the importance of our sustaining our opposition and undermining the South African State.  I want to raise a number of questions.  In many ways there is more at stake than the tragic deaths of the people who have most recently died.  There is our whole commitment in relation to principles of international law and principles of human rights and principles of freedom are called into question.  I am very convinced always by those who trace in the evolution of human rights a certain common human response.  After the horror of the camps in World War II it was felt that humanity had sunk to a particularly low level and thus people spoke of the concept of crimes against humanity and the human rights movement in a way <Col N="1459" /> received an impetus from the circumstances of the camps and the evidence which was revealed at the end of the war. Indeed, many people writing about it in the history of law write about the effect which the sight of those who came from the camps had on them.  Yet the television service provides us with evidence every day of the effects of apartheid.</P>
    <P>One must ask the question as to what kind of thinking and what kind of politics makes it possible to allow this schizophrenic view to prevail.  In our hearts we seem to condemn apartheid in principle and its obvious horrific consequences and yet, at the same time, South Africa has continued apartheid despite more than 100 United Nations resolutions condemning it as a system of practices, and despite its being condemned as a crime against humanity.  The answer lies in our view of the division between what we would call politics and economics.  There is the view in this country, as Senator Eoin Ryan has acknowledged &mdash; among business people for example &mdash; that you can divide politics and economics and that you can, for example, accept that people in a chamber like this can condemn apartheid but that we let economic relations roll on, let business connections continue.  Admittedly, there is official condemnation of these contacts, yet the contacts continue. Equally, there is the notion, particularly among sporting and cultural organisations, that they can separate their activities from politics.  Because of such a schizoid view and the consequences for those who hold it &mdash; and our own backwardness politically is partly attributable to such views &mdash; and because of the lack of an integrated view of the world, there is the danger that it establishes a conversational dialogue with apartheid that seeks to keep it in existence.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever that in terms of international affairs generally the situation has worsened because of the consequences of apartheid and the opposition to it, has worsened, more accurately, because of the foreign policies of Britain and the United States particularly under the regimes of Mrs. <Col N="1460" /> Thatcher and President Regan respectively. In December 1979 Mrs. Thatcher said &ldquo;There is now real prospect that the conflicts of South Africa's borders in Rhodesia and Namibia will shortly be ended.&rdquo;  She said: &ldquo;This, combined with welcome initiatives in South Africa's domestic policies, offer a chance to defuse a regional crisis which was potentially of the utmost gravity and to make progress towards the ending of the isolation of South Africa in world affairs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That view might be regarded as indicative of the naivety and ignorance which characterise Mrs. Thatcher's views of the world generally or her over-simplification of the world which enables her to live with her particular version of &ldquo;the world according to Margaret&rdquo;.  It is much more serious than that because it is undermining the position taken by the United Nations.  I question the credibility of British foreign policy in the whole area of South Africa.  I feel that both the United States and Britain under their present leaderships have undermined the credibility of the United Nations in relation to the condemnations of apartheid not only by their covert collusion with the economics of apartheid which sustained it but also because of their erosion of the principle and the letter of one United Nations resolution after another.  It is very necessary for us to be clear and not to have a romantic notion that white South Africa will suddenly change its mind and its heart and be moved to accord rights to those whom it has excluded for some time.</P>
    <P>Apartheid is based above all else on the principle of exploitation.  To place it accurately in its historic origin one must accept the history of a racism of this kind in exactly the same way, for example, as one accepts that historically there are minor versions of it where people twist the conception of the other person into a hate figure on the basis of some characteristics. For example, in the 19th century Irish migrant labourers were regarded by cartoonists and by people in Britain as ape-like figures.  A long tradition of hatred runs from the journals of the 19th century to the London <i>Evening Standard</i><Col N="1461" /> of today.  Unfortunately, racism is sustained and obdurate before our eyes on television.</P>
    <P>The twisting of the characteristics of people so as to deny them rights has an accompanying economics.  The structure of the South African economy is internally exploitative.  The point has already been made by Senator Brendan Ryan that the monopoly of land and of resources exercised by a tiny proportion of the population of whites is at the base of the apartheid system in South Africa.  We must remember that the western world and countries within the European Community have not only allowed that system to continue but have traded arms with South Africa and have given the gift of nuclear capacity to South Africa in return for uranium.  Therefore, we must question again the credibility of those people who purport to be following United Nations' decisions, conventions and commitments.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I would differ from the Minister and that is on the question of the code of conduct.  The code of conduct at the level of the European Community is little less than a farce. There are no sanctions for its breach and there is a lessening rather than an expansion of condemnations of breaches where they emerge.  In this regard we must ask ourselves questions in what I would hope would be a regular review of our position in regard to apartheid.  I make the case for a regular rather than a repetition of the same kind of motion as to the progress we are making, first, at the level of the United Nations, secondly, at the level of the European Community and, thirdly, in relation to our unilateral opposition towards apartheid.  It is very important that we should not be moved only by the more dramatic events.  I join with the Minister and the other speakers who have condemned the more recent killings on the 25th anniversary of Sharpeville but we must question the structure that is the apartheid state and its consequences.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear people speak about the violence that has been directed against the most recent victims.  There again the challenge is to recognise what <Col N="1462" /> consequences flow from a racist state when the whole apparatus of the state, including its measures of control and repression, have been amplified with the assistance of the western world and when, in fact, armaments have been provided and, as I said, nuclear capacity has been provided.  This causes us to consider &mdash; rather like the people at the end of the Second World War who were silent and who had to be moved by the opening of the camps &mdash; that we may be involved in a far more dangerous situation which may undermine the principles of foreign policy itself.  We say something and yet live with another reality.  South Africa has survived long after 100 United Nations resolutions have been passed. There has survived, for example, a covert and sinister collusion for a long time in the matter of investment capital from Great Britain, particularly in the service and financial sectors.  We used to have the contradiction of political statements from the political masters in Great Britain and the economic statements from British companies.  We are now in a more dangerous position with regard to the economic reality.  The kind of people who are trucking with the monster that is the apartheid state are now beginning to influence the political statements.  There has been little less than regression.  It is important to place that on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>The decision to collude with racism is one of the prime achievements of Mrs. Thatcher's and President Regan's administrations foreign policy.  It has a very important dimension for both of them. They will be remembered for it and they should be remembered for it because they are the people who have brought it about. They have adjusted their political positions to suit economic breaches of one United Nations convention after another.  In 1980 the European Economic Community accounted for 57 per cent of South Africa's foreign liabilities and North and South America accounted for 24 per cent of their liabilities.  I mentioned earlier that, for example, 62 per cent of the total assets of South Africa's top 20 banks belong primarily to foreign banks. <Col N="1463" /> I mentioned the service sector.  South Africa has survived and developed, and the gaps between black earnings and white earnings have all been made possible by the continued links which have been allowed to exist between the western world and the South African apartheid state.  I mentioned the enormity, given a state that so systematically on the basis of colour excludes, denies participation, discriminates against the majority of its citizens, the enormity in moral terms of that state evolving to being a nuclear power on the basis of a barter of the means of death, in one case uranium, in the other case nuclear technology, between the western world and South Africa.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to raise the question that has been correctly addressed by the Minister and by every speaker including those who moved this motion.  In 1966 the United Nations General Assembly revoked South Africa's mandate in Namibia, formerly South West Africa, and in 1971 the International Court of Justice ruled South Africa was under obligation to withdraw from Namibia immediately and that member states were under obligation to recognise the illegality of South Africa's presence there.  That was in 1971.  The International Court of Justice &mdash; when Mrs. Kirkpatrick wants to mock it she calls it the United Nations Court of Justice &mdash; 14 years ago resolved as I have quoted.  South Africa occupies Namibia with the support and connivance of the multinationals.  In all of that there are tragic consequences but there is the mockery of international law and the mockery of all the international institutions that are involved.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Irish diplomats who worked abroad, particularly former Ambassador Noel Dorr, whom I recall on more than one occasion speaking passionately in support of Ireland's condemnation of apartheid.  I hope that we would regularly see an all-party motion of this kind that would not only demonstrate consensus in condemnation of apartheid but would be a regular <Col N="1464" /> review of our achievements in relation to a common aim in foreign policy.  This debate points to the fact of the disadvantage we are at in both Houses of the Oireachtas in not having a Foreign Relations Committee which could regularly review the achievements towards what is now a common policy.</P>

      <P>I am proud to be a patron of the anti-apartheid movement but I would like to place on the record of the House my gratitude, as a legislator, for the regular submissions we have received from the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement and to applaud the leadership they have given in opposing racism.  I hope our debate here on apartheid, which is the surviving blemish on the face of mankind by any standard, would be something through which every child in school, as the Minister mentioned, through his development programme, would learn that in the eighties mankind has had this blemish put on it by the fact that people want to play their games separate from the realities of racism, want to say that sport and business should be kept separate from politics.  I endorse Senator E. Ryan and Senator B. Ryan and all the other Senators who asked the Irish Rugby Football Union to give as much attention to politics as to the games that they are playing and to sit back and ask how they can argue that sport is separate from politics when the provision for white sport in South Africa is 60 times greater than it is for blacks who want a sporting provision.  I would ask whether it is more important for them to keep their links intact within the sporting fraternity or, as all of us would hope and as every speaker on both sides of the House has said, not to condemn apartheid but to undo it and to replace it by a proper system in Southern Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to join in this debate on behalf of the Fine Gael Group in the Seanad.  When debating a question such as apartheid it is difficult <Col N="1465" /> to known how much one should say.  It is a subject on which one can merely restate one's basic condemnation.  It is a subject on which one could talk for quite a period citing all the details of apartheid which affects every area of life for the majority of the inhabitants of South Africa. However, Standing Orders decree that we are limited in time so I merely want to join in what has been said on behalf of the other groups and to underline some points that have been made in this debate and which are of importance.</P>
      <P>I would like first to echo something Senator Michael Higgins has said.  The most important thing is not so much to deplore individual incidents, horrific though they are, and appalling as they have been and the incident last week was indeed particularly appalling &mdash; but what we want to do is concentrate our attack on the system itself and discuss not the number of these incidents or how the violence of these incidents can be reduced, but the means by which the whole system can be destroyed.  People such as those speaking here this evening are often asked why do they single out apartheid?  Why do they tend to concentrate on what is happening in South Africa when there is a violation of human rights in so many countries in the world. I hope all of us are concerned to condemn the violation of human rights wherever it occurs.  But we have a particular duty to condemn it in South Africa because of its nature there.  Senator Eoin Ryan suggested that a person in South Africa who is not classified as white is born in opposition to the regime, is born incompatible with the regime.  The very genes present in the conception of a human person automatically denies that person basic human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the nature of apartheid, the way in which it has been institutionalised, that makes it so particularly horrible.  We have in many other countries of the world examples of where people's constitutional rights are denied by executive action.  Indeed, we have many horrific examples of this throughout the world, but in South Africa we have something more.  We have the denial of basic human <Col N="1466" /> rights by constitutional provision itself. This is the road of horror which has been travelled a few times in human history. We would hope that once we get rid of apartheid this road will never be travelled again.</P>
    <P>In a debate in the last few weeks, in a passage between Senator Lanigan and myself, I recommended to him to read the book by Christopher Hollis called <i>The American Heresy.</i>  I cannot help being reminded on the occasion of this debate of a passage from that book in which Christopher Hollis was talking about a very eminent American Senator, one of the greatest of American Senators of the pre-Civil War period, a man who was proud of his Irish origins.  That was Senator John Calhoun, the Senator for South Carolina.  He was the man who gave intellectual justification to institutional slavery for the southern states of America. Hollis made a very perceptive remark. He said that John Cauldwell Calhoun believed in the American Constitution, indeed believed that all men were created equal.  As his career developed in the Senate where he was the spokesman for the Southern States, he more than anybody else attempted to give an intellectual justification to slavery.  Hollis asked the question: where did this leave Calhoun? Since he held on to the proposition that all men were created equal, he was driven logically to the conclusion that negroes were not men.  This is the ultimate heresy in politics.  It is the doctrine of Untermenschen that led the Jews, the Gypsies and the Poles to the gas chamber because German logic carried that attitude to this logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is the same attitude that underlies apartheid in southern Africa.  We have here the ultimate horror of a political attitude which indicates that there are some people who are not fully human and therefore do not have basic human rights.  This does lead ultimately to what we saw in the thirties in Nazi Germany, to highly organised genocide.  That is why we must struggle.  That is why we must do all we can.  What in particular should we do?  We have heard the Minister once again declaring our support for what has <Col N="1467" /> been done in the UN and in the European Community.  I must agree with Senator Michael Higgins that perhaps the time has come when this is not enough.  We have to be concerned not only with the fact that we are upholding the various embargoes and sanctions, but that we should take steps to ensure that others uphold them too and denounce these others when they fail to do so.  This is something that we could do in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said rightly that we do not encourage trade with South Africa.  The position of the Government and successive Governments has been that there are limits to the extent to which they can interfere with individuals in their private trade.  But I think there is quite a gap between those two positions.  I am not sure that the Government should not be able to find itself in a position to move further along the road to increase the degree of discouragement in regard to trade with South Africa.  Equally, while they cannot prohibit co-operation by private sporting associations with South Africa, once again they can do a good deal to bring to the minds of those people who are concerned the nature and the ultimate horror of the regime with which they are unwittingly allowing themselves to be contaminated.  More efforts must be made, I would suggest, in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is a great danger that because of certain accommodations that have been made by South Africa with neighbouring African states over the past year or so, people may be tempted to believe that there is a real change in the regime, that because there is a military accommodation, and sometimes a trade accommodation, between South Africa and her neighbours that somehow apartheid is beginning to decline and will wither away.  This is a very serious mistake to make.  Anyone who keeps in touch with the situation knows it to be false.  If we look at the position at the end of 1984 and compare it with the position at the beginning of 1984, there were twice as many people in detention at the end of that year as there were at the beginning. <Col N="1468" /> There was a doubling of the number who were in detention.  Again, there seems to be an indication, and this is clear from some of the specialised articles that appeared in legal journals, that the Judiciary is being further perverted in South Africa. The Judiciary was open to condemnation for being an instrument of the State.  It does appear that during the last year there has been an intensification of this. There are the phenomena of a small number of judges being repeatedly involved in capital cases.  Apparently, the South African Government are not able to trust even some of their judges and they are confining themselves to a small number.  The conduct of trials and the <i>obiter dicta</i> of these judges are becoming something heartily to be condemned.</P>
    <P>We must of course deplore every incident as it arises.  But our reaction must be to make ourselves all the more determined to take action and to take action, not because we are a powerful State which can really affect the trade of South Africa, but because we do have a voice and one voice can be heard.  Often one voice can be heard more distinctly than many voices.  Our voice must continue to be heard in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new development which the Minister announced tonight in regard to the question of bilateral aid.  He has announced a move in this direction.  Even though the move is a small one, it is significant.  His Department have managed to find a way in which they can give some assistance here.  I hope once they find their way in this particular matter of giving aid inside South Africa by the co-financing of projects that they will expand in this particular direction.  It is a development to be encouraged and to be expanded.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am happy to take part in a debate here this evening in which we have a consensus of all groups represented in the Seanad.  I am thankful to Senator Brendan Ryan for his initiative in putting forward this motion.  I am glad to be associated with it.  It reminds me of other days when Senator Michael Higgins was a Deputy and I was a Minister and we were associated together in Dáil Éireann <Col N="1469" /> in an all-party motion in regard to El Salvador.  It is a very useful exercise in regard to these very troubled spots of the world, that all groups in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann can come together and agree.  We must agree, not merely in our attitude, we must agree also on action, because action is sorely needed.  The small amount that we can do will not alter the nature of things but by our action we can encourage others and in the long run, please God, this monster will be destroyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House must excuse me if I am a little bit incoherent.  I had some injections today and I am beginning to feel the worse for wear as a result.  If I am a little less than articulate I apologise in advance.</P>
      <P>I would like to say first of all that I welcomed both the tone and the content of the Minister's speech.  I am grateful for the Minister's presence.  It was a long way from the usual diplomatic niceties in which Ministers for Foreign Affairs usually express themselves.  It was blunt; it was unequivocal and it used the language that all of us believe is the language that should be used about South Africa. That is not to say &mdash; as I will mention shortly &mdash; that I and the Minister would agree about absolutely everything on what can and needs to be done about South Africa.  I am very grateful for what the Minister said.  It was a further step along the road to our distancing ourselves absolutely from the racist regime in South Africa and, furthermore, along the road to our taking the maximum possible action to deal with the problem of racism in South Africa.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's additional initiatives.  The sums of money may be small, but there is a symbolic value in the issues that the Minister is recognising. Both myself and those against apartheid recognise that we are taking our campaign against this most awful of regimes a further step along the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan used, quite appropriately, a comparison between the racist regime in South Africa and Nazi Germany.  It is not the sort of language <Col N="1470" /> that used be popular when talking about South Africa.  There was a tone and moderation which persisted far too long in Western attitudes to South Africa.  But to make the comparison clearly is quite legitimate.  It is in the context of that sort of a comparison, by somebody of Senator Eoin Ryan's stature, that the persistence of the Irish Rugby Football Union, in particular, in its sporting contacts with South Africa, need to be adjudged and assessed.  Organisations that would be identified as being more conservative like, for instance, those who organise cricket in this country and those who organise it in Britain, have faced up to the realities of racism in South Africa.  It is a matter of great regret that a major sporting organisation have failed to do so and use equivocal language and half-truths to justify their participation.</P>
    <P>We have overwhelming evidence that the policy of pressure is the only policy that has ever worked in South Africa and that anybody who contributes to the slightest weakening of that pressure, whether he likes it, or whether he knows what he is doing, is contributing to the continuation of racism in South Africa. What Senator Michael Higgins had to say was an analysis with which I agree without qualification.  I agree, as both he and Senator Dooge suggested, that the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have done a considerable amount of damage to international solidarity on the issue of racism in South Africa.  One has to say that it is very difficult to believe that people with the level of information and advice that the Governments in the United States and the United Kingdom have can actually believe what they say about South Africa.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one has to believe that it is a conscious decision, not in response to some half-imagined improvement in the system, but to accommodate racism in South Africa.  It cannot be believed by any rational person that what is being done by those two countries in particular is somehow based on a misunderstanding of the realities of life in South Africa. The days are long past when there was <Col N="1471" /> any misunderstanding about the nature of racism in South Africa.  Therefore if two major governments, as Senator M. Higgins quite rightly said, undermined the United Nations, we have to assume they were doing it knowingly and for reasons of most reprehensible self-interest of a kind that we have not seen for some years in the Western world.  As Senator Higgins said, the nature of apartheid as well as being racist is a racist regime which is based on economic exploitation.  It is an extra dimension which raises questions about what interests are being defended when two major powers choose to accommodate South Africa.</P>
    <P>Is it a political accommodation or is it, as appears on the basis of the structure of the economic order in South Africa, an accommodation to look after certain strategic economic interests in that region?  Because it appears that the only real interest the two major powers can have in South Africa is not some kind of nice concern about the well-being of people but a fundamental concern about very fundamental national interests which they have identified as being best sustained by support for racism in South Africa.  Therefore I believe that one of the areas in which we can step up our activities is in the area of pressure within the EC and, through the EC, with the United States Government to weaken and hopefully turn around the policies of those two Governments.</P>
    <P>The level of political activity in the United States in protest against the present administration's policy is most welcome evidence that public opinion in the United States is also unhappy about the level of co-operation with that most appalling regime.  Some of President Regan's comments on last week's horrific events were particularly tasteless and unhelpful and in the eyes of certain members of his own Congress were close to being racist in tone if not in content.  We all agree that apartheid must be ended, that apartheid is not capable of being reformed, that apartheid is not somehow <Col N="1472" /> a gloss on South Africa but is inherent to the structure of South African society.</P>
    <P>While we all wish for a non-racist, free and democratic South Africa we must recognise that that is not something that can come about simply by words of persuasion and expressions of goodwill and concern.  What it is about is the transfer of power from those who have it all and who benefited from it to those who have none.  That is what is at the core of South African racism.  It is the entrenched privilege of a minority living in a condition of privilege which is probably unknown anywhere else in the world.  That privilege, economic and social, is based on racism, on the racial exploitation of one group by another group who happen to be in command.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the history of South Africa, given that resistance now seems to be at long last almost endemic and continuous, questions have to be faced, questions about the reality of trade sanctions and boycotts; questions about whether it is enough for us as a people and our Government to stand back when ten brave people in a magnificent gesture of courage and solidarity refuse to handle South African goods and say because of the nature of our labour relations laws we can do nothing.  That is an inadequate response to something that could become a symbol of Irish resistance to apartheid and in particular of consumer resistance to the products of apartheid.</P>
    <P>It would be very simple for the Government to extend the regulations about purchasing &mdash; which I understand the Minister for Health has introduced &mdash; to all Government agencies and Departments, and, indeed, the purchasing policy of the restaurant service in this House, which I suspect may not be entirely innocent in regard to the purchase of South African produce, and into every possible area of Government purchase. The Government are a major consumer of goods.  It should not be too difficult to ensure that nothing that is tainted with racism is ever bought by any State or semi-State agency.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Irish Rugby Football Union a little bit of imaginative use of <Col N="1473" /> regulations could make life very difficult. We could, for instance, prohibit the export of currency to South Africa and let them go but let them go penniless if they wish to go there.  Let us prohibit the export of sporting goods to South Africa and let them go without their precious sporting gear and be fitted out by those they choose to collaborate with.  They are small things; they are not difficult but it may well be possible within the constraints of our Constitution to make it even more difficult for anybody to travel to South Africa without the expressed approval of this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On the issue of exports there are certain unhappy omissions.  For instance, the Central Statistics Office still classify the exports of Namibia as being part of the exports of South Africa.  It is an unhappy omission which fails to recognise legal realities in Southern Africa.  We have to address ourselves to the fact that certain South African companies are operating in this country, in Shannon in particular, and we cannot continue with a morally self-righteous tone about South Africa and at the same time accept certain benefits from this country through investment by people who are fundamentally based on the racist nature of South African society.</P>
    <P>We have to look at some of our other activities.  For instance, we have to look at our aid programme in Lesotho.  There is a very good case to be made that Lesotho deserves a particular level of concern because of its embattled nature.  What is particularly important is that any Irish personnel who go to work there have a high level of understanding about our national abhorrence of apartheid and a willingness to see that that national abhorrence is reflected in their attitudes as they work for development in Lesotho. I hope to have a personal opportunity to make some assessment of whether that is the reality in Lesotho in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>At this stage in the western world generally the question is not whether we ought to condemn apartheid, because everybody does.  There is nobody left, outside of the ranks of crackpot Tories <Col N="1474" /> in the United Kingdom and people like Monsieur le Penn in France, who would even suggest that there is anything to be said in favour of South Africa.  The question is, are we as Senator Michael Higgins said, prepared to end this separation between politics and economics, between politics and human rights and perceptions of security, because it is quite possible for the combined resources of the western democracies to end racism in South Africa or to make it absolutely impossible for it to continue?</P>
    <P>Therefore, why are those resources not being mobilised?  It is because, perhaps, deep down, in spite of the level of rhetoric, talk and commitment, there are concerns about political possibilities?  There are concerns about economic and alleged security questions, about the suggestion that the devil you know is probably better than the devil you do not know.  Therefore however much we denounce racism in South Africa we may be very worried about the nature of a future freely elected South African Government.  Certain economic, political and security questions which are not articulated any more are nevertheless motivating a large part of the real attitudes to South Africa.  The considerable level of economic interests that western countries and industries have in South Africa are obviously things that in times of recession concentrate the minds of many western Governments.</P>
    <P>It has to be faced up to that all those fears are justified, that there is no easy route to the ending of exploitation in racism in South Africa.  Persuasion gently whispered into ears at various diplomatic levels will have no impact.  It is pressure, pressure, pressure that will end that regime.  It is pressure on companies where their corporate interests begin to be identified as being in conflict with racism in South Africa.  It is pressure through sporting organisations where their interests begin to be recognised as being in conflict with South Africa.  It is pressure on a cultural level where all cultural contact &mdash; if you could have culture in South Africa &mdash; ends once and for all.  It is pressure that will terminate it all.</P>
    <P>At the end of it all, what we are talking <Col N="1475" /> about is not some sort of change in political colour or texture.  It is the destruction of exploitation and entrenched privilege. That is a matter which goes to the very heart of the nature of society in that country.  Because it is about such fundamental issues, it is important to remember that we are not just talking about issues of political debate, we are talking about one of the most fundamental moral questions in the world today.  The moral question of whether it is possible for a person to have any dealings with racism and claim to have any sort of fundamental moral values.  There can hardly be any more immoral practices, philosophies or attitudes than the implication that because of the colour of your skin you are superior or inferior to somebody else because of the colour or his or her skin.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome the fact that all groups in this House have supported this motion.  I hope it will give encouragement to those who struggle against apartheid in South Africa.  I sincerely hope that it will help to strengthen yet further the Government's resolve to take every possible step to ensure that Ireland is firmly and unequivocally on the side of the destruction of racism in South Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to modernise our local government system has been recognised for many years and indeed has been under active consideration by successive Governments since the end of the sixties. However, while there have been various commitments to local government reform since then, these commitments have not been translated into action.  As a result, the system continues to grind on with the various deficiencies which have been diagnosed &mdash; deficiencies in relation to organisation, functions and procedures and in relation to financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in the Dáil, the stage has now been reached where <Col N="1477" /> any further delay in tackling the whole question of local government reform would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>While our local government structures have remained largely unchanged in this century, fundamental changes have occurred in society itself.  These changes have deep implications for the workings of the local government system and its relationship to the public which it serves. Changes have resulted from the development process, including urbanisation. Within cities and major urban areas there are important issues of planning, renewal and development in which the local authorities have a critical part to play. The growth of traffic, of recreation and of tourism are other major areas of change making demands on the local government system.</P>
    <P>While the functions of local authorities have been extended over the years, in an attempt to meet at least some of these needs &mdash; particularly in relation to planning, housing, roads and environmental control &mdash; organisational change has been markedly absent.</P>
    <P>In spite of the changes that have taken place in local authority functions, there is still a feeling, therefore, that local government is somehow removed from the real needs and current preoccupations of the people who elect local councils. The fact, for example, that voluntary associations of various types are to be found so widely and, to a certain degree, are seen as being more relevant to people's needs than our local democratic institutions, is a signal which we must take account of.  It indicates the need to make local government more relevant and more accessible to people, and more responsive to their needs.  This calls for changes of organisation, of functions and of attitudes.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated in the Dáil, another major aim must be to make local government as efficient as possible.  Local authorities between capital and current spending are now responsible for some £1,400 million of expenditure each year. This is a significant element in the total public financing requirement.  Local authorities are also among the principal <Col N="1478" /> agencies providing employment throughout the country &mdash; often in areas where little other employment may be available. These factors taken together with the key importance of local authority infrastructure, mean that the system is playing a major role in the economy of the country.  The system must be seen to be operating efficiently and providing a good return in terms of value for money.</P>
    <P>This then, is the background against which the Government considered the whole question of local government reform and against which they decided on a major programme of reorganisation. Needless to say, consultations were held with representative local government bodies before any decisions were taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>The programme of reform will be implemented in stages and I will detail these stages in a moment.  Before doing so, however, I would like to point out that there was considerable misunderstanding in the Dáil as to the Government's intentions in relation to re-organisation and, in particular, about the scope of the proposed reforms.  The view was expressed, for example, that the present Bill cannot be considered as implementing major reforms of the local government system. This, however, is to misunderstand the whole approach which is being adopted to local reform.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not and, given the proximity of the local elections and the complexity of reorganisation, could not be a comprehensive measure covering all aspects of local government reform.  It is a first stage.  It deals essentially with matters which are necessary or desirable to have in place before the local elections in June as I will explain in more detail in a moment.  It will prepare the way in important respects for the more widespread reforms to follow under further legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now detail the various phases which will be involved in reorganisation and I hope this will clarify the position in so far as the scope of reorganisation is concerned, for the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The present Bill represents the first <Col N="1479" /> phase of the reform programme.  The matters covered in it are: The adjustment of Dublin city boundary involving some areas being added to the city and some to the county; the setting up, for electoral purposes, of three new counties covering the territory of the existing Dublin County Council and of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, and to which elections will be held in June; powers designed to enable effect to be given to the recommendations of the two electoral commissions recently published.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision also for the extension of the Galway city boundary and for up-grading of that city to the status of county borough.  The Bill includes some other particular provisions which I will come to.</P>
    <P>Much of the volume of the Bill is taken up with the definition in legal terminology of the new boundaries in Dublin and with matters consequential on the adjustment of the Dublin city and county boundaries.</P>
    <P>In the second phase the reorganisation of the system in Dublin will be completed, including the transfer of functions to new councils, the establishment of district councils and the setting up of a metropolitan council, as a co-ordinating body.  These matters will be the subject of a further Bill.</P>
    <P>A brief word about the proposed district councils and the metropolitan council would, perhaps, be appropriate here.  In addition to making recommendations on local electoral areas for the city and the new counties, the Dublin Electoral Commission was also asked to make recommendations on a division of both city and counties into districts.  The districts recommended by the commission, will form the basis for future district councils which will be in a position to address themselves fully and directly to the needs of particular local areas.  The special needs of the new town areas to the west of Dublin will, in particular, be borne in mind, when this system is being developed.</P>
    <P>The metropolitan council which will be established will not be directly elected; instead, it will consist of nominees of the principal authorities.  It will be essentially <Col N="1480" /> a co-ordinating body rather than a body with an executive, day to day role.  It will be the appropriate body to establish policy guidelines on an integrated basis for the major services, including transport planning, throughout the Dublin area.  The national plan for 1985-1987 provides that the Dublin Transport Authority to be set up by the Minister for Transport will become part of the reformed local government structure.  The arrangements to give effect to this, together with the precise functions and role of the metropolitan council, will be spelled out in due course in legislation. However, the mainline local authorities will remain responsible for the traditional local government functions, subject to an effective co-ordinating role being vested in the metropolitan council in the interests of integrated development over the area as a whole.  Full account will be taken of the recommendations which emerge from the Eastern Regional Development Organisation study which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>In the third phase of the reorganisation programme reforms and improvements will be effected in the organisation and procedures of local authorities.  This will cover such matters as the adjustment of urban boundaries; the setting up of new town councils; extended functions for local authorities in certain social and economic spheres; improved co-ordination and agency arrangements between authorities; a better provision for local authority recognition and support of certain local bodies, and a variety of adjustments in relation to procedures, by-law making and so on.</P>
    <P>The fourth phase is based on an examination which is being conducted urgently of means of effecting a substantive devolution of functions from the centre to the local authorities so that any necessary statutory provisions may be included in the legislative programme which I have outlined.  Changes in this area will have to be effected so as to avoid duplication or confusion of roles.  Where complete devolution is not feasible, agency arrangements between central bodies and local authorities may be possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> Certain important functions of my own Department will be included in this review, but the Government are looking at a wide range of public services in search of devolution possibilities.</P>
    <P>This work is based on the belief that people should be able to look to their local authorities more than at present for information, advice and assistance in areas of economic and social interest; in many cases these are areas in which the local authorities have little or no say at the moment.  I also believe that local authorities should have the right of making their voices heard when decisions affecting their areas are being made by various bodies at national and regional level and with this in mind the Government are intent on developing a more complete system of local self-government.</P>
    <P>No amount of change in organisation or functions will bear fruit unless there is an adequate finance system and the fifth phase of reform is concerned with this aspect.  The Government have recognised the need for change following the removal of domestic rates and the collapse of the agricultural valuation system and have made provision for a land tax from which the proceeds will accrue to local authorities.  Other approaches to see how local revenues might be supplemented and how local authorities might be made more financially self-sufficient are under examination.  Studies in this area have been undertaken by the National Economic and Social Council and by the Commission on Taxation and advice and suggestions from these sources should be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Looked at from another perspective, however, local authorities cannot expect to escape the severe financial constraints which apply in the public sector generally at present.  This means that there are severe limits to the additional resources that can be made available to local authorities in the short term.  This harsh reality of the moment does not remove the need to search for a better financing system on the lines I have described.  It would, of course, be the aim that there should be a suitable financial adjustment <Col N="1482" /> in respect of any new functions that might be developed on local authorities in consequence of the initiatives which I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Finally, the reform programme will include an examination of the regional level of government, including the role of the regional development organisations, and the relationship between the various bodies existing at this intermediate level outside the representative system.  In the meantime the regional development organisations will continue to serve local authorities and other interests as they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of criticism of delays on the part of the Government in bringing forward their reform proposals in this area.  This kind of criticism reflects a poor understanding of the complexities of the issues involved. Reform is urgently needed but it is not something to be rushed into leaving mistakes to be repented over at leisure. It may be of interest, in this regard, to hear something of the <i>rationale</i> behind the approach which the Government decided to adopt to reorganisation in Dublin, and of the kind of options that were considered.</P>
    <P>One of the options involved the replacement of the existing three councils &mdash; the city council, the county council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council &mdash; by one overall council, namely the Greater Dublin Council.  This overall council would have responsibility for services over the whole of the metropolitan area and might have committees at local level.  The option has certain attractions in that it would facilitate co-ordination in planning and development and in the provision of services.  It would also command resources on a scale which would favour adequate expertise being provided and economies of scale being achieved. In the Government's view however, a single council with responsibility for the whole of the Dublin area would be too large and unwieldy a body and too far removed from the people it served. Neither would it be well suited toward being more responsive to the needs of the people that are represented by it.  An <Col N="1483" /> overall council on the scale implied could also create imbalance in relation to local government units in urban and rural areas elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Another option would involve establishing a two-tier system of local government with perhaps ten or so borough councils covering the whole of the city and county, and a directly elected metropolitan council, functions being divided between the levels.  This was not favoured because of the fragmentation which would be involved and the additional problems of co-ordination which would arise.  It would also be a more expensive system.  Finally, the experience of such a system in the UK since the mid-seventies has not been encouraging.</P>
    <P>Another possibility examined was that the city area might be reduced so as to correspond more closely to the concept of an inner city authority, with a number of county or borough councils covering the rest of the metropolitan area.  Again, there would have been serious problems of demarcation and co-ordination.  Hundreds of thousands of people who associate themselves closely with the city would have found themselves excluded from that area and attached to new units of local government in the county.  The Government decided against this option as well.</P>
    <P>The Government decision, as announced, is that there should be four mainline local authorities in Dublin comprising the existing Dublin Corporation, subject to boundary adjustments, and three new county councils covering the rest of the metropolitan area and replacing, after a transitional phase, the existing Dublin County Council and the existing Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  As I have indicated, provision will also be made for a metropolitan council and for district councils.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the changes proposed in the city-county boundary and the boundaries for the new county areas. I would like to stress that the changes proposed in the boundary between Dublin city and county will be made definitively under powers set out in the Bill, before the local elections are held.  This means <Col N="1484" /> that by then the corporation will be immediately responsible once the changes are made for the areas being taken into the city, and the county council for the areas being excluded.  The three new county areas, on the other hand, are being established at this juncture for electoral purposes only.  The replacement of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council by three new county councils is a fundamental change involving complex matters to be settled in regard to transfer of functions, property, resources, staff and so on.  All of these will take time to work out &mdash; consultations with the local authorities have already begun &mdash; and will require further legislation to bring into effect.  In the meantime, the three new county councils will be elected in June.  There will be no direct elections then to the existing Dublin County Council or to Dún Laoghaire Corporation and those bodies will carry on with the members elected for the three councils serving on them until the three new county councils become operational.  These members will then assume operational responsibilities in the three new counties and the existing county council and borough corporation will be phased out.</P>
    <P>The changes in the city-county boundary will mean a net addition of some 18,000 in the city population.  The changes are not designed to increase or diminish the city but to rationalise the existing boundaries and to iron out some inconsistencies that have developed since the last boundary change took place in 1953.  I will consider these changes in more detail later.</P>
    <P>The boundaries for the three new county areas have been fixed by reference to major geographical features, namely the Liffey and the watershed which divides south Dublin naturally into east and west sectors.  The Dublin north county will be known as Dublin-Fingal and will comprise the territory north of the adjusted boundary and of the River Liffey, except for the small part of Lucan which lies north of the river and which will be included with the rest of that centre which is south of the river.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> The two counties south of the adjusted city boundary and of the line of the Liffey will be divided by a line which will proceed from the Dodder, and city boundary, at Woodside Drive, by the boundaries of the Castle Golf Club and of Marley Park, to Rockbrook and then by the Pine Forest Road to Glendoo Mountain and the junction with the Wicklow county boundary.  This line follows townland boundaries or other natural or physical features which facilitate the north-south direction of the division. The county to the east of this line will be known as Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and to the west, Dublin-Belgard.  Dublin-Fingal will have 24 members: Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will have 28 and Dublin-Belgard will have 26.  This gives a total of 78 members in place of the combined membership of 51 at present in Dublin County Council and in Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  This increase is fully justified by reference to the level of representation available in other counties.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enables effect to be given to the recommendations of the Dublin Electoral Area Boundaries Commission in the city area and in the new county areas, subject to two minor adjustments in the proposed city boundary at the Santry by-pass extension and at Cherry Orchard.  These adjustments are designed to provide a more logical line of division between city and county at these points and do not materially affect the recommendations of the commission in regard to electoral area divisions.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided, as announced, to implement the recommendations of the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaires Commission in regard to changes in electoral areas outside Dublin.  The commission were asked to recommend changes which would bring about a more consistent relationship between population and membership within the various areas. There will be an overall increase of 14 in the membership of eight county councils.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that Galway should be made a county borough, equal in status to Dublin, Cork, <Col N="1486" /> Limerick and Waterford.  This is in recognition of the distinctive history of the city, as celebrated in the quincentennial year. The decision is also justified by the size of the city and by its major importance as a social and economic centre in the west of the country.  This means that Galway city will become a separate administrative county.  Again, there are considerable complexities as regards the future relationship between the city and the county and it will take some further time to sort out these matters.  In the meantime the city population will vote as a separate entity in the June elections without linkage with Galway County Council membership.</P>
    <P>The way will be further prepared for the enhancement of the status of Galway by giving effect to the recommendation of the commission that the city boundary should be extended to take in a number of surrounding townlands.  The membership of the Galway Borough Council will be increased from 12 to 15.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to commend both Galway Borough Council and Galway County Council on reaching agreement about the adjustment in the city boundary and, in particular, the very positive approach of the latter body. There was no corresponding agreement in regard to the adjustment of the boundaries of Cork city or of Limerick city and accordingly the commission were not in a position to recommend adjustments in those cases.  The question of those adjustments will now fall to be taken up as part of the general review of urban boundaries, which I have already referred to, and for which a boundary commission will be set up at a later stage.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a number of amendments which were made to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil which I would like to refer to briefly.  The original section 19 of the Bill enabled the Minister to extend by order the boundaries of the county boroughs of Cork and Limerick and the borough of Galway.  However, as a boundary alteration has been recommended only in the case of Galway the references to Cork and Limerick have been deleted.  The commission also <Col N="1487" /> described the area which should be added to the borough of Galway which area had been agreed locally.  Section 19 now applies solely to this area.</P>
    <P>The original section 21 enabled the Minister to alter by order the number of members of a county council, a county borough, other than Dublin, and the Galway Borough Council.  However, the commission only recommended that the number of members should be altered in the case of county councils.  Section 21 therefore was amended so as to apply only to county councils.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments consequential on those I have mentioned and some other minor amendments of a technical nature were also made on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>While speaking of the commissions and their work I would like to avail of this opportunity to thank both bodies &mdash; the chairman, Judge Murphy and Judge Carroll, the members and the staff concerned &mdash; all of whom I know worked hard to complete their assignments in the short time allowed.  Inevitably in assignments of this kind the recommendations will not find universal approval on all points but the commissions have met their assignments effectively and impartially and within the time allowed, and I am glad to acknowledge this and to record my appreciation.</P>
    <P>I will now outline in more detail the specific provisions included in the Bill. Part I of the Bill contains standard provisions relating to Title, definitions and orders.  Part II relates to the upgrading of Galway to county borough status.  Section 5 provides that on a day to be appointed by the Minister the borough of Galway will cease to be part of the county and will become an administrative county of itself called the County Borough of Galway.  As I mentioned earlier, some time will be required to allow for the necessary arrangements to be made between city and county to ensure a smooth transition, without disruption of services.  Consultations between my Department and both authorities are under way.</P>
    <P>Section 5(4) provides that the borough <Col N="1488" /> electorate will not be entitled to vote at the June elections to Galway County Council.  This is because Galway borough is to become a county borough.  Section 6 provides for an increase of three to 15 in the membership of the borough council and that number of councillors will be elected at the June elections.  When the borough becomes a county borough the title of the council will change to the city council.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 7 is to apply the management system to the county borough.</P>
    <P>By virtue of subsection (5) there will be a single manager for city and county. This arrangement may, however, be terminated by agreement of the councils of both city and county; it may not, however, be terminated while the present manager continues to hold office.  It is important that joint management should apply for the initial stages to ensure that the separation of city and county is dealt with in a co-ordinated manner and that any practical difficulties arising can be readily sorted out.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables any further necessary provisions to give effect to the establishment of the county borough to be made by order.  By virtue of section 3 such an order would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20 in Part IV provide a legislative basis to implement the commission's recommendations in regard to the revised boundary for the borough of Galway.  The new section 19, inserted in the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil, will effect the boundary extension recommended by the Committee, so that the boundary alteration can have effect for the purpose of the June elections.  The commission also recommended that adequate provision should be made for the payment of compensation to the county council in respect of the boundary alteration.  Section 19 enables provision to be made for the payment of compensation and the order to be made under that section will include appropriate arrangements in this regard.  A new section 20 was inserted on Committee Stage in the <Col N="1489" /> Dáil.  The purpose of this was to bring section 20 into line with section 19.</P>
    <P>The next part of the Bill, Part III, provides for changes in the Dublin area. As I have already stated, these changes represent a first step and further legislation will be required.  It will simplify matters if I deal first with the city.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 10 is to effect the alteration of the boundary between Dublin city and county for all purposes. Detailed descriptions of the altered areas are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.  A map showing these areas has been prepared and a copy has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  The major areas being transferred from the county to the city are the areas which constitute the northern environs of the city, including Donaghmede, Darndale, Coolock, Santry and Ballymun, the Ashtown area and an area between Clondalkin Industrial Estate and Cherry Orchard Park. The other areas are an area adjacent to Cappagh Avenue and the Northway Estate and parts of Crumlin-Walkinstown and the Beech Hill area north of Belfield.  The major areas being transferred from the city to the county are the areas comprising Baldoyle, Bayside, Sutton, Howth, and an area at Rathfarnham.  Also to be included in the county are parts of Kimmage, Templeogue, Belfield and a small area south of Elm Park Golf Course.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Bill contains consequential provisions which will apply as a result of the alteration of the boundary between Dublin city and county.  They generally follow the lines of similar provisions made in the past in relation to boundary alterations and include, in particular, provision for the phasing-in over a ten-year period, of the liability of ratepayers in the areas excluded from the city.  The Bill as introduced in the Dáil provided for the phasing-in over a five-year period; this period was extended at Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for an increase of seven to 52 in the membership of Dublin City Council.  These members will be elected for the altered city area and on <Col N="1490" /> the basis of the electoral areas recommended for the city by the Dublin Electoral Area Boundaries Commission.</P>
    <P>I turn next to the provisions relating to County Dublin.  As I mentioned previously, the Government have decided that County Dublin, including the area comprised in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, should be divided into three counties with a county council for each of the three areas.  However, it would not be possible to have three new county councils fully operative immediately following the June elections.  This would necessitate the abolition of the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation; their replacement by the three new county councils, various complex property and financial adjustments, staff transfers; revised arrangements for the operation of various services and other arrangements to deal with the many other matters arising. Clearly, it would be impossible for this comprehensive programme of activity to be completed before June.  However, rather than defer reorganisation in the Dublin area the Government decided to press ahead and establish the new county areas of Dublin-Fingal, Dublin-Belgard and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown for the purposes of the June elections; for these purposes they will be known as electoral counties.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public should being to identify with these counties and for that reason elections are being held in June to councils for each of the electoral counties.  Section 12 provides for the establishment of the three electoral counties and the Third Schedule details the boundaries of the counties.  Section 13 provides for the establishment and election of a council for each of the electoral counties and specifies the membership. The alternative to this approach would have been to hold elections to the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and then abolish them and hold further elections to the new authorities when definitive legislation dealing with all aspects of local government re-organisation in the Dublin area had been prepared.  This would yet again postpone <Col N="1491" /> change and could, indeed, result in no change at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that all of the elected members &mdash; 78 in total &mdash; for the three electoral counties will serve on and act as the existing Dublin County Council. While this may be somewhat unusual, the alternative was, as I have said, to defer reorganisation again.  Also, the arrangement will facilitate an orderly transition from the existing to the new bodies.</P>
    <P>In regard to Dún Laoghaire, section 16 provides for similar arrangements to apply.  In this case, I will make an order specifying those electoral areas which correspond as nearly as possible to the existing borough and the persons elected for those areas will, in addition to serving on the county council, also serve on and act as the borough council pending its replacement.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing further legislation to invest the three councils elected in June with all the powers of county councils and to provide for the transfer of assets, liabilities, staff, <i>et cetera</i> from the existing authorities to the three new county councils.  For the interim period, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation will continue in being and will continue to perform their existing functions.  Section 29 provides for the continuation of the county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    <P>I apologise to Members of the House, incidentally, for the fact that on page 5 of the explanatory memorandum &ldquo;section 28&rdquo; should read &ldquo;section 29&rdquo; and &ldquo;section 29&rdquo; should read &ldquo;section 28&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the June elections to the councils for the three electoral counties will be on the basis of the electoral areas recommended by the Dublin Electoral Area Boundaries Commission. Section 14 provides the necessary statutory power to divide the electoral counties into electoral areas. Section 15 contains provisions relating to the register of electors, returning officer and costs of the elections to the three councils.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a standard provision providing for the preparation of official maps <Col N="1492" /> of the electoral counties.  The boundaries of the electoral counties are described in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 18 contains supplemental provisions in regard to the alteration of the city-county boundary effected by section 10 and would enable the Minister by regulations to continue in force in those areas any enactments, regulations, rules, bylaws and other instruments which had effect in those areas prior to the alteration of the boundaries.  The section would provide a convenient means of continuing, on a temporary or long-term basis, the application of statutory requirements in the areas affected by the boundary alteration where this is considered necessary, for example regulations under the Road Traffic Acts in relation to speed limits.</P>
    <P>In dealing with Part II of the Bill, which relates to Galway, I have already referred to section 19 which will alter the boundary of the borough for the purposes of the June elections.  Section 20 is a consequential provision which arising from an amendment in the Dáil, now requires the Minister, prior to the elections, to make any consequential adjustments to electoral areas in the borough of Galway and the county of Galway.  These will be made on the basis of the recommendations of the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission.</P>
    <P>The original section 21 enabled the Minister to alter on a once-off basis, prior to the June elections, the number of members of a county council, of a county borough (other than Dublin) and of Galway Borough Council.  This was to enable any recommendations of the commission in regard to membership to be implemented.  In the event the commission has recommended alterations in the number of members in the case of county councils only and accordingly the section was amended in the Dáil to apply solely to counties.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 are provisions which will enable any necessary adjustments to be made to the register of electors and to polling districts arising from the revision of electoral areas recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Section 24 will enable the Minister to make by order, which by virtue of section 3 must be approved by both Houses, any further provisions necessary to enable this Bill to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Section 25 enables the Minister to alter the quorum of a local authority to take account of any alteration in the number of members of the authority.  A number of technical amendments to section 25 were made in the Dáil.  The effect of the amendments is to bring section 25 fully into line with section 21.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is a technical provision designed to ensure that the number of members of the Dublin Committee of Agriculture will remain as it is at the moment: 32 members.  By law the number of members of a committee is four times the number of county electoral areas.</P>
    <P>Most Senators will be aware of the procedures which currently apply to the appointments by local authorities to health boards.  The effect of section 27 and the Fifth Schedule is to apply these procedures to appointments by local authorities to the bodies mentioned in that section.</P>
    <P>Section 28 will extend the boundary of County Cork to include the Whiddy Island oil terminal as recommended by the Costelloe tribunal of inquiry.  It will also enable the Minister to alter the maritime boundaries of any county or county borough.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with section 29 in the context of the changes affecting County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that many of the provisions of the Bill are of a complex nature.  This is inevitable, however, given the complexity of the subject matter.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the central provisions of the Bill relate to measures which will need to be in place for the local elections, notably the adjustment of the Dublin and Galway boundaries; the setting up of three new counties in Dublin, and changes in electoral areas and in council membership elsewhere.  These changes will have to be incorporated in the 1985 register of electors and in polling schemes under powers being provided <Col N="1494" /> in the Bill.  Reasonable time must be allowed for the necessary adjustments to be made at local level if the arrangements for the local elections are to proceed smoothly.  To fit in with this time-scale it will be necessary that the Bill be enacted before Easter.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to inhibit discussion, the proximity of the local elections imposes this time limit upon us.  I would respectfully ask for the co-operation of the House, therefore, in this matter.  I look forward to a good discussion on this legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister that we on this side of the House have no intention whatever of holding up this Bill but wish to co-operate fully in the passing of it so that the people of this country will at last have an opportunity of going to the polls in June.  Last week or two weeks ago I asked the Minister to name the date of the June elections. Hours before the announcement came the Minister now in the House was unable to tell the Seanad that 20 June was the date fixed for local government elections. We learned the following day from an announcement.  The Minister in the House did not seem to know when the elections were going to be held although, according to his final statement, he wants this Bill through before Easter so that the elections can take place on 20 June.  This is very shrewd legislation, very well thought up, very well timed and even though it took the Government 12 months to bring in this reorganisation Bill there is not one word in the Bill about local government reform.  The Bill before us is the one the local authorities have been waiting for since the introduction of the managerial Act in the fifties.  There has been no reorganisation whatever in the local government system.  We awaited the introduction of legislation giving local authorities new chores and giving managers new responsibilities in the area of charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole legislative system affecting a number of aspects of financing local government has changed down the years. <Col N="1495" /> There is not a councillor in Ireland who gives three damns whether you extend Dublin and give 27 additional councillors in that area.  What every council today are talking about is how they are to manage the finance and how they are to carry on under the existing legislation. Indeed, many councils have had deputations in Dublin with the Minister of State and with the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh in connection with local government reform.  We waited eagerly for the statutory commitments now the responsibility of local authorities to be diverted to central authority.  There is nothing about that in this Bill.  As I stated at the outset, there is no reform whatever.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite glibly said that legislation would be forthcoming.  Would he not think that going to the polls in June, after years of waiting for reform, the people would have an opportunity of indicating their welcome for the reform in the legislation.  But, there is no reform or change, except changes in districts in Dublin and a few little well thought out changes, indeed one in my own county where a Fianna Fáil county councillor stood in Balla and completely against geographical constraints, they have now adjusted his area into the Swinford area. I notice that a member of this body who was a member of the commission nicely arranged that our councillor from Balla will be fighting in the Swinford area.  This type of change does not concern local authorities who are in desperate need of finance.  There are a number of areas where anyone drawing up reorganisation plans would reach for Dublin city if he wanted to give an advantage to the Government.  Dublin had a major advantage on the corporation and county council on the last occasion.  It was evident from the trend of policies introduced over the last number of years that that advantage would be whittled away as a result of the present economic climate.  Shrewdly, the Government have tackled Dublin for major reorganisation.</P>
    <P>There are 22 pages in the Minister's speech.  He waited until he reached page 19 before moving out of the Dublin <Col N="1496" /> metropolitan area.  He referred only briefly to Galway when he had to because of the change in the borough there.  There was not a mention of any other county. The emphasis is on Dublin and on getting 27 additional county councillors in the Dublin area with a view to gaining &mdash; whatever they may lose in the rural areas &mdash; additional support in the city.  That is the only reform I see in this reorganisation.</P>
    <P>As regards the further legislation that was to come before the House I regret very much that we had not got an opportunity of examining this legislation even at the cost of the postponement to September or, indeed, any other date, for the local elections, in order to have full reform of the local government system.</P>
    <P>In Mayo, Galway and Roscommon there are civil bills from the Western Health Board &mdash; in that area there are three local authorities &mdash; for millions of pounds owed.  When one local body brings other local authorities to court, there must be something wrong with the financing system within the local government structure.  We are awaiting reform. This is the reform that is absent from the Bill.  I regret that somebody did not think fit to tackle the problem and take corrective measures to redress the financial situation existing in local government.  The road network system is threadbare. Roads are breaking up all over the country. Services are at a standstill.  Under the new financing system the manager has a right, under the Second Financial Bill passed last March, to increase charges for the various services.  That has had a reaction.  People are not paying their bills and millions of pounds are owed to local authorities.  Is there anyone who believes that the new system mentioned here under which the land tax will be the new financing system for local authorities, will be introduced?</P>
    <P>The Minister is a level-headed man, and even though he is from Dublin he knows quite well that there will not be an adjusted acre system for the duration of this Government.  I can assure the House that the next Government which will come from this side of the House, will <Col N="1497" /> not introduce a land tax system whereby local government will be financed.  Such a system cannot work.  It is a system that has been opposed by the IFA and others. It will not work.  This is the only financing system that the Minister has mentioned in his local government reform.  The Minister knows that this Bill will not become law.  This Bill will not be on the Statute Book while this Government are in office.  That is why I say that the long awaited local government reform that we have been promised will not be implemented. It is the only system of financing that the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is one portion of the Bill that I welcome as having merit, that is, the system of electing members to subsidiary bodies <i>pro rata</i> to the number of members elected to a local authority, on the same lines as the health boards introduced by the late Erskine Childers were elected. This system will be introduced for representation on the various committees &mdash; ACOT, vocational education committees and other subsidiary bodies.  This will give equality of representation.  It is a system that I welcome and have supported.  It did not happen in counties where there were political parties taking full representation on ACOT, vocational education committees and other bodies and getting control of them through a political system.  Total control as the Senator on my left has told me, did not happen in some counties.  It did happen in other counties where political pressures and political representation outweighed the system of election.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed.  I have been a member of a local authority for 30 years.  I hope I know what I am talking about.  I know that local authorities are in dire need of reform.  As I have said, the statutory charges in Mayo and in the western counties for drainage and the maintenance of rivers that have been cleaned and drained by the Office of Public Works, are resulting in recurring bills from the Office of Public Works which can no longer be justified.  We are <Col N="1498" /> unable to pay them.  The same applies to the Western Health Board.  We have no control over expenditure by the Western Health Board although we get a bill every year.  We have to face our commitments. Because we are not financially able to do so, we are now in court with the Western Health Board.  There was £4 million withdrawn from the budget this year.  We were told to continue operating the services of the three counties of Roscommon, Mayo and Galway in circumstances of a cutback of £4 million and 6 per cent inflation.  It is not realistic and cannot be achieved.  The only way it can be achieved is by cutting the services, as has happened in most western counties.  I refer only to western counties although the same situation arises in the eight health boards. The Western Health Board has to bring the local authority to court because of the severity of the cutback.  It is £4 million this year.  There is, a devolution of the health services in that region.  We can do nothing except pay up when asked to do so.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the road network system in the country is breaking down. Most of the local authorities are not able to meet their commitments.  It may be all right for the Minister to indicate the amount of money that has been allocated every year to local authorities throughout the State.  This has been going on since the beginning of time.  There is an increase every year to match inflation.  In some years that increase has been small in some counties and did very little to meet inflation.  For that reason county councils generally are in dire financial straits and are unable to continue under the present system of financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every council throughout this country have been awaiting the introduction of local government reform.  I would like the Minister to spell out in depth when the remainder of this legislation will be introduced and to tell the people, before we go to the polls in June, when the remainder of this legislation will be forthcoming.  This is only a kind of geographical extension of the area boundaries of Dublin and a few boundaries throughout the country.  That is really all that is <Col N="1499" /> in the Bill.  This is something that could be done without even a commission's report.  This is something that could be done on a population basis.  In the final analysis, the reason for the adjustments as outlined by the Minister was because the adjustments are on a population basis.  There was a statistics officer here; there were civil servants at the Minister's disposal and all that was required was a committee of civil servants to geographically, on a population basis, extend the boundaries.  That is exactly what has been done in most cases.  The Minister awaited a commission's report and then ignored it completely.  There is nothing in this reorganisation Bill to tell me that the Minister agreed with the submissions on local government reform.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell the Seanad before he completes his submission what is in the pipeline as regards the financing of local authorities in this State. Everybody is awaiting an announcement from the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, telling the councils how they are going to subsidise and finance local authorities, and I do not mean by the adjusted acre system.</P>
    <P>That system has not been put into train as yet and, indeed, never will come into operation.  There are indications that the variations of acreages, size, commonages, foothills, arable and other types of land throughout this State are going to be organised on an adjusted acre system in order to finance the local authorities of this State.  Of course, the Minister has no intention of doing this because he knows that the adjusted acre system will not be in operation.  All that has been done in the short term is to increase the number of councillors in the city by 27. A few other reorganisational methods have been adopted for one purpose, and one purpose only.  I am disappointed, as <Col N="1500" /> most of us here on this side of the House are.  I am not going further into it at the moment.  I will deal with this on a wider basis when we are dealing with the various sections on Committee Stage. Who am I to know in the Dublin metropolitan area whether you went out to Howth or whether you should have taken in the inner portion of Howth or the outer portion of Howth?  I am not in a position to tell the Minister or discuss the boundaries of that particular area.  Neither is the Minister in a position to argue about the terrain of counties that I represent.</P>

      <P>That may be, but if we try to discuss the Bill on these grounds I want to say to the Minister I would not be in a position to do that geographically. The Minister had, as I said, the submissions from the commission that was set up to examine the whole system of reform.  This was not done and I regret very much that it was not.  I am afraid that when we come down to the nitty-gritty of the Dublin metropolitan area and the various submissions that the Minister has made as regards boundaries, we will have to get a more enlightened back-up group into the Seanad to inform the Seanad what exactly it means to the city of Dublin and what it means to local government reform.  All I want to say is that I regret, as I am sure most councils in the country regret, that this Bill does not contain some elements of the long awaited local government reform.</P>
