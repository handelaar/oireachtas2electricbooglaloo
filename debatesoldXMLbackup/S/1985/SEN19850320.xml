      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The categorical refusal of students for consideration in certain areas for benefit or assistance on the automatic assumption that they are being supported by their families and the hardship that such categorical rejection is causing and to seek clarification on the matter which appears to be a frustration of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>In addition to the Order Paper for which I take responsibility under yourself, a Chathaoirligh, there has been a Supplementary Order Paper distributed in regard to the reporting back of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I take no responsibility for this being introduced.  Nevertheless, <Col N="1156" /> the matter should be taken and disposed of today.  Accordingly, I would suggest the Order of Business be No. a1 from the Supplementary Order Paper, followed by No. 1, followed by No. 4, that a break be taken from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., and that No. 5 be taken at 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 is being ordered as No. 4.  I know that Members on both sides of the House are interested in this Bill and by and large subscribe to the objectives of this Bill, whatever about the manner in which I and those who assisted me formulated it.  It is, therefore, a matter of considerable astonishment, not to say frustration to me, that notwithstanding that goodwill, the unwillingness, inability or lack of interest of the Government in the issue which has prevented them meeting their promises to the homeless over a period of almost two years have prevented this Bill being brought to completion.  My patience and the patience of other Independent Members who have introduced this Bill, has been carried far beyond what is reasonable to expect.  My final frustration was to discover that the Government have appointed the Department of the Environment as the focal point for the International Year for Shelter for the Homeless in 1987.  A Department who are incapable of drafting legislation on homelessness are now to become the focal point for an international campaign in 1987 on behalf of the homeless.  I regard that as something close to a gratuitous insult to the homeless, that the Department who apparently show no interest or ability have been chosen. Therefore, I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business that item No. 4 be taken after No. a1.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Senator Ryan. While I appreciate the importance of both the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, 1985, and the National Archives Bill, 1985, I suggest that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, has been before the House for a considerable length of <Col N="1157" /> time.  It has been stated by the Government that they are interested in this matter and that they wish to bring in legislation.  If they do so wish, I suggest they put their money where their mouth is, so to speak.  They should, at least, deal with the Bill before the House as quickly as possible, which would mean now.  I do not think it will make any great difference to the processing of either of the other two Bills if the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, is taken second on the Order of Business and I would suggest that this be done now.  If they had any legislation of their own to bring forward to replace this Bill, they had ample time to do it and have not done so.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan's amendment to the Order of Business that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, be taken second.</P>

      <P>Like my two Independent colleagues, I would like to support the motion that item No. 4 &mdash; Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 &mdash; be taken.  The Order of Business in this House is in something of a mess.  This Bill has been on the Order Paper as Item No. 4 for perhaps a year or 18 months. It has been ordered several times.  It is quite obvious that it is not going to come up.  It is completely dishonest to order something and pretend that it is going to come up when it is not going to come up.</P>
      <P>What I do not understand is if we do not have time to debate the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 &mdash; which apparently we do not &mdash; why did we not sit last Tuesday or Thursday?  On Wednesday last, we took the National Archives Bill, 1985, for one lousy hour. We postponed the National Archives Bill this week because we had the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, which is a very good Bill.  Why we could not have taken the National Archives Bill next Thursday, I do not know.  If we are not very careful we will have to sit in Holy Week &mdash; and not just in order to take the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill &mdash; and that would be sacrilege.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House, through the Chair, if the House is sitting tomorrow and also if it is, will we get an opportunity to debate the Bill dealing with the State take-over of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  Obviously this raises many issues, not least the totally outdated and inequitable jury system we find in civil cases and the scandal of having eight lawyers involved in jury actions in these cases, the tabs for which have to be picked up by the policyholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Hillery and I would like to ask if we are having legislation in the Seanad tomorrow in that regard.  Since the Government are on a blind date picking up the tabs for Allied Irish Banks without knowing the extent of the liability, it is a very serious matter and it should come to this House as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I adhere to the Order of Business as proposed and would urge the House to adopt it.  In regard to the question of the Seanad sitting tomorrow, I understand there is a wish to meet tomorrow, not in regard to any legislation on the Insurance Corporation of Ireland but because there is a Social Welfare Bill which must be law by 1 April I understood that it was the wish of the Opposition that we should at least start the proceedings tomorrow rather than have ourselves crowded in the discussion next week.  The proposal is that the House should sit tomorrow to initiate the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  By agreement, we would hope that the Second Stage would be resumed when we meet next Wednesday.  I do not have any knowledge of any legislation in regard to ICI.</P>

      <P>I was asked by the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to move this motion and accordingly I move:</P>
      <P>That the period for reporting back of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown be extended to the 2nd April, 1985.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee, at their meeting this morning learned with regret of the illness of its clerk and that because of this it was not possible to have the report assembled, printed and circulated to members in time for formal adoption today by the Joint Committee.  In the circumstances, the Joint Committee decided to defer formal adoption of the report to Wednesday next, 27 March 1985, and presentation to both Houses and publication to Tuesday, 2 April 1985. Members of the House will see that this was something which could not be either foreseen or avoided.  It is a regrettable situation but it is one of illness of a member of staff and in the circumstances the members of the committee had no option but unanimously to decide to seek a further brief extension in order that we may have our final meeting to adopt formally our report which is now basically, to all intents and purposes, completed. It will then be laid before the Houses and published on 2 April 1985.  I would ask for the support of the House for this further brief extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that this is a fairly formal motion asking the Seanad for another extension of time for the marriage breakdown committee.  This committee and its extensions have reached the realm of farce at this stage.  They have been looking for months, six months, three weeks, two months, two months &mdash; I have lost count.  I do not know whether this is the fourth, fifth or the sixth extension which the committee looked for.  It may be that this time, for the first time, there is a reasonable excuse for an extension. We have read in the newspapers &mdash; we have not actually seen the formal report &mdash; that this committee have failed to reach an agreement on the position of divorce, on whether to make a recommendation about divorce.  This committee have not only looked for about five extensions from this House and from the Dáil but have looked for five extensions to produce a report on marital breakdown which failed to make a recommendation for the purpose for which they were set up.  I am not going to force the House to have a vote on this because I think it would be wasting time, but I think it is absurd for a committee set up for a particular purpose &mdash; and that particular purpose is to make a recommendation on a vital issue, which is divorce &mdash; to ask the House for a fifth extension in order to produce a report which comes to no conclusions.</P>

      <P>This postponement would appear to be inevitable because of the cause of it.

      <P>Just in reply to what Senator Ross said, this is not a committee that was set up solely for the purpose of making recommendations about divorce. <Col N="1162" /> Whatever my personal feelings may be about the recommendations or lack of them, and the leaks about the proceedings of the committee last week may be accurate or inaccurate &mdash; I would argue that the report given last Tuesday night on Radio Telefís Éireann was totally inaccurate &mdash; the committee have at least moved to make one very firm recommendation, that there should be a referendum on this question.  That seems to be a step forward.  To dismiss this committee's work as just a matter of making a two line recommendation one way or the other, for divorce or not for divorce, is to ignore the fact that the committee have produced a report which will consist of approximately 170 to 200 pages and which deals with the whole range of questions with regard to the protection of the family, dealing with the question of marriage breakdown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not trying to deal with it in much detail.  I am simply saying that when we ask for this ten day extension we are doing so for a purely technical reason, because of the sickness of the clerk of the committee and to refer to this as a ridiculous extension seems to be quite unfair to the work of the committee, especially to those of us who have attended virtually every meeting of the committee over a period of almost two years and who have put a great deal of work into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion before the House, that the date be extended for the minimal period of ten days which will enable us to assemble the document which has been basically agreed between members of the committee.  In fairness to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House, I might say that there was not a party division on the recommendations of the committee. It should be said, also in fairness to the Fianna Fáil members of the committee, that the decisions of the committee were not made along totally party lines.  We look for this extension in order to allow the assembling of the report and <Col N="1163" /> its proper presentation to the House and to the public generally and to remind the House that it deals with a great many other important questions besides simply the question of a referendum on the question of divorce.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is in fulfillment of the commitment in the Programme for Government to re-establish the structure of the Combat Poverty Organisation with local involvement and the development of constructive community action against poverty.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the provisions of the Bill, it is relevant to recall the background to the measure, which goes back some 14 years and which embraces initiatives by Irish Governments, at EC level as well as at home.</P>
      <P>A major focal point in highlighting and bringing to public attention the existence and extent of poverty in Ireland was the Kilkenny Conference on Poverty in 1971, organised by the Catholic Bishops' Council for Social Welfare.  At that conference the estimate emerged that a quarter of the population of the country were poor. This conclusion aroused serious concern among statutory agencies, voluntary bodies, academic institutions and others concerned with poverty and the Coalition Government, which came into power in 1973 set about considering what action should be taken to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity to initiate action at EC level arose at the same time when the EC Commission was formulating its proposals for a new EC social action programme.  The Irish Government proposed that the programme should include specific action against poverty and this proposal was agreed when the programme was approved at the end of <Col N="1164" /> 1973.  Eventually in 1975 the Council of Ministers approved detailed proposals for the programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty to be carried out during 1975 and 1976.  The programme was subsequently extended to the end of 1980.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Irish Government took the view that whatever might emerge from the EC they should demonstrate their own commitment by pursuing the pilot schemes idea within the limit of their own resources.  In May 1974 the 25 member National Advisory Committee was established by the Minister for Social Welfare to design and implement a programme of experimental pilot schemes.  The membership included persons with a wide range of skills and experience in the fields of social research and practical social work, together with representatives of appropriate Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Both the Irish and EC programmes commenced in 1976 and terminated at the end of 1980.  The Irish programme was, of course, part of the EC programme and received EC funding for three of its four main schemes.  I would like to emphasise the pilot aspect of both programmes.  Because of their small scale they could not in themselves make any major impact on poverty nor were they intended to.  The purpose of the programme was to test new ways of dealing with groups of people in or at risk of poverty.  Such methods, if successful, could then be applied on a wider scale.</P>
    <P>The national committee submitted their final report to the then Minister in December 1980 and made a number of recommendations for future action to combat poverty based on the findings of the pilot programme.  One of their recommendations was for the establishment of an agency capable of operating at national, regional and local levels, which would develop and expand the work of the pilot schemes.</P>
    <P>The EC programme had several components. One was the pilot projects carried out in the member states, including Ireland.  Another element was a series of special studies on particular aspects of <Col N="1165" /> policy and on the perception of poverty. The third part was a report on the nature, causes and extent of poverty in each member state and an assessment of its policies to combat poverty.  The intention was that each report was to be compiled, mainly from existing sources, by independent experts in the country concerned so that the report did not necessarily represent the views of the Government of that country.</P>
    <P>A comparison of these reports subsequently included in the EC Commission's final report on the programme proved extremely disconcerting as far as this country was concerned.  Taking a poverty line of 50 per cent of average net income in each country the report disclosed that 23.1 per cent of households in Ireland were below the poverty line.  This was the highest proportion in the Community and was followed by Italy at 21.8 per cent and France and Luxembourg, both over 14 per cent.  I would like to stress that these figures relate to the average income in the country concerned and therefore refer to relative poverty.  The net national income in Ireland at the time was actually only 65.4 per cent of the EC average, the lowest in the Community.  These figures show that not only was Ireland the poorest country then in the Community but that the proportion of the population within Ireland who were poor in relative terms was the largest, indicating a more unequal distribution of income in the country.</P>
    <P>The report carried out in this country for the EC was based mainly on the Household Budget Survey, 1973.  My Department later contributed to a further study, carried out like the first by the Institute of Public Administration, which updated the data on the basis of the Household Budget Survey, 1980, and which was published in 1984.</P>
    <P>This second report concluded that the extent, risk and incidence of financial poverty in 1980 differed considerably from that in 1973.  Income maintenance policies had succeeded in reducing poverty among some groups outside the economically active but was unlikely to <Col N="1166" /> have reduced the risk sufficiently to prevent a rise in poverty.  Furthermore, the distribution of direct and gross incomes was more unequal in 1980 than in 1973. This and other studies produced in recent years confirm that the problem of poverty is as serious as ever, if not more so, and that public policies are not making a sufficient impact on it.</P>
    <P>The response of the previous Government to the report of the Combat Poverty Committee was to set up the National Community Development Agency in 1982.  It has already been explained, in the course of discussions on the National Social Services Board Bill, why this Government considered that that response was insufficient.  Briefly, it was felt that that agency had no clear and workable mandate particularly in the area of poverty.  Poverty was an issue that had to be singled out for special and positive attention, involving as it does so many areas of public policy such as social welfare, taxation, health and social services, education and housing.  Community development is one aspect, and a very important one, of the problem of poverty and it is given special emphasis in the new agency's functions.  On its own however it is not a sufficient response to the problem of poverty and the Community Development Agency had little chance of ever becoming an effective force in the fight against poverty.  The approach taken by this Government, therefore, as outlined in the Programme for Government, was that the Community Development Agency should be abolished and replaced by an agency whose explicit purpose would be to address the problem of poverty in our society and devise appropriate policies to deal with it.  This was in line with the recommendation of the national committee in their 1980 report on the pilot scheme to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards setting up the new agency, the Interim Board of the Combat Poverty Organisation were established in March 1984 to submit recommendations with regard to the structure, membership, staffing etc. of a permanent anti-poverty agency and the <Col N="1167" /> detailed terms of reference of such an agency, bearing in mind, <i>inter alia</i>, the role of the agency with regard to the drawing up in accordance with the Government's programme of an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning. The interim board submitted a report to the Minister containing detailed recommendations for the new agency and the proposals now before the House are based essentially on the board's proposal.</P>
    <P>It is considered essential that the new agency should be a statutory one and have the necessary status and permanence to enable them to carry out their functons effectively.  I would now like to give a brief resume of the main features of the legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the new agency will be responsible for three broad areas of activity in relation to poverty, namely, research, action and policy advice.  In line with the recommendation of the interim board it is envisaged that the primary role of the new agency should be that of &ldquo;facilitator&rdquo;.  In particular they should to a limited extent only be directly involved in carrying out action projects themselves but instead should initiate and assist the carrying through of projects by other agencies.  This aim is reflected in the functions of the agency set out in the Bill. As far as the research role of the new agency is concerned it is envisaged that the new agency would publish such material as they consider appropriate in this area.</P>
    <P>The need for a significant and well-planned community development component as part of a programme to combat poverty is also given explicit recognition in the Bill.  Community development in the sense of a planned programme of activities whereby people combine efforts with their fellow citizens to establish community needs and solve them through action is seen as a very important feature of an anti-poverty programme. The basic approach will be to assist and encourage disadvantaged people to involve themselves as much as possible in decisions concerning the services <Col N="1168" /> affecting them.  It is envisaged that the agency will be responsible for local action programmes either directly, to a limited extent, or by arrangement with other organisations to bring about effective practical intervention to combat poverty and to develop new techniques and strategies for dealing with poverty and inequality.  They will need to develop a close working relationship with local authorities, health boards and other relevant statutory bodies and ensure that the efforts of the agency, the statutory authorities and the local organisations are welded together to provide an integrated response to the needs of the poor.</P>
    <P>As part of the community development approach to combat poverty it is envisaged that the new agency should act as a resource centre for community development in relation to poverty.  This measure is designed to encourage facilities for training in community development, to stimulate evaluation and research and to promote initiatives and experiment in community work.  A resource agency of this kind could provide a worthwhile service to voluntary organisations and communities and also to central and local authorities and statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>The new agency will have a board of eight to ten members appointed by the Minister.  There will also be a full time chief officer to be known as the Director of the Agency who will be appointed by the board with the Minister's approval and he may be a member of the board.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the campaign against poverty in which the agency will be involved will be the EC programme. In December last the Council of Ministers approved a new programme of specific action against poverty to complement the economic and social policies of the member states and of other Community programmes.  An amount of 25 million ECU was provided for a four-year period to finance projects submitted by member states to the extent of 50 per cent of overall costs, or 55 per cent in exceptional cases.  An advertisement inviting projects to be submitted appeared in the press on 18 January 1985 and a large number of proposals have been received in response <Col N="1169" /> to this.  One of the tasks of the new agency when established will be in connection with the implementation and assessment of the EC programme as far as this country is concerned.  Meanwhile, pending the establishment of the agency, the Minister has asked the interim Board of the Combat Poverty organisation to examine and make recommendations on the projects to be put forward as this country's input to the programme.  The EC programme will come into operation in the autumn and project proposals have to be with the Commission within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I will be glad to answer any detailed questions arising from the Bill in the course of this debate.  The proposals in the Bill endeavour to take account of all that has happened in this area over the past decade.  There have been different approaches reflected in different policies adopted by successive Governments.  The approach now put forward seeks to draw on the most positive features of all different views and approaches.  To be effective the new agency will have to have a wide degree of support in the community and I hope that it will be possible to achieve a wide measure of agreement in relation to the proposals now put forward. It is in this spirit that I commend this Bill to the House for favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>The conditions which this Bill sets out to correct are indeed rampant in this country and have become particularly so over the past number of years. I do not have to remind the House of the high level of unemployment which is reaching record proportions and which continues to increase.  I do not have to remind the House of the problems which are a direct consequence of unemployment. They are indeed varied and widespread, and poverty is included in this category.  We know that public services have been cut to an all-time low and that inequality and social deprivation have become more and more acute.  More people than ever before are experiencing hardship and poverty.  We have now the new poor, people who in the past had <Col N="1170" /> worthwhile jobs, professional and semiprofessional. They are highly qualified people.  In the past some of them had been earning between £15,000 and £20,000 a year.  Now they are not only wondering how they will pay their mortgages but for the first time in their lives many of them are wondering where the next full meal will come from for themselves and their families.  This is a new situation and unfortunately a growing situation.</P>
      <P>In the past we have had a combat poverty programme which the Minister has referred to.  I cannot help feeling that many people at that time had a wrong impression of what that programme was about.  In fact I felt that its title was in a way a misnomer.  Many schemes which bore very little relationship to poverty were half implemented.  We can learn from those schemes and from the surveys and researches carried out.  We can learn from the mistakes of the past and hope to correct them in the future.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (c) of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and for that purpose the promotion, commission and interpretation of research;</P>
      <P>That will be one of the general functions of the agency.  We can learn from the past.  Could I ask the Minister in regard to this important area to what extent in the future are we going to have files and files of documents?  Are we going to have surveys by the score?  Are we going to have research and information taking years and years to complete while the real problem is not being tackled?  Are we going to spend our money on these surveys and researches?  Certainly some research might be necessary but we have had so much of it in the past that we have enough on record to tackle the problem in the most practical way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we going to have teams and teams of alleged experts?  Are we going to spend the money that is available on them rather than directing it to the people to whom it should be directed, namely, the poor and those who are deprived?  The <Col N="1171" /> Minister knows that we have many great organisations doing fantastic work in the area of poverty.  We should pay tribute to them for the great work they have done and are continuing to do.  Perhaps we should give pride of place to the St. Vincent de Paul Society.  This is a huge national organisation doing the most practical work possible in a quiet but very effective way.  They are present in practically every parish in the country. Full marks must be given to them for the work they do.  We know that when they appeal for funds from the people, the response is one of over-subscription. They are an organisation that deserve the highest possible tribute.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of this Bill provides for the engagement of consultants and advisers and for payment of fees to them.  Again I must come back to this as I feel very strongly about this aspect of the Bill. Are we going to spend our money on consultants, advisers and teams of experts?  In the past valuable money that should have been spent on the poor and the under-privileged was spent on these consultants and experts.</P>
    <P>Regarding appeals by various organisations, I believe that the Irish people and the people of the world respond magnificently to all cases of actual concern. Poverty and everything connected with poverty are matters of concern to all of us.  I do not have to remind the House of the response by the Irish people to the world scandal of Ethiopia.  So it is with other groups; maybe not with the same national network as the St. Vincent de Paul have, but groups like Simon, Hope and many others are all doing really fine work in their own way.  These groups know the real problems of poverty.  They know the problems on the ground.  I have no doubt that if tomorrow morning instead of going through the formality of discussing this Bill the Minister decided to pick one or two members from each of these groups he would have a first class combat poverty agency selected with practical on-the-ground knowledge.  That is what is needed.</P>
    <P>We cannot forget or ignore the work <Col N="1172" /> that the various community services councils are doing all over the country. They have practical, worthwhile projects. In my own town our local community services council hope to purchase a number of spreads of turf from bog developers at a cost of £200 a spread.  They hope to lease them out to poor families who would in turn save turf with the help of friends and their own families and repay the £200 over a fixed term.  I do not have to tell everybody that with a bag of coal at £7.90 and turf briquettes at £1 or more a bale, a few bills could be cut by more than half.  I am sure that this exercise by the Athlone Community Services Council is a practical exercise in tackling the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>There are many priority areas for immediate action and I believe that they must be identified and tackled as soon as possible.  The biggest problems are in the under-privileged urban districts.  We know that many of our problems stem from those particular areas, such as vandalism, crime and drugs.  Certainly there is need for swift action in these areas. We should and must have increased cooperation and participation between the urban population and the various services. We must set up as quickly as possible organised contact between all persons, organisations and institutions that are involved, and who would become involved, in a positive joint action campaign against poverty in areas such as I have mentioned.  This must be backed up by a huge improvement in the physical, social and communal conditions in these under-privileged areas.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale we have what have become known as the impoverished rural areas.  Here there is a different form of poverty.  There is a high degree of socio-economic problems, such as poor health, housing, and obviously low incomes.  Here community development is vital.  In many ways it is being implemented by the priests, the Garda or the local groupings.  It is important that this contact must continue.</P>
    <P>Other areas of poverty abound in this country.  All areas will have their own methods of dealing with the problem.  For <Col N="1173" /> example, there are the problems of the elderly and the long term unemployed. We hope the Social Welfare Bill will improve that situation.  There are the problems of the single parent family and the travelling people.  When I refer to the travelling people I hesitate to refer to the many wealthy types in this category who are quite common, but there are many genuine travelling people who need help. They are all in some way poverty stricken and need urgent assistance.  What should be a priority in many cases is education.  I say this from my own practical experience and having spoken to many people who have been active in various organisations. What is vital and very necessary in terms of short term educational commitment is in the area of household budget control. How people spend the money they receive in the most effective way possible is very important.  Usually the money they receive is social welfare benefit of one kind or another.  I know of some families who have a greater income than many Members of this House, yet come Tuesday morning, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, or some other organisation, are called in to help them out because they cannot control their budgets for the week on the large amount of money they receive from the State.  Therefore, education in household management is vital.  In particular, we should train young people how to earn their living, try to eliminate the hand-out, endeavour, as far as possible, to gear them for what they would like to do in life, whatever they have a flair for, rather than endeavour to teach them academic subjects.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to the membership of the agency.  I have already made what I think would be a practical suggestion. Ten is too small a number to operate with effectively.  We need practical, knowledgeable people who have a knowledge of poverty on the ground.  The Bill provides that members will be appointed by the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to appoint people with proven records in this work.  It should not be a Dublin or a Pale membership but should be scattered right across the country.  That is why I <Col N="1174" /> say perhaps 15 or 18 members might be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The role of the Minister is all too obvious in the setting up of the agency and in the subsequent day-to-day affairs of the agency.  The danger might be to kill the morale of the agency.  There is far too much ministerial interference in the affairs of the agency.  We must remember that the manning of the agency will be on a voluntary basis.  Too much involvement by the Minister could prove, in those circumstances, disastrous.  The role of the EC, obviously, will be important.  This was referred to by the Minister in his speech today.  He said:</P>
    <P>One of the tasks of the new agency when established will be in connection with the implementation and assessment of the EC programmes as far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>Can I assume that funds will be available from the EC for the particular work in hand or will it be direct Government money?  Finance is not provided specifically in the Bill.  I suggest that a lack of reference to finance is a criticism of the Bill, a reflection on it.  We know that there is an EC poverty programme but it does not follow that the poverty problems of the EC are totally similar to the kind of problems we have.  However, I am sure that we can learn from their experiences.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the need to learn from the past.  With regard to a previous agency, two members, one a prominent priest from County Donegal resigned because they felt that the work envisaged was not being properly carried out, that the money was being spent in areas that had no relationship whatsoever to the problems of the poor.  I want to stress the point that there is a great need for the views of the poor, and the people working on behalf of the poor, to be heard.  There is a need for the views of those affected by poverty to be presented to the public, a greater awareness of the problems of the poor and they should be highlighted in every way possible.  I hope that the media will comment on those problems. I know the media tend to look for a story that will sell well or a story that has a <Col N="1175" /> degree of sensationalism.  The problem of poverty in our midst is so important that I appeal for a greater awareness of it by the media and by the public.  We talk about justice and human rights, not just in Ireland but all over the world.  Surely combating poverty is basic to these objectives. My hope would be for a really worth while working relationship between the health boards, the local authorities and all the other groups concerned with the problem, whether they be statutory or non-statutory bodies, and <i>ad hoc</i> groups, and that they would all respond to the needs of the poor and would ensure that the efforts of the Combat Poverty Agency would be very successful.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill at this time.  It is a measure that we have been looking forward to for some time.  It is based on experiences gained in the past and an awareness of the fact that efforts made in the past did not succeed in eliminating poverty as those who introduced various measures, social welfare schemes and so on, had hoped they would do.  We are speaking at a time when mankind is very much aware of the extent of poverty on a universal scale.  We are living in an age when thousands of millions of pounds are spent in building up stores of arms to destroy mankind, and as this extravagance is going on, tens of thousands of people are dying from hunger in Africa, Indonesia, South America and different parts of the world.  It may be that future generations will have harsh words to say about the generation of people who could squander the wealth of the world in such a way and at the same time see tens of thousands of fellow people dying from hunger, and in some cases children dying shortly after birth because of the inability of man to give them a fair start in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland certain Governments have set about eliminating poverty by various measures adopted under the Social Welfare Acts.  Pensions and allowances are given to people of old age and to the infirm.  Unemployment assistance is <Col N="1176" /> given to those who find it difficult to obtain employment.  We have differential rents, free fuel schemes and in general we have been conscious that there was a large section of the community who needed support and help.</P>
    <P>It comes as a great surprise to people to learn that there are so many people living below the poverty line.  In discussing a Bill of this nature we will do something to draw the attention of people to the fact that we are not as well off as we should be and that the less well off section of our community is not as well catered for as we thought they were.  The main purpose of the Bill is to set about eliminating this and to examine the causes of the poverty which prevails.  Those who are interested in the work carried out by the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other charitable organisations are quite aware of the great poverty that exists in different parts of the country.  Some people have come to the conclusion that this poverty is confined to cities and bigger towns.  It is also true that poverty prevails in rural Ireland.  People do not know how to fend for themselves.  There are people with a reasonable intake of money who make such bad use of it that they, or members of their families, are on the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is the function of the Combat Poverty Agency to examine the causes of poverty.  The cause is not always lack of money.  It is sometimes due to an over indulgence in alcohol and in some cases to bad management.  All the causes will have to be examined and it is hoped that as a result more beneficial work will be done and that the taxpayer will have a better return on the money he is prepared to contribute to the various social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced as a result of knowledge gained from attempts to deal with these problems in the past.  Those attempts, as can be seen in the Minister's statement, have not met with the success that was hoped.  The Minister stated that it was estimated that three-quarters of the population were poor.  Different Governments took steps to improve the situation but the net result was that those <Col N="1177" /> people are no better off now than they were then.  Indeed, one would gather from what the Minister said that things have become worse.  Therefore, it is necessary that an agency be set up to examine the whole scope of the measures that are being adopted at present, why they are falling down and what more has to be done in relation to the nature, causes and extent of poverty, and for that purpose to promote, commission and interpret research and develop greater public understanding of the nature and causes of such poverty.  With such understanding there will be a greater willingness to help.</P>
    <P>The most recent proof of that, for example, was when the disaster in Ethiopia became known to our people.  They subscribed more <i>per capita</i> than any other nation to alleviate hunger and distress there.  It is necessary that people who have such an outlook, who are charitable by nature and who do not like to see their fellow man suffer, understand the extent of the problem.  Then they are more willing to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the new agency will develop community help.  There is a tradition in Ireland that the local community gather round to help a person who, say, has come across bad times through death, losses on the farm or whatever the cause might be.  We hope that the agency will help to redevelop that community spirit.  It is hoped to call on the services of the local authorities and the health boards.  It is necessary at all times that we have the closest cooperation between the different agencies and that we have people actively involved in the scheme who know the people they are dealing with.</P>
    <P>It is true that changes in society and in the way of life have brought on new forms of poverty.  We have, unfortunately, marriage breakdowns with husbands deserting their wives.  Workers involved with the St. Vincent de Paul Society will testify that it takes a long time for deserted wives to establish the fact that they are deserted and have difficulty in obtaining the allowances to which they are entitled by law.  Only for organisations such as the <Col N="1178" /> St. Vincent de Paul Society and the work carried out by them, those people would be absolutely destitute.</P>
    <P>There are families whose breadwinner earns a good wage but because of addiction to alcohol or gambling the wife and children in the home are often living below the poverty line.  It is something which will have to be dealt with through greater education and understanding so that the head of the household will appreciate what his responsibilities are. Such circumstances prevail and result in great poverty for some people, when in normal conditions there would not be any poverty.</P>
    <P>In general, I am glad to see this Bill introduced.  I believe it will do a great deal to co-ordinate the efforts of different organisations engaged in helping the less well off sections of our community.  We will have profited from the experiences of the past.  For example, there is a wealth of evidence and information in the final report of the Pilot Scheme to Combat Poverty in Ireland, 1974-1980.  In this report we have a very in-depth assessment of conditions in the country.  When the new agency is set up, I expect its members will draw largely on the information contained in that final report and that we will have a co-ordinated and well directed effort to deal with poverty, bearing in mind that it is in our nature not to be happy to see people on the poverty line or below it.  The taxpayer who contributes to the relief of poverty is entitled to expect that the very best possible work will be done with the contributions he makes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fashionable to say to the world at large that we do not have real poverty in Ireland, of the kind that exists in the Third World.  It is one of these extraordinary self-righteous things that people who tend to be extremely well off usually advance to the world, somehow in justification of something or other about Irish society.  Nevertheless, it is fashionable to suggest that we do not have real poverty in Ireland.  I will begin what I hope will be coherent comments on the Bill, on the nature of poverty and <Col N="1179" /> related matters by putting a couple of basic facts on the record.</P>
      <P>The Simon Community in Cork told me recently that 12 months ago about four families a week used to come to them looking for food.  Last November this had escalated to close to 20 families a day looking for food.  I know the people involved: it is not a question of them being easily conned, it is a question of a basic reality.  A number of teachers in primary schools have told me they have now identified why large numbers of children in their schools are listless and disinterested.  It is because the children are coming to school hungry something the teachers did not notice three or four years ago but they notice it now.  The sort of theorising that is thrown around, the rationalisation, the manipulation of figures that is used particularly by spokesmen of the Government and, indeed, of their predecessors, that somehow there is a safety net being maintained in the face of the recession which is preserving the living standards of the poor, are fundamentally in conflict with the facts of people's experiences.  The facts are that people who are poor are becoming rapidly poorer, that a whole series of oppressions are being piled on their shoulders and that things that we would like to pretend do not exist, for example, basic hunger, are now a fact of experience for many people in Irish life.  I know of one or two people who do not eat for a few days in the week in order to pay the rent for their accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reassuring and maybe a sign of progress to have the issue of poverty debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas. There was a long period in Irish life when talking about poverty was regarded as only one step away from subversion, Marxism and so on, that there was a certain healthiness about being poor, that it was a sign of the purity of the strain and of our detachment from earthy things and that we did not have any poverty.  Of course, the reality is that two of our major parties presided over a very effective Irish solution to the problem of poverty which is that we exported our poor people <Col N="1180" /> to Britain and the United States.  One million people emigrated in the period since the foundation of the State, who effectively relieved our increasing and burgeoning poverty problem.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, they are at home. Notwithstanding the encouragement of prominent industrialists, businessmen and politicians, they resolutely refused to emigrate and be shifted off to the Ruhr and the other great industrial areas of Germany to share in the exploitation of the Turks, the Greeks and the other people who provided cheap labour for those countries.  Because they resolutely refused to emigrate, we are beginning to experience the realities of what poverty on a wide scale does to a society.  That is beginning to be manifest in particular in matters such as crime and so on.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the publication of this Bill, which took two and a half years to gestate, to be considered, discussed, amended and all that goes into the process of producing a Bill, the reason for its delay escapes me and I suspect will escape anybody else who reads it.  It is welcome as far as it goes, but it is hard to understand why it took two years of work to produce this small document, large sections of which are copied directly from another Act. Nevertheless, the Bill is there.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in terms of what it proposes to do and above all in terms of the resources that it is intended to make available, is not our response to poverty.  On the other hand, the increase in repression by way of the Criminal Justice Act and the extensive and apparently continuing humiliation of poor people through the labour exchanges, through cutbacks in public housing and other areas like that, are the reality of our response to poverty &mdash; the real response is a response of control, a response of suppression and a response of preservation of the established order of society.</P>
    <P>I wish somebody somewhere in a Government Department would even begin to quantify the problem of poverty, not just to tell us in shameful, round figures that there are a million poor in <Col N="1181" /> this country, but to begin to tell us that that million people are not one homogeneous group but are, if you like, the army of the marginalised, all those in Irish society who for one reason or another are excluded from the mainstream.  It is indeed a complex mix of people all of whom are marginalised.  We can go through that army of the marginalised and identify some of the problem areas and put them yet again on the record of Irish society through the record of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The average pension payment in 1979 amounted to less than a quarter of average industrial earnings.  That was a very marginal, almost insignificant, increase on the ratio between pensions and industrial earnings five or six years before. Effectively, we are making no progress and, indeed, there are a considerable number of campaigns to suggest that there are good, necessary, hard-nosed &mdash; whatever are all the appropriate epithets and adjectives which justify the callous nature of many public policies today &mdash; arguments that we must maintain these dreadful relativities.</P>
    <P>Pensioners are in some way, to use a phrase that could be misused, the acceptable form of poverty.  It is easy and acceptable politically to talk about our old people as long as you do not suggest that we should re-use resources, because if you suggest we should re-use resources, you must talk about what other deprived group you are taking the resources from. There is this enormous willingness in society to campaign vigorously for redistribution, but the form of redistribution that we are campaigning for is redistribution within and between different groups who comprise our one million poor, not redistribution from those who have to those who have not, but redistribution from one group who have not to other groups who have not.  It is particularly fashionable among bankers, employers and industrialists when they advocate means tests and when they talk about confining social services to those who really need them, a category which apparently is easier for a banker to identify than anybody actually working with <Col N="1182" /> poor people.  Nevertheless, even in the relative hierarchy of fashionable kinds of poor, the one which is least discussed, the one people tend to qualify with all sorts of hedging of bets, is the category of the unemployed.  Neither the party which usually occupy the benches in front of me, nor the major party opposite are really prepared to accept that the unemployed are poor.  They are either a temporary phenomenon, they are in need of incentives or they are in need of campaigns in terms of abuses or something.</P>
    <P>The first and most fundamental characteristic of unemployment is poverty.  If we are to talk about dealing with poverty we cannot talk about it in terms of the fashionable to some extent, or the socially acceptable marginalised groups, but we must talk about it in terms rather of the groups which are central to our society today and which, given the pessimism of most Irish politicians, are going to be central to Irish society for the indefinite future.  Among those groups loom largest the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Put quite simply there is no point in dealing with poverty in Irish society. There is no point in expounding enormous amounts of rhetorical good-will if the levels of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit remain as they are, pathetically inadequate to support an individual and pathetically inadequate to support a family.  All the research, all the campaigning and all the self-help groups in the world will not change the basic fact that that income is inadequate, that poverty prevails in the ranks of the unemployed and will continue to prevail.  All the psychological studies and the damage done by unemployment are meaningless if we do nothing about the income of the unemployed. Our society is not just characterised by an indifference to the plight of the unemployed, it is characterised by a positive hostility to the unemployed, a lack of sympathy to their needs and to their feelings and, most of all, by the apparent eternal &ldquo;hype&rdquo; about abuses of the social welfare system, abuses which are to be <Col N="1183" /> responded to, I understand, in the Social Welfare Bill which we will get tomorrow, in terms of increased penalties, increased vigilance, increased numbers and almost a suggestion of a new category of vigilantes to deal with these nasty people who are defrauding the State.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the arguments of whether there is a marginal problem of abuse &mdash; the figure usually quoted represents about .1 of 1 per cent of the total social welfare expenditure &mdash; the atmosphere that is created by people who have power, influence, money and services available to them, is characterised by hostility to and denigration of the unemployed. Undermining the dignity of the unemployed is bad enough, but when Governments and Ministers respond to that with more penalties, more investigations and more downright cruelty to the unemployed, then one has to say that there is not just an indifference to the unemployed, there is a downright hostility towards them.  Why, I do not know, and what it is based on, I do not know. Of course, the 250,000 people who are unemployed are not all saints, but they are, before everything else, victims of our inability to order our affairs.  It can be truthfully said that most of those who criticise unemployment abuse, who query the alleged disincentive value of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, who suggest more stringent controls over access to unemployment benefit &mdash; many in the ranks of Fine Gael suggest that the unemployed should be conscripted into the Army, as a Fine Gael MEP has said on at least two occasions &mdash; have one thing in common, they have never seen the inside of a labour exchange.  They have never seen the inside of a social welfare office.  They never had to suffer the humiliation of signing on, the moral degradation of the long queues, the deliberately humiliating atmosphere of the extraordinary procedure of having to sign a receipt for money before it is placed in your hand and, above all the humiliation of being compelled to be available for work when work is no longer available. <Col N="1184" /> In that context the Minister for Health and Social Welfare sent a letter which is a classic of its kind in terms of indifference. Two of our young footballers had the tremendous honour of competing for Ireland in the Soviet Union.  They were enormously successful and were away from home for a fortnight.  They came back, and discovered they had lost their entitlement to unemployment assistance because they were not available for work. Together with a number of other people I raised the matter with the Minister, and his concluding remarks were that these people were not available for work and that perhaps the Football Association of Ireland would keep that in mind in future when they are selecting people to play football outside the country.  This seemed to suggest that if these young people were not employed the football association should not pick them because if they are unemployed we cannot support them.</P>
    <P>That, more than anything else, characterises the attitude to the unemployed and this nonsensical provision about availability for work in a society where everybody, even those who claim to have the most optimistic Ronald Reaganite views of the future of the free enterprise system, accept that there will not be work for everybody in the future.  If we insist on oppressing the unemployed by insisting on a qualification of availability for work to justify their getting the pittance we give them, then we are not supporting the unemployed.  We are not assisting the unemployed.  We are consistently, methodically and systematically humiliating them.  It seems extraordinary that when people talk at length about poverty and social welfare they talk about widows and old people, but they leave the unemployed to, at best, a throwaway remark at the end of their speeches.  I have said often that it is time we stopped talking about unemployment as if it were some abstract economic statistic and started talking about the humiliation of the unemployed.  One of the qualities that is attributed to the unemployed is the apparent unwillingness to work.  It appears that there is a sustained view <Col N="1185" /> within the Establishment that if you raise unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit too high it becomes a disincentive to work.  It is fascinating that those who talk about these disincentives would spend as much on a meal as a single person on unemployment assistance has to live on for a week.  Nevertheless, those same people can pronounce on the disincentive nature of unemployment assistance. One of the consequences of that in recent years has been a policy of successive Governments tying what they call our short term social welfare rates more to the rate of wage increases than to the rate of inflation.  The truth is that if anything is to be done about the plight of the unemployed there is only one immediate remedy available and that is a substantial, real and fundamental raising of the rates of payment to the unemployed.  All the talk, all the concern, all the hands on hearts and all the political posturing is meaningless if we leave unemployed people as they are.  All the talk about alienation, psychological damage, a sense of worthlessness and pointlessness is a load of meaningless claptrap unless people identify that what the unemployed need now, immediately, is an income on which they can live in dignity.</P>
    <P>Unemployment leads to crime, to alcoholism, to drug abuse and probably to psychiatric illness.  Our response to the problem of unemployment is to humiliate these people even further.  It is a shame that we not only cannot provide employment for these people but we assist in providing a series of humiliations through which they must pass on the road to the pittance we offer them as unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There are other large areas of marginalisation in Irish society.  Our single parents in terms of income and housing provisions are severely discriminated against.  Of our 40,000 old people living alone, 60 per cent of them do not have hot water, 30 per cent have no water, and 10 per cent have no electricity.  So much for statistics.  This is one of the interesting queries I would like to put to the Minister: is he really sure that we need yet more and more research on poverty? <Col N="1186" /> What has been generated in the last ten years is not a solution to the problem of poverty but an enormous volume of research on poverty and its nature.  If we could talk about research which is related to action to solve a problem it would be fine, but we have a volume of statistics which defy description.  I could not even begin to go through the volumes of books on the problem of poverty that even a layman like myself has access to.</P>
    <P>Our 13,000 travellers, 50 per cent of them children, were promised legislation 12 months ago, not quite as long as the homeless have been promised legislation and not nearly as long as our children have been promised legislation.  But, all promised legislation of a serious kind has one thing in common, that is, the promise has been broken.  Apart from the travelling people's problems of income and housing, they now have to suffer being the scapegoats for every outburst of serious crime anywhere in Ireland.  A traveller is anybody who is travelling and, therefore, if the person suspected of having committed a crime has moved away, one can always say he was a traveller, even though one was not attacking the travelling community.  It is particularly sad to see Members of this House, as one particular individual has done, develop a prejudice against the travelling community in this city.</P>
    <P>On the Tallaght by-pass in 1981 there were 80 caravans and from those 80 caravans there were more than 40 children in hospital at one time.  We let those people wait and the Government make and break their promises.  It would not be fair for me to continue talking about the problems of the homeless, but, nevertheless the following Ministers, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, and Deputy Séamus Pattison, have all made promises about dealing with the problem of the homeless.  The Minister of State responsible for Youth Affairs in a blunt expression said he was going to meet the problem head on.  Wherever he met the problem head on, I have not seen the <Col N="1187" /> consequences of it yet.  Finally, the Taoiseach made two speeches about home-lessness in the last six months and he promised to do something about the problem.  The one common characteristic of all those promises is that they have all been broken, and the problem of the homeless remains.  I would like to quote from a survey carried out by the National Campaign for the Homeless on Ireland's young homeless.  They determined that there were approximately 800 young homeless people in this country.  Among the other things they discovered was that a large number of the agencies who had met homeless young people concluded that those homeless young people were sleeping rough before they came into contact with the agencies.  I wonder how much do we need to know about any problem related to poverty, causing poverty, or manifesting poverty, before we do something about it.  It took us two and a half years to get this Bill and apparently it is going to take us until 1987 to get the legislation on the homeless.  I wonder how long it is going to take us to get the legislation on travellers and what it will be like when it comes.</P>
    <P>Apart from our homeless we have our long stay psychiatric patients.  Whatever their present plight, I fear for their future because the fashion of community psychiatric care is now threatening to destabilise their lives.  They are allegedly going to be allowed to return to the community to the tender mercies of our community care services.  Anybody who has had any experience of the way our community care services operate would be anything but enthusiastic about this move.  Anybody who saw a recent British television programme on community care for psychiatric patients and the way they all inevitably gravitated into hostels, dosshouses, cheap lodgings and positions where they were not cared for or fed, will have a profound suspicion of what really is involved in community psychiatric care.</P>
    <P>Real community psychiatric care will inevitably be more expensive than hospitalisation. I see officialdom and politicians <Col N="1188" /> latching on to the concept of community psychiatry with such overwhelming enthusiasm I have a suspicion that the motivation may be as much financial as it is compassion or therapeutic.  I want to warn this House and families and relatives of people in long stay psychiatric hospitals to be extremely vigilant because what is described as community psychiatric care may well mean you doing a job instead of the State doing it, and doing a job that you are incapable and unable to do so that the State can save money.  We have 14,000 long stay psychiatric patients. They are liable to be discharged from hospitals into what will appear on the surface to be very caring and compassionate community psychiatric caring agencies.  The evidence is that no resources, no back-up, no home help and none of the necessary range of services that will be needed to achieve what is obviously an admirable objective, will be available. What we will have is another problem discharged into marginalisation and into the hostels and dosshouses where people are more or less permanently invisible.</P>
    <P>One thing I have learned over the last ten years is that whether we have an area which is called community care under our health boards, there is hardly any area where community care actually exists. Let me give an example of community care in an area related to psychiatry.  I know a group of 21 parents in Cork who have children who are profoundly and severely mentally handicapped.  These brave people decided for the best reasons that they would not institutionalise their children, that they would keep them at home.  This decision was based on concern and love for their children and not on any other reason.  They discover that because they do not institutionalise their children there is no provision for them. They want training for their children on a day care basis, but that cannot be provided. They want travel facilities for their children on a day care basis, but that cannot be provided.  If one can draw any conclusions from that it is that that is an interesting microcosm of the future of community care.  If their children were not handicapped they could get travel <Col N="1189" /> services to school, but because they are profoundly handicapped no such travel services is available.  If these children were in permanent residential care it would cost the State between £10,000 and £20,000 a year to maintain them, but out of these institutions it costs the State very little. Nevertheless, the inability, the inflexibility, or the downright pigheadedness of the statutory agencies leaves these parents profoundly on their own.  Therefore, if our long stay psychiatric patients are to be cared for, then they must be cared for either by upgrading the currently existing institutions, by replacing them with new institutions, or by community care services which are properly funded, properly monitored and properly re-organised as needs change and develop.</P>
    <P>It is often omitted in discussions like this that we have an extensive problem of rural poverty.  In 1979 there were 40,000 farm families with an income of less than £2,000 a year.  It is one of the regrettable characteristics of Irish life that one of the real blows against poverty, by which I identify the smallholders' assistance, is now being pared back and assessed in ways which seem to be adding to the humiliation of yet another marginalised group.  The anger that many Members of this House showed at the humiliating way smallholders were assessed for smallholders' assistance was admirable.  I only regret that the continuing and similar humiliation of the urban unemployed does not seem to provoke anything like the same sense of rage and outrage.</P>
    <P>Another area which is very fashionable in Ireland today, fashionable in the sense that it seems to be the recipe for our future economic salvation, is those who are poorly paid and, if we are to believe the economic gurus, these are the people who should be the salvation of the country. From what I can see they are the salvation of a series of vested interests. People working in the hairdressing profession, in many areas of catering and, judging from consistent reports, many of the employees of the legal profession, seem to be paid quite astonishingly small sums of money for their week's work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> We come back to this extraordinary proposal that one of the Government parties seem to be committed to, that is, to link unemployment assistance to earnings.  That seems to be no more than a conspiracy to preserve low pay and to copperfasten inequality.  What have we to say about an education service where almost 10 per cent of our children leave school before they are 15 years old, and 15 per cent leave at 15?  This means that close to one in four of our children leave school at or before the minimum age.</P>
    <P>The poor have inadequate income and inadequate services in the areas of health, education and the environment.  Yet, sadly, they seem to tolerate it.  They tolerate the way they are treated; they tolerate their problems being put on the long finger, and they tolerate the indifference that is shown to them.  How do we as a society tolerate the absence of children's legislation and the appalling ignorance about the absence of children's legislation when the Minister of State can say the same thing as his senior Minister said 12 months ago and get headlines again, can announce the same thing three years in a row in virtually the same wording and get headlines on each successive occasion?  It astonishes me that we, as a society, care so little for our children that the standstill sort of announcements that successive Ministers and junior Ministers from the Department of Health have made about children's legislation, are still apparently regarded as news by the media.  We have done nothing about our children; we are doing nothing about our children, and, judging by the passing reference to juvenile justice in the national plan, we do not propose to do anything about that area for a long time.</P>
    <P>Why do our poor people tolerate all this?  Why do our old people, our unemployed, in particular our young unemployed, tolerate this?  It is because there is one characteristic common to all our poor people, and that is powerlessness because poverty is no accident. People are poor because they are powerless, or perhaps they are powerless because they are poor.  It is really a <Col N="1191" /> chicken and egg situation.  It is no accident, for instance, that the voting participation levels in poor areas of cities is much lower than anywhere else.  I wonder if the two major parties would enthusiastically support the idea of making voting compulsory.  This might upset delicate balances in a large number of urban constituencies.</P>
    <P>Many urbanised poor people see the forces of law and order not as a support but as an agent of oppression.  It is also a fact that most poor people, if they have the misfortune to end up in court, where people are supposed to be equal before the law, find the court procedures anything but equal from their viewpoint.  The commonality of interests that exists in court procedures between the Garda, the legal profession and the judiciary, is further evidence of the powerlessness of poor people.  Our prison population is comprised largely of poor people.  Irrespective of who commits the crimes in society, those who end up in prison are poor, they are people without employment opportunities, people without educational background, people who cannot read, and a substantial minority who cannot do basic addition and subtraction. The law is not equal and citizens are not equal before the law.</P>
    <P>The oppression of poor people is not confined to the State or to the agents of the State in the areas of law enforcement. We deliver, organise and run social services as an instrument of oppression and, indeed, in many cases an instrument of control.  I have already instanced the quality of labour exchanges &mdash; if I can use the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo; in the context of labour exchanges.  There is an extraordinary rigmarole involved in getting a medical card.  If any of those who pronounce most about the need for means tests had ever to go through the rigmarole of getting medical cards, of qualifying for all the so-called benefits that are available, the system would collapse rapidly under the volume of protests, as was evidenced in the case of small farmers assistance. When they were subjected to the humiliations <Col N="1192" /> that are commonplace in urban areas the system was rapidly improved and humanised.</P>
    <P>A characteristic example of the humiliation of the poor is in the social welfare appeals system.  There is no specific evidence presented to a person who is appealing against disqualification. There is no ability to cross-examine those who make the allegations against them and there is no confrontation with their accusers in the process of appealing against disqualification.  The legal aid board are not allowed to take an interest in social welfare law and social welfare cases.  If ever I saw society carefully preserving itself from the threat that people might feel they were equal before the law, that administrative decision is a case in point, even though the Coolock Law Centre identifies social welfare appeals as one of the major areas of legal concern for poor people.</P>
    <P>If we are to remedy poverty we must first identify its causes.  Somewhere in this Bill there is a reference to do precisely that, and as far as it goes it is worthwhile. Poverty is not an accident.  It is one of the fashionable middle-class liberal virtues to talk about poverty as if the poor are the people we happened to forget, that somehow we did not really notice that people were poor for the last 20 years, but now that we know there are poor people in society we are going to do something about it.  Poverty is not an accident.  It is a direct consequence of the way we order society.  It is a reflection of the values of society and in particular, it is a reflection of the emphasis on competition as a basic value in society.  Competition is used in education and as a mark of progress in economic matters.  We have a society which is based on competition, and in competition there are winners and losers. In order to identify the winners, we enshrine a level of affluence and consumption as a mark of success.  If there are winners then there must be losers, because people's success cannot be measured in material terms.  If there is not a benchmark against which to measure success, it is necessary to have poor people in order that the success of those who are <Col N="1193" /> successful in our ruthless, competitive society can be measured.  Poverty is not an accident.  It is a necessary consequence of the values that we have as a society. The poor are necessary to reassure the powerful that they are successful.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of words used to describe the poor.  Words like &ldquo;under privileged, deprived and socially disadvantaged&rdquo; should be abandoned because they imply that the whole thing was an accident, an unfortunate error.  The poor are not deprived, they are not underprivileged, they are not socially disadvantaged. They are oppressed.  They are not some group who happen to be there by accident.  They are a consequence of the values on which Irish society chooses to operate.  They are necessary for society to sustain itself and to sustain the levels of activity in society.  We build into our society an assumption about how people work and what causes society to operate efficiently.</P>
    <P>Poverty is cyclical.  Children are born into poor families.  Because they are poor their housing is poor.  Because their housing is poor, their health is poor and because they are poor the health services they get are poor.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Medical Social Research Board clearly demonstrate that the children of the poor or the oppressed, have poorer health.  There are higher levels of infant mortality among poor people.  It all amounts to a cycle, because they are poor, and malnourished they leave school early.  The cycle continues. In this cycle of poverty it would appear that the only intervention we as a society can make is in the prescription of tranquillisers in large volume to preserve the sanity of those who have to function within that society.</P>
    <P>I remember the remarks of a woman from the inner city of Dublin who was being prescribed tranquillisers in large quantities.  When she discovered the price of the tranquillisers she said that if she was given the cash equivalent of the tranquillisers she would not need them at all because she would have an income sufficient to support her family.  It appears that the one thing we can do <Col N="1194" /> without qualification and without limit is prescribe pills, drugs and medicines to people to preserve their placidity because I suspect that without tranquillisers people would not tolerate what we impose on them.</P>
    <P>If poverty is not an accident then we must recognise that there are those in our society who have a vested interest in the preservation of poverty.  Five years ago, it would not have been fashionable to say that.  The speeches of those who lecture about competitiveness and who simplify competitiveness down to income and wages make one begin to realise that what they are really talking about is a low income economy.  If the income from work is to be kept low then the consequence of that is that the income for people who are not at work, whether they are pensioners or unemployed people must be kept even lower.  Therefore, those who lecture us about competitiveness and the competitiveness myth and particularly the wage correlation with the competitiveness myth are effectively lecturing us on the need to preserve poverty in Irish society.  People are needed to do poorly-paid jobs.  People are needed to preserve poorly-paid employment particularly in large areas of the tourist industry where we are told that high wage rates are driving up prices and frightening off tourists.  Apparently we must have people who are prepared to work at wage levels which enable us to charge what are deemed to be attractive rates.</P>
    <P>Many people have a vested interest in poverty.  There is nothing unusual in that. The history of society for the last 200 years is a history of conflict between the interests of those who control wealth and capital and those who do not.  It is one of the cycles of history that at present those who control wealth and capital are dominant in terms of influence and in terms of the thinking of society.  To deal with poverty fundamentally we must deal with the structure of society, with the system of economic and social values in which society chooses to operate and the whole social order.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke to a poverty conference in Kilkenny in 1981 he said <Col N="1195" /> that if we were to eliminate poverty we would have to &ldquo;subvert&rdquo; the social order at the time.  It was probably the only time the Taoiseach committed himself to subversion on a grand scale but it was a most appropriate commitment and one that I hope he has not forgotten entirely. Perhaps the Minister will remind him of it.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that poverty will never be dealt with fundamentally within the present structure of society, there is a great deal that could be done if there were a political will to do it.  We could do it by law in the area of the organisation of the social welfare system.  We could do it by law in the area of accountability, in the areas of participation and of access to information about people's treatment and in a number of other areas.  We could do it by allocation of resources into welfare, into housing and education.  We could do it by looking at the whole appalling mess which is our supplementary welfare system, a system which is characterised by unwritten laws by which people must operate, by circulars which are not public knowledge, by criteria of assessing means which are not public knowledge and by rules which seem to vary with the resources available and from area to area.  A community welfare officer for instance, to my knowledge, in the North Eastern Health Board determined that a person is entitled to no more than £15 a week if he has no other means and somebody in another area will give another person £29 a week.  This miasma or network of discrimination could be dealt with by legislation and by political will.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from this nonsense that we cannot afford it.  We are not, contrary to a widely-held view, the most heavily taxed country in western Europe.  There are large areas of exemption from taxation in Ireland.  I wonder how many people realise that you have to make more than £15,000 a year on capital gains before you pay any capital gains tax. People are told that their total personal income tax allowances is a fraction of that and yet if you are in the capital gains <Col N="1196" /> and capital appreciation business you can make £15,000 in any given year before being liable for capital gains tax.  How many people realise that, when they think we are overburdened?  Foreign manufacturing industry made profits of £1,500 million last year in Ireland and did not pay one penny tax on that.  Do we realise that people on high rates of income tax are heavily subsidised in their house purchase. There is a long list of things.  I will quote from the Economic and Social Research Institute about the real nature of our taxation system.</P>
    <P>A report from ESRI paper No. 109 published in 1981, states:</P>
    <P>As taxation on capital and inherited wealth drifted towards the inconsequential, an awareness of social class would have alerted policy-makers to the possibility that Ireland may enter the twenty-first century with an upper middle class so privileged and so securely entrenched as to harken back to its nineteenth century predecessors.</P>
    <P>If I said that, I would be accused of Marxist rhetoric.  It was not I; it was a respected social and economic research body which said that, that we are enforcing an extraordinary and uneven class distribution of wealth and power in the structure of Irish taxation.  To suggest that we have reached a determinable objective ceiling in terms of the resources available to deal with poverty is a nonsense. The acceptable levels of taxation are not an objective number that can be independently determined; they are a matter of political acceptability and what is politically acceptable depends on what politicians and society choose to accept. If we create a hysteria about levels of taxation and leave large areas without taxation, it is not, I suspect, because of objective concern for the poor overburdened PAYE sector but because of the interests of that minority in Irish society who control wealth, capital and power, whose interests are threatened by an extension of taxation.  The extension of taxation would invade the area of the untouched, the overprivileged that the Economic and Social Research Institute <Col N="1197" /> identified.  That could be done within the structure of Irish society as it is now constituted.</P>
    <P>In the context of the reality of poverty the Bill is no more than one small step along the way.  It is very well-intentioned and the objectives it sets for the Combat Poverty Agency are welcome.  But why do we produce a Combat Poverty Agency and allocate it a pathetic sum of less than £1 million to combat poverty in Ireland? I want to remind the House &mdash; and it is not popular to do so because it is probably one of the more popular liberal achievements &mdash; that we spent £20 million in the last few years to renovate a property whose precise function we have not yet identified, that is, the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham.  That may have been money well spent but I have my reservations about it.  It is a bit much to tell Irish society that we have no money for anything: that we have no money for a dozen good causes if we do have money to do that, if we have money to do something so ill-defined, so unplanned and unprepared. At the bottom line one has to ask why is it that we are allocating such little resources to an agency to deal with such a huge problem.  One has to conclude that fear is part of the motivation.  If you turn over the stone in Irish society and reveal all the problems, all the oppression, all the injustice and suggest to those who are oppressed and victims of injustice that they can actually do something about it, then the consequences for Irish society would be extremely unpredictable and indeed would be unpalatable for many who have a vested interest in the <i>status quo.</i>  Therefore, it seems that unless this Bill and the agency set up are given resources of about ten, 15 or 20 times greater than those proposed &mdash; in other words, roughly the same amount of money that is spent on the FAC every year &mdash; we cannot begin to challenge poverty in Irish society.  But then a challenge to poverty in Irish society is a challenge to the structure of Irish society, to the inequalities and injustices of Irish society and fundamentally to the control of wealth and power in Irish society and <Col N="1198" /> we will have to presume that it will not be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by welcoming this Bill.  Much of what I have to say will, I hope, be of a non-repetitive nature because we have had the opportunity already in the reaction to the Bill of hearing some excellent contributions, including that from Senator Brendan Ryan.  I am very pleased that he has moved the debate from the rather narrow confines of the characteristics of the poor to the whole question of the reproduction of an unequal society.  This is a point we will benefit from in this debate.  However, to take up an immediate short term point, I hope that the allocation that has been made to the Combat Poverty Agency in this initial year will be primarily used for the identification of projects that require the large sums which he mentioned next year and the year after.  I also hope that the sums of money would be just anticipatory sums of an action kind.</P>
      <P>May I defend immediately the people who have been doing research in this area?  I do so very deliberately, and I want to link my defence to a point raised by Senator Brendan Ryan.  He asked why do the poor accept the position that has been defined here this afternoon.  I was glad to hear him quoting Noirin Kearney's paper to the 1981 conference in Kilkenny in which she made the point that the gift to a low-income family was one of bad housing, poor participation in education and as much sickness relief as possible.  In quoting that, he raised the question that perhaps tranquillisers do help.  But may I make a further point which is even more important and that is that any research that enables us to understand the structure of Irish society and the structure of our economy is a powerful contribution to consciousness in all social classes.  It so happens that the people who are most excluded from knowing how income is taxed, from knowing how wealth is distributed, from knowing how the structure of power is exercised, are the people who are excluded from the educational process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> As I have said before, you can find a map of the country you live in but you will be deprived for all of your life in Ireland of a map of the power decisions in your life.  Even those who have gone to different educational institutions have been precluded by the systematic exclusion for so long of any discussion on ideology, philosophy or politics from any adequate information as to how different societies in different circumstances in the contemporary world have historically organised their affairs.  What we have heard is, if you like, an apology for the existing western world we live in and it is a very short step from that to go on and say that that world view must be defended even at the cost of enormous armaments expenditure against another world.  Ignorance is compounded on ignorance and ignorance becomes a substitute for policy.</P>
    <P>I have been involved &mdash; and I hope it is not a fashion &mdash; in this debate about combat poverty since 1967.  In 1967 I had the advantage of being in the United States when the United States war on poverty was declared.  It was a very interesting experience.  In 1964 it had been suggested by, I think Barry Goldwater, that there were no poor Americans and in 1965 it was discovered by Lyndon Johnson that there were several million poor Americans.  The poor were discovered in 1965 in the United States.  In Ireland, they were discovered at Kilkenny in 1971.  They were lost along the way on several occasions, but there is no doubt whatsoever that there is the question of the discovery of the poor and then their rediscovery.  There is a certain cycle through which studies go.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of the United States study and I said this in the other House three or four years ago.  The poor were discovered and then a series of strategies were developed to combat their position.  It had a number of effects.  For example, the civil rights movement in the United States was starting at that time and some of the money was channelled to people who wanted more than just soup or participation in primary education. <Col N="1200" /> They wanted to stand for election. They upset distinguished people such as Mayor Daley and the mayors of many American cities.  They upset boss politics in US cities and very quickly a delegation from the mayors of major cities went to the President of the US asking that federal money be kept out of their bailiwicks. There was a great pull-back from the poor then but it was done on the basis of a marvellous rationalisation which no doubt we will hear before this debate ends, and that is that no matter how much money was spent on the poor they would continue to behave in a particular way. We had the elaboration of the concept of the culture of poverty, following on Fraser's original distinction that the blacks were not as achievement oriented as the whites because of the structure of the negro family, or because of their attitude towards the future.  The way the poor made love was different; the way the poor spoke to their children was different, and so on.  The use of the culture of poverty from Oscar Lewis's work was used as a massive rationalisation for a policy withdrawal from poverty.  The next question was to leave it aside again until some time in the future when it was to be rediscovered.  So the phases of the work went towards that end, discovery policy, policy failure, withdrawal of policy, rationalisation of the failure, use of the concept of the culture of poverty and then the collapse of the programmes and so on.  I know I sound a little biblical but to come to the Irish situation in 1971 there were a number of papers presented and most of them found their way into print in the volume edited by Sister Stanislaus Kennedy, <i>One Million Poor</i>, published in 1981 to which some reference has been made already.  We were after a period of sustained growth then.  Emigration had to some extent paused and people were quite genuinely moved by a certain kind of benevolence, a not unusual attitude by Irish people in terms of economic growth.  In 1972 it was decided to have an all-day seminar in the Economic and Social Research Institute on research into poverty.  In 1973 the Labour Party published a policy document <Col N="1201" /> on poverty and it was acknowledged in Professor Liam Ryan's contribution to <i>One Million Poor.</i>  They were the first political party to publish a policy document on the poor and relied heavily on statistics that had been provided by Séamus Ó Cinnéide and other distinguished pioneers in this field.  In 1974 an elaborate set of negotiations took place to try to establish a European poverty programme. So it went on.  The programmes were interesting.  A number of them were concerned with eliciting information but many of them had an action component.</P>
    <P>There are different ways of looking at poverty studies.  Some are descriptive and have been amongst the finest we have. Others are polemical; they have raged against the poor.  Oscar Wilde once said &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that the poor should never be grateful because if they make their peace they make a very bad bargain for a very bad mess of pottage; that the poor should rage.  The concept of the grateful poor was one that he rejected.</P>
    <P>There have been the marvellous official inquiries of which we had many.  There have been scientific studies and there have been action programmes.  Undoubtedly it was the action component of the early studies that upset many people because they touched the nerve of power. They upset many people.  They upset brokerage politicians who were upset at the breaking of dependency and the fact that people were being encouraged to move past them to seek information from the State.  I think I am not unfair to the people in the public service who serve this State very well, in saying that they looked with some jaundice at a body that would appear to call into question the efficacy with which State services were being delivered.  They even upset members of the Hierarchy because they suggested that people should ask questions about, for example, who sold and owned old, disused schools.  Those who exercised power, be it clerical, economic or administrative power were unsettled at least and that unsettling led on to a kind of indigestion that became venomous on occasion and many of the attacks directed <Col N="1202" /> against Combat Poverty were of that kind.  I recall them very clearly.</P>
    <P>Then, as in the United States programme, it was time to suggest again that perhaps the programmes were not succeeding and in 1980 Combat Poverty died the death that the American war on poverty died.  It is a perfect replication of a cycle that calls into question the commitment that politicians and others are making to the question of the poor. What I am saying is that if you try to develop programmes dealing with poverty without being willing to analyse the fact that you are talking about inequality you are going to founder.</P>
    <P>I want to state very clearly that I welcome this Bill because I believe that the Bill has, in fact, benefited from the working group that has been serving in the interim and have made representations to the Minister.  I am delighted to see that in the terms of reference there is (a) the question of advising and making recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State.  That means that you are integrating your anti-poverty approach to the social and economic planning process.  That is a real achievement and I want to record it as that.  The next one &mdash; (b) &mdash; and it is quite high up and I commend those who gave it second place in priority &mdash; is the initiation of measures aimed at overcoming poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures.  That has an action and evaluation component and I welcome it.  In (c) I welcome the question of research.  May I make a plea here that we should not indulge in a fashionable anti-intellectualism? The reason we live in an unequal society and send our children off to schools that reproduce that inequality, the reason why we have two health services, two legal systems, two educational systems and all sorts of inequalities is that we do not sufficiently evaluate knowledge on the nature of society in which we live. I support that item in the terms of reference. Indeed, there is the promotion there &mdash; and I certainly defend that &mdash; of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in <Col N="1203" /> the State and the measures necessary to overcome such poverty.  In the fourth component there is the question of public education and there is need for public education.</P>
    <P>I listened with great care to the thoughtful speeches offered so far and I am very reluctant to criticise even in a minor way speeches made by the Opposition because I hope, and I know that we are going to see in the future a bipartisan approach towards this problem.  I hope that this agency will have the commitment of whatever Government are in power to achieve its aim and will be allocated such resources as are needed. There is an important comment on the Bill.  The Bill is establishing a national agency.  It is being given autonomy separate from the European programme on poverty so there will not be available to any administration of the day the excuse that because funds are drying up in Europe we should cease the operation of this agency in Ireland.  The Bill clearly establishes that autonomy and I welcome that and I hope that whatever administration is in power will maintain it.</P>
    <P>I have said that there is a need for a change in Irish attitudes because, quite frankly, our attitudes towards poverty in Ireland could be described as being rather high on compassion and low on justice. The European Economic Commission's findings are quoted on page 156 of <i>One Million Poor.</i>  They cited attitudes towards poverty.</P>
    <P>Basically in Ireland, we are quite willing when the extremes of poverty have been brought to our attention to give towards the poor but the existence of poverty is usually attributed to personal characteristics.  I quote from <i>One Million Poor:</i></P>
    <P>One recent Irish study found that the underlying concept of poverty was one of personal inadequacy or failure rather than possible fault in the social and economic institutions.</P>
    <P>Research by the European Economic Commission has revealed a remarkable range of attitudes to poverty among the <Col N="1204" /> peoples of the Community.  It said that injustice in society was cited by 26 per cent and laziness by 25 per cent but when you looked at Ireland, you found that 19 per cent compared to 26 per cent in the Community believed that poverty was the result of injustice in society.  When you looked at laziness in the nine countries of the Community &mdash; as it was at the time &mdash; 25 per cent were giving laziness as a reason and 30 per cent in Ireland were quoting that as the reason.  In the Community when 16 per cent were blaming bad luck, in Ireland 25 per cent were attributing poverty to bad luck &mdash; perhaps because of our imaginative qualities. That clearly reveals that our attitude towards poverty is very much one of explaining it in terms of the characteristics of individuals, of families, of neighbourhoods, of groups and even of classes. There is the notion of low-motivated families, low-motivated individuals, people who are low in the work ethic and so forth.  We are exceptions in Europe in that.  May I emphasise that we are low by European comparison in identifying the causes of poverty within the structure of the society.  We do not see poverty as the consequence of the social and economic structures of society.  We see it more in terms of the personal characteristics of the poor.  That is why it is very interesting when social policies are being construed in this country that some people say: &ldquo;We should go after the very worst of the poor. What about identifying the organisations who work amongst the poor and assisting those?&rdquo;  This is an invitation to blindness. It is an invitation to say: &ldquo;Let us ignore the causes and let us concentrate on the worst features and the symptoms&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, the people who are dealing with the worst aspects of poverty are not asking us to look at the causes of poverty in a structural sense.  They have said: &ldquo;We do not want you keeping on your concern and using it as a palliative for your guilt in ignoring the structural consequences.&rdquo; There is a very clear message coming from the fine people who are members of the St. Vincent de Paul Society that they would welcome a political <Col N="1205" /> analysis of the causes of inequality and poverty in Irish society.  They are not asking us to get in behind them pushing their trolley.  They are asking us to do our job, which is, to look at the shape of our society and the shape of our economy. Looking on the shape of our economy and the shape of our society I agree with Senator Brendan Ryan in one respect, that it is becoming unfashionable to point out that we are a profoundly unequal society.  For example, in <i>Poverty and Social Policy</i> compiled by Laraine Joyce and A.  McCashin of the Institute of Public Administration in 1983 some figures are given.  I am very anxious to quote these because sometimes people get excited when I quote figures because they think that I am inventing them.  I am quoting from the volume I mentioned and it is on page 22, &ldquo;Inequality can be measured in terms of four major dimensions. Wealth is one of them.&rdquo;  I have heard so often the phrase &ldquo;there is no great pot of gold out there.  There is no great wealth that we can identify&rdquo;.  There have been arguments on this question about Patrick Lyons' figures.  The Joyce and McCashin document notes that in preparing his 1974 estimates of the distribution of wealth, Lyons sampled about 10 per cent of the small estates under 5,000 for which no detailed figures were published.  His estimate of the distribution of personal wealth in Ireland in 1966 is shown in table 2.20 of that document. There is obviously a marked degree of inequality in the distribution of wealth. Approximately 5 per cent of the population own 64 per cent of the total personal wealth in Ireland.  One per cent own 24 per cent of total wealth, while 62 per cent of the population was estimated to own no wealth.  Lyons concluded also that the degree of inequality in the distribution of wealth in Ireland was somewhat more marked than it was in both Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>There followed a number of studies which questioned the methodology used by Patrick Lyons.  The figure of 64 per cent has in no place, that I have seen it published, been revised under a figure of <Col N="1206" /> 65 per cent.  Let us not argue about a few percentage points here and there.</P>
    <P>The unfair distribution of wealth is usually justified on the basis that if you interfere through any taxation strategy with wealth, you will destroy the incentive that is making modern Ireland the industrialised modern country that it is. Most of this wealth was not built up in a single generation.  It was mostly inherited wealth.  It is not the achievement of some captain of industry, some genius, some enterprising soul, some industrialist who has transformed where he lives.  It is something built on an inherited base.  It is equally something very much established and made secure on a basis of speculation in the 1970's.</P>
    <P>A former distinguished Member of this House, Dr. T.K. Whitaker, hardly a leftwing roaring radical, more than once commented on the deleterious effect on the Irish economy of the fact that there was so much speculation in the seventies, in other words non-real value-producing wealth, non-job producing wealth.  In many ways people made great personal fortunes with all the ostentatious expenditure mentioned by Senator Ryan, through destroying jobs in the seventies and through asset stripping.  One company after another fell.  As the jobs went we tried to create new jobs out of taxation. We were left with a social welfare burden while others built up their personal fortunes.  There is a lot of that wealth in that figure we are talking about. Equally, another figure that is interesting is in relation to the distribution of income.  In relation to income the Joyce and McCashin study shows that the top 10 per cent of the population has 25.5 per cent of the total disposable income, while the bottom 20 per cent has only 7.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The question that arises is in relation to the transfer pattern in the State.  In other words, it is agreed that we have a society unequally structured in relation to wealth and unequally structured in relation to income.  We now turn to the way the State operates in building these basic characteristics.  By and large it works to transfer but it transfers very <Col N="1207" /> much and very often from the not yet poor and the poor towards the wealthy. Out of public taxation, for example, we make it possible for an overwhelming disproportion of the professional classes to reproduce themselves in the various professions.  We can raise the question of the relative likelihood of advancement for children from various backgrounds. This is a stark question for someone wanting to judge and decide.  Take a low income family where the head of household is a manual worker and let us assume that such manual worker is employed &mdash; although the chances of being unemployed are very much greater in that category than in other vocational categories, and then take somebody, say myself, who is a university lecturer.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the two situations. What are the relative probabilities of the child of my situation and the child of the unskilled worker going to university? Look at another characteristic.  What are the relative probabilities of a child of my situation and a child in the other situation ending up needing psychiatric care?  You will see in effect what we have done.  We regularly reproduce a society in terms of its wealth and inequalities and in terms of its income inequalities.  We regularly look on as the transfer pattern of society transfers access to education, access to better health, access to tax reliefs &mdash; because you have a better chance of getting a mortgage and thereby owning a house &mdash; and access to better law &mdash; because you have the chance of being able to hire your own lawyer.  In every dimension of experience where we use the State we could have a philosophical argument as to whether it is a deliberate action or whether the State is neutral and facilitates the process.  But, however, you look at it, in all of these dimensions of experience, the transfer actions are such as not to eradicate inequalities but to build on them and exacerbate them.</P>
    <P>I now take up the previous speaker's question at to why this is so.  This is why I defend the clauses on research and education.  I take it up with the greatest respect because there has not been <Col N="1208" /> enough research on wealth, income and the transfer pattern.  Wonderful work is now being carried out by the National Economic and Social Council in relation to the transfer actions of the State.  The other studies I mentioned are pioneering studies that tend to stand on their own and are not being replicated or expanded in the various social science departments of the universities.  This raises a number of questions.  Senator Brendan Ryan spoke about the fashionable concern with poverty.  I would appeal to these institutes to become far more interested in the needs of an unequal society.  I would appeal to the media to address questions of inequality more regularly than they do.  It is not through any accident and it is not through the prescription of tranquillisers that the needs of society will be met.  There is an ideology that sustains all of this inequality.  It regularly surfaces in this House.  At the heart of it is the suggestion that if you give too much welfare you will destroy the work ethic. There is a set of assumptions about the nature of the human being, such as that the human being is at his or her best when not interfered with by the State and when moving without restriction and that even the groups that the person is involved with are temporary coalitions of interest.</P>
    <P>There is the concept that when this principle is accepted in society, in the economy, even in salvation, a better kind of society can be achieved.  Against that is the view that in isolation we are less and that it is through contact with others that we develop our personalities and social capacities and enrich one another not simply in an additive way.  It has been assumed that human groups have been the vehicle for changing society and are not temporary but grow to be human institutions that defend civilisation and that are the carriers of culture, socialisation and so forth.</P>
    <P>In a sense it is social against rabid individualism. I now get back to base about this because the Minister spoke about it in his introductory speech when he spoke about the events from 1971 to the present time.  He omitted 1975.  We had a conference in Kilkenny in 1975 too.  I remember <Col N="1209" /> well the night before it opened.  I would like to mention the speech of Dr. Don Carroll, a distinguished member on many different boards in this country.  He spoke about the collapse of the work ethic.  He was astonished to find that the Minister of State of the day replying to him said that poverty could not be simply looked at in terms of a concept of the deserving poor. I ask the people who are going to speak on this subject to think about who would be the deserving poor.  I remember when the Community Development Agency was established.  Beneath it all was this notion of the deserving poor in which you would push your trolleys off to the most deserving of the poor, you would help them and the others would buckle themselves together and compete in the economy and be as happy as the rest of us. This was the basic thinking in it.  It had no concept of the structural basis of poverty.  It did not accept any concept of inequality.  It had a notion that more could be grafted on to well meaning, well structured, voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I am not going to debate the merit of State provisions versus voluntary provisions under the terms of this Bill.  I would like to say that some of the judgmental attitudes involved in the delivery of such provision could be enormously inhuman in many ways.  Take the concept of who were the deserving poor.  It is not more than the concept of the grateful poor, to which Oscar Wilde made reference.  I would like to raise this in all its enormity. In 1971, Bishop Birch was alive.  The conference opened up with a splurge of compassion.  The social workers came along and they spoke about all categories of the marginalised that Senator Ryan has been speaking about.  They spoke about the disabled who were poor, the rural people who were poor and, children who were poor.  They all listened.  It set up this chain of events.</P>
    <P>We went back to 1981.  Thankfully the papers have all been published.  The document <i>Conference on Poverty 1981</i> was published.  I was there.  Something had changed.  Two oil crises had intervened. They had shook things apart slightly.  What had happened?  On this <Col N="1210" /> occasion we were not going to be drowned with compassion.  We were supposed to be moved with compassion and then to be rescued into realism.  On taking up the volume one can see the contributors. Indeed, Noirin Kearney, to whom I made reference earlier, decided correctly instead of reading out more statistics she would give a description of a typical family at the margin.  She was followed by T.K. Whitaker on future possibility. We went on in many ways as well.  Frank Salmon was balanced by Kieran Kennedy. I sat and listened, and what one heard was a restatement by all the people working on the ground of how the position of the poor had got worse in ten years.  After every speech an economist stood up and said that this is what we can afford, and then there was another speech about some other disadvantaged group and another economic viewpoint. This raises questions as to the structure of economics within the social science.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the professional economists, by and large, had removed themselves from the traditional concerns of the political economy which included the distribution of wealth and the whole distribution of possibilities and the nature and consequences of economic planning. They had put themselves via econometrics into some kind of technical position in which they spoke about it as if you could speak about the economy as a de-politicised identity.  The economy was beyond the comprehension of social scientists.  As it is now presented, it is beyond the comprehension of Members of this House and of the other House. The idea being when I come along to a political programme it gets a little messy for a while.  The media likes to take on the professional opinion first because that is as immutable as the weather.  If the economists say there are no alternatives there are no alternatives.  Then we come to the politicians.  They talk vaguely and then it is time to say, &ldquo;Goodnight, and thank you for coming.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They de-politicised the economy when they revealed themselves in Kilkenny. They came along one after the other. <Col N="1211" /> They said these are the economic conditions. They even went further and said that these were the economic conditions for the next ten years and afterwards.  I want to say my attitude is not a Luddite one within economics but the assumptions that they were unwilling to consider were these.  If one had taken 1971 as real and one wanted to eliminate poverty, one could have gone down the road on two or three social policy alternatives. One was to stay, as Senator Brendan Ryan has been arguing, within the realms of your existing economic relationships and say, &ldquo;We will distribute whatever we can afford, a residual model of social welfare.  Let us see what we can afford and give it to the most deserving&rdquo;, and then have all the discussion in the newspapers and radio programmes where it can be read and heard about the real poor as opposed to the workshy poor, or the poor who were not really poor.  How does one work this concept out?</P>
    <P>The second model proposed is linking solidly to the work ethic.  Let us give it all to people who worked hard.  Thirdly, you would try to, if Senators meant what they were saying, redistribute and use the welfare system not just to reward people for a life of work or indeed just to compensate the worst casualties of the system but that you would further desist.  We operate a legislative system that at present gathers tax to make it possible overwhelmingly for those who are privileged now to be succeeded in the next generation by their own children.  Equally, we use our taxes and we accept a disposal of wealth and income that will exclude the majority of people from participation, in a full sense, in education that will give them a different kind of experience in relation to health and to the law.  If that model is accepted you could consciously try, accepting the causes of poverty are not now located in individuals or families or neighbourhoods but located in the economic system, to use our social welfare policy to seek to undo the worst effects of the economy.  I know of no place where any Minister in any Government since I entered public <Col N="1212" /> life has said clearly, &ldquo;This will be our social policy provision&rdquo;.  That is a great defect in relation to the political alternatives and solutions in this area.</P>
    <P>I want to clear up the point to answer those who want to locate the causes of poverty in individuals.  We are, contrary to what people might think, beneficiaries of research.  The poor are not one composed entity.  We are not talking about the same people all through their lives. Anyone who knows anything about the subject knows this.  A couple, for example, can get married and let us say that he or she has a job and they have no children.  Their income is adequate for awhile.  Then they have one child or two children and one knows the ethos we have towards this in welcoming all these children even though we do not make provision for them.  They may suddenly find their income insufficient.  For example, the husband or wife may lose his or her job.  Then the children grow up.  The couple are alone again and suddenly their income is adequate.  The experience of poverty is something into which people move in and out.  One is not talking about one composed population all the time. That is a dimension to it that needs to be taken into account.  It is true &mdash; and here the myth of the culture of poverty is exposed &mdash; in certain areas where there is inadequate housing, overcrowding, large families, very often unemployed heads of households, and where perhaps there is low participation in education and so on we repeat those deprivations objectively for the same areas, families and class. It is an intellectual joke to suggest that working class families almost like being poor; as if they, for example, do not wish to send their children to school.  This may be so because that option has never been allowed to exist for them.  We have to balance the objective conditions which we create and re-create against these motivational factors which are now fashionable and that are being adduced in relation to education.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear Senator A. O'Brien locate this problem in Ireland in a global scale.  His contribution is very valuable and welcome.  The Senator <Col N="1213" /> emphasised the point that was later taken up by another speaker, that it is insufficient to be speaking about problems of compassion and problems of aid.  Aid is frequently a disguised export.  World hunger is something that comes about predictably, not by accident, and can be affected by the structure of aid and trade. Neglected structural features lead to emergency aid.  Poverty in Ireland is a microcosm of that poverty in the world produced by oppression and domination in the relationship between developed States and undeveloped ones.  Equally, I agree with the last speaker in saying that the oppression and domination which takes place in Irish society is a consequence of the privileges which many people want to hold on to.  I contest their view of the economy and society.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome because the four main elements in it and their functions are valuable.  I pay tribute to the inclusion of the concept of a resource centre &mdash; page 4 of the Bill &mdash; for the collection and dissemination of information on poverty and community development and to act as a centre for counselling and training in relation to the giving of information on community development as a means of overcoming poverty.  What is raised here is the question of community development. What is meant by community development?  It is not a semantic question. I have listened to community activists all my life.  Very often I have to ask the question: what do they want?  Do they mean communities developing according to their view?  You get people saying they are a community group and they proceed then to make indications about what would be appropriate behaviour or projects. No more than people wanting travelling people to become the mirror images of themselves, do they mean communities operating as mirror images of themselves?</P>
    <P>Community development in the context of all these poverty action projects in every country I know where they have been applied has another dimension to it: it is seen as the community coming to know how power is exercised in the community and how participation is <Col N="1214" /> structured.  It is very important that there be a concept of community development. It identifies the structures of communities, like who is excluded from power and who is automatically included.  I could write novels about the community meetings which I have attended and the way which they unfold, rather like the Czars of Russia in terms of hierarchy and honorary status from the front row down to the back row.  They proceed from who is invited to speak down to the humble person who used to make the tea or sweep the floor or stack the chairs.  This is a concept of community hierarchically organised, power-concentrated, excluding a great number of people from deliberation and participation.</P>
    <P>Where Combat Poverty got into trouble initially was when it raised questions as to what was the content of the word &ldquo;community&rdquo;.  If it was to be &ldquo;communitas&rdquo; and you were speaking about the bond and so on, what basis were people bonded together?  Was it on the basis, for example, of a single individual taking over all the development opportunities of a particular area?  Did it mean, for example, that a person who might have a shop, a farm, an undertaking business, or an auctioneering business should be put forward to acquire a farm or business coming on the market or to take care of a certain job, and so on?  The objections made against this were: the action section of Combat Poverty early on questioned the exercise of power and questioned clientelism.  It had the temerity to organise people to bid for land on the open market against people who wanted their third and fourth farm.</P>
    <P>The economic reverberations came straight back: we were talking about something entirely different; we wanted something that would assist all the people who were doing good work that is everywhere to be seen &mdash; the meals on wheels, the people living alone, all the people who were assisting.  They did not want any interference in the economic area. Then the pennies began to drop for all of us who are working in this area for nearly 20 years.  The people talked about community in terms that it was something in <Col N="1215" /> which you left existing power structures and the economy of the local area intact and dealt with the most deserving and extreme poverty and gave assistance wherever it was being voluntarily organised. I am in favour of assisting voluntary organisations and giving them all sorts of additional resources.  I do not support the idea of pulling a blind across the way in which community power and local economies are exercised.  I defend the actions of the first Combat Poverty group.  I should like to place on record my tribute to the bravery of all those wonderful people who worked in any way in Combat Poverty in its various incarnations.</P>
    <P>I encourage my colleagues who have said we can learn from our mistakes.  I hope they are referring to the mistakes of politicians.  The mistakes were within the political process.  It is a charitable word for those people who directed their ire against Combat Poverty.  There were very powerful interests against it from the beginning.  It was not something that was fashionable.  It was something which raised difficulties.  We have all benefited from this.  I live in County Galway where one of the best projects conducted by Combat Poverty is there for everybody to see.  Two people worked there from the original Combat Poverty Group. Today 15 different activities take place, including credit unions, fish co-operatives, wood turning, where people do city and guild examinations in wood carving. People who never did an examination in their lives have just completed these examinations.  This is on the basis of the work of two people.  The evidence is there.</P>
    <P>One must hope in relation to all of this that as one begins to build the projects, to evaluate them and to establish the centre for the collection and dissemination of information, there will be an evolution in public and political attitudes from being simply concerned with the deserving or the most extreme forms of poverty to having some conception of justice and an acceptance that it is monstrous to sustain the inequalities which exist.  I agree with the last speaker that <Col N="1216" /> what we have are not only a new wealthy but a vulgar wealthy in their behaviour. Since we began talking about Combat Poverty from the 1960s to the 1980s the newspapers began giving less space to the poor and more to the people who could spend £120 on an intimate dinner for two, which I find vulgar and ugly behaviour on the part of people who are exploiting Irish society and who frequently have not the gaze of politicians directed towards them.  This is a point towards which we have come.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the new circumstances which prevail in an atmosphere of greater unemployment.  I agree that the changed nature of unemployment has exacerbated many of the features which we identified in 1971 and 1981.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas Delegation to Nicaragua: Motion (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government to implement the recommendations of the report of the inter-party Joint Oireachtas delegation to Nicaragua.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator M. Higgins)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making on the previous occasion when we were discussing this motion was the importance of developing our ties with countries such as Nicaragua, and not only on the diplomatic front.  I urge sincerely that we establish diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and, indeed, other Central and South American States with whom we do not have such links.  The argument always advanced was one of costings and economics and I firmly put the point that it is not necessary to have a residential mission in each country with which we have links.  Indeed, we have diplomatic links <Col N="1217" /> with many countries where we do not have residential missions on a full time basis.</P>
      <P>The people of Nicaragua are endeavouring in a very determined way to establish a democratic form of government, to advance social services, to start a literacy programme, to make such basic amenities as sanitation and health care available to its people.  Our own inter-party delegation, representing the whole spectrum of Irish politics, attest to the fact that the Nicaraguan people have genuinely sought to establish a real and true democracy in that country.  They deserve our support and we should give that by establishing diplomatic relations with them, either through our embassy in Canada or Argentina or establishing a new embassy in Central America that could have relations with many of the Central American countries.  On the other front &mdash; which is equally important &mdash; of developing our commercial relations, I believe that Irish agencies have within themselves tremendous potential to help.  I said that the most important form of solidarity is to be present on the ground and we have many valuable contributions that we can make.</P>
      <P>I totally endorse the report of the Irish inter-parliamentary delegation and commend their hard work and efforts.  I commend sincerely to this House and to the Minister the detailed recommendations on page 11 of the report.  These recommendations can be followed through by this Government, by this Parliament and I hope that we will see action on them in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is most welcome. It is well written and extremely well presented.  What continues to astonish me is the almost total absence of reporting and coverage of this report in the Irish news media.  It is quite an astonishing fact that every distortion, lie and slander about the Government and the people of Nicaragua which is passed on by the international news media under the influence of the United States is reported assiduously both by our national broadcasting service and by our national newspapers.  A comprehensive and <Col N="1218" /> coherent report on the truth of what is happening in Nicaragua compiled by four Irish parliamentarians of very different political views &mdash; and all the stronger because of the different views, backgrounds, attitudes on many other issues of the four members &mdash; has been virtually buried without trace by the Irish news media.  It has surprised and pained me that this report has not been covered in the depth and detail it deserves.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why the recommendations cannot at least be accepted in principle.  Admittedly we recognise the government in Nicaragua; as far as I know probably the only government we do not recognise is the government in Kampuchea.  We recognise the Pol Pot Government as the legitimate government in Kampuchea, which does not say much to our credit.  We show an extraordinary unwillingness to get involved in diplomatic links, which is recommendation No. 3.  Some of the convoluted reasoning that has been produced has to do with cost We could establish diplomatic links with Nicaragua at very little cost.  It has to be said that the real reason why we will not contemplate diplomatic links with Nicaragua is because we are afraid of offending a government who &mdash; whatever our pretence to neutrality &mdash; would regard it as being of major significance in our foreign policy, that is the government of the United States of America.</P>
      <P>On Contadora, without tangling myself up on things I do not understand fully, what is true is that the United States Government, having used enormous efforts to blame the government and people of Nicaragua for not participating fully and accepting the Contadora proposals, promptly changed its mind once the Nicaraguans did so, because obviously the United States Government has no interest in peace in either El Salvador or Nicaragua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is welcome that we should increase contact.  I have heard at least one member of the delegation suggest that apart from food aid we could give a lot of advice on agricultural development.  The proposals are so straightforward that one has to <Col N="1219" /> wonder what are the criteria by which we assess our aid decisions that have prevented us from even thinking about implementing that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The recommendation that produces the greatest amount of pussyfooting in official circles is what should be the most acceptable recommendation, that we should support a campaign to end support for the counter revolutionaries in Nicaragua. In contrast, given the official stance of successive Irish Governments on terrorism internationally, it seems astonishing that one manifestation of terrorism is circumnavigated with a choice of judicious words quite uncharacteristic of the usual bluntness with which we address the problem of terrorism internationally.</P>
    <P>I quote some facts from page 3 of the report because I think they need to be reiterated:</P>
    <P>There are in the order of 15,000 counter-revolutionaries operating on the borders of Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins extrapolated the numbers that would be involved if there were similar numbers on the borders of the United States and Canada and it would run in the order of 1.5 million.  It is a huge number in terms of the population of Nicaragua. Seven thousand Nicaraguans have died at the hands of these counter-revolutionaries. These are not Nicaraguan soldiers or militiamen.  A large proportion of those 7,000 are civilians, nurses, doctors, teachers and, indeed, sometimes children. This is not some sort of romantic soldier fighting soldier.  What is romantic about that I do not know, but it is usually seen as a higher form of warfare.  This is terrorism plain and simple, with all the techniques and the tactics associated with it.  It is a war against children, farmers and aid workers.  Aid workers have been killed in this.  The war has cost the Nicaraguan economy some $250 million a year.</P>
    <P>In spite of that ferocious assault from the outside, the mining of the ports, the increasing economic blockade on aid, the Nicaraguan revolution has succeeded in producing basic health care and basic <Col N="1220" /> literacy and a limited supply of food for its people.  It is an astonishing and inspiring achievement by a small country in the face of enormous odds.  Economic growth has averaged 5 per cent since the revolution reached a high point of almost 11 per cent in 1981, which appears to contradict what the Minister of State said about the revolution having produced enormous damage to the economy.  It appears to me that the capacity, of this revolution in the words of Xabier Gorostiaga, S.J., to mobilise the people of Nicaragua has unleashed and has enabled economic growth to be proceeded with in spite of the best efforts of the United States to sabotage it.  They have spent more money on health and housing in the last five years than the previous American-approved regime spent in 20 years.</P>
    <P>The consequence of these achievements for the people of Nicaragua has been political vilification of a kind that is usually reserved for international terrorism of a most obnoxious kind.  Accusations of totalitarianism and persecution of the Church are uniquivocal rubbish. The Church agency Trocaire, still supports and encourages us to support the Nicaraguan revolution.  Individual churchmen have come into conflict with the authorities in Nicaragua, but it is not the only country in which there has been conflict between Church and State in recent memory.  It is unlikely that we will be accused of persecuting the Church. The accusation of totaliarianism is manifest rubbish.  We have now the expressed written opinion of four different Members of the Oireachtas to confirm what most of us suspected, that whatever its deficiencies, inadequacies and mistakes, Nicaragua is most definitely not a totalitarian regime.  At a meeting in Dublin the Vice-President of Nicaragua was criticised by some of our own hard leftists for being the leader of a bourgeois democracy and not being involved in a real revolution.  The Nicaraguan Government were criticised by the Marxist-Leninist groups during the election for not being sufficiently Marxist, Leninist or sufficiently left wing.  What we are talking about is not a country which is a threat to anybody <Col N="1221" /> else in terms of either its political ideology or its military activity but about a country which provoked the Government and the administration in the United States to levels of hostility which are unparalleled outside a war. What we are beginning to get now is not distortion, or misleading statements, but lies by the United States Government and by the United States President.</P>
    <P>The only people who are fighting for freedom in Nicaragua are the people of Nicaragua.  The people who are operating on their borders are international terrorists with a record of repression and slaughter during the period when they operated for the Somoza regime.  The United States Government is not as short-sighted as we would imagine in their dealings with Nicaragua because they have recognised that if Nicaragua, with its capacity to reconcile moderation with fundamental change in society, succeeds then it will become an inspiration for Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and, much more threatening perhaps, to the oppressed people of Mexico and the entire continent of South America.  The Reagan regime or administration, while it may use distortion, untruth and lies to support itself, is identifying the real problem which is that Nicaragua is an inspiration to the rest of the world. Today's <i>Irish Times</i> contains a very interesting article on the Philippines concerning the oppressed people living in the slums of the major cities who are renaming their slum areas after Nicaragua.  The slums of a major city called Mindanao have been renamed Nicaragdao because Nicaragua is becoming an inspiration to oppressed people all over the world and that is why it is a threat.</P>
    <P>We have spoken in unequivocal directness about oppression in Poland, oppression and invasion in Afghanistan and quite rightly, but when it comes to oppression and slaughter in Nicaragua we choose the most extraordinary careful choice of phraseology.  Take, for instance, the reference in the Minister's speech, &ldquo;The Government are firmly opposed to outside interference in the internal affairs in the countries of Central <Col N="1222" /> America.&rdquo;  There are different kinds of outside interference.  The only outside interference that is taking place in Nicaragua is the economic, military and political terrorism that is being perpetrated against the government and people of that country by the Government of the United States of America.  Why in Heavens name are we so timid?  Is it because deep down we are afraid of offending our apparent political masters?  Let it be said that if we stand against terrorism and if we choose, as many of our politicians do, to say over and over again &mdash; in the words of the Pope at Drogheda &mdash; that murder is murder is murder, then the terrorism being perpetrated against the people and Government of Nicaragua by the United States administration is murder.  President Ronald Reagan can only be described, considering the relative weight of his position and that of the people of Nicaragua, as a supreme international terrorist because what he is doing is nothing short of terrorism on a grand scale against a brave and vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that our foreign policy in relation to a major fundamental moral issue about the right of a small brave people to be free to develop justice as a model for the rest of an oppressed world should be challenged in the interest of the manoeuvrings and the economic ideology of one major power.  Frequently, and quite rightly, we have condemned the abuses of power by one major power.  It appears that we are afraid, intimidated, or too cowardly to take an equivalent stand here.  Those in the media who suggested recently that our neutrality is either meaningless or undefined, may well have a point because, perhaps for some people in Government, our neutrality does not have a point.  For many of us this is a very firm and fine touch-stone on which to make a point of our neutrality, and that is our capacity to speak independently and freely and without looking over our shoulder at apparently half recognised political masters when we see terrorism in the form of the assault on the brave people of Nicaragua by the Government of the United States.</P>
    <P>Nicaragua is a fledgling democracy.  It <Col N="1223" /> is a fledgling revolution attempting to do most extraordinarily brave things for its people.  It is not a perfect society any more than we are or, indeed, God knows, any more than the United States is, but it is a major improvement on what was there before in Nicaragua or in Central America.  It deserves not some sort of pious, hand-wringing and tears of concern from a safe distance but our full and unequivocal support.  The members of the committee in their report, written as it was in careful and moderate but nevertheless quite unequivocal English, have given us a very firm base from which to take a stand on principle and commitment.</P>
    <P>That is what a country with a commitment to real, constructive and positive neutrality would choose.  Nicaragua is not just one obscure country.  It is a touch-stone of whether this country has a foreign policy based on either our own past experience, or concern for development in the world, or for peace, and one that should concern us, particularly in regard to our unwillingness ever to be associated with the use of violence to achieve political ends.  What is manifestly clear now is that the United States Government are not interested in small changes or military controls, they are interested in the fundamental destabilisation of the political and economic structures that have resulted from the Nicaraguan revolution.  It is, therefore, a matter of moral choice for us: do we support one small step on the way to change in the Third World, do we put our foreign policy where our development theories are and support a minority of people, or do we abandon them in the interests of great power and pressure?</P>
    <P>I will quote two lines from somebody who probably has never been quoted in this House, a rock singer named Bruce Springstein.  They are the best two lines I can think of to conclude my speech. They represent a philosophy that many of us in this House have adhered to over 20 difficult years.  &ldquo;We made a promise that we would always remember, no retreat and no surrender.&rdquo;  As far as I am concerned, the position of one oppressed <Col N="1224" /> people is best represented by that.  There can be no surrender of a fundamental moral right of a people to develop themselves in the face of international terrorism. I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion moved by Senator Higgins.  In complimenting him and, indeed, all the other members of the delegation, Deputy Bernard Allen, Deputy Liam Hyland and Senator Shane Ross, I am expressing the appreciation of all Members of the House for the way they conducted their investigations during the elections in Nicaragua and also the way they presented not alone their recommendations, which are dealt with in this resolution, but also a whole resume of the situation in the country, how the elections took place, the commentary on the elections and the results.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to be instrumental in the Inter Parliamentary Union in proposing that the Oireachtas would be represented in Nicaragua during these elections for the very purpose of ensuring that a proper record would be available to those of us, particularly in this country, who have an interest in democracy and in ensuring that democracy survives even in Central America, in spite of the war of attrition that is going on there and in other areas in Central America by very powerful nations who obviously for their own vested interests try to ensure that small nations such as Nicaragua will never have a chance of survival except under the kind of administration to which they were subjected for so many years previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other members of the delegation will not be annoyed if I pick out Senator Higgins particulary for commendation in this regard, not alone for this report but for his tremendous interest down through the years in Central America and, indeed, in both El Salvador, which he also visited, and Nicaragua.  He has been part of a whole group of western European politicians who have triggered off in various institutions throughout the world an awareness that something is happening in Central America of which we should be aware, that we should document and on which we should not be <Col N="1225" /> afraid to state an opinion.  There is no doubt from the results of this election that with the tremendous disadvantages they have had in that country we are satisfied that every effort was made by way of an electoral system and monetary assistance from the State to ensure that everybody who wanted to express an opinion in the elections had the opportunity to do so.  I was saddened that the American Government and other institutions tried to defame the results by insinuating in some way that they were not genuine.  Some people opted out on the basis that they could not win and those people in their opting out decried the efforts of others who stayed in the kitchen when the heat intensified.  The results of the elections are before us and our group are to be commended for doing that.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins, in his efforts throughout the years, has issued many documents on this subject.  He issued documentation which he may have even forgotten by now, though he is listening to me here, from a previous group of people who met and expressed opinions about this.  They said that it was unacceptable that attempts were being made to strangle the people of Nicaragua by economic isolation and military attack.  That is still going on even after those elections.  As we know, a war of attrition is going on there. Last week Padre Cortina came here and spoke about El Salvador.  The question was put to him which situation created more problems, the intervention of the Americans or, in the case of El Salvador, the intervention of the Cubans.  He thought long and deliberately for one or two minutes and then said the intervention of the Americans created the most problems.  There is no doubt that they are the cause in the first instance of all the interventions in other countries' affairs because strategically those countries are of importance to them.  Continued disruption both to the economy and the development of these countries in that strategic area create a problem for the American people perceived through their President's eyes.  In other words, he is not prepared to accept a democratic election result in any of these areas if the people <Col N="1226" /> elected do not necessarily believe in his own political philosophy, as has happened in the case of Nicaragua and, indeed, is happening throughout Central America.  They have decried what has been going on by these newly elected Governments and the international media.</P>
    <P>The Irish media have been favourably disposed towards Nicaragua because of the high profile that has been given to it by Members of this House, particularly, and by members of the Hierarchy, Bishop Casey and other people, with a bit of courage that also comes down to the myth about the intervention of Marxism and all other sorts of totalitarian systems. When they try to link democratic socialism with that particular ethos and create confusion in people's minds it makes our job much more difficult.  The media in Ireland, have to some extent, been sympathetic towards this particular case.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to put on the record of this House, in taking into account the recommendations from the committee, that our Government should officially recognise the considerable advances made for democracy in Central America as a result of the free and fair elections in Nicaragua.  I will not deal with the other recommendations because it would be repetitive and other Members have already dealt with them.  I go along with the idea that even if Nicaragua is not a priority area for diplomatic links, the position certainly calls for some formal link with it, whether at consular level or any other level.  Within that group of nations in Central America it is imperative that we as a small, neutral nation should have a link to which we can turn and should keep a dialogue with these non-aligned nations.  I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs will seriously look at our recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the advances that have been made in Nicaragua, it is only fair to say that the educational institutions there, particularly since 1979 have reflected that there are profound problems <Col N="1227" /> prevalent throughout Latin America. The illiteracy rate was 50.8 per cent compared to the average of 30.8 per cent on the Continent.  As in all countries, the majority of the literate population lived in the cities and the rural regions in general received no educational attention. There has been tremendous progress made already by the elected Government. They have produced statistics.  We listened to the Deputy Premier outlining what they had achieved.  He said that among their priority projects undertaken in 1980 was the illiteracy campaign which reduced the illiteracy rate from 50 per cent to 12.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>If anything can defeat the international press which is stimulated by the Americans, it is the fact that ordinary people can read for themselves the kind of lies that are being printed about them.  It is a good thing that the people are being taught to read in their native language.  I understand there are two or three minority languages in Nicaragua and it is important that people in various parts of the country would be able to read what the world says about them and to know that there are nations like Ireland who are interested in their survival and in helping them through projects, through various departmental agencies and through international aid.  Our committee recommended that we should consider making available supplies of food although I suppose Nicaragua would not be in the same league as the Ethiopian famine, and the famine in Sudan.  It is a tragedy that we have to make choices when people are starving and that resources have to be rationed to ensure that those in greatest need are immediately looked after.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the educational system in Nicaragua has improved and the statistics are there to prove it.  They have also had a tremendous health programme.  In the past the poor were neglected by the previous régime.  People literally died on the streets from hunger and disease.  The rate of infant mortality was in the region of 121 per 1,000 births <Col N="1228" /> compared with the infant mortality rate in Ireland which is 15 per 1,000 births. This figure gives an idea of the dangerously low level to which the health standards in Nicaragua had dropped.  The adult mortality rate of the population was something like 16 per 1,000.  These people had overcome all the childhood diseases and should have been able to lead a full life but unfortunately that was not the case.  It is only since the present Nicaraguan Government came to power that efforts have been made to give any semblance of respectability to the health services.  The health problems reflect the living conditions of the population. Thirty per cent of the urban population were without water supply, 94 per cent of the rural population were without water supply, and 20 per cent of the urban population were without any sewerage facilities.  That is an indication of how the country was demoralised and neglected into a state of revolution.  It is no wonder there was a revolution by ordinary people against such a régime.  They did not have food, water or any of the basic human rights we talk about.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government of Nicaragua for their programme of education, health services, increased medical care centres, clinics, the provision of proper medical services, the visits to people in trouble, the visits to dentists, how the country looks after its pregnant women, the number who are under medical care and so on.  This must be an indication to our Government, to this country and to the media that a gesture is due towards the people who fought a revolution which cost the country a colossal amount economically speaking but which had tragic consequences for the population &mdash; and the revolution must have been worth something to have disposed of that kind of government.  The newly elected government have given figures to show their interest in their people and we, as a small nation should recognise them for what they are.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this subject two weeks ago the Minister did put on the record the attitude to Nicaragua of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government <Col N="1229" /> during our presidency of the Community. We also availed of the opportunity arising from the visit of President Reagan to put on record our reservations about the effects of his policies and the continuing effects of his attitude towards Central America.  It is appropriate that that should have been done.  Many of us looked to America to defend the smaller nations throughout the world and it is disappointing to feel that, because they want to protect a particular right wing philosophy, or because perhaps they have reservations about their territory being subjected to political beliefs from Central America, they will use any power or a war of attrition to ensure that democratically elected governments will fall, that anarchy will take over and that the whole process of military juntas and those chosen by right wing governments elsewhere would fall into place.  The Nicaraguan people have started and will continue to come to grips with their problems if they get assistance from us and from the European Community.  It will be a tragedy if all that is lost.  I hope the debate of this kind of report in this House and throughout the country through county councils, health boards and any other institution which can focus the attention of people on this area will be worthwhile.  It will be reassuring for the people of Nicaragua to recognise that there are people who care about them and care for the kind of institutions they have chosen for themselves by democratic electoral process.  We commend them for what they have done.  I am glad we had the opportunity to discuss this motion and that the Department and the Government will take cognisance of our recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I commend all the wonderful, powerful efforts made by Senator Michael Higgins in this matter.  The matter is a very simple one.  The last war, and the first one, were fought for freedom, the freedom of small nations, the right of self-determination and the right to run their own affairs democratically.  Why are the Americans so inconsistent?  They took part in these <Col N="1230" /> wars.  Why are the Americans &mdash; the Reagan Administration &mdash; so inconsistent when they say &ldquo;No money for NORAID, no money for the Provos, but money for the guerrillas to bring down a popular government in Central America?&rdquo; That is a blatant act of hypocrisy and inconsistency and our Department of Foreign Affairs should take note of that, if inconsistency means anything in international language.  I know it is right that the Russians were condemned for the Afghanistan invasion but that does not make the Americans right.</P>
      <P>From time to time the Americans have taken on the mantle of moral leaders in the world.  They cannot drape this mantle around their shoulders, as moral leaders of the world.  These Americans seem to be obsessed with the threat of Marxist Communism &mdash; to make it sound worse they call it Marxist-Leninist Communism, I do not know what the difference is &mdash; but I wonder what they are afraid of.  They took action against Cuba and finished up by driving Cuba into the arms of the Communist sphere of influence. They went to Vietnam, and we all know what happened there &mdash; a debacle.  What is not widely known is that the people who have the popular support in China now made overtures to the Americans and said they were going to conquer China on the new philosophy.  They wanted to have some kind of rapport with the Americans, but the Americans turned them down and backed the Kuomintang; so we have Formosa.  An American ambassador called Davies who was in Peking at the time advised the American Administration that they would be wise to get together with the people who were eventually going to take over China but they did not do it.  The result was the North/South Korean war, for which the Americans are absolutely indicted.  That was American influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are they afraid of?  Are they afraid that Americans will go Communist? At a reception in San Francisco during the Cuban crisis I said the Cuban people have a right to work out their own destination and future, the way they are going, the way they navigate where they <Col N="1231" /> are going, their ports of call and where they are going to finish.  I believe that John F. Kennedy drove the Cubans into the Russian sphere of influence.  I tried to reason with some Americans that night in San Francisco but I was almost physically assaulted.  They said, and this is how democratic they are, they would drop an atomic bomb on the island of Cuba. That was the way they would deal with Communism.  This is an obsession.  If their fear of Communism is not internal, it must be external.  If they are afraid of Communist spheres of influence externally, it follows logically that they are afraid of a world war situation where they might be invaded.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest that the Americans are thinking like juvenile delinquents. America is not going to be invaded by the Communists, by the Russians, the Warsaw pact people or the Cubans.  The Cubans in Nicaragua came about as counterproductive to American intervention. They are a most unhappy and unfortunate people.  The Americans have backed the most reactionary régimes in the world since they began the exercise of creating spheres of influence.  They are actually afraid of democratic socialism as well as Communism.  In 1962, I was a guest of the State Department in San Francisco. Our hostess that night was the wife of a rear-admiral in the American Navy.  A German broadcaster was with me at the opera.  During the intermission she got talking and fulminating against the British welfare system.  She was convinced that it was Communistic.  I tried to explain it was simple social justice.  You can put any ism you like on it.  That is the American interpretation gone amok, awry.</P>
    <P>The Americans do not understand that they must assist the small nations.  They must not spend any more money encouraging guerrillas to bring down a democratically elected government which is socialist, whose basis of approach to their own people is one of social justice.  Somebody must tell that to the Americans. The Americans are friends of the Irish, and the Department of Foreign Affairs <Col N="1232" /> are well placed to say from time to time, &ldquo;Look, you are a big brother with a lot of money and you are trying to crush the democratically elected government in Nicaragua.&rdquo;  The Department of Foreign Affairs must do this and they must pay attention to it.  Senator B. Ryan rightly said that the Americans are afraid that the whole socialist justice policy and philosophy will take on in South America. Why do the Americans not like that?  Do they not like social justice?  Do they not like social justice just because it is carried out by democratic socialists?  They will have to make up their minds about this. They have to accept there will be revolutionary change if there is not evolutionary change, and I make that distinction. They should be backing evolutionary change rather than revolutionary change. They should stop the supply of money and arms and intervention in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in support of the motion.  I congratulate the delegation who went to Nicaragua on the very thorough way they carried out their mission and it is quite clear from reading their report that their mission was successful.  They have given us an excellent report and have informed us very fully and adequately of the situation that exists in that country at present. If it were not for their report and the speeches they have made since their return, we might have been taken in by the propaganda circulated as to the undemocratic nature of the Government in Nicaragua.  Having read their report, it would not be possible, whatever one's view may be about the affairs in that country, to believe that there is not a democratic Government in existence there.  Having regard to all the circumstances it is very democratic indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Nicaragua are entitled to live their lives in their own way.  They are entitled to try to drag themselves up from the depths in which they existed up to a few years ago, from the depths they reached under the tyranny that existed for many years.  They have a tremendously difficult task to try to re-establish <Col N="1233" /> themselves as a successful nation, as a literate nation, a nation which can live its own life.  They have been doing an extremely good job and they are entitled to do that without threats from the United States.  They are entitled to our help.  We have had experience of threats of economic measures.  We should do anything we can to help these people.  It is impossible to believe that Nicaragua could be a threat to the United States having regard to the size of the United States as compared with the size of Nicaragua and to the economic situation there.  That being so, it is impossible to understand why the United States have adopted the policy it has adopted to that country.  In the circumstances, the United States policy must be deplored.</P>
    <P>If we can help Nicaragua by speaking out, by upholding their viewpoint, by insisting that they are a democratic country merely doing their best to improve their lot and trying to live their own kind of life, then we should do so.  If the life they want is a socialist one that is their business and they are entitled to that kind of country, economy and government.  It is their own business and should remain their own business.  It would be a tragedy if the recently elected Government should be undermined either by armed invasion or by economic warfare, by economic forces, economic boycotts and so on, and if we in this country can do anything, either through Government representations on the international scene or by our own efforts in this House and throughout the country, to uphold the situation in Nicaragua, then we should do our best because this is a cause to which we should devote ourselves so far as we can be of any help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by thanking all the Senators who have contributed to this debate, not only this evening but on the occasion of the moving of the resolution by Senator Ross and me.  I want to thank Senator Ross and my colleagues on the delegation, Deputy Liam Hyland and Deputy Bernard Allen, for their commitment and hard work in preparing a report that is now, I am glad <Col N="1234" /> to say, very widely accepted as a basic document on the Nicaraguan elections. In that regard I also want to thank the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who, in December 1984, adopted the report <i>in toto</i> and supported its recommendations to the Government.  On 10 January, 1985 they issued a press release saying that they had affirmed their support for all the recommendations.  The House will be pleased to note also that on 30 January, 1985 I received a letter from the Secretary for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Socialist International, in which he said:</P>
      <P>I was very much impressed by the objectivity and thoroughness of the report which will without doubt contribute to a better understanding of the realities in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>The report has had very wide dissemination abroad and the colleagues who worked with me have made that possible. I want to thank every Senator who spoke. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for assuring us that the Department of Foreign Affairs would continue to support the Contadora process and facilitate any technical assistance that might need to be given.  I want to thank Senators Howlin, B. Ryan, Ferris, McGonagle and Eoin Ryan for very accurately pointing out the kinds of issues that are involved in essentially a small country that has recently thrown off the shackles of dictatorship, that moved from a 50.3 per cent to a 12.9 per cent illiteracy rate in five years, that has massive participation in adult education which moved from 9,000 students attending pre-school programmes to 66,850 at the time we visited that country, and that has doubled the number of people attending primary and secondary schools. In every sphere &mdash; health, education, welfare, housing &mdash; its achievements have been enormous.  It is a society which is transforming itself.  I appreciate the support that the Seanad is giving to this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Circumstances have changed in this regard since I introduced the motion. Unfortunately, there has been a series of <Col N="1235" /> rhetorical war-like speeches from President Reagan and his aides in which they have stated, in violation of every principle of international law and every principle of sovereignty respected internationally, that it is their intention to undermine Nicaragua's present Government and replace it; that it is their intention to continue support for people who are today murdering and torturing people from the borders of Nicaragua, who are operating a régime of international terrorism, who are piling on the already great offence it is in international law to mine the ports of a neighbouring country, who issue a manual which speaks of the disruption of the economy, the shooting of people, the assassination of judges and the assassination of key officials within the civilian framework. These are breaches of international law. <i>The Irish Times</i> of 4 March, which commented so well on the situation, had this to say:</P>
    <P>Washington's behaviour over Nicaragua is a reason for alarm on the part of all the friends of the United States because it is so incoherent, naive and potentially catastrophic.  If the US Government can behave so outrageously and foolishly in its dealings with a tiny enclave of a relatively primitive and quite impoverished country at its back door, how can it be qualified to discuss seriously and coherently the global issues of arms control with the Soviet Union in a week's time?  The implications are terrifying.</P>
    <P>This is a point made by Senators from all sides of the House and by Members of the other House, urging the United States, as friends, to think again about the attitude they are taking to Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>In winding up the debate on the motion I would like to go back to the point on which I began.  It is very clear that a decision has to be made on the Nicaraguan question on the basis of a fundamental fact.  Do you believe that Nicaragua is transforming itself because it is possessed by Communist demons?  That is one view and it is the Nicaragua according to <Col N="1236" /> Ronald Reagan and Jeanne Kirkpatrick, or do you believe that that country, in the immediate wake of a dictatorship, is trying to provide its people with shelter? Since 1979 it has provided more houses than were provided in the previous 40 years.  It has provided its people with vaccinations.  Seventy thousand people participated one Sunday in a low cost mass vaccination programme.  It is now internationally accorded that Nicaragua has made enormous achievements in relation to literacy and now is trying to deal with adult illiteracy.  On those facts, is it not easier to believe that it is transforming itself because it wants to meet the needs of its people?  Perhaps you do not accept that, and I will take up Senator Ryan's point.  In international law we have signed covenants that recognise the integrity of national territory, that accept sovereignty.  Under international law the belligerence of the statements being made against Nicaragua are outrageous.</P>
    <P>I am personally disappointed that the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs are not here for the conclusion of this debate, but I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Creed, for whom I have enormous respect, is here and I know he will communicate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the views I am now representing.  In opening the debate on this resolution I said there were four points where Nicaragua could be destabilised.  One was in relation to the military aggression directed against the country.  In that connection we can use our voices to oppose what has been said by President Reagan.  While we were in Nicaragua the funeral of the Castellano family occurred.  Three children under 11 years were buried alive in buildings that were knocked by an assault from the Contras in the northern part of Nicaragua. President Reagan has compared these people to Simon Bolivar and to Lafayette, saying they are in the great tradition of freedom fighters.  What would our reaction be if such an appellation was appended to people seeking to destabilise our society?  We must oppose this war-like rhetoric.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> Secondly, in relation to the economic assistance there are a number of things we can do, particularly towards facilitating the economic agencies who might want to establish links with Nicaragua.  It is practical and sensible to establish a diplomatic presence in the region of Central America.  It would be more than acceptable to the Nicaraguan Government if we decided to locate a presence in Costa Rica, for example, which is a neutral country and such a person could be accredited to all of the states in the Central American region.  This is a positive suggestion.  I know it would be acceptable to the Nicaraguan Government.</P>
    <P>The regular war of economic attrition is taking place through the structure of aid, trade and debt renegotiation.  I should like to add a new set of facts which I have not used up to now as a number of people have asked me, since I introduced this motion, to give some substance to one point I made in relation to the financial war against Central America.  I should like to quote from a document &mdash; International Policy Report from the Centre for International Policy, 120 Maryland Avenue, Washington D.C. They published in March 1983 an interesting document and I will give some facts from it.  They mention three institutions. One is the Inter-American Development Bank.  They make the point early on about how the bank has been politicised to exclude assistance to Nicaragua.  They open by drawing a parallel, for example, with the situation in Chile.  It is an appalling, horrific parallel in that the Inter-American Development Bank decided to &mdash; and the phrase used in 1970 by President Nixon was &mdash; and I quote &ldquo;make the economy scream&rdquo;.  Another quotation: &ldquo;Not a nut or a bolt shall reach Chile&rdquo;. This was translated into economic strategy, and I quote from page 7 of the document to which I have referred:</P>
    <P>The bank claimed that Chile's macro-economic policies, not its politics were the grounds for denying the loans.  Once the military junta killed Allende and took over, the World <Col N="1238" /> Bank, the Inter-American Bank and the IMF all opened up with generosity. Chile's macro-economic policies had changed, they explained.</P>
    <P>The interesting side of this is that during the Carter administration, Nicaragua received $175 million from the Inter-American Development Bank and had prospects of getting $149 million more. In early November 1981 the United States led Argentina and Chile in forcing Nicaragua to withdraw its request for a loan which would have brought 50 new fishing boats and spare parts for old ones. I should like to point out that this kind of interference is interesting in that Somoza, to whom I have made reference, left Nicaragua in July 1979 and took with him most of the country's modern fishing boats.  He also owned three modern fish processing plants.  The point is that the loan was for replacing parts for those plants.  It was suggested by the executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank, who is a Salvadorean, that the fishing boats would be used to invade El Salvador, despite the fact that the fishing boats &mdash; and I have visited the area where they would be used &mdash; were in fact for use on the Atlantic coast.  By February 1983 the whole loan was gone.</P>
    <P>In January 1982, the World Bank was prepared to consider a $16 million loan to finance storm drainage and low income neighbourhood improvements in Managua. The US executive director of the World Bank and the Treasury Department of the Latin American Bureau were in favour of letting the loan go through; they recommended this in a cable to Secretary of State Haig in the Middle East and from there, and I quote from page 10 of the report: &ldquo;General Haig said a categorical no.&rdquo;  There was to be no $16 million loan in 1982 for storm damage. We visited the areas which were affected by the storm.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of education I quote from page 10 of the report:</P>
    <P>In February 1982 the World Bank's country programme paper equally suggested that no IDA resources can be allocated to Nicaragua.  Further lending <Col N="1239" /> for Nicaragua is not included in our proposed lending programme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It said about rural roads, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Nicaragua's road system is in reasonable shape and it appears that major investments could be postponed... We believe, equally, that we can reasonably recommend suspension of further water lending because of a possible lag in demand for water after the war.</P>
    <P>This is in a country where the bank, in the earlier part of the report from which I am quoting, had acknowledged that only 34 per cent of the rural population had access to safe water and only 32 per cent had access to any sewerage facilities. They were cut off from this aid also.</P>
    <P>In relation to the International Monetary Fund I should like to make a point: in the Somoza period, from spring 1979 to July 1979, the IMF was implored not to make a planned loan of $66 million to Somoza.  It made the loan.  Worse than this, under the IMF's compensatory financing facility, if a member state makes a wrong estimate, it has to pay back the under-estimated source.  The present Government in Nicaragua has had to pay back in full the Somoza falsified loan.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in relation to the military aggression, in relation to the economic issues, aid, trade and debt renegotiation, in relation to the political process, and in relation to the building of links, there are a number of things which we can do. These are not big dramatic things.  I repeat a point which I made in opening this debate.  It is good and I recommended it and our colleagues put it into our report when, with courage, Ireland behaved with principle at the September meeting in San Jose and resisted pressure from the powerful United States through Germany and through Britain to exclude Nicaragua from aid.  The exclusion of Nicaragua from trade is something which goes on at every meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  I should like to publicise this.  The fact of <Col N="1240" /> the matter is that the Caribbean Basin Initiative of the United States, which was effectively not allowed to be the model for the San Jose meeting, requires derogation from the GATT.  At those meetings, Ireland will have an opportunity of being consistent with its San Jose policy and of refusing to allow Nicaragua to be isolated.</P>
    <P>When history is written I believe that all those groups in Ireland who have supported the non-isolation of Nicaragua, a small country with a population slightly less than ours, will be thanked for their interest because &mdash; and this is my concluding point &mdash; I am well aware from a meeting of the National Security Council that took place in late summer in the United States that there is a systematic attempt to discredit delegations like that one of which I was a part; to discredit individuals who are interested in Nicaragua and to discredit members of political parties in Ireland and in Europe who are interested in Nicaragua.  It is the all-party support which exists in this House that enabled us to make such a strong defence of human rights in El Salvador.  Equally, it is this solidarity among all the political parties and the wonderful public support from all sections of the community that says to the United States: We are not simply green Paddies who do not understand the issues in Central America.  Our moral position is that we understand them very well and are taking action on them by continuing our interest.</P>
    <P>The report, which is the body of the motion before the House, is not a termination point in anybody's interest but a beginning of their interest.  Those who have been interested before now will be encouraged to continue their support for this democracy that may not exist should we ignore the challenges which are there to it now, within the next two years.  We have an urgent task before us and I hope that there will be opportunities before long of returning to this theme so that we might save people who have established democracy in the wake of the cruellest dictatorship of the century.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of which I have given you notice for the Adjournment relates to the interpretation of the criteria of qualification for supplementary welfare allowances.  It deals specifically with the situation in which a number of students find themselves.  To put the matter rather simply and perhaps over-simply in an uncomplicated way, let me construct a hypothetical situation.  If a low income family &mdash; let us say that they can either qualify for the grant or are <Col N="1242" /> slightly over the limit &mdash; should send some of their children to a third level institution and manage to be able to afford that for a particular year and that student then fails the examination the position that arises is that he, of course, is under no requirement to attend lectures at the third level institution but may present himself for re-examination at the end of the year.  He can receive a document from the third level institution confirming the fact that he is not required to be in attendance at any lecture.  He then can register as unemployed and available for work should it be offered. The position that arises in that case is that he is now registered as unemployed and having no work.  He is now perhaps living in digs or a flat or whatever and he gets into difficulty with the rent and difficulties about food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A practice prevails in Galway that if students announce that they are students they are automatically refused supplementary welfare allowance.  That is the categorical interpretation as it has been reported to me.  If, on the other hand, such people said that they were simply unemployed young people, living in a flat and were not able to pay their rent or people, for example, who needed to provide themselves with some food, their applications would be successful.  In other words, if they had ignored altogether the fact that they were students repeating their examinations.  I have reports in front of me where such individuals were successful. This is the issue that has been raised.  To the organisations involved in student welfare in these third level institutions it seems that there is some kind of arbitrary suggestion that the announcement that you are a student automatically disqualifies you for consideration under the provisions.  The long, rather wordy way in which I have placed this before the Seanad may have created some confusion but I make reference to the right of individuals in these circumstances to be considered as individual citizens in their own right with the full entitlements that are available under the Social Welfare Acts and it is the suggestion of the notice that I gave that the <Col N="1243" /> spirit of the Social Welfare Acts is being frustrated by interpretations.  Equally, the interpretations are causing hardship and needless suffering.  I had the choice of dealing with each of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Pattison, has now arrived here to listen to my statement on this problem.  I will try to be succinct in my summary of it.  In my notice to the Seanad I drew attention to what I feel is a somewhat arbitrary interpretation of the provisions relating to the administration of supplementary welfare allowances.  I am rather worried in this regard.  I suggested a hypothetical situation in which a low income family who may or may not be in receipt of a grant, succeed in providing means which they transfer to the person involved to attend at university.  The student then fails the particular examination.  The student has now been told by the parents <Col N="1244" /> that they are not in a position to support him or her in the year that follows.  The student is registered at the university only for examination purposes at the end of the year.  He can get a certificate like the one I have in front of me signed by the academic secretary certifying that he does not have to attend lectures.  He therefore registers for work and as being available for work and no work is available.</P>
      <P>A practice seems to prevail, at least in Galway city, that where such students, who are not being assisted from home announce themselves as students they are automatically told that they do not qualify for supplementary welfare allowance. I am raising the question of the interpretation that because you say you are a student and repeating an examination at the end of the year your individual citizen's right of entitlement under the Act should not be considered.  I further instanced the position where two perfectly similar cases presented themselves, one disguising the fact that he had any intention of doing an examination at the end of the year or that he had been in university previously and simply said that he was an unemployed young person living in a flat and could not afford the rent and was short of food and he was immediately granted supplementary welfare allowance.  The distinction between the two cases is that one person offered the information of what his main activity was in the previous year and what it would be &mdash; hopefully &mdash; at the end of a successful repeat of the examinations. The exclusion of people on such an arbitrary basis is a wrong interpretation of the Act.  It frustrates the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment because I had been dealing with five individual cases.  What concerned me in a number of ways is that in the reply to one student &mdash; I am referring to qualification certificate AK 12229 dated 29 November 1984 &mdash; there is a box ticked stating: &ldquo;You have not given details to show that your means are not more than £2,935.40 a year.  In your case this is the maximum amount of means you may have to get a qualification certificate . . <Col N="1245" /> ..&rdquo; The problem is that this particular student had tried to get a job locally; he was studying in the evenings; he was repeating an examination in agriculture. He went to England and obtained a job as a labourer, he managed to save some money to support himself and when he returned to Galway the money was exhausted.  He then started borrowing. These borrowed funds ceased.  He wanted money to pay rent.  He was short of money and came to see me.  The local social welfare office requested him to prove he had no means.  He tried to comply with their request.  His suggestion of proof was rejected.</P>
    <P>He also went to the PRSI office in Galway to get a letter of proof stating that he had not worked at any time in Ireland.  He was told that as he did not work here he had no number, therefore they could not write such a letter.  This is a needless &ldquo;bind&rdquo;.  It is a problem to try to identify those people whose means are meagre and who are not being assisted from home.  I accept that as a real difficulty. But the categorical and I say arbitrary decision that when a person announces himself as a student you can initially refuse him this benefit is not in the spirit of the Social Welfare Acts.  It frustrates their implementation and impedes the benefit of these Acts to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>In another case which I am dealing with the student had borrowed money. This student is Reference 3923317E.  I have approximately five such cases.  They indicate a certain pattern of dealing with a certain type of applicant.  Rather than having a frustrating, growing file of correspondence in each of these cases, courteous but not enormously helpful letters, it is better to raise this matter here and to seek not only clarification but such direction from the Department as might straighten the matter out.  If, for example, any one of these persons had the legal means to test the implementation and interpretation of the Acts in the court, I have no doubt that an individual case could succeed but I do not see why it should have to come to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first to explain some basic concepts which underpin the system of unemployment payments.  The various conditions governing these schemes are laid down in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  One of these conditions is that a claimant must be available for employment. In order to determine whether the particular claimant is or is not available for employment, the deciding officer must ascertain the facts of the case as far as possible and apply his judgment to the evidence.  The deciding officer must decide whether the person is genuinely on the labour market and available to take a job if one is offered to him.  The point has often been made that there is little point in requiring a person to be available for work when there is little possibility of getting work.  The fact, however, is that availability for work is an essential condition for unemployment payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misconception here and to assist the Minister of State, may I say that the issue is not availability for work?  If you register as unemployed and were available, I do not see how you could disqualify yourself by studying while you were idle.  That would be the interpretation of the logical position towards which we are moving now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there are two aspects to the question.  One is the necessary qualification to get the qualification certificate but it does not automatically mean that if one gets a qualification certificate, one will get unemployment assistance.  The matter has to be decided as to availability and so on.  Clearly if a person is engaged on a course of study, this fact has a significant bearing on <Col N="1247" /> whether he is or is not available for work. Questions which would arise in the case of claimants who are engaged in a course of study would include: &ldquo;Is this person truly on the labour market?  What is his or her work record?  What are the hours of study required?  Would the student be likely to give up his studies and take a job if one were offered to him?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interrupting the Minister but I would like to place on record a document in relation to one of the cases.  It states:</P>
      <P>This is to certify that X (name and address supplied) is registered in this college as a first year agricultural science student for examination purposes only.</P>
      <P>He is only required to attend for the ten days when the examinations are being held at the end of the year.  This is a document signed by the academic secretary and with the seal of the college.  In every one of the five cases there is a document of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The answers to questions such as these will determine the position but it is obvious that each case has to be decided on its merits.  Full-time attendance by day at a course of education is generally speaking not regarded as being consistent with the notion of being available for work during the academic year.  Full-time students can, however, qualify for unemployment payments during the summer vacation if they are available for work and if they satisfy the other conditions for entitlement. A student engaged in a programme of studies during the summer vacation as for instance in the case of a student taking an examination in the autumn, might not, however, be entitled to payment.  There are no hard-and-fast rules on this matter. Each case must be considered on its merits.  The question to be determined is whether the degree of commitment to his studies by the person following the course is such as to render him unavailable for employment.  There are no hard-and-fast <Col N="1248" /> rules to deal with the situation of an adult claimant who has been made unemployed and who decides to pursue his or her educational studies pending reemployment.</P>
      <P>Within the limits of the existing legislation there is considerable scope for unemployed persons to engage in education courses without affecting their entitlements. Persons engaged in part-time courses, who are trying to improve their prospects of employment, would generally be able to fulfil the availability-forwork condition.  My Department, while retaining the right of deciding officers to decide cases on their merits, is always prepared to discuss with educational agencies and providers of educational courses whether particular programmes would present difficulties from this point of view.  This, combined with greater flexibility on the part of course organisers &mdash; which is becoming an increasing feature of educational provision &mdash; has considerable advantages in terms of giving the unemployed a greater range of options.  I am satisfied that the existing approach of my Department in regard to unemployment payments and persons pursuing educational courses is reasonable and could not be regarded in any way as frustration of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Decisions on unemployment claims are made by deciding officers who are independent in the exercise of their powers.  Moreover, any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of his or her deciding officer may apply for a review of the case by an appeal's officer.  I might say that the condition that a claimant must be available for work is basic to the unemployment schemes of other countries also and is recognised as such by the social security conventions drawn up by the International Labour Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the unemployment schemes is to provide income maintenance to persons who are involuntarily unemployed.  Student support is not a proper function of these schemes.  The provision of income support for students <Col N="1249" /> is a function of other agencies.  In addition to the question of availability, unemployed claimants have to satisfy the other conditions for the receipt of benefit or assistance.  Since most students would not have an adequate PRSI record for benefit purposes, it is generally unemployment assistance they claim during their holiday period.  This involves a means test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a mistake I made in my presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, if an applicant does not satisfy the means test, the question as to whether he or she is available for work does not, in fact, arise.  The items to be taken into account in assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes are set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981.  One of the items which arises frequently in the case of unemployed claimants who are living at home is the value of board and lodgings. The legislation does not specify the method by which this value is to be calculated but the value of board or lodgings in any case clearly depends on the standard of living of the household and the formula which has been devised provides for assessing the value of board and lodgings in this way.  The purpose of the requirement to take account of the value of board and lodgings is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants whose parents are well to do and those whose parents are in poor circumstances. Otherwise, persons living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
      <P>I understand the Commission on Social Welfare will be examining the question of what items should be taken into account in assessing means under the various social assistance schemes and I look forward to their recommendations in regard to this item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aside from the value of board and lodgings any other income an applicant for unemployment assistance might have is also taken into account in accordance with the legislation.  The amount of any <Col N="1250" /> educational grant received by an applicant is assessable as means.  Similarly, any financial contributions made by the parents of an applicant who is living away from home would be assessable.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said clarifies matters to some extent for the Senator and in particular that I have disabused him of any notion that automatic assumptions are made by my Department in respect of any category of claimant.  The fact is that every claim is decided on its individual merit.  In the case of applicants who are participating in an educational course there is sufficient flexibility in the system to ensure that those who are in need and who are genuinely unemployed receive their entitlements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to thank the Minister but in doing so to say that there is one problem about which I am not clear and that is in respect of the student from the circumstances I mentioned, who fails an examination and continues in the place where the third level institution is and wants to be available for work, whose parents are not supporting him or her.  That person, as I have heard this explanation, because of the danger of the children of affluent families abusing the system, is not being considered. I question the legality of imputing parents' income to people who, perhaps, have broken their connection with home.  Quite frankly, it is a breach of Constitution rules.  I welcome the council and its recommendations.  Three of these five people I have mentioned have no contact with home.</P>

There will be cases where the deciding officer has to make up his <Col N="1251" /> mind as to whether the information is right or wrong.  This has to be pursued.</P>
