      <P>Under the powers conferred upon me by Standing Order 21(2) of the Standing Orders of Seanad Éireann relative to Public Business, I summoned Seanad Éireann to meet at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 February 1985 for the following special reason: To consider proposed urgent legislation.  The Business to be considered at this sitting is confined to the items on the Order Paper which I caused to be circulated this afternoon.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Let me begin by thanking Senators for responding to the call to resume here this evening to discuss this urgent and important legislation.  It is regrettable that a Bill of this nature has to come before the House in this way and with so little advance notice to Members but I want to assure the House that the Government consider that the circumstances are such as to leave them with no option but to proceed in the manner <Col N="316" /> proposed.  I would like to say that we appreciate the co-operation shown.</P>
      <P>In the time available to me since I left the other House it has not been possible to prepare a separate statement for delivery here so I am sure the House will understand if the statement I make now is in substantially the same terms as the one made in the other House earlier this afternoon.  I will of course be dealing with points arising in the debate in my reply.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill arises from a specific situation that has arisen and which has such serious implications for the maintenance of public order in this country that the Government have no option but to move with speed and decisiveness to deal with it.  Information has been conveyed to me by the Garda authorities that a large sum of money which is the proceeds of criminal activity by the IRA &mdash; specifically extortion under threat of kidnap and murder &mdash; has found its way into a bank in this country and is being held to the use of and for the purposes of the IRA.  In recent days it became apparent that those who are nominally the custodians of this money would find it necessary to make a very early move to transfer it.  This necessitated urgent action by the Government to prevent the money becoming available to the IRA to fund their campaign of murder and destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Offences against the State Act, 1939 contains provisions which declare the property of unlawful organisations to be forfeited to and vested in the Minister for Justice but those provisions of that Act do not contain a sufficiently precise formula or mechanism by which the Minister can seize the property while at the same time giving anybody who may claim to be the legitimate and bona fide owners of it the right to have their claims determined by the courts.  For this reason, the Government have decided to ask the Oireachtas for new powers &mdash; powers which will not only provide a mechanism for dealing with the instant case but which will also establish a framework for dealing with any future cases of this nature that may arise.  Hence, this Bill, amending and extending the <Col N="317" /> Offences against the State Acts, is now before this House.</P>
    <P>In bringing the Bill before the House I am, as I hope the House will appreciate, necessarily constrained by security considerations from outlining to the House the full extent of the information supplied to me and to the Government.  However, I believe it is both possible and necessary to give the House an indication of the nature of the evidence.</P>
    <P>The sum of money involved is, as I have said, a large one.  There are cogent reasons why I should not be specific or give even an approximate figure but, to give some idea of what I am talking about, I will say that we are speaking in terms of a seven-figure sum and I would not want anybody to infer from that that I mean the smallest possible seven-figure sum.  It has already been moved across international frontiers and may, to an extent at least, have been &ldquo;laundered&rdquo;&mdash; to use a modern colloquial expression. Members at this point may legitimately wonder how firm is the basis for what I have said.  The answer may be deduced from the following.  The Garda Síochána received information of a very definite and specific character regarding the handing over, outside this jurisdiction and by people not resident within this jurisdiction, of a very large sum under pressure of Provisional IRA threats with &ldquo;kidnap-related&rdquo; background.  The details covered the movements of the moneys from one foreign bank account to another and into the Irish banking system.</P>
    <P>All the details, no matter how reliable the sources the Garda Síochána might have, would be taken with a due degree of caution.  What seems to put the matter beyond any reasonable doubt is that, at a particular point in that series of transactions, the Garda Síochána obtained independent evidence that confirmed the accuracy, at that point, of what had been disclosed.  That independent evidence is, at least in part, available to the Garda Síochána in documentary form because legal proceedings were taken by a public authority in one foreign country in relation <Col N="318" /> to certain aspects of the banking transactions in that country.</P>
    <P>I think I should make it clear to the House that I asked the Garda Síochána whether there was any possibility that the sources from which they received the details to which I first referred might have learned of those details from some foreign banking contacts or whether there was any other way whatsoever in which what I might call the two streams of information could have had a common source and were therefore not truly independent. I have been assured that no such possibility exists &mdash; that the Garda Síochána are aware of the precise nature of the contacts that made it possible for the initial information to be given to them and that the confirmation, in the sense in which I have used that term, is independent. On the information available to me, and given the assurances received from the Garda Síochána about the independent nature of the confirmation, it seems to me that the matter must be taken to be beyond any reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to everyone that, if this money were to be used for IRA purposes the consequences for human life on this island would be grave.  I do not need to spell out what it would mean.  In these circumstances, the Government and, I submit, the Oireachtas have a clear moral duty in the interest of the common good to intervene to stop this from happening. I believe it can be argued that there is also a legal duty to do so deriving from the Constitution itself.  The Constitution, as the House is well aware, places on the State an obligation to safeguard the rights of all its citizens, to respect them and to defend and vindicate their personal rights whenever they are threatened.</P>
    <P>I do not need to lecture this House on the evils of the IRA.  I will simply recall, because it is important in the context of this Bill that I should do so, that since the IRA campaign began again in this country in the 1969-70 period thousands of people have been murdered and maimed on this island.  In this part of the country 12 members of the security Forces &mdash; Garda and Army &mdash; have been murdered in the past 14 years.  Millions <Col N="319" /> of pounds have been taken in armed robberies. And, on top of all that, the tragic position of the people of Northern Ireland has become worse.</P>
    <P>We now have to deal with the unusual and difficult problem of these funds.  It is one for which a solution has not been easy to find.  Although the 1939 Act clearly provides that the consequential effects of the Government making a suppression order against an unlawful organisation includes depriving them of property held by them, as I have said, the Act does not provide a clear mechanism whereby the Minister can take over property which becomes forfeited when the organisation is declared to be unlawful.</P>
    <P>There is provision in section 22 which authorises the Minister to take all necessary steps including the initiation of legal proceedings to get the property into his possession but, apart from the fact that this provision is vague, it is not desirable &mdash; for reasons which I am sure the House will appreciate &mdash; for the Minister to have to initiate a court action in circumstances such as this where speed is of the essence. That is the kernel of the problem.  The Bill before the House addresses itself to this problem in a direct and, I think, commonsense way.  I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 2 will be that, on production to a bank of a document signed by the Minister bearing the seal of the Minister and stating that, pursuant to section 22 of the 1939 Act, certain moneys described in the document are, in the Minister's opinion, forfeited as being the property of an unlawful organisation, the bank will be obliged to pay those moneys into the High Court as directed by the Minister.  There is provision requiring the bank to notify the person, or persons, in whose name the moneys are held of their payment into the High Court.  This provision is being brought in on a temporary basis only and will operate for only three months unless continued in force by Government order. The Government will be able to reactivate it but only for three months at a time.  This is, I believe, an important <Col N="320" /> limitation on the power of the Minister and will, I suggest, act as a safeguard.</P>
    <P>When the moneys are paid into the High Court it will then be open to any person claiming to be the owner of them to apply to the court within six months for an order directing the High Court to pay the moneys, together with appropriate interest, to him.  If the High Court is satisfied that section 22 of the 1939 Act has not had effect in relation to the moneys &mdash; this means that, subject to what is contained in section 8 of the Bill, which I will deal with shortly, if the court is satisfied that, loosely speaking, the moneys are not moneys belonging to an unlawful organisation &mdash; and if the court is also satisfied that the person claiming the moneys is the owner of them, the court will be obliged to order that the moneys be repaid to the person claiming them.  In any such proceedings that might be brought, the Minister will be entitled to be heard and this will, of course, enable him to defend the action he has taken.</P>
    <P>If proceedings are not brought within the six month period or if they are brought and are dismissed, the Minister may then apply to the High Court on an <i>ex parte</i> basis &mdash; this means that he will not be obliged to serve notice on any other party &mdash; for an order directing the moneys to be paid into an account for the benefit of the Exchequer.  However, there is specific provision in this section for preserving the rights of any person claiming to be the owner of the moneys who does not apply within the six month period.  It is open to such a person to bring an application anytime within a period of six years of the payment of the moneys into the High Court and if he can satisfy the court that there are reasonable grounds for this failure to bring an application within the six month period &mdash; he may for example have been abroad and unaware of the Minister's action &mdash; and if he also satisfies the court as to the other matters &mdash; namely that the moneys are not the moneys of an unlawful organisation and that he is the owner of them &mdash; the court is obliged to order a refund of the moneys to him.  Where the High <Col N="321" /> Court orders moneys to be refunded, either within the initial six months or pursuant to &ldquo;late&rdquo; applications, the court is empowered to award compensation to the person in respect of any loss incurred by him.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which deals with evidence, provides that if a document is produced in court signed by the Minister and stating that moneys described in the document are &mdash; again loosely speaking &mdash; the property of an unlawful organisation the document shall be evidence of the fact.  This does not, of course, mean that it is conclusive evidence of that fact but only that it is evidence and, like all or virtually all evidence, it can be rebutted.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of this section will enable a party to proceedings relating to ownership of moneys paid into the High Court to apply to the court for an order directing the bank or a specified officer of the bank to produce and prove to the court documents or records in the bank's possession or capable of being produced by it relating to the operation of the account to which the moneys relate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is an important provision because it will have the effect of conferring full immunity on a bank for acting in compliance with a document of the Minister requiring it to lodge moneys in the High Court.  The corollary of this, however, is that under section 7 if a bank fails to comply with a requirement to transfer funds into the High Court it will be guilty of a serious offence and any member of the bank's staff that is responsible will also be guilty of an offence and liable to be charged accordingly.</P>
    <P>Finally I come to section 8.  This does two things.  First it removes any doubt there may be that all the property of an unlawful organisation is forfeited under section 22 of the 1939 Act and not just property held by it at the time a suppression order is made.  Second, it applies section 22 &mdash; the forfeiture provision &mdash; to moneys held for the use or benefit of or for the purposes of an unlawful organisation.  This widens the scope of the forfeiture provision and deals with what probably is in many cases the reality, namely, that moneys will be held <Col N="322" /> by &ldquo;front men&rdquo; for unlawful organisations. I think that covers the main points of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to say that the Government have not lightly brought forward this Bill and would not have done so were it not convinced that the Bill is essential and that there is no other way of dealing with the problem that now faces us.  I do not deny that it is a strong measure and that the power it confers on the Minister is one that ought never to be used lightly.  I can and do now give a firm assurance that I will not use it lightly but it may be more to the point if I say that I do not think that it can ever be used lightly, if only because any use of it is open to immediate challenge in the High Court and one in which the Minister of the day would face the hazard of having to pay compensation for any loss.</P>
    <P>The provision for a confiscation or forfeiture of the property of unlawful organisations is there since 1939.  To the extent to which this Bill expands its effectiveness, its main provisions are usable only for a period of three months initially and, after that, only for a limited period at a time if and as authorised by Government order.  I have no evidence that would make it either necessary or appropriate for me to act under it at present except in relation to the one specific case I have mentioned but I think it right to say that the information available suggests that it may well be needed on occasion in the future though obviously, unless such a situation were to arise, within the initial three month period, it would require a Government order to authorise any ministerial action.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under normal circumstances we would not like being brought back here to discuss a Bill at such short notice, but we must take the Minister's assurance that it is necessary to have the specific items mentioned in the Bill dealt with urgently.  For that reason, we on this side of the House will not hold up the passage of the Bill.  Indeed, I feel most Members of the House would, at this stage, wish that everything to do with the <Col N="323" /> Offences against the State Act should now be reviewed so that instances like this or instances that have occurred in the past fortnight do not occur again.  It is vitally necessary that a Bill which gives such wide powers should, if not completely amended, be brought up to date.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that in the Bill protection is given to people who have what they might consider a legitimate claim on funds which the Minister might consider to be funds which are available for the use of illegal organisations.  The fact that this Bill will be allowed to go through here this evening without what I would consider to be the necessary thought that we would like to give it, does not mean that in all future cases we will act accordingly.  On the assurance of the Minister that this Bill is to deal with specific money that has come into the State because of IRA activities within or outside the State, we will go along, on this occasion, with it.</P>
      <P>The people around the country who were wondering what was going to happen in this and the other House today should take cognisance of the fact that we are dealing here with the IRA, that the moneys we are talking about are moneys that were taken by extortion and by threat of kidnap and murder.  Anybody who would have any thoughts of going along with what the IRA stand for should having read the reasons for bringing this Bill before us, change their minds immediately.  We do not like to have Bills placed before us in this manner but, considering the assurances given by the Minister, we will go along with him on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House understand the urgency of this Bill.  We should also take the opportunity to commend the investigating authority which came forward with this information, namely, the Garda Síochána.  I have no doubt from what the Minister said that he is satisfied that the information available to the Garda Síochána is correct and that it necessitated urgent action.  When looking at the Offences against State Act, <Col N="324" /> 1939, in which the Minister considered he had sufficient powers to confiscate property, it is fair to say that the Offences against the State Act, 1939, referred to physical property, for example, buildings or offices.  It could be construed at that time that it would be unlikely that it would suddenly disappear overnight unlike this vast sum of money which we are informed is lodged in a bank account in the Twenty-six Counties.  I take it from what the Minister has said in terms of figures that this is running into millions of pounds.  It is appropriate that if this kind of funds were taken by force, threat, coercion or any other forceful means from innocent people in other parts of the world and lodged here we would be reneging on our duty if we did not give to the Government the necessary legislation to ensure that these funds would be frozen.</P>
      <P>In commending the Government on their secrecy and indeed the way the media handled this situation, we hope that when the Minister goes to the bank in the morning he is not late.  We hope that the money is still available to us and in fact that it will be there.  This brings us to other sections of the Bill which deal with the money the subject of High Court proceedings.  It will be lodged in the courts and will only be available to the Minister having followed through the processes outlined in various sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to those sections, which we will probably deal with on Committee Stage, apart from the upfront person who lodged this sum and looking at illegal organisations, the intricacies in which they work &mdash; certain people in certain places &mdash; since we cannot be sure about the people making claims, can I take it from what the Minister said that, within the statutory period of six months, the owners of this money who can prove that they were some of the people who were subjected to extortion under threats or otherwise, will be considered, even if they are outside the jurisdiction, the bona fide owners of this property?  If sufficient evidence is forthcoming from that <Col N="325" /> type of source, will their claim to this particular fund be considered a legitimate one?</P>
    <P>I have no other reservations about it. We have all been loud in our condemnation &mdash; the Minister has joined with us, &mdash; of the IRA and their activities and the results arising from them not alone in the Twenty-six Counties but also in the Six Counties and in other places.  We have condemned them on numerous occasions in the Seanad.  Even though this might sound like draconian legislation, in this particular instance the Minister will find ready support from all sides of the House. Senator Lanigan has confirmed that in his contribution.</P>
    <P>My party have no reservations in this area.  I hope the Minister is not too late and that the stable door has not already been opened.  I hope the appropriate consultations have taken place and that the Bill will be in time to ensure that Ireland is not used as a safe dumping ground for any of the materials used by this illegal organisation in the furtherance of their policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Dr. O'Donoghue Dr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because I know other Members wish to speak on this subject also.  It is right that we should make it clear that we endorse any action which brings home that we totally reject any of the actions of the IRA, especially their abominable kidnapping type operations.  In the context of having this legislation put through today, the questions which crossed my mind were, first of all, if the existing legislation, section 22, authorises the Minister to take all necessary steps, including the initiation of legal proceedings, does that mean that there was power already to at least prevent the funds from being withdrawn from whatever bank that is currently holding them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask this question in the context of being concerned whether it might have been possible, perhaps even today, for some of the people concerned to have made any move to repossess these funds. In other words, was there any action already initiated to prevent any movement <Col N="326" /> of these funds until such time as this Bill comes into effect?  If that is the case, if action has already been taken to freeze the funds in their present location, does that mean that we might have had time to debate this Bill in a more leisurely fashion?  I am not necessarily questioning the urgency of this Bill.  I simply would like the Minister's assurance that the inevitable delay which must occur even between the announcement yesterday of the recall of the Seanad and the introduction of this urgent Bill, would in some sense have alerted some of the people concerned and ask what interim steps, if any, had been taken to contain the situation until a Bill such as this comes into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill which amends in a very important respect the Offences against the State Act, 1939, deals with a specific situation, the facts of which the Government only are aware.  It is only right and proper that these facts should not be outlined to us and that we should accept the good faith of the Minister in indicating to us the necessity for this measure.  The necessity is one based on national security.  As the Minister has said, the background is kidnap-related. All members of this House are aware and accept that this measure is an attempt by the Oireachtas to further defeat subversive organisations.  As such I welcome it.  The central mechanism of the Bill is balanced.  It gives all parties the opportunity if they have bona fide laid claim to what may legitimately be theirs.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we congratulate the Garda Síochána and the security forces for bringing to light the circumstances which gave rise to the necessity for this Bill.  I welcome the Bill.  It is a necessary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks by quoting Harold Macmillan when he said quite recently that he had always found that whenever the establishment was unanimous about anything it was almost invariably wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I obviously cannot and will not oppose this Bill because I am too rational a human being to enter into an argument on <Col N="327" /> something about which I do not know the entire facts.  Nevertheless, one cannot help contrasting the delicacy surrounding the expropriation of somebody's property, as suggested in this Bill, with its legal niceties and its temporary provisions and so on, and the extraordinarily vicious and widespread way in which the rest of this legislation is used against people against whom no reasonable suspicion exists, confirming the suspicion I have long held that people's property is far more sacred in this State than their liberty.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would be slower than other Members of the House to congratulate the Garda Síochána for something which has not been proved in a court of law, because with all due respect the Minister and particularly his Department are not by any repute the most objective assessors of evidence from the Garda.  Various past proposals that have emanated from various Ministers for Justice on the basis of confidential reports have been proven to be quite spurious and quite exaggerated. Nevertheless, if it is true that there is a substantial sum of money in circulation through our banking system, if it is true that this money will be used to fund unlawful armed activity and if it is true that this Bill is necessary in order to deal with that issue, then, of course, we have to support it but I am somewhat taken-aback that at this stage, after 15 years of dealing with subversion in this country, it has suddenly emerged that what seems to be a principal and major provision of dealing with subversion i.e. that a proscribed organisation has its property forfeit, we now, apparently, have some doubt as to whether that is the case.</P>
    <P>In the light of a decision in the courts on another aspect of the Offences against the State Act I wonder is it time to look, not just at the dreadful injustices that are perpetrated against people under the Offences against the State Act, but also as to its continuing suitability in the light of a succession of Supreme Court decisions over the last ten years.  I am profoundly sceptical and somewhat uneasy about the fact that this legislation can be renewed by Government order subject to <Col N="328" /> a negative vote in the House.  In other words, it will not require a vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas to continue this legislation in existence.  It will require a negative vote to prevent it from being renewed.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable capacity for troublemaking on the part of a maliciously intent; I am well aware that the present Minister would never be maliciously intent, but a possible successor could cause considerable trouble for political organisations that are accused of being in sympathy with subversives by suggesting that aspects of their funds or all of their funds come under the heading of the provisions of this Bill.  Since it would require a vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas to overturn such an order it seems that the capacity to meddle in the affairs of what are legal political organisations, whatever we think of them, would be further extended, which goes back to what an organisation called the Anti-Apartheid Movement said before, that if we are going to denounce organisations and not have anything to do with them then we should proscribe them; if we are not then we should leave them alone.  I have a profound belief that there is a temptation on all of us and particularly on Governments to abuse any powers they have had.  Every power that I am aware of that has been given under emergency legislation or under the Forcible Entry Act or under anything else has been abused and extended beyond its initial intent and purpose.</P>
    <P>While it is not for me to weep over those who have millions of pounds on deposit in banks if the Minister for Justice or the Government choose to make life difficult for them, nevertheless I wonder about the possibilities that will be read into such a provision in years to come because the evidence in the past is that what may well be necessary to deal with a specific task can become very convenient to deal with a vast range of tasks.  It would have been preferable if the provisions of this Bill had to be renewed by the Houses of the Oireachtas from time to time as the Government saw fit.  Again one has to wonder if at this late stage <Col N="329" /> such a fundamental question is unclear in the Offences against the State Act, how many other fundamental questions are unclear in the Offences against the State Act.  Perhaps now that the Minister has had to concentrate his mind on the Offences against the State Act he might concentrate his mind on the entire question of the Offences against the State Act and particularly the overwhelming evidence that has been used for a whole variety of purposes beyond that for which it was intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Second Reading of this Bill.  The problem which the Minister has identified is obviously one which has developed only over the last few years.  It is common knowledge that subversive organisations have to an increasing extent, concentrated their activities in the area of extortion and kidnapping.  That has been the result of various successful campaigns by successive Governments to restrict the success of these subversive organisations in the actual taking of cash as it was being moved around the country.  This is a new trend which must be met in its own way and by all modern means and when you ally that problem to the very real problem that arises, that a lot of these cash rich organisations which are operating in this country have their headquarters outside of this country, you add to the problems which the security forces have in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true to say these organisations might from time to time find themselves under pressure like that and while it is true to say that they, in fairness to the people of this country, should resist these pressures, because their headquarters are outside this country we are powerless in some cases to know whether they are resisting the pressure or not, and in other cases we are powerless to do anything about it.  But from time to time, as the Minister has indicated, certain moneys do make their way to this country which have suspicious origins and origins which appear to indicate that they have been the result of this type of extortion or this kind of kidnap pressure.  It is right <Col N="330" /> that we should tackle this problem.  We will all support the Bill in that regard.</P>
    <P>Balanced against that the Minister has to take into account in putting any legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas any possible abuses of legislation which might arise.  I would like to congratulate the Minister particularly on tackling in this Bill that potential problem.  For the Minister to make the adjudication of his actions under this Bill a matter for the High Court and a matter specifically referred to as being a matter for the High Court is a very worthwhile safeguard against the abuse of this power by some future Minister.  In so far as the State is safe as long we have the separation of powers between the courts and the Government, it guarantees that this Bill cannot be abused during that period of time.  It is true to say that if there was a complete breakdown of goodwill on the part of the State and if it gained control of the courts then no legislation would protect the citizens from an oppressive government.  We are not concerned with that here because that does not appear to be very likely in the future in this country because of our political climate.</P>
    <P>The Minister in giving the power specifically to the High Court to adjudicate on these matters is taking the very best way out.  He is removing the decision on this matter away from himself, away from the political process, away from the members of the Garda Síochána to the Judiciary and giving them the responsibility in that regard.  The Minister is to be congratulated in respect of that portion of the Bill and that approach to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This represents a severe limitation on the private property rights of certain people.  We can be safe in the knowledge that the High Court will, conscious as they are, some might say over-conscious as they are, of the property rights of the individual and the importance of them, examine any Order which the Minister might make under the relevant section of this Bill and they will protect the legitimate interests of anybody whom this Minister or any future Minister may mistakenly certify as coming within <Col N="331" /> the relevant sections of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The other thing on which the Minister is to be congratulated is the short period of time of operation of this Bill, that is a three month period from time to time.  It is right and proper that that should be the case.  The Minister should be further congratulated because should it be necessary at any time in the future to re-introduce this legislation, by order, the Minister of the day would have to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and would have to justify himself in this regard.  This is no guarantee &mdash; with the Whip system in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; that it would not be passed by a House of the Oireachtas but it is a guarantee that the matter would be subject to public scrutiny, and that is almost as important as the vote which would take place in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to remind all of my fellow Senators that, in so far as I have been able to ascertain, this really only applies to proscribed organisations, it only applies to organisations which have already been proscribed under the Offences against the State Act.  Therefore, you cannot decide that it is going to apply to some political organisation you do not like.  First of all, you have to go through the process of proscribing it in the way which is laid down under the Offences against the State Act, subject to all the limitations of that proscription procedure.  It is only then that an order can be made under this Act.  It is important that the Minister should clarify that that is the case and that we should satisfy ourselves that it is not possible for a bona fide organisation to have the terms of this Bill applied to them unless they come within the definition of a proscribed organisation under the existing emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will have something to say with regard to the penalties under the offences section of this Bill but subject to that I congratulate the Minister.  In adopting the attitude which they are adopting both Houses of the Oireachtas are showing quite clearly that we are united in our determination to <Col N="332" /> ensure that democracy will prevail in this country and those who try to rule us by the gun will not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to support this Bill and to congratulate the Government and the Minister on the speed with which this has been introduced.  I am delighted to see the Government &mdash; which has come under so much criticism for being incapable of governing the country &mdash; coming to a firm decision in a matter where it is obviously of enormous importance.  We are dealing with the IRA.  We are dealing with an organisation whose declared aim it is to overthrow the State, and I believe this legislation is obviously necessary.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ferris said, and Senator Ryan did not seem to agree completely, it is an opportunity for congratulation of the gardaí because the gardaí are so often criticised, they are so often pilloried for all sorts of mistakes in all sorts of spheres. On this occasion it is quite obvious that they have done, without going into detail, an extremely effective job of work and have come across a situation where it is necessary for the Government to act.  It is time the gardaí were given a leg-up in the propaganda war, and I am delighted that this has happened.</P>
      <P>I trust the Government not to abuse the power which they can exercise under this Bill.  I am delighted to see the attitude of the Opposition on this Bill.  On one point we might look &mdash; not in a critical way &mdash; at what has happened.  But we are talking about a very large sum of money. We might ask how this sum of money came to be in the hands of these people. We should ask how did they get it?  I do not necessarily agree with what Senator Ryan said.  Although I understand the reasons for what he said and the reservations which he has, I question his timing because I do not think it is the time to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at the possibility of strengthening the law against the IRA and not weakening it.  I believe in some ways the Offences against the State Act should be looked at, but we are still being threatened, in a very real way, by this <Col N="333" /> organisation, as this Act today shows and as the necessity for this Act shows.  I think the Minister should look at it, but there may be places where this Act could be strengthened.  I congratulate the Government, the Opposition and the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to having had a personal feeling of immense relief when the purpose for which we were being convened this evening was made known to us in the course of this afternoon because &mdash; I am sure like some other Members of the House &mdash; I had a secret fear that it might be for some other purpose, perhaps for some other rescue of a financial nature which might have caused us concern.  I support unequivocally any measure which is intended to curtail or hamper the activities of the IRA or of any unlawful organisation in the State and I support any measure which would attempt, as this Bill does, to ensure that the activities of such unlawful organisations would be restricted, curtailed and hampered.</P>
      <P>But I have to say that I am somewhat concerned by the nature of this legislation. I think it is better to express that concern at this stage.  It is necessarily a tentative expression of concern because I have not had an adequate opportunity to examine in detail the provisions of the Bill.  I regret &mdash; as I am sure other Members of the House do &mdash; the necessity for it to be passed with such speed, although I can see the nature of the Government's concern in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My worry is that this Bill relies upon and substantially extends provisions of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, which have been part of our law &mdash; in the sense that they have been there for a considerable number of years &mdash; but which have not been examined or scrutinised by the courts.  I am concerned that we are building on what may be a rather fragile base.  I hope I am wrong, but I am concerned about this.  The base on which we are building is sections 19 and 22 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939. Section 19 provides for the Government forming the opinion that there is the basis to do it and then making a suppression <Col N="334" /> order in relation to an unlawful organisation. Section 19 provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  If and whenever the Government are of the opinion that any particular organisation is an unlawful organisation, it shall be lawful for the Government by order (in this Act referred to as a suppression order) to declare that such organisation is an unlawful organisation and ought, in the public interest, to be suppressed.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Government may by order, whenever they so think proper, amend or revoke a suppression order.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every suppression order should be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as conveniently may be after the making thereof.</P>
    <P>(4)  A suppression order shall be conclusive evidence for all purposes other than an application for a declaration of legality that the organisation to which it relates is an unlawful organisation within the meaning of this Act.</P>
    <P>As a direct consequence of the making of a suppression order of that kind and without any necessity for a second order or a different order the provisions of section 22 in relation to forfeiture come into effect.  These are very detailed provisions. It is a very long section.  It provides in effect, as stated at the beginning of it, that:</P>
    <P>Immediately upon the making of a suppression order, the following provisions shall have effect in respect of the organisation to which that order relates, that is to say:</P>
    <P>It then details provisions:</P>
    <P>all the property, (whether real, chattel real or personal and whether in possession or in action) of such organisation shall become and be forfeited to and vested in the Minister for Justice;</P>
    <P>It gives the Minister power to take possession, to take any measures necessary and so on in relation to that property.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his speech introducing this Bill, section 8 of this Bill extends the scope of section 22, first of all by clarifying what the scope is intended to <Col N="335" /> be.  Section 8(1) says:</P>
    <P>For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that section 22 of the Principal Act applies and always applied to property of an unlawful organisation acquired by it at any time while a suppression order under section 19 of that Act in respect of it is or was in force as well as to the property of the organisation immediately upon the making of the suppression order.</P>
    <P>(2)  Moneys held by any person for the use or benefit of, or for use for the purposes of, an unlawful organisation in respect of which a suppression order under section 19 of the Principal Act is in force shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act and sections 22 and 23 of the Principal Act, to be the property of the organisation, and this Act and those sections shall apply and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>I would be worried lest both the original sections, in particular sections 22 of the Offences against the State Act and now the provisions of this Bill, relying upon and extending that section, would, in effect, erode one of the fundamental provisions of our Constitution, namely the separation of powers because the effect of the forfeiture section is, in fact, to constitute a penal deprivation of property. There have been a number of cases recently where the courts, in the course of different situations, have made it clear that the penal deprivation of property is a function of the courts.  For example, there is the case of Deaton and the Attorney General in 1963.</P>
    <P>Because we have only got this Bill this afternoon and because these are very complex areas it is only appropriate to raise questions.  But I would seriously ask the Minister whether he did consider, for example, the possibility of basing a provision of this kind on Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution where he could have, through the provision of emergency legislation, avoided what I see as at least being a risk of a possible constitutional challenge to this measure.  It is a measure <Col N="336" /> which does appear to erode the distinction which is fundamental to the constitution of the separation of powers in this area and by doing so may be possibly open to constitutional challenge.  For the reasons I stated earlier I would not welcome the possibility of enacting legislation which was potentially constitutionally infirm.  I regret again that we do not even have the possibility of referring this Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26 because there is a motion to abridge the time and it is intended presumably that the President will sign it either later on tonight or early tomorrow morning so that it can be acted upon.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in his reply at this stage of the debate first of all to indicate to the House whether there have been any steps taken by the Minister for Justice under section 22 of the 1939 Act, whether any forfeiture measures have been actively taken, given that the Minister has had in theory title to the property and could take various steps?  What kind of measures, if any, have been taken? Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister to clarify to the House whether it was considered that the particular legislation might be based on the alternative basis of being genuine emergency legislation under Article 28 and, therefore, benefiting from the immunity from constitutional challenge because of the nature of what was being proposed.</P>
    <P>I will at the Committee Stage have a number of points and questions which I would wish to raise on some of the sections. It is clearly a technical and quite difficult Bill in the way in which it is drafted.  It does seem, for example, in section 2 (2) (a) (ii) that a Minister is in a position of directing the court with regard to what must be done with the funds which are lodged in the court.  I am not clear whether it is necessary to totally fetter the discretion of the court in that matter, whether it is appropriate that the Minister would be able to direct in a mandatory manner and require the court to pay the moneys in the manner required by the Minister on <i>ex parte</i> application. That is a Committee Stage point.  I would <Col N="337" /> wish to hear the Minister's views and be reassured on the general framework of this legislation.  It may sound strange to raise a doubt about sections which have been on the Statute Book for a long time but a good deal has happened.  There has been a good deal of jurisprudence in the courts, principles have been enunciated and clarified by the courts since 1939. There is a danger in basing legislation in 1985, particularly far-reaching technical legislation of this kind, on provisions of our code which may be open at least to questions of the kind I have been raising. Therefore, I would like some response from the Minister on those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would like to thank the Seanad and the individual Senators who contributed.  In that context I would like particularly to thank Senator Lanigan, speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, for facilitating us in this piece of legislation.  Senator Lanigan in his contribution suggested that it would be time now to review and update the 1939 Act. Other Senators also made this point.  It is easy for a Minister to say that this is so, and all things being equal it would be appropriate to look at legislation which has been on the Statute Book for a long time and which may be in need of review. The difficulty is that because of the nature of that kind of legislation if one comes into the House with a review of it there is a reluctance on the part of the Houses of the Oireachtas to renew that kind of legislation.  I take the point the Senator has made, but I am not making any commitment to be back in the near future with a general review of the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Ferris for his contribution. He talked about the rights of a rightful owner and he posed a situation where money is stolen from somebody and it ends up in the hands of an unlawful organisation and that it is not really the property of the unlawful organisation but is the property of the aggrieved party in the first instance.  Even though possession of the property has changed the legal right to possession has not changed.  As I understand it, any person who at the <Col N="338" /> moment has a claim of right can assert it.  He is entitled to assert his claim to property in a court under existing law and to sue for it.  He can bring an action at common law for detinue, claiming that it be surrendered to him.  This Bill will not affect the rights under common law at all but the rightful owner will have an additional right under section 3 where he could move within the six months period or, if it is taken into the Exchequer by <i>ex parte</i> action of the Minister there will be a further six years in which to establish that kind of claim.  His rights would not be sacrificed in any way.  They would be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donoghue asked why not operate section 22 of the existing legislation. For two reasons.  First of all, section 22 could be interpreted as having force to make property forfeit at the time the suppression order came into being from an unlawful organisation.  In section 8 (1) of the Bill we are saying:</P>
    <P>For the removal of doubt, it is hereby declared that section 22 of the Principal Act applies and always applied to property of an unlawful organisation acquired by it at any time while a suppression order under section 19 of that Act in respect of it is or was in force as well as to the property of the organisation immediately upon the making of the suppression order.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that I believe that section 22 does not need this piece of clarification, but it is no harm to do it.  I believe the property of suppressed organisations is forfeit, not only at the initial stage of suppression but subsequently in relation to property coming into their possession.  But there is no mechanism in section 22 which enables the Minister to take that into his possession or into the possession of the State and it would involve the intervention of a court and, quite frankly, I do not have that kind of time.  The Senator also asked for an assurance that in our deliberations here today and in the deliberations in the other House there is not a risk that we are shutting that stable door when the horse has bolted.  I am confident that if all <Col N="339" /> sections of the Bill are passed tonight and the legislation is signed by the President tonight it will prove effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan has also welcomed the Bill and I thank him for his contribution. Senator Brendan Ryan played a particular tune which he plays very well &mdash; long practice has made him an accomplished performer of that tune &mdash; but I do not think it was appropriate music for tonight.  He introduced to us this terrible villain, the Minister's successor, who frequently comes up in debates of this kind. The terrible villain, the Minister's successor, will be constrained by the terms of the Bill, because section 2 of the Bill, the activating section, has a life of three months and it is not in the hands of the Minister to reactivate it.  It will require an order of the Government to reactivate it or to continue it in operation.  So, consequently at that point it is taken out of the hands of the individual Minister.  If this villain, the successor, goes back to the Government and gets them to introduce a further three month period, during which this section of the Bill will be operational, that order will have to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and again, there is the veto of the Houses of the Oireachtas, as is normal in placing a Government order before them.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senator O'Leary. In a very economical speech he illustrated very clearly the strength of the measure on the one hand and on the other hand the concern for constitutional rights and the concern that the courts would play a very strong part in this legislation and consequently that the constitutional rights of individuals would be preserved. He said &mdash; and of course it is quite right &mdash; that this applies to proscribed organisations. There are certain criteria in the 1939 Act which by their nature if an organisation get themselves involved in them that organisation would be unlawful. For example, there is a provision that says that any organisation which organises a campaign to prevent revenue being paid into central funds or local funds, that <Col N="340" /> would be unlawful and that organisation would be unlawful.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Yes, or a residents' or tenants' committee or anything like that, but this legislation does not apply to organisations who come within that criteria.  This legislation only applies to those organisations which have been proscribed by order of the Government. In effect, that means the IRA, which has been proscribed for a long time, and the INLA which was proscribed by this administration in 1983. So, the scope of this is confined to those organisations which are proscribed by order of the Government, which are suppressed by the Government and again, as the House is aware, there is a mechanism for bringing that order before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way.  It would be incorrect to raise hares about other organisations which from time to time by nature of their activity could be deemed to come within the ambit of the 1939 Act and consequently be construed as unlawful organisations. It will not apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Shane Ross for his contribution and indeed for his support. Senator Robinson expressed concern that we were building on a fragile base.  It is the only base we have to deal with this situation.  I listened with interest to what she had to say.  In the final analysis, the only response I can make is that any legislation is open to constitutional challenge and it would be up to the courts to decide.  She asked also if the provisions of section 22 are being used to confiscate property or money.  Obviously, when it came into effect it had that effect, but I know of one case in 1978 in County Sligo where moneys which were taken from individuals in a car were taken by the police.  The individuals from whom the money was taken took proceedings in the District Court and failed to get back approximately £5,400.  Then section 22 was invoked by the Minister of the day to require the gardaí to pay the money to the Minister.  That is the only precedent, <Col N="341" /> in so far as it goes, which I know of in recent times, but again it is important to go back to what Senator O'Leary said, that the nature of the fund raising activities of subversive organisations has changed. We all remember the massive spate of armed bank robberies which occurred in the recent past.  In the more recent past that type of activity has diminished somewhat and there is no doubt that there has been an increase in kidnapping, threats of kidnapping and in extortion. As I have said in my Second Stage speech, this incident which caused the Government to act in this way relates to money which was got, we believe, under threat of murder and kidnapping.</P>
    <P>I thank the House again for their cooperation on Second Stage, and of course I will be willing to answer any questions on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, I am concerned about subsection (2) where it enables the Minister to make application to the High Court by way of <i>ex parte</i> application.  Subsection (2) (a) says:</P>
      <P>If proceedings are not brought under section 3 of this Act or otherwise,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act is quite clear.  It deals <Col N="342" /> with the normal application that could be made by a person who claims to be the owner and I have no difficulty or problem with that.  I would like to ask the Minister what &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; means.  I expect &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; means in that regard that no law can prevent somebody going to the High Court and asking for his money back, not looking for it back under section 3, but saying.  &ldquo;I want it back: it is my money&rdquo;, in other words the equivalent of a common law application.  Is that what &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; means&rdquo;?  If it is what it means is the Minister happy that after three months and when the power to make the order referred to in subsection (1) no longer exists, if there had been an application to the court, not under section 3 but just an application to the court asking for the money back by way of plenary summons, the person cannot in fact get the money back?  When the three months have expired but before six months have elapsed there is a three-month limbo period involved, and is the Minister happy that the money in the High Court cannot be got out by way of an application &mdash; which seems to be envisaged &mdash; under subsection (2) by the use of the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): First, what the Senator has indicated would be one explanation of &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  It will also be open to him to bring other proceedings, for example an action for a breach of contact, against the bank or a declaration that the Act is unconstitutional.  There would be a variety of possibilities here.</P>
      <P>On the question of the limbo period, the short life, the three months life, does not apply to the Bill as a whole; it applies to section 2.  The remainder of the Bill will stand.  Section 2, where the Minister will produce a document for the bank and the bank has to comply, is the part that cannot be operated after the three months; the other procedures in the Act will apply and there will not be a limbo period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of a bank which receives one of these documents. <Col N="343" /> It receives the document telling it to pay over the one million pounds that it has into the High Court because the Minister believes that it is money of this type.  It is paid over to the High Court; the High Court receives it, presumably using as the authorisation for its lodging the document signed by the Minister.  In otherwords one just does not go up to the High Court and say, &ldquo;here is one million pounds&rdquo;.  They will say, &ldquo;why are you giving us the one million pounds?&rdquo;  They will be told, &ldquo;we are giving you the one million pounds because here is the authorisation signed by the Minister&rdquo;. Three months pass and the authorisation signed by the Minister may no longer have effect.  Some person then initiates proceedings to say, &ldquo;please give me my money back&rdquo;.  The High Court has one million pounds on deposit on foot of an order made under a section of the Bill which is no longer in operation.  If the Minister is happy about it, I am happy about it.  I am, however, a little concerned about it.  Should the Minister specifically include in the Bill a statement to the effect that the lodgments made in respect of any order made under paragraph (a) would continue to have an effect throughout the period of the lodgment with the High Court?  Has the Minister considered that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The three months clause applies to section 2 (a) of the Bill.  That is the procedure whereby a Minister may require a bank to pay money into court.  Once the money is in the court the procedure for a litigant to get the money out remains extant and will not be affected by the three-month clause.  All the three-month clause would bring about would be that the Minister would not be empowered to make new orders about other moneys that might come to his notice unless the Government reactivated section 2 (a).</P>

      <P>I am worried about the situation where, after the expiry of the three-month period the High Court now has money in its custody.  I want to give it a statutory basis for having that money. <Col N="344" /> I would suggest to the Minister that it would be very convenient if there was a statutory basis.  If the High Court, four months after it gets the money, says, &ldquo;why do we have this money?&rdquo;  then it can look at a particular section of the Bill and say, &ldquo;even though paragraph (a) is no longer in operation, there is a specific duty on us to keep that money until such time as it is adjudicated under section 3 or the Minister makes application under section 2(2)&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to Senator O'Leary as to his repetition of this point.  It seems that he is raising a difficulty that is not in the Bill. It seems to me that paragraph 2(a) on page 2 is only concerned with what the bank does.  It tells the bank to comply by handing over money held at the time the document is produced; it is not concerned with money that comes to the bank after the date of the order and it is concerned only with the handing over of the money by the bank to the High Court.  There is nothing, it seems to me, in subsection 2(a) that determines what is to happen to the money other than that it is to be handed over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Section 3 applies to the procedures whereby a litigant may claim money which is paid in.  All of section 3 is preserved, and once the money is paid in under order of section 2 then the rest follows.  Once an order has been made during the three-month period to pay the money into the court then it is money which is in the court as a result of an order under section 2; the procedures for claiming ownership apply under section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a somewhat different point to raise, and that is to clarify the duration both of section 2 and of the Bill itself.  As the Minister stated the rest of the Bill is permanent legislation.  Section 2 has this provision for the lapsing of the power that exists for three months; the Government may from time to time continue it in operation.  There is no ultimate time limit on that.  Although the <Col N="345" /> Minister has emphasised that it is a provision that gives very real safeguards that after the three months the Minister cannot renew it since it requires a decision of the Government, is there not equally a danger that within every three-month period it will automatically be on the agenda of the Government and that we are in fact enacting a permanent power of this kind?  There is no provision to say that this will operate for a period of a year or two years or three years after which the power will lapse and you have got to look for new power.  There is not even the requirement to provide that the looking for power to extend for a further period of three months would require the active approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is only the subsequent power under subsection (4) that an order should be laid before each House and can be subject to a resolution annulling it.  In practice does not this mean that although it seems to have lots of safeguards it will in effect be renewed every three months because it will appear to a Government to be useful to have it in reserve in case this power is needed.  Is it not a less effective genuine curtailment of power than it might appear on the face of it?</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I do not think so.  Paragraph (c) (1) says it will remain in operation for three months beginning on its commencement and will then cease to be in operation.  The reason for the whole Bill being subject to a time clause is that by writing in a provision that during an initial six-month period somebody can litigate while money is in court or under the charge of the court but we say that for a further six years people can take an action to recover the money. Consequently, the protection that is being given here to bona fide account holders runs over a very long period.  One could envisage a situation where somebody would start in the middle of the sixth year an action which could run for quite a while after that.  What is being subject to the three-month time clause is the part of the Bill which gives the Minister the extra power.  As the Senator says it is subject to Government order and it <Col N="346" /> would be for the Government to decide at the appropriate time whether it would lay an order before the Houses to renew this section of the Bill or not.  There have been occasions in the past where Governments did not renew specific powers granted to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and they were allowed to lapse.  Rather long detention periods were brought in on one occasion and were allowed to lapse fairly quickly.</P>

      <P>I wonder could I come back to the point I raised on Second Stage on subsection (2)?  Again it is more in the form of a question &mdash; the provision to which Senator O'Leary was referring where the Minister may, after a period of six months apply <i>ex parte</i> to the High Court for an order directing that the moneys be paid to the Minister or into such account at the bank as the Minister may specify.  That may, in fact, be common sense and the appropriate thing to do, but it does seem to be a very considerable exercise of power by the Minister and it leaves no discretion to the court in relation to the particular moneys. I am not suggesting that these moneys would necessarily be a useful injection to the funds of suitors or some other fund, but it is analogous to the situation in the Sinn Féin funds case.  It is not exactly parallel to it and I do not have the same concern about it, but at the same time the Minister is, in an <i>ex parte</i> application, directing the court to pay the moneys in a particular way or into an account at a particular bank that the Minister may specify.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that under section 22 the property is in effect vested in the Minister. I presume that is the effective linkage, but perhaps the Minister would explain why that is framed in that particular way and if he is satisfied that it is an appropriate way of getting the funds out of court if no application has been brought by anybody asserting ownership of them.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I think the point to be made is whether the court must grant an application of the Minister <Col N="347" /> and if not is this an interference by the Executive with the Judiciary and therefore unconstitutional?  My advice is that no, the court must be satisfied that no applications have been brought under section 3, and if they have, that they have been dismissed.  It is not, therefore, ousting the discretion of the court.  Subject to that, however, the court must, if the Minister asks, grant the application. There are precedents for this.  There is the appointment of an administrator under the recent legislation dealing with the PMPA, for example.  My advice is that that problem would not arise.</P>

In effect, section 22 has had effect.  The Minister has shown that this is temporarily in the custody of the illegal organisation and to that extent section 22 is in operation.  But it can also be shown that this money was originally the property of somebody from whom it was stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make much the same point.  This section raises a question of two kinds of people, (1) the legitimate owner who at some earlier stage was deprived of the money whether through kidnap, threat or some other measure, and (2) a possible person claiming &mdash; and presumably that person would be somebody who would be perhaps a member of an unlawful organisation as described by the Minister.  I have two different questions relating to section 3. First of all, is the Minister satisfied that it is not necessary to increase specifically the amendment made in section 8 of this Bill, in section 3 and section 22 as amended or extended by section 8 of this Bill?  It may be that it is not necessary to refer to it.  It is that section that has not had effect in relation to the moneys.</P>
      <P>The other thing that concerns me is in sections 19 and 22 of the Offences Against the State Act.  What is referred to is an unlawful organisation and the property of that unlawful organisation.  It is not clear to what extent, apart from the extension now in section 8 of this Bill, property of an individual is to be assumed to be property of that organisation or where the distinction is to be drawn.  For example, if the member of the organisation had a pub or some other revenue-raising entity and had got money in funds but was known to be an active member of the unlawful organisation, would that be covered by the extended definition? We must read this together with section 8, subsection (2):</P>
      <P>Moneys held by any person for the use or benefit of, or for use for the purposes of, an unlawful organisation in respect of which a suppression order under section 19 of the Principal Act is in force...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> That seems to me to be a considerable extension of the original section 22 where it was clearly the property of the organisation and then a doubt arose as to whether it was the property at the time the suppression order was made or any subsequent property that might come into the hands of the organisation itself. It would be necessary in order to understand the scope of section 3 and to understand the circumstances where the courts might be satisifed that section 22 of the principal Act has not had effect, to be clearer on what the rights of the three sets of people would be, of the legitimate owner, of the person who might be claiming although he might be claiming as somebody who was associated with an unlawful organisation but saying: &ldquo;That was my money, not the organisation's money&rdquo;, and where the overlap might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Section 22 has brought about a situation where the property of a suppressed organisation is forfeited.  There is an extension to it here but the extension is confined to moneys, not to property.  &ldquo;Moneys&rdquo; in the Act is money in the bank or shares in a building society, because that would be the way one would have money on deposit; one would be a shareholder in a building society.  That is the extent to which the scope is being extended in so far as the type of asset is being extended. Then the question as to whether it relates to the organisation or whether it can relate to members of the organisation arises.  What we are doing here under section 8 (2) is saying that moneys held by any person for the use or benefit of, or for the use or purposes of, an unlawful organisation etc.  That extends it to the individual who has the clean image, the front for the suppressed organisation where it can be shown that it is for the benefit of, or use of...There is an extension in that respect also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the rights of the legitimate owner in the kind of situation drawn to our attention initially by Senator Ferris the bank robbery or the robbery from a home where there is money which is passed to <Col N="350" /> a suppressed organisation, but who are not the rightful owners of it &mdash; I would argue that section 3 gives rights to the legitimate owner as well, because the fact that the money has come into the possession of an unlawful organisation or its members for a period does not imply a legal transfer of ownership.  Even if a court were to interpret the situation along the lines suggested by Senator Ryan, the rightful owner has other powers under common law through which to proceed to obtain the money.  Naturally, in the real situation this measure is being brought forward by the Minister and Government to prevent money being used for the benefit of the IRA.  Consequently, there will be no reluctance on the part of the Minister to see money returned to rightful owners.  There are powers, other than powers contained in the Bill, which protect the rights of rightful owners when money is taken by criminals or by any organisation.</P>

The Minister indicated his intention to ensure that money of this kind would be returned to its rightful owners, but due consideration would have to be given to the possibility that the same organisation would succumb to the same blackmail in the future.  If it is not made uncomfortable for the people who fork out the money they will be under no constraint in the future if they are guaranteed that they will get their money back.  This is a matter which has been brought to the attention of the House.  The Minister should give consideration to this during the course of the period ahead as to what our attitude to this should be.</P>

The particular instance which gives rise to this legislation is where the money <Col N="351" /> is a result of extortion under threat of murder, assassination or kidnap.  I agree with what Senator O'Leary says, but I am arguing on the generality rather than on the particular situation.  There are situations where somebody at a loss as a result of a criminal act by an illegal organisation was in no way party to that loss.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 33, to delete &ldquo;£100,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with penalties for people who fail or refuse to comply with the requirements of the Act.  The first amendment deals with the penalties which are described in subsection (1), that is, the financial institution, the bank itself, being responsible and unwilling to act in accordance with the direction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent this may not be <Col N="352" /> as important as the other amendment, While it is true to say that the bank would be at risk to the extent of £100,000, it depends on the State for its continued existence.  An unfriendly act such as this would not be easily forgiven by the State, and to this extent the relationship between the bank and the State would mean that a relatively small fine would be sufficient.  When we are talking about money which we can only speculate as being some millions of pounds, a penalty of £100,000 on a bank might be quite small, and the bank may consider itself intimidated into a situation when it would be willing to pay £100,000 rather than suffer the adverse consequences of the wrath of an organisation who would seek to raise this kind of money by extortion and threats in the first place.  Therefore, it is necessary to put &ldquo;beef&rdquo; into the Bill in regard to the fines and terms of imprisonment under the succeeding section.  For this reason I move in respect of section 7(1) that the £100,000 be deleted and £1 million be substituted.</P>
    <P>The second amendment deals with the conviction of an individual in the bank who refuses or neglects to do something which he should do to comply with the legislation, Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>(2)  Where an offence committed by a bank under subsection (1) of this section is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to any neglect on the part of, any person who, when the offence was committed, was a director, member of the committee of management or other controlling authority of the bank concerned, or the chief officer or other person, by whatever name called, having charge of the management of the bank, or the secretary or other officer of the bank (including the manager of, or other official of the bank at, a branch of the bank), that person shall also be deemed to have committed the offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for <Col N="353" /> a term not exceeding 12 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is important that on indictment the possibility should be open for a conviction for a number of years far in excess of two.  This would be a method of protection for people who are working in banks. Supposing there was only a nominal fine provided for in the Bill.  Members of the staff of the bank in question might find themselves under pressure; they might find themselves, by electronic means, agreeing to the transfer of money at short notice if the organisation concerned suspected that the Minister had made an order in respect of their funds.  Two years is not sufficient as it does not give the bank official a strong enough argument, it does not enable him to say that he will get into the height of trouble if he carries out certain requests in the case of an organisation with seven or eight million pounds on deposit with the bank.  At present the worst that can happen to the official is two years in jail.</P>
    <P>When there is £7 million, £8 million or £9 million or £10 million involved, to threaten somebody with two years imprisonment is not proportionate.  The protection of the employees of the bank must bring about a situation that the penalty for not complying must be very severe so that it will discourage people from putting pressure on them, as has been the case in banks already.  Under both these headings, the fines which are contemplated and the terms of imprisonment are not sufficient.</P>

The figures were growing and growing as reports were coming in on radio.  A seven figure sum was the first one.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with section 7 (1).  The figure of £100,000 seems a trivial sum in comparison to those to which I have listened on the radio.  Senator O'Leary has said the sums of money that might be involved can be vast, and the sum of £100,000 to a financial institution is absolutely dismissive.  If it became known to the institution that the Minister was presenting this documentation, and if leverage or threats were being used on the institution not to comply, this sum would be paltry in comparision to the amount of money that they might be handing over.  I would support the argument by Senator O'Leary in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my usual position to be wearing a law and order hat, but I agree with Senator O'Leary.  It would be very easy for a bank to cough up a fine of £100,000 if it would make life very simple for them.  It is entirely out of proportion to the capacity to pay.  It could be the easiest exit for them to comply with threats.  It is ironic that this Bill results from the capacity of illegal or prescribed organisations to extort money by threats of one form or another.  In that context a sum of £100,000 might seem to a major financial institution to be a very small price to pay for the ease of mind that they would have with the absence of threats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> I am always sceptical about prison sentences as having the capacity to deter, but in the context of some decisions we have taken in this House during my period here in the last two years, a two year prison sentence as a maximum seems trivial, for instance, when we are prepared to lock up a kid for five years for stealing a car or a kid who is a knowing passenger.  But senior executives of a bank who conspire or connive to transfer enormous sums of money into the hands of organisations who would use them to do enormous damage to ordinary people will get a sentence of two years.  I do not think it will matter.  If a bank official has his family threatened, if we had life in prison it would not deter him.  But the institutions, organisations and those who have executive responsibility who might be tempted to take an easier route need to have penalties that reflect their capacity to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): When we are establishing figures for an offence of any sort it is a matter of judgment.  We examined the situation and came up with these figures after a certain amount of discussion.  The figures are adequate.  We are talking about a figure of £100,000 penalty on an institution which has been found guilty of an offence.  We are talking about a lesser sum of money on the individual, but we are also talking about a term of imprisonment for individuals, whether somebody at senior level in the management of a financial institution or a bank manager or somebody in the absence of a bank manager who is managing the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real penalty and the real deterrent for a bank is the fact that a bank would leave itself open to conviction.  One should look at the nature of the situation that would pertain when a reputable financial institution would be hauled before the courts and convicted of an offence under this Act.  That is the big deterrent.  The subsidiary deterrent is the actual amount of money.  The sum of £100,000 in the light of a sum of money <Col N="356" /> of seven figures might seem to bear an inadequate relationship, but there may be situations when we would be using this legislation for £10,000, £20,000 £50,000 &mdash; we are not always in the millionaire class when we are legislating or seeking to establish penalties.  The penalties are adequate because the real penalty is the threat that a reputable financial institution will be convicted.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the individual rather than the institution, a term of imprisonment is also introduced.  Obviously one cannot put the bank, as an institution, into jail.  A term of two years imprisonment is a reasonable deterrent for people in senior positions in any financial institution. A conviction and then a two year term of imprisonment are fairly heavy for the kind of people to whom the deterrent would apply.  Non-compliance with the section could come about through neglect, and we must remember the nature of the offence <i>per se</i> when we are trying to establish the particular level of deterrent.  After consideration what we have in the Bill is adequate and I would ask the House to accept it.</P>

In arriving at the decision to set the potential fines on the financial institution in this regard, has the Minister taken into account the pattern of attacks on financial institutions in Northern Ireland over the last 14 or 15 years?  It would appear to me that there has been a steady decrease in the number of attacks on financial institutions in that jurisdiction.  Did the Minister give any consideration to the circumstances in which this decrease might come about when arriving at the figure of £100,000?  There is an area there that the Minister should consider as being worthy of investigation.  It might be an area which would indicate the extent to which these financial institutions are willing to obey the law in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Yes, I am.  We have a very good banking system.  We have very reputable financial institutions.  As I said, it is a question of judgment.  I do not think we can have a sliding scale.  We have to specify a maximum fine under law and allow the courts discretion to apply it at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Senators seem to be approaching the argument from two conflicting sides. There are two perceptions being brought to bear on the question.  First, Senators are arguing about the adequacy of a particular time as a deterrent.  This can be argued up and down the scale.  Second, they seem to be suggesting that there is some element of protection for bank staff in the level at which a fine is pitched.  I would be doubtful about the second line of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bank staffs over the years have been subject to threat and in recent times they have continued to be subject to threat.  I do not think that the IRA will be deterred from threatening anyone of us because of a penalty that might face any of us in law for not complying with their desires. <Col N="358" /> We have thought about it.  We have to strike a balance somewhere.  A fine of £100,000 on an institution plus a two year prison sentence on an individual in a senior position in a bank provide the kind of deterrent necessary, always taking into account that the major deterrent for any reputable institution of any sort, especially a bank, is that it would be susceptible to conviction for an offence such as this in the first instance regardless of what the penalty was.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): They are ordinary terms which would indicate that the unlawful organisation had access to these funds through some kind of front man or a reputable launderer and that in the final analysis they would be used to <Col N="359" /> forward the activities of the unlawful organisation.</P>

      <P>Therefore, I have profound reservations.  Take the case of the H-Block candidates who participated in the 1981 election.  I was not in politics until after that election, but to put it clearly I was not involved in the H-Block campaign but I suffered a considerable amount of personal and indeed physical abuse because of my opposition to them in another capacity.  Nevertheless, they participated in an election and there was a widely held view expressed in Irish political circles that they were operating to the benefit of and indeed in parallel and in tandem with the Provisional IRA. Would it, therefore, be reasonable for me to say that moneys held by individuals in the H-Block campaign will come under the provisions of this Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Ultimately, the courts would have to determine this.  The property of an unlawful organisation and moneys held by any person for the use or benefit or for the purposes of the unlawful organisation in respect of which a suppression order in section 19 was made would come within the ambit of the powers of this Bill.  We are talking about moneys which the IRA would have or moneys held and to which the IRA would have access for their purposes, and we know what they are.  In the same way as we go after their members if we believe that certain members have been involved in crime, whether it is kidnapping, a murder or bank robbery or whatever, we would go after property by virtue of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, under which their property is forfeited anyway if it is the property of a suppressed organisation.  It is likely, too, that we <Col N="360" /> would go after money which the IRA would have if we could find where they have it.</P>

      <P>Exactly how will subsection (2) work out?  I understand perfectly what the Minister said: he means money which is held by a sort of clean front for IRA purposes, and I am in absolute agreement with him that this money should be affected by the Bill. Would it mean that the Minister would decide when he was going to make one of these orders, this was the kind of money in question and then that some person or persons could later make an application to the court saying that is not what the money is and that the courts would then decide?  Is that the kind of mechanism that would be involved?</P>

      <P>As I made clear at Second Stage, it would be this section which would be of particular concern to me in a broader sense.  I asked, and I do not think the Minister has yet answered, whether there was thought given to the possibility of basing a measure of this sort on Article 28 as opposed to an amendment of the Offences Against the State Act, which has effectively been done. The effect of subsection (2) is unclear. We have to admit that it is unclear what property would be included, but whatever property is included and deemed to be the property of the unlawful organisation is automatically forfeited not by any order by anybody at any time, but by virtue of a special order which may have been made many years before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is far-reaching.  We are dealing in section 2 of this Bill with a particular mechanism of applying to court in relation to it.  The scope of it rests on the provisions of sections 19 and 22 of the original Act.  If it is deemed to be the property of the organisation, although held by an individual or individuals, then it is automatically forfeit.  I do have concerns about the existing provisions of section 22 of the Offences Against the State Act as extended in section 8 of this Bill.  I have to express worries about the scope of it.  It seems to <Col N="361" /> be penal deprivation of property, which is a function of the administration of criminal justice by the courts.  There seems to be an erosion of the separation of powers which is fundamental to the constitutional principles as has been enunciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): The answer to Senator McGuinness is yes. There is a compensation provision in the Bill which has to be borne in mind apart from the fact that the Minister could be brought to court.  Somebody could argue that it was not the property of an unlawful organisation and consequently win the case.  There is a compensation provision as well, which is a further brake on the action of an impetuous Minister or indeed on an impetuous Government.</P>
      <P>On Senator Robinson's point, I would have to say yes.  Naturally, when we were considering in this particular instance we adverted to the powers available under Article 28 of the Constitution.  It was felt that the manner in which we have approached this was sufficient.</P>

      <P>I am not going to get myself branded as a defender of the Provisional IRA &mdash; far be it from me.  I long ago said that the abuse of powers that may be necessary to deal with the subversive organisations can often be the best recruiting agent the subversive organisations have.  We argued about this question of alienation and all those things here on another issue a long time ago so I will not go into it again.  It appears to me that, given the attitude of this and preceding Governments to Sinn Féin, to say in effect that they are synonymous with the IRA but membership in terms of objectives, methods and what they support, that as section 8 (2) is now presented to us the entire funds of Sinn Féin would come under the aegis of this Bill, and those of the IRSP.  I cannot see why, if a Minister should choose to be awkward at some stage in the middle of a general election, he could not legitimately argue that he was acting within the powers of this Bill.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Anything a Minister would do in the middle of a general election campaign would be susceptible to whatever political consequences there would be for that action very quickly, so there would be an immediate accountability in that very limited sense.  Sinn Féin are not a suppressed organisation, they are not a proscribed organisation, so moneys held by Sinn Féin would come within the ambit of the Act and there would have to be information that they were IRA moneys, and the Minister would have to be prepared to argue that subsequently if moved against. I do not believe any of us contributing to this Bill expect that the Provisional IRA will walk into a bank and open accounts, a cheque account and a deposit account, No. 1 IRA account and No. 2 IRA account.</P>
      <P>Quite obviously in the normal sense of activity they will either use front organisations or front men or women.  There is not much point in doing what we are trying to do unless we can talk about persons &ldquo;with the use and benefit&rdquo; etc. It is an essential component of it if we are to be effective.  It is a strong remedy. I suggest that the amount of money involved, if it could be used for the military activities of the IRA would cause us a lot of problems.</P>
