      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2 with the proviso that No. 2 will only be taken if No. 1 is disposed of before 4 p.m. this afternoon.  For the information of Senators I would like to indicate that we will be taking next Wednesday the Report Stage of the Nurses Bill and also that I intend to give Government time to Motion No. 32, which is a motion to annual regulations made by the Minister for Health.  Since this is time limited I intend to give Government time without in any way conceding there is a principle that such motions should be taken in Government time.  It is an act of generosity.  I should say that on Thursday of next week it is proposed to debate the motions on Developments in the EEC including the report of the Joint Committee on the Spinelli Draft Treaty.  I am endeavouring to arrange on the following Thursday to take the Joint Committee report on Irish Shipping and on the Thursday after that the report on the Multifibre Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of motions which refer to matters relating to the EC.  Could they all be amalgamated into the one motion on Developments in the EEC, 1985, rather than continuing on and leaving some of them <Col N="630" /> behind, which we might not reach for months.  The developments in the EC is open ended enough to amalgamate all those reports and we could have a comprehensive debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter which has been exercising Senator Lanigan is one to which I gave a great deal of thought yesterday.  I studied the Order Paper for a long time with this very point in view. There is a real difficulty here that if we try to bring everything into a general debate it will be a very diffused debate. Looking at some of the reports that are here from the EC, some of them are of tremendous importance.</P>
      <P>Let me just take examples.  No. 18 on our Order Paper, concerning the matter of the Vredeling Directive on Workers' Consultation and Information Rights, to my mind is an extremely important issue not just for Europe but it is a terribly important issue for us at any time and a vital issue under our present conditions of recession.  I certainly would not like to see a discussion in regard to workers' rights of information get lost in a general debate and only surface from time to time.  Equally, there is Motion No. 15 dealing with the Processing and Marketing of Agricultural Products &mdash; again a subject that I think could carry the weight of a full debate.  If we had separate debates on these issues we would have a more meaningful debate, a more concerntrated debate, which I think would be helpful not only from the point of view of Senators wishing to influence a Minister but also helpful to the Minister.</P>
      <P>For example, if we block them all together then we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs here, who can of course transmit what was said.  If we were talking about the marketing of agricultural products we would like to have the Minister for Agriculture here.  If we were talking about the Vredeling Directive we would like to have the Minister for Labour here to hear directly what Senators have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still open on this point but, having considered it for quite some time yesterday, I feel that it would be better if we <Col N="631" /> had a general debate.  There are the important political developments.  We can, of course, advert to other matters; but I think, if we set the stage with a general debate and then try to do a little minor bit of grouping in regard to the remainder, that we might deal, for example, with information, the Vredeling Directive and the Report in regard to the Fifth Company Law Directive.  Those might be brought together in the one debate as being cognate.  I am glad that Senator Lanigan raised the point.  I certainly will be thinking about it further and having discussions about it.  For the moment my mind would tend towards a general political and economic debate next week to set the general scene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally concur with what the Leader of the House has stated but I just feel it would be helpful if we could bring forward the items which are likely to come up for decision within the EC in the next few months.  The Senator mentioned that the Vredeling Directive is an important directive and that the Fifth Company Law Amendment is important, but they are highly unlikely to come before the EC or it is highly unlikely that in ten years' time the Vredeling Directive will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not be so pessimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is highly unlikely that the Fifth Company Law Amendment Directive will be implemented because of the problems associated with these directives from generally speaking, the bigger countries' point of view.  I feel we must bring forward the items which are of great importance rather than items which are important but will not be of any significance in debate here in the next five months, ten months or ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Bill on some Order Paper dealing with legislation for the accession of Portugal and Spain. Would it be possible to widen the scope <Col N="632" /> of that debate to take in one or two of the motions from the Joint Committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that the legislation in regard to the accession of Spain and Portugal were dealt with on its own.  It would be difficult to take it with a motion.  It certainly can be considered. The legislation will be with us shortly.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Lanigan has said that we should bring forward those motions which are urgent.  That is why, as I mentioned, we hope to take the report on the Multifibres Agreement out of its order of presentation.  Certainly I intend to look at the order in which we will take these and try to take them in an order which represents urgency, if there is such a word as &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; in EC affairs.  I will endeavour to arrange to have all these Joint Committee reports discussed but I would ask that Senators who wish to see this done to encourage their colleagues not to continually ask me not to sit on a Thursday.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Dooge on Thursday, 27 June 1985:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, urges the widest possible debate on its recommendations and calls on the Government to consider the holding of a Referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to hold a referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution within the lifetime of the present Government&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When we last debated this matter I had paid tribute to the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown for the manner in which they had set about their task in debating what is without doubt a matter long neglected in popular debate in Ireland.  I had noted as well that some of the lengthier and very valuable speeches so far made on this debate had in fact been made by the women Members of the Seanad.  While I consider this is a good thing on reflection I can see that it tells us something else as well, that is that in changing the law in relation to the strategies that are available consequent on marital breakdown it is something that affects every member of the State and all legislators.  In that connection I severely criticised last week those who remained silent on this issue because it is an issue that affects the suffering and the circumstances of very many families, adults and children.</P>
      <P>I was responding &mdash; and this is the point at which I would like to resume &mdash; to some of the thoughtful comments made by Senator Seán O'Leary in which he criticised the report for the detail and the figures which are included in it.  I do not agree with him that you should criticise the methodological structure of this report or the manner in which facts or issues are presented in terms of the presence or absence of detail.  At the end of the day the function of a legislature is to make laws, to reflect on inadequacies, to make the case for amendment or innovation, to respond to new social, economic and legal circumstances.  If that is so, of course it is incumbent upon those who prefer base documents which argue for changes in the law to be as detailed and as strong in their arguments as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very much a lesser project for the Committee on Marriage Breakdown <Col N="634" /> than the political task of breaking silence on the issue of divorce in Ireland, because we are in a very unusual position indeed. We have tens of thousands of broken marriages.  I am not interested in the detail of the figure.  Its magnitude alone tells its own story: perhaps 100,000 people affected in one way or another by the absence of one of the remedies available to marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is only correct to pay tribute to the members of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown in the task of breaking silence.  Marital breakdown is a very interesting topic when one examines it and the ability of the law to respond to it.  There are many things in Irish society about which people do not speak but which are real in terms of their impact on the lives of people.  Among these are mental illness, child abuse and indeed marital breakdown itself.  Most people who have come to meetings to discuss what has happened their marriages, reflecting on the law, reflecting on the position of their children and themselves and new unions which they may have formed, have usually done so after a long period of quiet suffering, a great deal of personal pain and an enormously long period of silence.</P>
    <P>In some ways the Committee on Marriage Breakdown &mdash; I pay tribute to them again for this &mdash; have been more courageous and more forward looking than the main body of legislators in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is in Irish politics very frequently an unfortunate inhibition to speak on matters about which there is not a great popular discussion. If one was to follow the logic of that one would be left with the uncomfortable situation that those who suffer quietly and alone or those who don't have a great public debate about their circumstances would have to wait a very long time for an evolved public concern.</P>
    <P>In that case you are left with the question as to what status you can give the argument.  Let us wait until there is a popular demand for divorce before we have a constitutional referendum to remove the inhibition and certainly long <Col N="635" /> before we move to the practical debate as to the form, circumstances and process of divorce that would be suitable to Irish circumstances.  I have no doubt at all that the Legislature should aim and build itself towards meeting need and not to be dragging its feet in, if I may say so, a somewhat cowardly fashion behind the bogus notion of consensus.  The history of law making in areas like this is not one of waiting until there is an enormous public majority for changing the law.  This is not to say that one is imposing a minority opinion on the public who, after all, elect the Legislature.  It is merely indirectly stating that it is the function of legislators to lead in responding to new need, changed circumstances and the kind of pain and suffering that I have been describing.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the argument. It would be a pity to go to the country and to have this proposal to change the Constitution defeated.  This is the argument I have heard so far from some sections on this debate.  I respect the motivation of those who suggest it, but I profoundly disagree with it.  I say to them that if they wanted, for example, to look at the debate on slavery, historically, in any one of the other legislatures they would find that the people who made the case for the abolition of slavery made so not only far short of inter-party agreements and large popular consensus but in the teeth of enormous hostility from those who wanted to keep it alive.</P>
    <P>You could take other issues one after the other in the study of reform in legislatures in different jurisdictions.  It is always the same.  If you argue like I have been you are really saying that it is the function of the Legislature to anticipate, to build the case, to inform the public, to inform the debate about legally reforming options and so on.  Yes, the committee have done that, so I do not take refuge in criticising their statistics, asking for more reports or waiting for a day in which you will have something like 70 per cent of the people saying they want to change the Constitution.  The relationship of <Col N="636" /> people, politics and Legislature is against this notion.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having said that it was the function of the committee to help break the silence on this issue and to open up a debate, there is an enormous obligation on us to debate this matter publicly. Another question arises in relation to the two options I have discussed.  Supposing you said, &ldquo;We will wait until there is all party agreement, until there is a very large majority in the country in favour of divorce&rdquo; what kind of debate will you have?  It will be a long, strung out, bitter ill-informed, prejudiced affair.  If, on the other hand, you say that you intend to hold a constitutional referendum and be definite about when you are going to hold it &mdash; that it will be held, let us say, in the lifetime of this Government &mdash; you focus people's minds on what the options are. People will have to move past their rhetorical citation of bogus arguments for and against that have gone on for nearly a hundred years &mdash; for example, the argument it is the children that suffer, that it is the innocent spouse that will suffer and so.</P>
    <P>These are legitimate arguments &mdash; I will turn to them in a moment &mdash; but they are something that can be exhausted in a century.  We really do not need to have the entire argument rehearsed for several decades, not only dragged out and dishonest in its structure, in the competing rhetorics and so forth, but also reflecting something else which is even more dangerous: putting into the argument the nature of the connection between Church and State.  It is one thing to have woolly, vague, inaccurate and daft arguments but it is another thing altogether to be told that you are bound through a curious contortion of theology to have to accept these as the price of membership of a particular denomination.  Indeed, I felt that in other debates of a similar nature one of the casualties was the very considerable development within theology itself and within the discussion of the relationship between Church and State of the concept of conscience.</P>
    <P>The inability of those very high ranking churchmen who have entered the debate <Col N="637" /> in recent times, very specifically the Archbishop of Dublin, has been to cast another unwelcome shadow across the discussion.  It has been to trample even more on what I said was a significant development in modern theology, a significant development in the relationship between Church and State and a very powerful contribution to the Forum when it was held, that is, the acceptance of the notion of informed conscience with all its implications, that even if one felt that one was right one did not have the right to trample on the beliefs of others who in turn had come to the opinion that their beliefs were what they wanted to hold, that what they believed was for them a conscientious position.</P>
    <P>The longer and the vaguer that this debate will be we will have it, as I said, informed by inaccuracy and by unhelpful heat; but we will also have it informed by ever more temptations to those whose authority is not based strictly on democracy to interfere in a bullying way in the relationship between Church and State. It is in the interests of everybody to have this debate focussed, to have a period of time and then to go to the people and let the case for reforming the Constitution stand, let it be argued against and let the people make up their mind.  If I was not to take that viewpoint, if I was to put myself in the position of the people who argue the other way &mdash; wait for a majority in favour, wait for all agreement within the political parties you are likely to compound the evasive character of Irish political representation even more.  If the individual politicians, many of whom do not want to discuss this issue &mdash; obviously I am not talking here to the exceptions &mdash; if they do not want to discuss it how less likely is it to find itself being chosen by a political party as the main element of their approach to the public?  You are simply putting barriers upon barriers between the resolution of this matter and the people's choice.</P>
    <P>All academic, you might say.  Is it not a matter of when we will change the law? It is not academic because standing in the background, waiting for resolution of this matter, are the tens of thousands of <Col N="638" /> people affected.  They have the prospect of saying &ldquo;Sometime in the lifetime of this Government may be we can hope for this issue to be addressed at last&rdquo;.  Then it appears that their hopes fade and they cast an eye on another Government or on several Governments in the future and say they are left with the empty promise that at some time in the future, when Irish parties have all agreed, when the politicians within those parties have discovered their courage and when there is apparently a public majority, at that stage their problems, which are real now, which are being experienced by the adult members of families that have experienced marital breakdown and their children, everything is deferred by way of resolution to these.</P>
    <P>Then comes back the argument: we can offer you nullity in the short term. This is a curious one because it would appear in the arguments of those who make the case for either an expanded concept of nullity &mdash; indeed it would be very hard to know what that might be, given what nullity means at the present time &mdash; but, leaving the temptation to pursue that one aside, we move on to the question of how inappropriate it would be to move the procedures of nullity into the area of civil law.  Of course, nullity tells you something very interesting.  The people who argue for nullity have a very interesting assumption in their approach. It is that it is all right to address the question of marital breakdown, but in a very remote way.  It has been described by a writer elsewhere as a curiously medieval approach.  It is that, rather than look at the strains of marital breakdown at the present time, the inadequacies of the civil law or the constitutional impediments, you go one better and you stretch back in the lives and the experiences of people and you say &ldquo;Well, your marriage was not a marriage after all&rdquo;, ignoring the existence of children.  Once again the people who are against divorce on the basis of its impact on the children seem not to want to consider for a moment the curious kind of questioning that children might put to themselves as to being told that their parents were really a figment <Col N="639" /> of their imagination in the terms of the law in relation to marriage.  This is presumed to have no effect whatsoever but it is assumed automatically that the existence of civil divorce will send the same children into a downward spiral of disorganisation. You can see what I mean by the phrase that it is a curiously medieval view of law in relation to the unions that constitute marriage in this country.</P>
    <P>In the case of nullity, sitting side by side with the absence of civil provision, we have the long catalogue of Irish solutions to what is in fact a world problem, the whole notion of Lourdes marriages, marriages dissolved abroad, marriages half cancelled, ones that are half alive, ones that are half recognised.  Occasionally these surface, not usually in the form of a discussion about the confusion, the mockery it makes of the law or indeed of the personal and social distress it causes, but of the property implications that it creates.  It creates those on occassion.  So, we are now in the position, therefore, that we will have to decide on that, to see how useful it is on the one hand as the arguments against having a constitutional referendum put it &mdash; waiting for the consensus and nullity in the short term.  We can come back to those, but the public should have an opportunity of evaluating those arguments and evaluating them soon rather than later.</P>
    <P>The report of the joint committee &mdash; at this stage I am paying nothing but compliments to it and to every member who worked in it &mdash; contained in chapter 7, 8, 29, summarised on page 120 says:</P>
    <P>A referendum should be held in relation to the question whether the Oireachtas should be empowered to introduce divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>Straight and simple &mdash; the discussion on the form, the nature, the extent, the consequences, the process of divorce is left aside from that recommendation.  It is just no more, no less than to remove the constitutional inhibition.</P>
    <P>Another preliminary question arises here.  You have to address both the case for and against removing the inhibition <Col N="640" /> as per the recommendation of the joint committee but you can hardly do so without looking at that to which it proposes the amendment would be directed.  Again I would ask those who want to defer the referendum to seriously consider the constitutional inhibition, which itself is the outcome of a particular moment of social history, a particular set of assumptions concerning the family and certain social and economic characteristics which prevailed at that time.  Do those same conditions prevail?  Is it that this suggestion of a referendum is redundant or unnecessary because the circumstances have remained the same?  To give credit to every Member who has spoken from any side in this debate so far, I do not think anybody has suggested that they have.</P>
    <P>Circumstances have changed in a great number of ways.  The concept of the family has changed.  It has changed for a great number of reasons.  In relation to the family it has shed a great deal of the functions it had in the thirties to other institutions and agencies.  It is hardly likely the same kind of agent of socialisation now in the eighties that it was 50 years ago.  Some other agencies provide now even in the realm of education, health and in relation to the normal satisfactions and preparations for life that a family receives.  These have all changed and changed radically.  As well as that, with changes in the social structure itself, including changed assumptions concerning the position of women, their participation in society and so forth, other changes have been fed into the context.</P>
    <P>Now, to some extent, we are left here with a problem.  Perhaps you could say, taking all of what I have said so far, that what you are dealing with is simple urban modernity versus some kind of saved rural past.  With the greatest respect in the world, even in the thirties there had been a long history of marital breakdown in rural Ireland.  It had been effected very much through that legal measure known as the boat, where people went away for <Col N="641" /> very long periods and returned occasionally and many women reared their children without the presence of a father. One can look at the statistics contained in the Scully report in the sixties and others and you can see the large number of women who were the heads of households and small farms, not only widows but deserted wives.</P>
    <P>One can take a more modern indicator, the number of people who are receiving deserted wives assistance.  But perhaps the real measure is the number of those who would like to apply for it, including, therefore, those who have been refused or those who have not yet moved themselves to accept the reality that their partners have left and are not coming back, and certainly not assuming a position in running a viable union.  There is the assumption in it which is perhaps too little stated: what is a good marriage?  The committee decided not to put that in their terms of reference, and wisely so. Indeed, how would you answer the question? But certainly in the arguments made against the referendum on divorce there is to me surfacing every now and again, however tacitly, the suggestion that anything that sticks together, no matter what it is like, is better than anything that is chosen be it a second union, a third union or a fourth union.  You have to deal with that assumption too.  It is an indication of modern life and not necessarily an indication of any social decay that people should want from their marriages much more than the people might have wanted in previous ages.</P>
    <P>Marriage has many functions.  It can deal with the reproduction of children, a point that has not been under-emphasised either in Irish social practice or in the theology that has sustained it.  It can deal with the transfer of property.  It can equally deal with the whole question of providing the context for an emotionally valuable and enriching relationship between people.  Indeed, the whole discussion in the sixties in Roman Catholic theology concentrated on restoring that last purpose of marriage to an appropriate position within marriage in general. <Col N="642" /> You have in the opposition to the referendum an attempt to turn back the clock to something that is not real or documented but something that is quasifictional and something that might have been more barbaric, more limiting, more miserable than people are willing to accord.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a book once on these traditional marriages which are supposed to have been attacked by the availability of divorce and one comment made on them was that they were not indeed the rich things that people suggested. One researcher has written a book that is methodologically not very acceptable perhaps but has some insights &mdash; Nancy Sheppard-Hughes's book on Kerry in which she refers to the case of a husband and wife and the woman in the interview says &ldquo;He was a good man, but a cold man&rdquo;.  She discussed visiting him in the hospital and she said &ldquo;You were very good but I wish things had been better between us.&rdquo;  She describes on another occasion a couple setting out, a taxi-driver and his midwife nurse wife as she headed out to deliver another baby, and they are uncomfortable until they switch on the radio in the car and then they are all right.  What were they going to say to each other?  I wonder about the wonderful communication, the ideal which was contained in many of these early marriages to which now all marriage, thousands more of them, are being compared as a standard.  I am not judging them.  I would not dream of taking the examples that I have just cited and generalising from them.  I have just said that they are insightful in their own way as to whether these marriages sustained by a constitutional impediment to divorce were warm, loving, wonderful things all the time to all the people who lived in them.  I would just rest my case on that. I suspect that they were not such a source of undiluted joy as the opponents of divorce would suggest.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Marital Breakdown was formed to address itself to a problem. There is a problem located in contemporary Irish society, a society that is not the society of the thirties.  It is very different <Col N="643" /> in so far as that the means by which people make their living now are very much changed.  There has been a massive shift from agriculture into industry and services.  The population is now since 1971 by a majority an urban population, a point which has escaped many people and which creates in its non-recognition its own peculiar problems, because very often when we deal with the problems contributed to by an urban society we bring a rural, idealogical and a past-oriented mode of analysis to bear on those problems.</P>
    <P>It also, as I say, is a society that has very many changed attitudes in relation to participation in the workforce, equality, the relationship between parents and children and so forth.  You have to judge the committee's recommendation, this principal one that I have decided to home in on, the question that there should be a constitutional referendum, in the context of those modern conditions.  At the end of the day what we have to decide here is what will best address that problem, no more or no less.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, the previous speakers in this debate have made their case &mdash; and I will not weary Senators further on it &mdash; for there being an all-party agreement or a consensus on the implementation of that section of the report.  The real test is what effect will it have on the lives of those affected.  The committee in its own way goes much further than anything that I have said so far in stressing the new context in which our discussion is taking place.  It mentions the personal factors and the environmental factors that surround marriage now.  It addresses itself to the changed character of these and it is a welcome change in many respects from the previous thundering suggestions that we were living, as these cyclical theories of history used suggest, in some stage of the collapse of civilisation.</P>
    <P>People who want to have either an end put to something that has not worked for them or people who want to have a second or another union recognised are not really interested in contributing to <Col N="644" /> the collapse of civilisation.  They are interested in the relationship that exists between them and other people, between the relationship that exists between these new unions and their children, in their relationship with the law, their relationships with society and so on.  They want, if you like, to remove a stigma and a deviancy label from their new circumstances. That is what they are aiming at and it is to these aims that they ask us to respond, not to say that we want to change Irish life overnight.</P>
    <P>This raises a question, then, as to what we should do.  What we are in danger of doing, to my mind is avoiding the issue. The committee, in a way, and the discussion that surrounded the work of the committee, sometimes helpful discussion, sometimes unhelpful discussion and sometimes interventions from within the committee perhaps on occasion, &mdash; I would stress by individual minority members of the committee &mdash; were singularly unhelpful when people with who knows what motivation, with who knows what degree of sincerity, I would add too, decided to deliver views that were what we might call high traditional: that is they could only be encountered by those who moved to a very high point of the society or civilisation and who are on a special line to some special source of authority.</P>
    <P>They are entitled to their opinion.  I question the viability of it in a country that has so many young people, that is undergoing such change and that is in the European Community and has chosen to let the blinds fly up on its experiences in so many different ways in looking at the rest of the world.  The committee in that debate stopped us ignoring the problem for at least a little while.  But having decided not to ignore the problem we have yet to make sure that we do not fall into the trap of avoiding the implications of the discussion.  Deferral and delay will be simply construed as avoidance.  Of those who want to respond many genuinely believe that one can build on the framework of nullity something that will evolve eventually towards the changes in the civil law which will be possible <Col N="645" /> contingent on the removal of the constitutional inhibition.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect I differ.  One has only to reflect on what nullity is. Nullity is the recognition that what had been regarded as a union was never a union at all, no more and no less.  The circumstances in which nullity would be granted are quite definite: incapacity of one kind or another; knowledge, information, coercion &mdash; one can discuss these.  They are an appropriate discussion, internal to canon law procedures. One has to contrast that with civil divorce where civil divorce has been available.  It differs in a fundamental way from nullity.  This is important to us in so far as it addresses itself to the circumstances of marital breakdown now. In that way some would say that it is a bit more honest.  Some nullity decrees are granted, I think addressed to circumstances that are very genuine and that certainly could impress people.  But many more nullity decrees are fictions, the projection of the requirements of a new arrangement backwards.  In this rather bizzare situation that the circumstances of a union had not been present at the original contract, one can now go on and suggest: &ldquo;Well, therefore, let us wipe the slate clean&rdquo;.  One can build into this.</P>
    <P>Like everything bogus in life it is more available to the rich than it is to the poor. Nullity has been available to those who are familiar, and who are able to engage those familiar, and I add those who are able to pay those familiar with the procedures, much more to the people with resources than to those without resources.  It is a costly, socially discriminating, long, tedious and very bitter process. I do not want to delay the House by looking at the quality of the procedures in nullity cases and contrast those with civil legal changes.  But I would not be impressed by those who tell me that the person concerned is met by a kind person; brought into a warm room, engaged in long chats, given a cup of tea; and that this negates my argument.  That is not what I am talking about.  I am saying that to achieve and sustain an argument for nullity one has to make very deep, real <Col N="646" /> allegations or factual statements about the partner that are often painful and more painful, more shattering in many ways on the partner in question than what is usually said in the hearing of civil divorce cases.</P>
    <P>There is the other question also that in the case of nullity hearings, as I understand it, the suggestion is that one begins with the assumption that it should not be granted.  Therefore, one has to argue the case almost impeccably to suggest that one has a particular ground for seeking nullity.  The civil law dealing with divorce starts on an entirely different basis.  It addresses itself to the present circumstances of a union that is not working.  It addresses itself to today and the immediate yesterday.  It does not seek to find a flaw in the contract.  It says: it did not work.  None of us is perfect; many people have a view by which they look for less and they will last longer.</P>
    <P>There are many people whose expectations are not met in marital unions. There are many people whose marriages come under appalling strain.  Maybe under the forces of economic circumstances, unemployment, poverty or whatever, a marriage gets into difficulties or one of the partners develops an alcoholic problem.  Does one go back then and say: &ldquo;Well, I did not know that he had a propensity for alcohol when I married him&rdquo;.  One cannot quote that for nullity.  But it has wrecked a person's life. It has ruined the home.  It is damaging the children.  With the best will in the world one might try to do something about it; perhaps the partners separate; perhaps after a long period they decide that they want to try again.</P>
    <P>I rarely ever preface anything I have to say in this House by saying &ldquo;as a sociologist. . . &rdquo; but I will reply to one assertion made here that once a person got a divorce he or she was not likely to marry again.</P>
    <P>The fact is, whether people like it or not, the people who write about the family tell you that people try again, again, and again.  If marriage does not work for them once, they are not put off. They set off again and they try again and <Col N="647" /> again in the vast majority of cases.  We should just bear that little cautionary note in mind.</P>
    <P>In relation to the difference between nullity and the civil law, however, there is a straightforward question raised.  It is that one is, after all, talking about the procedures available primarily of a denominational kind.  How can one leave the Church-State connection and its basis as it affects the law intact if one decides to take the nullity provisions of one denomination and move them to the centre of the civil law in a State that at this very time is debating how to move forward towards a conception of transcendent morality of some kind or transcendent social systems and cultural systems that might end the conflict on this island?  At times it is believed that we should live in a pluralist society.  How can one without a change?  Let us not judge it whether it is positive or negative.</P>
    <P>There are people who would like to see the procedures, the canon law of one denomination enshrined and become the law of the State.  But there is a price to be paid for that.  I believe that at present popularly in Ireland there is much less desire for people to see the specific sustenance of one tradition, one set of orientations towards marriage enshrined in the civil law than people might believe.  On the one hand people want to have the right to hold on to what they believe in. They are right in that, but they are equally not showing the enthusiasm that politicians sometimes portray to have their version of their faith and its implications in civil law imposed as the principal one on this island.  People no longer in a majority way want that.  There is a tiny minority of people who seek that.  When we discussed this matter indirectly in the 1970s Mr. Justice Costello, then Attorney General, seemed to see some merit in the approach against which I have argued.  I found this very strange at the time, given his distinguished training and practice in Irish legal circles, because I felt that it was available to anybody at a superficial level to notice that there was <Col N="648" /> a fundamental difference in the procedures of nullity and the procedures of civil divorce.  Beyond that, there were other implications which would have to be teased out.  But he must have formed his opinion knowing that there were definite social assumptions that seemed to prefer it and sustain it as a preferred option.  I suspect that the social assumption that argued in favour of it then as an option was that you could appear to get away with it and you could not appear to get away with civil divorce.</P>
    <P>You have to be better than that.  The fact of the matter is that the social assumptions of nullity &mdash; I have described them already: they have been the subject of radio drama as the family met together to decide on what it meant to be obliterated as the marriage of their parents was dissolved.  There is a curiously effervescent quality to it all: one day we were married and had children, then it was dissolved.  But they are there as some kind of consequential alteration of the dissolution.  There are the circumstances in which nullity is granted and which I have covered.  There are the circumstances which would be available, correct matters for a church to debate, correct matters to be discussed as people want to up-date their cannon law.  The procedures of it can be discussed also, I presume, although I have found from debates on the question of nullity and divorce that people are not so sure about the basis for decisions on the different criteria.  Sometimes they appear to work: other times they do not appear to work. The only thing we know about them is that the relative outcome is better &mdash; you have a better chance, the higher up you go in the social scale, the more aware you are and the more money you have to get a proper opinion.</P>
    <P>In relation to civil divorce, it is obviously when the constitutional referendum has been held and after the decision that the debate would take place on the circumstances in which divorce should be granted.  But like everything else in life we tend to make all of this a great deal more emotional then it is.  In the history of marriage, family and unions, all over <Col N="649" /> the world, in different cultures, in different times, there has been a minority of people who have been able to pick one partner and with that partner construct a single household which has met all of their needs through different generations.</P>
    <P>One of the great and powerful props to the family was the existence of forms of meeting that satisfaction elsewhere. There are those who would argue in the history of extra-marital relationships and the history of prostitution that it has had, an indirect consequence occasionally, of sustaining many a &ldquo;fine marriage&rdquo;.  Equally, I suspect that the notion of a marriage once and for all irrevocable, was closely related to the transmission of property in society.  It enabled the transmission or property, usually in the male line, to take place in a very orderly way. But today people are getting married and people are under pressure.  Many of these people are not people who are less than anyone else in society.  In many cases &mdash; this is an important point to bear in mind &mdash; they are people who ask more from their unions than many of the people who suffer on in what is, in many cases, a less than fulfilling union.  They are also people who are victims of circumstances over which they have little control.  What do you do in the situation where a partner changes your whole relationship by unilateral actions that change the whole basis of the relationship?</P>
    <P>In all of this we must make a qualitative leap past the hypocrisy and the prejudices of our society, that we are superior or that we are different from anybody else. What the availability of civil divorce does is that it acknowledges the fundamental humanness of people, that in looking for a union they want it to work; they have hopes from it.  Circumstances change; it turns from anything positive or rewarding into something that is bitter and often corrosive; something that in many ways drags down the health of the partners.  It changes them and it affects their children and so on.  They do not want to be told this is a bad dream; you were really having a dream all the time, you were not married.  They want to know what it <Col N="650" /> is to hear that this unfortunate phase in their lives is over.  They seek finality, they seek an end to something that simply did not work, that had all the consequences that I speak of.</P>
    <P>They also seek the freedom to live as full participating citizens before the law, before the social welfare codes, before every aspect of the civil and administrative law, as full citizens by enjoying the freedom to have a late union recognised properly by the State.  It is an extraordinary position for a State to say, you will have one shot at it and if it does not work, well, tough luck.  That has implications for the first union and for the later ones. Those who argue about the first one will say to you, that as long as those walls are there there will be a greater incentive to make it all work.  There will be a greater atmosphere of stability.  But is there not a price to be paid for all that?  Is it not a rather miserable view of a union at the end of the day that you have to create an open prison of marriage by your constitutional impediment and your opposition to civil divorce law, that you have to lock the people into it in such a way that they are stuck?  They make it work; it is better than anything else, with the deceits, the social evasions, the appalling dishonesties that it gives rise to outside of marriage.</P>
    <P>I am not describing the majority of marriages when I say that marriages fail. A great majority of them do work.  I am not arguing against marriage &mdash; far from it.  I am not arguing against long, loving relationships that will go on for several decades &mdash; good luck to all of them; they have nothing but my admiration.  But I am saying that it is a hell of an assumption to say that if you manage to be running one of these models, everybody else has to do the same.  People's circumstances differ.  There are people who differ in relation to the way that the social and economic structure of society impinges on them.  We know this for a whole series of reasons.  Are they to be locked into relationships, to be precluded from having certain options on the basis that we do not want to recognise their experiences?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> In many ways the willingness or unwillingness to discuss the holding of a referendum and the bringing in of changes in the law on civil divorce is an expression also of the relationship between majorities and minorities.  There is this assumption which leans on the political, that what you are dealing with are the rights of the minority.  The majority is suspected of being conservative and politicians always suspect that their majorities are more conservative than they are in reality, that you cannot move to meet the needs of a minority.  It is a degradation of the political process when rights of minorities are not recognised in this way. This is not a crude relationship &mdash; the establishment of the relationship between majorities and minorities in the matter of rights.  It is not a matter of acceding to demands.  It is a matter of the way the majority handles a minority experience with it.</P>
    <P>For example, in relation to societies that exploit people it is not often only the facts of the structural exploitation that are important but the quality of the relationships.  These have to be negotiated. The concept of democracy is only crudely and improperly stated if it asserts majority rule.  Democracy is about the negotiated relationship between people who take decisions, some of whom are in a majority and whose view prevails and some of whom are in a minority and whose view does not prevail.  Having won the vote, the head count of the orthodox conservative versus the rest, you have no right to trample on the aspirations and on the needs of those who are in a minority.</P>
    <P>I have said that the recommendation contained in the report that we should have a referendum should be speedily implemented for other reasons as well. This has been covered by other speakers but I would like to make one short statement and that is that it drags the law into disrepute.  You cannot look at the panoply of provisions we have at present and suggest that they are anything other than a mockery of what the law should be.  They reflect ingenuity in some cases. People advise each other that if you go <Col N="652" /> about it in this particular way you may qualify under this provision.  There is the whole notion about the State's attitude towards foreign divorces, for example.  In the end my own training and orientation towards this problem is primarily influenced by the social circumstances of (a) the absence of the possibility of divorce and (b) the social circumstances of there being such a possibility available in Irish civil law.  I am convinced that you need the latter for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>Quietly I think we should assess some of the arguments for and against these positions.  It has been argued that you really do not need it, that you can live with the availability of annulment.  I have said sufficient on that.  It has been argued equally in relation to its effect on the children, the people who are the spectators of marital breakdown, of divorce proceedings, of nullity proceedings.  They are the participants in the consequences of such arrangements as are being made. I might say in passing the constitutional position as to their participation in all of these proceedings and many others is far less humane than anyone should desire. The concept of children having rights of their own needs to be vindicated and indeed vindicated in a constitutional way. We have the position of the competing status of different statements.</P>
    <P>Against divorce, it is suggested that the availability of divorce itself will impact on children's welfare.  I have two things to say to that.  Where is the evidence? The evidence you are looking for is comparative. You have to say where are you able to show that it has had such an effect on children.  There is no point in taking two separate sets of facts and saying that where divorce was available you had the following number of children in institutional care.  That is like saying there is a relationship between hay and rain.  It is a meaningless kind of comparison.  You listen to it all the time on this.  For example, is it not much easier to show statistically and every other way that there is a relationship between the diminished circumstances of children and marital breakdown.  Before you come as far as your option of divorce or nullity or <Col N="653" /> whatever you want, if you are living in the circumstances of marital breakdown, it is that that affects children.  Then you go on and ask yourself the careful unemotive question as to which has, given the evidence, impacted most on the welfare of children, their perceptions, their general welfare, their whole development? Is it the fact that they were locked into unions that were unhappy, unions that had ceased to exist emotionally and every way or where the parents had decided that they could no longer live together and had moved on to form another union?</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to ask the children. Which can they remember?  Which has the worst impact on a child, a long memory of an unhappy home or a memory of a household that was disassembled and another union that was reassembled.  I am not going to make any absolute statements.  The people who have the answers on all of this are claiming an absolutism.  We are speaking for the children.  I say that the evidence is not there to support them.  The evidence is in the other direction.  Children's welfare, their development, their whole process of socialisation is more affected by the quality of the relationships than it is by whether or not daddy or mammy had a particular kind of union or another.  We have to look at these questions very carefully in relation to the question of the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  A woman came to my clinic a few months ago and said it would be very unfair to the existing spouse.  In relation to people who come to talk to me about this, it is not representative and I would not dream of attaching any importance to it.  People come to tell you the things that you want to hear or sometimes brave people come to tell you the things that you do not want to hear. The truth of the matter was that she was very much in a minority of those who represented opinions to me on this subject. She had the view that maybe it is unfair to the existing spouse.  That has to be evaluated too.  Suppose, for example, the conditions of marital breakdown apply, is that not unfair to the existing <Col N="654" /> spouse or both of them but particularly in so far as the conditions of breakdown are initiated by one side of the relationship &mdash; gross marital infidelity, absence of economic security provision, attitudes of one kind or another, any kind of violence, etc?  Is it more proper to continue to suffer there with that union intact and himself &mdash; as they would say in the story &mdash; running wild?</P>
    <P>There is in such a notion the concept of the heroic suffering Irish wife.  I believe that anyone who listens to women in Ireland today know that they have rejected that model for themselves.  It has an elaborated theological existence.  Pray that things will be all right.  Prayer is a good thing and it is not my business to evaluate its efficacy.  The fact of the matter is, I suspect, that this view of the long suffering partner at home in a union that has been protected not only by God, the Roman Catholic Church, Mr. de Valera and his constitution but now by the Irish State and a majority of the Irish legislators is poor comfort to somebody who wanted a little more from marriage.</P>
    <P>Equally in relation to the effect on the existing spouse there is the notion that in the availability of divorce there is always the possibility of another more satisfactory union.  There is the knowledge that actions initiated by the other partner can have a set of consequences that do not place you in the role of victim but to which you can respond.  You can invoke the law as something that oppresses you. In the availability of civil legal divorce there is the possibility that the law can assist you in adjusting your relationship both to the other partner and to society. Is there not the possibility of drawing a logical hypothesis from that that the very existence of civil legal divorce, far from making more precarious the existing spouse can, in fact, in many ways serve as a condition which makes it in the interest of both partners to have a better relationship within marriage?</P>
    <P>There is one other simple and final notion.  William Duncan in his book addressed this notion at the end of the day when all the others had failed.  I am running out of patience with this one.  It <Col N="655" /> is that the country cannot afford divorce, the idea being that we will not be able to pay the gardaí, the teachers, the nurses and everybody else if divorce comes in, we will be so busy handing out assistance to the children of the new divorced people etc.  The mind boggles sometimes at these structures that are set up.  To answer it, there is a preliminary case as to whether or not it is a right.  I believe it is a right and a civil right I justify in so far as, where there is damaged participation socially, economically, legally and culturally in the society, it should be available. I am not put off by the suggestion that you look to the human rights codes and you will find that it is not reflected in the different international codes that exist.  It is not an answer.  Why is it not an answer?  Because international codes themselves have been historically minimal responses to certain conditions.  The example of course is the influences even on the United Nations charter and others; its response historically to the conditions in the gas chambers, in the death camps of the Second World War, the conception in human terms that we had sunk as humanists to a very low level and we should respond and have a condition of human rights.  We did not evolve to the point where we wanted for example to accept it as a human right to eat and address ourselves to the question of famine.  Famine is only beginning now to jog us in a longer haul towards acknowledging what we rather quickly acknowledged in relation to the circumstances at the end of World War II, as well as the question whether it is a need and if it is a need whether the State should both legislate and provide for it.</P>
    <P>There is another more basic and fundamental argument that can be made, whether or not you have the existence of civil legal divorce, you have the problem of both the partners and the children affected by marital breakdown, they have to be assisted by the State.  Can it not be more honestly handled that you would meet all of these needs when you have a proper legal framework to do so rather than having a whole plethora of possible <Col N="656" /> responses, all responding in different ways to different degrees of destitution, different degrees of poverty within individual families.  In many ways the whole argument, and I will conclude on this, is that the Committee on Marital Breakdown performed a valuable task in drawing our attention to some short term things that can be done and that should be done.  For example, I would have liked to have seen a longer and more elaborated discussion on the whole question of emotional and sexual education for marriage.  The whole notion of education counselling, mediation and so on are there.  There are some specific proposals as to the age of marriage and there are comments on the existing law.  What stands out in it is the short, terse statement that after its long, much published deliberations the committee said that a referendum should be held in relation to the question whether the Oireachtas should be empowered to introduce divorce legislation.  We should respond to that by having the referendum and by having it in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take from anything I have said so far by going back to the point that Senator Seán O'Leary made that there are divisions within the Labour Party and divisions within all parties. With respect for my distinguished and good friend, Senator O'Leary, this is a little cheap.  The fact is that all ten Senators in this House will be voting in favour of the formulation of words which we had already decided upon, that is that we want the referendum in the lifetime of this Government.  As a party we will be continuing a campaign, with which, I am proud to say, as Chairman of the Labour Party, the Labour Party has been associated right from the beginning, on the question of marital breakdown.  It is my problem and the Labour Party's problem as how we deal with the odd few people, how we listen to those people, as we have to, who have different views or have reservations.  The position of our party is one that is unequivocal at one conference after another.  It is not that we want to lead the gallop down some <Col N="657" /> moral decline in Ireland.  Our party is older than the other parties here in its commitment towards order and in a commitment towards the quality of law.  What we want is to address ourselves to a human problem.  Unless we establish an outer point for the debate, unless we establish a date there will be a long, vague, badly informed debate.  It will be bitter and it will involve even more. Remember, as we seek to establish some conditions of peace on this island, that every now and again there will be these unwelcome authoritarian, bullying statements from those who say that they operate from a higher level than ourselves.</P>
    <P>I remember, shortly after coming in here, hearing one of the most honest Senators that I can recall speak, my namesake Senator Michael J. O'Higgins. He made what I felt was a brilliant contribution on family planning.  He honestly stated that he felt the law of God took precedent over the law of man and that the civil law was derived from natural law and so on.  He believed that.  The merit of listening to him was that it was an interesting natural law view of legislation and law, Church and State in this island. What is much less satisfactory are those who do not have the courage to say that and even those who stand behind them such as the Archbishop I mentioned, who do not have the courage to openly say: &ldquo;We want Catholic legislators to vote in a particular way&rdquo; but who say something evasive and shoddy like this, as I can attest from attending seminars with Dr. McNamara, that: &ldquo;Catholic legislators will be in no doubt as to where their duty lies&rdquo;.  Behind this enigmatic statement lies another one: &ldquo;Catholic legislators should be in no doubt as to what an informed Catholic conscience is&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If these statements are going to surface again and again in an open-ended debate while we look forward to some day when there will be a majority wanting to change the civil law to address the question of suffering people, adults and children, you are going to have an atmosphere created that is alienating them &mdash; and there is their business &mdash; from not only the Church but alienating them from the <Col N="658" /> Legislature itself.  We have a duty to respond to the needs of everybody who lives in this State.  Our Constitution, whether we like it or not, in its fundamentals, gave us that obligation.  What we need to do now is to seek to remove the impediment that is in that Constitution to allow us to develop the possibility and it is only a possibility because after the creation of that possibility, by the removal of the constitutional impediment, we then have to go on and calmly, unemotively debate the forms of divorce legislation that are suitable for this country. Our choices are to operate like that and respond or to ignore the problem, to avoid the problem, to evade the problem or to imagine that we can indulge ourselves in some kind of vague cloudy discussion about nullity that is tacitly and in an unwelcome way galloping us along towards an unacceptable and inappropriate and an unhelpful view of Church-State relations in this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of Senator Higgins describes what has been happening in this House for the last number of weeks.  We have had a vague and broad-ended discussion but it has not been on the problems that have been set down in the report.  We had a number of people on the other side suggesting that Fianna Fáil were the only people who could create the situation in which a referendum could take place.  Senator O'Leary said this.  We had the unusual situation this morning when Senator Higgins suggested that the only way we will go forward in this particular referendum is if we get an all-party agreement.  It is very unusual to hear a member of the Government side suggesting that the only way legislation can be introduced is through all-party agreement.  That is running away from the responsibility that the Government have to introduce legislation if they intend to introduce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question that is before us we have one suggestion, that a referendum should take place signed by both Government parties; then there is an amendment in in the name of the Senators from the <Col N="659" /> Independent side and now we are told all members of the Labour Party are going to support that amendment having signed the proposition in the first place.  This shows that there is nothing but disunity on the far side as to what is to happen. The only people who can bring in the legislation to have a referendum are the Government.  It is up to the Government to do that.  It is not up to us to decide for them whether or not we should have a referendum.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Government have no intention of holding a referendum on this matter.  No Government Minister has said that they intend to hold a referendum.  There has not been one solitary Government Minister in this House during the whole of the debate. The Government Ministers do not, judging by the apathy they are showing, intend to hold a referendum in the lifetime of this Government.  They will not introduce it, it would appear no matter how long their stay in Government. According to the people who have been speaking in the debate people who oppose divorce are not living in a real world; they are people who are living in a middle ages type of society.  There are two shades of opinion and I firmly believe that on either side the opinions are valid opinions and the people who hold them believe they are the right opinions.  It would appear from what Senator Higgins said that the people on the committee who took the traditional stance were people who should not be listened to and that the only people who should be listened to were people who wanted drastic changes made.  It was also suggested that the opinions of lawyers over-ruled everybody else's opinions when the result of this tribunal became known.  Lawyers have their own place in society but this is a running down of the work of the people who served on that committee for many hard and dreary months.  The influence these people had on the committee was big and it is most unfair to suggest that the lawyers won.  The problems that confronted this committee were enormous <Col N="660" /> and there is no doubt that they are growing problems.  The committee worked extremely hard and produced a report which is fair, very broad and addresses itself to the actual problems.  It equally addresses itself to the reason for the setting up of the committee which was that the Oireachtas realised the need to protect family life and, equally, that there is an awareness of marriage breakdown as a social reality.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this debate has not been on the protection of family life but rather on how we can deal with the problem of marriage breakdown.  Every Member of this House has in his political life been confronted with the problem of marital breakdown, with the problems associated with marital breakdown and equally with the realisation that certain marriages are on the point of breakdown.</P>
    <P>The report makes us very aware that education for marriage in Ireland is negligible. In fact, one might almost go so far as to say it is nil.  Lack of education for marriage is probably one of the main reasons why marriages break down. There are other personal, psychological, physical and environmental reasons, but there has been no attempt either in our educational system or even in our family system to educate people for marriage. We then wonder why so many marriages run into trouble.  The existence of education for marriage will not rid us of the problem of marriage breakdown.  There may be people who are not suited to marriage.  Many of the problems we see in terms of marital disharmony are created by the fact that people get married too young.  When they reach the age of legal majority they feel they can get involved in marriage without adequate preparation.</P>
    <P>Both in my political and family life I see too many marriages which are breaking down due to inadequate housing.  Young people of 17, 18 and 19 years of age get married and go to live with their in-laws. They go to live in houses which are not large enough to have any kind of separation between the first and the second family.  This causes problems not only for <Col N="661" /> the young newly married couple but also for the older in-laws because they cannot have the privacy necessary in either marriage. The situation with regard to public housing is wrong.  When houses are being allocated it is too often the case that families with problems are moved into areas where there are already many other families with problems.  This creates further problems.</P>
    <P>There is no real counselling service available to a couple with marital problems. Social service groups make attempts to get involved, as do priests, friends etc. but there is no adequately structured service to help people with problems.  There is a suggestion in the report that people under 18 could get married with the consent of a court in cases where circumstances suggest that these marriages could be stable.  In no circumstances should people under the age of 18 be allowed to marry.  In situations where people wish to get married under the age of 18 there is usually a pregnancy involved.  A marriage should not be allowed to take place simply because there may be a social stigma attached to an illegitimate birth.  In such cases there is the probability of the marriage breaking down.  The greater proportion of marriages which have broken down are marriages hastily entered into by virtue of the fact that the girl was pregnant.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism and drug abuse are relevant factors in quite a number of cases of marital breakdown.  There is a need for greater emphasis on education into the causes and effects of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Senator Higgins suggested that nullity or an extension of nullity was what was being advocated by certain people on the committee.  I did not read anywhere in the report that anybody had suggested that all the problems of marital breakdown could be resolved by extending the law of nullity as it stands at present either in our legislation or Church rules.  The situation of people whose marriages have broken down is a very worrying one.  As one who has many, many personal friends whose marriages <Col N="662" /> have broken down one can see the problems they have.  One can see in their everyday lives the problems that they come up with.  It has been suggested that in all these cases divorce would be the panacea for all their ills.  That is not necessarily so.  Senator Higgins probably put his finger on one of the incongruities when he suggested that once people divorce they tend to marry again, and then they tend to remarry.  This is one of the peculiarities that one notices, particularly in societies in which divorce is legal and can be obtained.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the remarriage rate after divorces it is very, high in percentage terms but the degree of breakdown in the second marriage is equally high.  If there is a third marriage, breakdown is equally high.  It is an option for many people, but it is not going to solve the problems of marital breakdown nor is it going to resolve the problems which may have caused the marriage breakdown in the first place.  It will not change a person's psychological make-up.  If the breakdown occurs because of a certain psychological problem there is absolutely no doubt in my mind but that divorce will not resolve that particular problem.</P>
    <P>The position of children of divorced people and whether they are more or less disturbed or more or less happy than children of parents who are in stable relationships in the married state is not something I would like to go into.  From my personal knowledge of children I feel they need a stable relationship.  You will get stable children and stable adults from stable relationships.</P>
    <P>The question of what happens at present in Ireland in terms of family courts, or of the separation orders, or of orders for granting of funds to a person whose marriage has broken down are totally inadequate.  The justices who deal with cases in what are supposed to be family courts deal with them too impersonally and with absolutely no privacy in back-rooms of courthouses on days on which courts are sitting.  Everybody who is going to court on the Tuesday morning will know that the justice is sitting on family <Col N="663" /> matters at 9 o'clock or is sitting on family matters at 6 o'clock.  They know that anybody who is seen going into the particular courthouse is going in because of a marital problem.  Generally speaking, the justice is overloaded with criminal or civil case has not the time, the energy or the interest to deal adequately with the cases that come before him.  He is either in a rush to get into the ordinary court or he is in a rush to get away afterwards once the court has finished.</P>
    <P>There is a desperate need &mdash; and I say desperate need &mdash; for the setting up of a proper family protection court system, that is adequately housed, and is private. The justices or the mediators should be people who are highly motivated and trained in the particular subject, and not people who just because they happen to be district justices or High Court judges, or whatever, must deal with the broad spectrum.  They should be people who are adequately trained in dealing with marital disharmony, in how to assess the problems of children, in how to deal with the problems that they are faced with on an increasing scale week by week.</P>
    <P>There are questions of family courts or of mediation, which comes first.  There is no counselling or mediation service. There is an urgent need for the setting up of such a service.  The Government would do well if they provided the resources needed.  They are not providing any resources to deal with the problems of spouses.  It is a matter of the State allowing the families who have problems to continue with these problems, and to continue sometimes when a proper mediation service or a counselling service could get over many of the problems.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding this particular report, as I would see it, is that we welcome the report and the fact that it is before this House.  We would like to thank all the members of the committee who worked so extremely hard in the production of this report.  If there is going to be action on this report, it is not up to us to create that action.  It is totally up to the Government to initiate whatever legislation is needed.  There is no <Col N="664" /> point in their lecturing us on this side of the House that we are responsible for holding-up legislation.  We cannot do anything.  It is up to the Government to introduce the legislation if they want a referendum.  If they want a referendum they can introduce the legislation and then let us see what happens.  We are not going to help them in that.  They are there to govern.  If they do not want to introduce it, why not say so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion that Seanad Éireann welcomes the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and urges the widest possible debate on its recommendations and calls on the Government to consider the holding of a referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution.  I must join with all the other speakers who have paid a well-deserved tribute to the Members who sat on this Joint Committee and who have examined in such depth the entire problem of marriage breakdown. They have done so in a very comprehensive way.  Indeed, they say &mdash; and I would like to quote from page 2 of their Report dealing with the methods of inquiry:</P>
      <P>The Committee placed advertisements in the daily newspapers on 22nd September, 1983 and 25th November, 1983 and the Sunday newspapers on 25th September, 1983 and 27th November, 1983, seeking submissions from interested parties on matters covered by the Committee's Orders of Reference.  In response to these advertisements, the Committee received submissions from a wide variety of religous, social, medical, legal and political organisations and from individual members of the public.  More than 700 written submissions were received.  All of these drew attention to the lack of protection for marriage, the inadequacy of legal remedies and the need for legal and social reform.</P>
      <P>At 1.4 they continue:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the quality of the submissions received, the Committee <Col N="665" /> acquired a body of information which provided source material for all the various questions which arose in the course of the Committee's deliberations and the Committee wishes to thank all those organisations and individuals.</P>
    <P>That, I think, gives an idea to the ordinary members of the public of the very careful and open way that our colleagues on the joint committee set about their work.  It accounts for the fact that this report on marriage breakdown is so comprehensive it goes a long way towards finding and reaching the root of the problem, if such is possible.</P>
    <P>The report comprises of 11 chapters. It gives an in-depth examination on practically every aspect one can imagine of marriage breakdown.  It has chapters as follows: Chapter 2 &mdash; Marriage and the Family &mdash; The Legal and Constitutional Position.  Chapter 3 &mdash; The Protection of Marriage and Family Life.  That chapter considered education, counselling, mediation and the age for marriage. Chapter 4 &mdash; Marriage Breakdown &mdash; deals with the personal factors and the environmental factors.  Chapter 5 &mdash; The Problems Caused by Marriage Breakdown. Chapter 6 &mdash; The Statistics.  Chapter 7 &mdash; The Legal Remedies.  In their approach to this problem, the joint committee have done a great service to society.  I hope as wide a cross-section of the public as possible will read this report and will consider with great charity and in detail what the Government in setting up the joint committee were striving to achieve.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan a few minutes ago said that the Government were not very interested in bringing forward legislation. The Minister for Health and Social Welfare attended during most of the debate in the House last week.  There is a desire on the part of most people in the Government to tackle this problem.  It is not just something that is foreign for most of us, even in the most remote, rural area. There is not a village, town or parish <Col N="666" /> where there are not at least some problems, whether desertion or judicial separation or barring orders or even annulments.  Nobody can dare to say that problems do not exist.  I agree with the report that every effort should be made to try to effect reconciliation in as many cases as possible.</P>
    <P>In their introduction on marriage breakdown the committee very clearly point out &mdash; and I quote from page 21:</P>
    <P>Having considered the nature and form of marriage, the Committee examined the factors which contribute to the breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>In so doing, the Committee from information supplied in submissions and in published works on marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Committee felt it was desirable to examine in detail the questions of how and why marriages break down, in order to place the many elements of break down in the context of their opinions and observations on how best to protect marriage and family life and del with problems which are caused by marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The essence of marriage is a formal commitment, made in the presence of witnesses, to create and maintain a lasting and stable relationship between the spouses.  The extent to which the stability of this relationship is subjected to pressure will vary.  Pressure is brought about from within the relationship by the interaction of the personalities of spouses on each other and from outside the marriage by social, economic and environmental pressures such as bad housing, unemployment and the changing values and ethos of society. Most marriages in Ireland deal in the normal course with these pressures, but in an increasing number of cases these pressures can lead to friction and conflict which cannot be resolved and which can lead to the breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>Everyone will clearly admit to the evidence before their eyes in most parts of <Col N="667" /> the country.  When we come to a problem which, even in the least way touches on the Church, people refuse to see it so clearly.  People, when they see a marriage in difficulty &mdash; and certainly in rural areas it is very difficult to hide that fact &mdash; straightaway lose that sympathy for which our people are famous.  They are inclined to say that it is their own fault, or it is his fault or her fault, or whatever. This is a position in which we should, as far as we can individually &mdash; and certainly collectively in the Oireachtas &mdash; try to give some hope.  It is possible for people to make mistakes, and sometimes things do not work out.  Indeed, it is difficult to understand in some ways the attitude of the Catholic Church, of which I am a member.  I accept the principles of the Church and nullity.  I read with great interest a book entitled <i>Marriage Annulment in the Catholic Church &mdash; A Practical Guide,</i> by Ralph Browne, which clearly spells out the way in which the Church and the ecclesiastical courts deal with the problems of annulment and marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand how the Church sets out criteria for ecclesiastic annulments and at the same time does not recognise the State, or any other body, dissolving a marriage on the same criteria. This is something to which we should address ourselves to see if it possible to come up with an answer.  I believe that the State should recognise Church annulments.  The State recognises Church marriages.  The priest, or the minister, has the facility as registrars of marriage. While the State recognises Church marriages, I believe that legislation must be enacted to enable the State to recognise Church annulments.  Otherwise, the whole thing is a nonsense.  As I have already said, with large numbers of families and spouses being deserted and with so many judicial separations, barring orders and, indeed, annulments, there is a problem.</P>
    <P>The committee quite rightly pointed out that statistics were not too clear.  They have asked for the next census of population to clear up that point.  I expect that <Col N="668" /> this, of course, will happen.  Nevertheless, there needs to be a change of heart right across the country.  Senator Higgins, in his very forceful speech this morning made a number of points that I should certainly like to support.</P>
    <P>The question of divorce in this country is, unfortunately, almost taboo.  Even in the last couple of years when we had the legislation on family planning once one mentioned one such subject, we had the puritans coming in with contraception, abortion and divorce &mdash; the three problems &mdash; as if they were all parts of one malaise or whatever.  It is unfortunate that so many good-living Christian people should think that way and have closed minds on this whole social area.</P>
    <P>With regard to divorce, in so far as it is consistent with the common good it is important that it should be available to the large percentage of people who want it.  We should consider the liberty of people and the number of persons who need it and how many people in this country are asking for divorce.  The Catholic Church is not a democracy, but if they were to hold a plebiscite within the Church on the question of whether or not they should continue offering the facility of annulment it is difficult to know what the outcome would be, because the people who are loudest in these areas would have difficulty in reconciling their views.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán O'Leary last week dealt with the question of statistics.  The joint committee recognised the difficulty here. I think that before the committee reported an effort should have been made to endeavour to clarify the numbers of people who find themselves in this category of annulled marriage.  It is not just sufficient to say that nine, ten or 11,000 people are in receipt of deserted wives' allowance.  For every deserted wife who is granted a deserted wife's allowance there are many more who are equally as deserted but do not qualify for the allowance.  I think that could be as high in my own constituency as three to one, because for everyone who gets such an allowance there are probably three who have not satisfied the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> On the whole question of divorce, the concept of the common good must be taken into account, bearing in mind, of course, the numbers whose marriages have irreparably broken down.  The report suggests that marriage breakdown can be divided broadly into at least two phases.  First, during the first five years of marriage, breakdown is often brought about by the failure to establish the necessary minimum relationship, physically and emotionally.  Secondly, marriages which negotiate the first phase with reasonable success and enter the second phase in which the relationship is subjected to different stresses &mdash; the increased maturity of the personality with the passage of time, new needs which attain prominence and which may no longer be recognised or met by the partner, and the arrival and the rearing of children.</P>
    <P>I suppose that is quite true, but without the actual in-depth statistics it is difficult to see that.  I would hold the view that the blanket prohibition on divorce as a solution to marriage breakdown does nothing, and will do nothing, to promote happy marriages and, indeed, happy family life.  I know that if we take the environmental factors and provide good housing &mdash; I know that bricks and mortar do not make a home but the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree that the Government's generous and imaginative scheme which was announced last night will help &mdash; the situation is helped.</P>
    <P>With 30 or 35 years' experience as a public representative &mdash; and a lot of our work, as you all will agree, touches on social work &mdash; if one walks into a house and there is an atmosphere there one can sense it at the door before one goes in. On the whole question of the damage to children, I am not in a position to know which is the most traumatic experience &mdash; either the separation of the parents or a straightforward divorce.  If one walks into a house &mdash; and I am sure this is the experience of most Members &mdash; and there is an atmosphere, there is also a certain amount of tension.  I am sure teachers recognise that in their schools.  A happy home is not just a house, a tent, a caravan <Col N="670" /> or a mobile home, it is the people, the give-and-take in the family.  A home should be a loving, caring place, a refuge, a place we feel safe, where we are free to relax.  If there is tension between parents it ceases to be a home; it is a shelter where you are fed, if you are lucky.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this <Col N="671" /> very important motion has been on-going for a number of days.</P>
      <P>This morning I was dealing with the work and the research of the committee, and I would like to quote for the House from page 29 of the report which points out the anomalies and difficulties that the present lack of legislation and adequate resources is causing to so many persons and indeed families.  Paragraph 5.6 on page 29 states:</P>
      <P>Persons whose marriages have broken down may form second relationships, many of which are stable and loving and have many of the appearances of a marriage.  Such couples cannot validly marry and, looking ahead, under the present law, given that marriages will continue to break down, the numbers of such second relationships will increase and the numbers of children which result from such relationships will also increase.  The absence of any real legal protection for persons involved in second relationships has not deterred people from entering into them.  On the contrary, attempts are often made by couples in such relationships to put some legal or official face on the relationship.</P>
      <P>The examples they give are:</P>
      <P>1.  Persons domiciled in Ireland obtaining foreign divorces with one or both divorcees subsequently marrying another person and residing in Ireland with that other person as if married, in circumstances where Irish law does not recognise the foreign decree of divorce or the second marriage, and still regards the divorced couple as married to each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The obtaining of Church decrees of annulment or dissolution with one or both parties marrying someone else in a Catholic Church, producing the result whereby the State does not recognise either the annulment, disolution or second marriage and regards the annulled or dissolved marriage as <Col N="672" /> still valid.</P>
    <P>3.  A married person residing with another person, one of whom changes his or her name by deed poll so that both have the same surname and appear to be married.</P>
    <P>Further on in that page it says in a submission to the committee that the solicitors of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland stated:</P>
    <P>We are all aware of second unions being entered into and continued, with every appearance of stability and happiness, in which the partners beget and raise children.  While possessing all the appearances of a regular family, the second union does not have State recognition or protection as a marriage. When it is recalled that at least one of the partners to such a union has a living spouse with whom at an earlier date marriage vows were exchanged, then if the number of such second unions taking place was small, the norm of marriage as a commitment for life, come what may, could still be seen as a norm accepted by society in general.</P>
    <P>That clearly sets out what the state of play is in this area.  For anyone to suggest that these problems are not there or they do not arise is choosing to be completely blind to the issue and to the hardship, the heartbreak and to the unhappiness in so many homes.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt there is a widespread problem of marriage breakdown and marriage failures right across the country.  It is manifestly the duty of the people who are elected to the Oireachtas to think on this problem, to debate it and to strive for a solution.  For us to keep our heads in the sand and let on that the problem does not arise perpetuates a huge injustice on the thousands of people who are suffering, many of them unnecessarily and purely because there is a lack of commitment or a lack of legal remedies.</P>
    <P>A husband or a wife or a father or a mother whose love has cooled so much for whatever reason whether it is lack of communication, incompatibility, drink, <Col N="673" /> infidelity, finance problems, health problems, lack of work or indeed overwork, if they themselves cannot solve their problem with or without the help of marriage counsellors, inevitably find that the existing legal procedures and remedies are not ideal because they leave these people in an adversarial situation which brings out all the tensions, all the hostilities, all the bitterness and, of course, the recriminations afterwards.  When court proceedings, limited as they are, end with a separation or indeed a barring order, it only puts the problem on ice as people find that their married life is at an end. They then embark on a most unnatural phase in their lives where they are neither single or married.  This is an area where people would appear not to want to concentrate their minds and perhaps by some strange coincidence the problems will go away but it does not appear that they will.</P>
    <P>On the law of nullity the joint committee have dealt at some considerable length with this solution for some problem cases.  I had the opportunity of reading a very excellent book, <i>Marriage Annulment in the Catholic Church, A Practical Guide</i> by Ralph Browne, which is an English publication.  It sets out in great detail the grounds for nullity and indeed the procedures leading up to it. The one thing I find is that in the law of nullity of marriage the grounds for a decree of nullity would appear to coincide fairly exactly with what the ecclesiastical courts are looking for or what they lay down.</P>
    <P>The point that I, as an ordinary Catholic layman, find difficult to understand is that while the Church grants decrees of nullity the State on the other hand does not recognise them.  Yet the State recognises that most marriages contracted here are held in churches.  The registrar is the minister or the priest.  It seems to me difficult to understand how the State recognises the marriages and yet does not recognise the annulments.  On the other hand, it is another mystery to me how the Church which grants decrees of annulment is so strongly opposed to <Col N="674" /> the State doing what the layman perceives as the very same thing and what some people would like the State to do.</P>
    <P>When one mentions divorce one raises shackles everywhere.  If one could find a new phrase to cover it, it might not be as bad.  There is an area here which it is difficult for me to see the logic behind it. I hope that area will be tackled with goodwill and with an abundance of Christian charity.  The estimate of the number of families who are affected varies from 40,000 to 70,000, If we seek to look at the number of deserted wives the only figures to go on are those in receipt of deserted wives' allowances.  When the Minister for Social Welfare was in the House this morning I said that for every deserted wife who qualifies for a deserted wives' allowance in my experience there appears to be three or four in a somewhat similar category who for one reason or other do not meet the criteria laid down by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is difficult to get at the exact figure and it is difficult to see the size of the problem. Let us hope that an effort will be made to quantify the problem.  Certainly, there is no doubt in my mind that the number of people concerned is large enough to warrant some legal moves being made to ease the problem on those marriages and on those families.</P>
    <P>On page 33 of the report, chapter 7 on the legal remedies, the Joint Committee, speaking on the law of nullity of marriage, say:</P>
    <P>The law of nullity of marriage is concerned with the circumstances in which a marriage will be invalid according to the law of the State; it is not concerned with such questions as divorce (which is the legal termination of an existing valid marriage) or legal separation (which is also concerned with a valid marriage).  Nullity of marriage focuses on a state of affairs prevailing at the time the marriage is entered into and thus cannot be an answer to all problems which bring about marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>Again, in chapter 7, the joint committee set out very clearly the grounds for <Col N="675" /> obtaining a civil decree of nullity which render a marriage void, which are:</P>
    <P>(1)  Lack of capacity, prior subsisting marriage, marriages within the prohibited decrees of relationship, marriages to which &ldquo;an act to prevent marriages of lunatics&rdquo; applies, marriages between persons of the same sex and lack of age.</P>
    <P>(2)  Non-observance of formalities.</P>
    <P>(3)  Absence of consent, mental incapacity (insanity), mistake, duress and fraud.</P>
    <P>Then they go on to set out the grounds for obtaining a decree of nullity which render a marriage voidable which are:</P>
    <P>(1)  Impotence.</P>
    <P>(2)  Psychiatric or mental illness rendering a party unable to enter into or sustain a normal marital relationship.</P>
    <P>On reading through the book <i>Marriage Annulment in the Catholic Church</i> by Ralph Browne, the grounds would appear to be more or less the same except the Browne book certainly goes into great detail.  It sets out the problems in a very clear and concise form.  The divorce lobby and those who would like to see divorce introduced here have not much time for annulments or the concept of annulments. I would not like to see a situation evolving here where a couple for the least squabble could just walk in and get a divorce on demand.  No one in this House wants to see that.  But in situations where there is an absolute breakdown in a marriage relationship and it is obviously irreconcilable the State should endeavour to make it easier for couples to rebuild their lives.</P>
    <P>In chapter 8 the joint committee went to great lengths to examine the problems of mediation.  Indeed, in the recommendations they set out guidelines, if one could call them such, and advocate that there should be an effort made to ensure that for young people especially who intend getting married there should be a period of preparation before marriage.  They <Col N="676" /> recommend something like three months.  In most dioceses in the country the Catholic Marriage Bureau and the Church authorities have pre-marriage courses.  They insist on a three-month preparation period also which, hopefully, will be of great assistance to young people embarking on marriage and perhaps giving more care to the problems and giving themselves an opportunity to plan their future together.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that people who enter into marriage should think about the future, about finance, social problems, housing, employment opportunities, child care, education and so on.  It is important that it should be a state which people enter into after considerable preparation. After all, it is very important that marriages and the family should continue to be the basis of our society.  People should prepare for that state and, as a result of accepting that fact, the State should, whether by way of funds or by way of setting up structures, ensure that facilities will be available to assist people who contemplate getting married.</P>
    <P>Chapter 10 of the report which is a summary of the opinions of the committee, deals with the protection of marriage and family life.  It states:</P>
    <P>The committee is of the opinion that the State should ensure that a cohesive and comprehensive educational programme designed to prepare people for marriage is provided within the present educational system.  Anyone wishing to marry should have access to a premarriage guidance service, and they should be encouraged to avail of such a service.</P>
    <P>Most churches are doing something like that.  It would be a great advancement if there was a uniform approach to this problem, especially as a comprehensive educational programme can only assist people to embark and to establish as a strong, endurable and loving family unit. The committee also recommend counselling. The report states:</P>
    <P>The Committee is of the opinion that <Col N="677" /> an easily accessible and effective counselling service should be available to married persons, and in particular to persons who are experiencing marital difficulties.</P>
    <P>We all agree with that, but there is the problem of getting people who are in difficulties to admit it and to look for help.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to the introduction of a three month waiting period in Civil Law between the time a couple decide to marry and the date of the marriage.</P>
    <P>The committee recommend the minimum age for marriage be raised from 16 to 18 years.</P>
    <P>In their recommendations on marriage breakdown in relation to the environmental factors, the report states:</P>
    <P>The committee is of the opinion that there is need for a campaign of awareness to be launched by the State in regard to the question of the abuse of alcohol and drug abuse, including the excessive use of some proprietary antidepressant and other prescribed drugs.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia in her excellent speech a couple of weeks ago touched on this very topic.  She said that we have a national tolerance towards drink, the abuse of alcohol and alcohol-related crimes and nothing causes more unhappiness in the home than the side effects of drink.  The Senator described the whole scene as a socially acceptable national drug. I am inclined to share her view on that. In many cases experiencing marriage breakdown, the side effects of drink play some part in it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the fact of marriage breakdown in practically every stratum of society has to be recognised as a great personal tragedy for all those involved.  It must be a traumatic encounter especially for the families and the children.  Therefore, a marriage breakdown must be looked upon as demanding our concern.  It certainly is deserving of our understanding, our sympathy and <Col N="678" /> help should be afforded to all persons concerned whether they are young or old.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that we should ignore the plight of such families?  People who just blankly oppose divorce as a solution to marriage breakdown should consider the predicament of people with failed marriages from a more humane and charitable point of view.  It is all too easy for those of us who are blessed with a happy marriage and a happy home to adopt too simplistic an attitude towards couples in distressful situations.  We all make mistakes at one time or another and we should assist in effecting a reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Reconciliation is not always possible and the joint committee are very much aware of that.  Chapter 10, page 114 of the report, states that the legal remedies, in the opinion of the joint committee, should be of help to families in distress. Page 114 states:</P>
    <P>The committee is of the opinion:</P>
    <P>That legislation should be introduced to up-date the law of nullity in the following ways:</P>
    <P>Mental illness at the time of marriage which causes an inability to understand the nature of marriage and its obligations should continue to be a ground of nullity which renders a marriage void.  Mental disorder of such a nature as to render a person incapable of discharging the essential obligations of marriage, should be a ground of nullity which renders a marriage voidable.  A definition of mental disorder should be set out in such legislation in accordance with the principle discussed by the Committee in paragraph 7.1.21.</P>
    <P>That the following grounds should continue to render a marriage void under the general heading of lack of capacity in addition to mental illness:</P>
    <P>(a)  Where one or other party is, at the date of the marriage, a party to a prior existing marriage.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where one or both parties are under age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> (c)  Where the parties are within the prohibited degrees of a relationship.</P>
    <P>(d)  Where the parties are of the same sex.</P>
    <P>The Report also states:</P>
    <P>That a separate part of the church ceremony of marriage should be set aside, in which the civil aspect of marriage is clearly set out.</P>
    <P>That defective consent should render a marriage void in circumstances of mistake, duress, fraud, or misrepresentation, as are at present accepted under the law of nullity.</P>
    <P>That impotence existing at the time of marriage, resulting in an inability to consummate the marriage, should continue to render a marriage voidable.</P>
    <P>That the court should have a discretion to refuse to grant a decree of nullity where justice requires, on the grounds of impotence.</P>
    <P>That a grant of a decree of nullity should not render the children of the parties declared illegitimate.</P>
    <P>That the court should be empowered to grant ancillary orders relating to guardianship, custody and maintenance, when granting a decree of nullity.</P>
    <P>Then they go on to judicial separations. Quite a lot of work has gone into this in having the decrees and the grounds so clearly set out.  I think it is worth putting on record the committee's views on judicial separation.  The committee is of the opinion that</P>
    <P>irretrievable breakdown should be the one overall ground for the grant of a decree of judicial separation . . . the court should be satisfied that such a breakdown has occurred if the applicant proves one of the following:&mdash; . . . .&ldquo;</P>
    <P>They give a long list of grounds for a judicial separation.  This sets out the <Col N="680" /> problem clearly.  They have, right through their opinions, made it quite clear that there is a lack of legislation here which needs to be rectified.  I would hope that the Oireachtas would not just consider or debate this report in both this House and the other House but would decide to set the wheels in motion to effect an improvement in the present situation. It is fairly common knowledge that there are extramarital unions in every parish and town in this country.  Single people are living together, married persons who are deserted are living with someone else.  There are married people claiming to be living apart just to draw deserted wives allowances.  There are people who were granted ecclesiastical annulments and who have remarried, I suppose bigamously in law.  There are people who travel out to Nevada or some country where they can get a decree of divorce after six weeks' residence and come back and marry someone else.  I do not think that all of this can in any way serve the common good.</P>
    <P>The problem is certainly not one that is going away.  It would appear to be on the increase.  There is an increased illegitimate birth rate.  I suspect that in some cases misguided persons embark on this as away of life and look towards the State to give them preferential treatment for housing and other State benefits, whether it is maintenance or health care. All of this, of course, is at the expense of the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>At council level when we have a council housing scheme to allocate I think it is the experience of most councillors that invariably we have the problem of waiting lists.  For every batch of new houses there is bound to be a couple with a number of children who are not officially married but yet the council has a problem which they must face: do you house the people who are most in need?  It is a fairly drastic change over the last ten years to be confronted with a problem like that.</P>
    <P>While I am not against change I think the last straw is when people deny that it is there or do not wish to know that it is there.  I would hope that the law of the land would be able to meet the situation <Col N="681" /> of the day.  We should be up with the action and be able to deal with situations as they arise.  I believe that as the State recognises Church marriages, the State should also recognise Church annulments. How that is going to be brought about I do not know.  It is grave injustice to have people whose marriages are annulled deprived of the chance of starting another relationship.</P>
    <P>There is always the hope that people will find happiness and contentment and fulfillment.  Again in conclusion I would like to compliment the joint committee on the tremendous amount of work that they have put into this very comprehensive report.  It has not been easy because it is one of our difficult problems to which so many people would like to find the ideal Irish solution.  There should be a greater weighing of social justice: we should be more pragmatic in our approach to this whole problem.  There should be more equality and we should endeavour to salvage as much of the national ethos as possible and indeed to conserve our heritage from a legal point of view.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Catholic Church would move to understand the needs of the people and to serve the people in this time.  I find it difficult sometimes to listen to people quoting extracts from the Gospel, as though what was the norm in the year of 30 or 33 when Christ was alive should operate today.  Our obligation should be to meet the problems of the people today rather than think what they would have been like 2,000 years ago. From my point of view, I would hope that people, especially Catholics, would look at these problems with greater charity, to address their prayers and thoughts to the God of humanity and love.  If we say that our greatest precept is to love one another, we should try to implement that as far as we can in our statutes and in our law and not try to brush under the carpet a sore that is festering away and causing so much unnecessary hardship, tension and unhappiness to many thousands of innocent children who are caught in a desperate situation.</P>
    <P>I would hope that we would work on this and I support the motion.  I think that <Col N="682" /> the ordinary people are entitled to have their say in whether or not this problem of marriage breakdown and unhappy homes and impossible situations should be tackled or not.  I am sure that the situation can be improved: there is nothing impossible. If people find themselves, for whatever cause, in a difficult situation, there is no situation that cannot be improved by understanding and counselling.  It was interesting that last Sunday, in one of the English papers, I read of a survey on marriage.  It indicated that the number one priority was that there be more give and take.  That was a result that perhaps many of the commentators were not expecting to find.  I would like, finally, to compliment the joint committee on their work and I would hope that the people of the country would have an opportunity of giving their verdict on the work of the joint committee at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I wish to commend its members for the time and effort that obviously went into its preparation.  In the course of my remarks I wish to focus on three areas: the inappropriateness of the legal system, especially the courts, for resolving family law disputes and also to comment on the age for marriage and the permanence of marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some critical observations to make about the courts in relation to the problem of marriage breakdown.  It seems to me that the present legal system is intrinsically inappropriate for resolving family law disputes and should now be replaced by a new family law jurisdiction similar to the framework which we have for resolving industrial relations disputes. The most important aspect of family law is not so much the remedies which might be available to a party but rather the procedures which a party has to go through in order to obtain a remedy.  In this regard I warmly welcome chapters 8 and 9 of the joint committee's report dealing with mediation and a new family court structure.  Most litigants who have gone through the legal process and have obtained a remedy often report that the <Col N="683" /> experience was so harrowing that they would not have gone to court in the first instance if they knew what they would have to endure emotionally.</P>
    <P>Litigants in family law cases are to a great extent in a category of their own because, unlike other litigants, they must continue a relationship with one another after the court hearings have concluded. While their own personal matrimonial relationship may be over for good they nonetheless have to relate to one another over children, over poverty, relatives, friends and so on.  Before the terms of custody of the children are decided &mdash; I would make a plea on this &mdash; it is essential that material matters like money and maintenance are first settled; otherwise children may become part of the division of spoils.  Unfortunately, that sometimes happens.  The present family law procedures, it seems to me, can only exacerbate the conflict intention that exists between the parties in dispute with further adverse consequences for the children involved.</P>
    <P>The joint committee have obviously recognised these problems and have recommended reform in the form of mediation services and a unified family court which they propose should be called a family tribunal.  It should be pointed out that since 1980 two significant changes have occurred in the administration of family law.  In 1980 the State civil aid advice scheme came into operation. In May 1982 the Courts Act of 1981 came into operation.  Both of these reforms were designed to make the courts more accessible to the community at large and in particular to the less well-off. While the intention behind these reforms could be described as admirable and progressive it should nonetheless be appreciated that these reforms were introduced on the assumption that access to court is synonymous with access to justice.  Perhaps this is a false assumption, a myth which needs to be exploded.</P>
    <P>It must be said that since 1980 there has been an enormous increase in family law litigation brought about or faciliated by these reforms.  Many litigants have <Col N="684" /> obtained much-needed protection from the courts in the forms of barring orders, maintenance orders, custody orders and so on.  Many of these litigants would be far worse off were it not for the relatively easy availability of these remedies.  At the same time one must examine the procedures involved in the litigation and the effect these procedures have on the individuals in dispute, on their families and on society as a whole.  The social and psychological effects of an individual going to court cannot be underestimated. It is unpleasant enough for a person to litigate on an ordinary matter &mdash; for example, a claim for compensation &mdash; but to litigate over a family matter is perhaps one of the most emotionally painful experiences one could endure.</P>
    <P>A litigant in a family law matter is usually experiencing the most emotional crisis of his or her life.  The procedures that have to be gone through in order to obtain a legal remedy should be designed to minimise the emotional trauma and the problems caused or exacerbated by the present legal procedures.  In this context I want to return to the joint committee's proposals, which could be described as reforms as opposed to radical change. While the committee proposed that the new family court would be informal in nature and that the rules of evidence and so on would be relaxed, it nonetheless still leaves us with a court administered by the Judiciary and the legal profession. Is it not therefore somewhat misleading to describe the proposed court as a tribunal? What is really needed is a genuine family tribunal which would be inquisitorial in nature rather than the present adversarial arrangements and that it would be administered by a panel of people who would have a background in the social sciences, medicine and law.</P>
    <P>The committee's views and recommendations on mediation highlights how aware the committee are of the social and psychological dimensions of the problem. Perhaps what is really needed is a completely new framework for resolving family disputes and that this framework should be separate and independent from the Judiciary where law and the legal <Col N="685" /> profession will play a secondary role as in the case of labour-management disputes. There could be various elements to a new family jurisdiction such as reconciliation, mediation, conciliation services, arbitration services and a tribunal which would impose certain settlements.</P>
    <P>In chapter 8 the joint committee focus on mediation.  They favour a structure which would provide for the introduction of a third party who would intervene from a position of neutrality to help the parties towards an agreed outcome.  The committee lists several advantages in support of this type of independent mediation structure.  It would encourage the husband and wife to focus on the interests of the family as a whole.  It would avoid the bitterness which is often caused by legal proceedings.  It would help to reduce the cost to the State brought about by marital breakdown by a reduction in the number of court cases.  When marriage breakdown occurs, there is a need to have available almost immediately a crisis intervention centre pending resolution of problems between the parents.  There are some services available to meet this need but an expansion of such services is required.</P>
    <P>Equally, the independent mediation service envisaged by the joint committee would need to be regularly accessible. Such a mediation service would be available and should be available and used at a very early stage, preferably before the question of court proceedings has arisen. There are already some agencies in Dublin doing very valuable work in coping with the problems of marriage breakdown short of court proceedings. The Department of Child Health and Family Psychiatry at the Mater Hospital, the Child and Family Centre and the Marriage and Family Institute are excellent examples of this type of service to meet needs short of the court procedures. Likewise, there are similar agencies engaged in professional help in marriage breakdown cases in other Irish cities.</P>
    <P>The joint committee see no reason why an independent mediation service could <Col N="686" /> not interact with the statutory and voluntary services which I have just mentioned. The joint committee rightly stresses the necessity for each service to be autonomous and to have regard to the differing functions and goals of each of the other services.  The committee is of the view that the independent mediation service should be provided free of charge primarily because the resulting reduction in applications to the court would in turn reduce legal aid costs to the State.</P>
    <P>I feel that the views of the joint committee on mediation are most welcome and should be incorporated in a new family law jurisdiction.  It is true that certain matters of family law would have to be reserved for the civil courts, but only a residue &mdash; for example, petitions for nullity.  Litigants could, however, be left with the option of going to a civil court or going for mediation, arbitration or to a tribunal.  While there could be problems with regard to the enforcement of settlements coming from the new family jurisdiction, research in other countries has shown that settlements that are concluded after mediation or arbitration usually stand up much better than those imposed by the civil courts.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn briefly to the question of the age for marriage.  The joint committee do address the age for marriage in chapter 3.  Marriage is an adult relationship.  This implies time and space to live as a single adult before becoming a married adult.  Some years are necessary to find oneself as a person, to discover who you are and what you want from life: to know who is right for you as a married partner and the kind of person you are right for.  This inevitably raises the broad question of the right age for marriage and the place of preparation for marriage.  I fully support the recommendation of the committee that the minimum age for marriage should be raised from 16 years to 18 years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to turn to the question of the permanence of marriage.  People marry in the hope of sharing the rest of their lives together but because of their expectations of a deeper kind of intimacy <Col N="687" /> marriage now is less likely to survive without a satisfactory relationship.  It is personal relationship that will hold partners together now more than an impersonal contract.  Rather than a state which people enter, marriage is an inter-personal relationship which they bring about between themselves over a period of time.  The breakdown and break up of marriages force us to examine contemporary marriage.  The married state no longer guarantees permanence.  Marriage reflects what is happening in people and life generally, and so is influenced by social instability, uncertainty about values, the search for intimacy without the knowledge of the means to obtain it, the changing status of women, the threat for men of entering the world of feelings and many other factors.  Marriage changes as people change.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, permanence in marriage was supposed to result from the actual state of marriage rather than from the strength and closeness of the bond.  The phrase &ldquo;for better or worse&rdquo; was taken to mean that no matter what happened, no matter how harmful or destructive the marriage, partners must stay together. Now we can understand it to mean that when husband and wife truly relate they will stay together in poverty, in sickness, in health and wealth.  The bond between them will hold, for it is an inner bond of love rather than an outer bond of law.  I welcome, therefore, the emphasis placed by the committee on the importance of preparation for marriage.  I also share the committee's view that prevention of marriage breakdown would be considerably improved by increasing the level of awareness of persons contemplating marriage as to the true nature of marriage. The services designed to prepare people for marriage would and should emphasise an understanding of the nature of marriage, the key importance of communication in marriage and an understanding of the responsibilities and obligations which arise from being married.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again wish to welcome the report and feel that as a consequence of its publication we are all that much <Col N="688" /> more enlightened about the many facets to the problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be fairly brief because it bothers my mind to listen for long periods of time to the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown chapter and verse being put into the record.  That is not my intention. The Labour Party case has been put very well by people like Senators Mary Robinson and Michael D. Higgins.  Legislators in the past have allowed children to marry and enter into contracts.  In many cases, because they were children anyway, they were unable to form what Senator Hillery calls adult relationships i.e. marriage. They made a mistake.  The State has a responsibility, not the church.  Sometimes it is difficult to know whether one is in Maynooth or the Seanad of the Houses of the Oireachtas when one listens to some of the contributions.  The State has an obligation to address problems concerning the citizens who have elected them to these Houses to make laws for them.  The Church is a separate thing altogether.  In some cases we are talking about children who have made mistakes.</P>
      <P>It would appear from some contributions that the only people seeking divorce are those who suffer from drink problems or who are slightly insane.  The reality of the situation is that thousands of ordinary, sane and sober people have come to a conclusion that their relationship with husband or wife has come to an end.  They want to conclude it in as decent and civilised a fashion as possible.  The State and the Government have an obligation to assist those people in any way possible in trying to bring about that civilised cessation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties published a book entitled <i>The Case for Divorce in the Irish Republic</i> by William Duncan.  It is interesting to go back to see how the Article in the Constitution prohibiting divorce came into being and whether in fact it created as much fervour and fever as it appears to create now.  I would like to quote from the introduction <Col N="689" /> to his book where he quotes the Constitution and says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this short and uncompromising sentence, part of a lengthy Article designed to protect the family, the 1937 Constitution introduced what has become known as the ban on divorce. Its birth was hardly dramatic.  When placed before the Dáil it provoked no real debate and attracted only the smallest of audiences.  During the debate in Committee on Article 41 a count had to be taken twice to see whether a quorum of twenty Deputies was present.  An attempt by Deputy Dr. Rowlett to open up a general discussion of whether divorce might in the case of a marriage which had failed beyond hope, serve a useful purpose, was dismissed by Mr. De Valera as unnecessary because, in his view, the evil of divorce was obvious from the experience of other countries.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we were to open out a broad discussion on the matter, it would, as I understand it, only lead to one result and it would not be useful to enter it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the introduction of that Article did not attract the same attention as our efforts to remove it &mdash; or at least the same fervour.</P>
    <P>The whole debate so far has centered around whether divorce will undermine marriage as an institution, undermine the family and, if you like, damage the social fabric of society.  I again quote from Duncan's book, page 52, where he says:</P>
    <P>Does divorce cause marital breakdown or is it merely a symptom of breakdown?  The weight of international evidence favours the second view and suggests &mdash; to use a macabre but apt parallel &mdash; that divorce bears the same relationship to marital breakdown as does a funeral to the fact of death; divorce is the burial ceremony for a marriage which is dead, not the cause of its death.  To deny divorce in <Col N="690" /> an attempt to prevent marriages breaking down is like forbidding funerals in the hope of eradicating the problem of death.</P>
    <P>That sums up my position on whether or not there should be divorce legislation in Ireland.  Despite what has been said about people who are well disposed towards the introduction of legislation and the repeal of the Article of the Constitution and who say &ldquo;sometime but not now&rdquo;, to me displays a lack of faith in people in general.  As one who wishes to see divorce introduced into this part of the island I am quite prepared to accept the verdict of the people in a referendum. I have no hangups about it.  Whatever they decide, as a democrat I will abide by it.  But to set up a committee which did excellent work, to debate the report of that committee here in the Seanad and then refuse to allow the people to give a verdict on it is a charade.  Within the lifetime of this Government the people of Ireland should have an opportunity to say whether they want to remove the constitutional ban on the ability of the Oireachtas to pass divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I did not wish to repeat the arguments put forward so aptly by Senator Robinson and Senator Higgins on behalf of The Labour Party. I wanted to add my own few words to it and to indicate that I will be supporting the amendment which calls for the introduction of a referendum in the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As has happened with every speaker, with the exception of Senator O'Leary who had minor reservations, I also would like to express my sincere gratitude to the committee for producing a very worthwhile report.  As somebody who is very much a lay person in relation to the legalities of marriage and marital breakdown I certainly found it very educational and very worthwhile in many senses, not least in that it set down for me in concise, clear detail and <Col N="691" /> in book form the various aspects of marriage, the legal and constitutional position, the family, the various advisory and protective mechanisms and services that we have, the problems encountered, the legal remedies, mediation, etc., above all the need for remedial action to be taken in relation to the updating of family law. I believe that the two years spent by the committee have been very fruitful and very worthwhile and that they have more than justified the various time extensions afforded to the committee by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Everybody to an extent is apprehensive about this debate, about the political ramifications and I, too, am apprehensive. I am apprehensive about the turn this debate has taken outside this House. Already it would seem to have many of the elements of the pro-life amendment campaign and laterly the contraceptive debate.  I sincerely hope&mdash;I know that I re-echo the sentiments of the vast majority of people involved in political and private life&mdash;that this debate will transcend &mdash; if ever a debate should &mdash; political self interest and party political gain and that the source of the dimensions can be debated rationally on their own merits.  Having said that, however, the early statements emanating from the various groupings seem to indicate positions entrenched more than ever.  I fear that we are once again about to see something of a repetition of the unseemly political brawls that were so characteristic of the two debates that I referred to earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within this House also there was reason for concern and apprehension because for much of this debate, apart from Senator Fitzsimons, we had an eerie silence from the Opposition benches until Senator Lanigan as Leader of the Opposition gave us his offering.  We do not know whether as Leader of the Opposition party in this House in fact he is speakng for the vast majority of the party but for my part I am sorry to see that he opened his contribution by scoffing at the aspiration of all of us, particularly in the <Col N="692" /> Fine Gael Party, that there should be all-party agreement, that there should be consensus.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the normal cut and thrust of legislation it is up to the Government to lead.  It is up to people to formulate their policies, their plans and their decisions, to go forward with those and to have them argued on their merits but surely if any area is above and beyond the ordinary cut and thrust of political debate it is the question of marital breakdown. It seems strange that a party that participated so fully in producing this report should, on the one hand, largely refrain from contributing and then, on the other hand, try to attempt, through Senator Lanigan in fact, to turn it into a political party issue.  People could justifiably ask, are there no Fianna Fáil supporters who have an interest in the problems of marital breakdown?  I sincerely hope that this debate will be got back on the rails again and that we are not witnessing in fact a subtle attempt to gain some practical political advantage at the expense of the trauma of the thousands of people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>Already the bulldozers are flattening the ruins of Mexico City.  No more sounds emerge from beneath the debris and all are presumed lost.  The city was torn asunder by the ripples of a vibration almost 200 miles away.  Mexico City we are told had no solid foundations.  It was built on the sands of a dried up lake so that when the test came it did not stand up.  So, too, with marriage as has been said on several occasions and indeed spelled out in the report, unless the foundations are properly laid the chances of it wilting and succumbing under strain and pressure are vastly increased.  I honestly believe that herein lies the root cause of much of the problem.</P>
    <P>This argument is very much sustained in the section of the report dealing with the age for marriage.  The committee found that the average age for marriage in Ireland is going down, that research proves that the age of a couple certainly determines and influences the eventual outcome or relative success, that young <Col N="693" /> marriages, particularly those in the sub 19 year age bracket, are considerably at risk, that these people applying for annulments are generally of an age younger than the national average, that deserted wives generally come from families where the age structure is particularly low.  The committee recommend&mdash;I go along with their recommendation&mdash;that the free age for marriage should be reduced from 21 to 18 but that any marriages contracted under the age of 18 should be null and void.  While I agree with reducing the age to 18 that is very much definitely the bottom line and we agree with that recommendation.  It is questionable whether somebody is, at the age of 18 years of age, mature enough to participate in a life long contract.  I honestly believe that the State has an obligation in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is sadly an increasing tendency to trivialise marriage.  I feel that precipitate marriages should not alone be discouraged but that something positive should be done by way of the introduction of a compulsory waiting period.  I commend, as Senator McDonald has done, those clergy who have refused to marry couples who do not serve them with the minimum of three months notice of their intention to do so.  I also would like to see this increased to even six months in the civil sphere.  At least some statutory minimum waiting period would reinforce the prospect of proper consideration of the magnitude of the step such people are about to take.</P>
    <P>One must ask here does the Constitution really protect marriage?  Article 41 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage . . . .</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court goes on to amplify this article by stating:</P>
    <P>The State will continue to fulfill its functions as the basis of family as a permanent indissoluble union of man and woman.</P>
    <P>What does the State really do to afford this protection other than placing a legal <Col N="694" /> bar on the introduction of the dissolution of marriage.  Only two pages of the report actually deal with the role of education. These are full of very worthy aspirations garnered from the various submissions&mdash; for example, the need for a structured approach to educating people for marriage, making people aware of obligations, rights and liabilities, the promotion of awareness, reflection and mature consideration by the parties concerned. The State's specific responsibility is to promote a system of education for marriage, the need for a fourth R in the curriculum, that is, relationships, the necessity for a pre-marriage guidance service.</P>
    <P>Can we honestly answer that these obligations and services are present to any significant degree in our educational system?  We are pitifully remiss in this whole area.  As currently structured neither the time nor the curriculum structure is set aside to deal with this.  In fairness to the teachers, who are often the whipping boys in this area, they have not been trained to cope adequately or indeed to have the necessary confidence to engage in marriage preparation of students which, with all due respect to the curriculum that is being taught for examination purposes, is the single greatest and most significant step that each of them will take within a significantly and relatively short period of time after leaving school.  It will be interesting to observe how major a role the whole preparation process for marriage will have within the report of the Curriculum and Examination Board commissioned last year by the Minister for Education.  Will the fact that marriage preparation and relationships do not qualify one for points entry into university be again relegated to a mere addendum to the report?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>The area of counselling is also dealt with in the report.  The obligation of the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provision of a comprehensive nationwide State-aided counselling service with trained personnel, which will be easily accessible to all married people, is emphasised.  One hopes that as a result of the recommendation in the <Col N="695" /> report this will come to pass and will be acted upon, together with the points I mentioned previously in relation to greatly expanded educational services.</P>
    <P>I spoke about these matters in the House, particularly when speaking on the debate on the Curriculum and Examination Board.  As I said earlier, it is questionable whether or not, with the minimum services that are available at present, the Constitution can honestly claim to protect marriage other than by way of the bar of prohibition on divorce. I submit that the statistics speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>However, no matter how perfect a society we may have, marriages will break down through absolutely no fault whatever of the participants.  That is why, as has been rightly stated in this House, the simplistic advancement of nullity as being a remedy is so&mdash;I will not use the term insulting&mdash;less than complimentary to so many people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  These people whose marriages have broken down would be the last to claim and would steadfastly refuse to accept that there never was a marriage existing in their case in the first place.  I admit the validity of the nullity provision where grounds for such exist and the further need to redress or regularise the situation whereby Church annulments receive no State recognition. One again is mystified, as Senator McDonald has said, why this whole area has not been addressed before now.</P>
    <P>The joint committee deserve our gratitude for highlighting the existing legal remedies and particularly the need to update and increase accessibility to them.  It draws, for example, sharp attention to the exhorbitant cost and the intimidating and too formal nature of our family legal process, something referred to earlier by Senator Michael D. Higgins when talking about the cost of defending a case of nullity, which will cost a minimum of £2,000 and indeed in most cases £3,000, well beyond the range of the average citizen.</P>
    <P>The joint committee have usefully <Col N="696" /> evaluated also the effectiveness of the 1976 Family Home Protection Act and, in particular, have drawn attention and commented on the manner in which the wife's interest in the family home is inadequately protected by this Act.  For example, there is the impossibility of proving that the spouse is intentionally engaging in conduct likely to lead to the loss of the family home.  Then you have the anomaly existing in that she can afterwards take action to claim compensation after the damage has been done whereas she cannot take action to prevent somebody who is obviously on the course to destroy or in some way remove the family home.</P>
    <P>We wish to thank the committee for producing an informative balanced document, a report which focuses on the fact that the vast majority of marriages are stable and that most people have stable relationships despite the statistics.  This should in no way make us complacent.  It should in no way cloud our capacity to act in the cause of those whose marriages are in difficulty and have irretrievably broken down.  Unfortunately, this whole debate has been labelled as the divorce debate.  It is about far more than that.</P>
    <P>I, for my part, have tried to address some other aspects of the report but, whether we like it or not, the question of whether or not divorce should be permitted is a very important element, indeed is the key element in the debate and is addressed for 20 of the 123 pages of the report.  The fact remains, as I said earlier, that marriages do break down and these people do form new relationships.  We have to ask ourselves if there is a need to accommodate and to give legal recognition and status to these new relationships.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am worried about the consequences of introducing divorce and I do not accept the view that it may not have the effect, particularly initially, of accelerating the number of people who would apply for the facility of divorce were it to be introduced.  The big question to be answered is whether this should prove the ultimate bar on the right to <Col N="697" /> remarry of the thousands of people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  Each of us has to ask ourselves this question until ultimate decision time when choice has to be made.</P>
    <P>The two motions differ only in terms of timing.  I am in favour of a referendum but only after a long and informed discussion. I use the two adjectives deliberately because I think the debate should be long and informed.  I disagree with Senator Michael D. Higgins's thesis that the Legislature should push ahead, which was a point made by Senator Lanigan, and should not wait for consensus. The whole purpose of this document, the whole purpose of the two years teasing out the various options and coming up with the various recommendations was that in this report we would have the basis for a whole new public discussion which would, hopefully, lift the whole topic on to a new unemotional and depoliticised plane.</P>
    <P>I am not saying, as Senator Higgins said, that there is a desire by this party to wait for a 70 per cent guaranteed majority before one would go to the country with such a referendum.  I do not share his view that by leaving it for public debate you will have a long, strung out, bitter and ill-informed debate.  If we rush in with legislation at this point in time we will have a short, bitter and very ill-informed debate precipitated by highly charged emotional arguments.  I wish that the people who want to see divorce introduced could for their own sake see that by doing so they are aborting the very issue and cause that they set out to propagate.  Legislation at this stage would only short circuit the ultimate goal of redress, some type of legal facility to enable people who have formed second relationships to be recognised by the State as having a legitimate right to do so.</P>
    <P>One noted yesterday that the people outside this gate from the Divorce Action Group when asked why they were there said they were there because the Seanad was holding up the progress of the passing of this document&mdash;again a misinformed and erroneous view.  Senator Robinson <Col N="698" /> in her contribution &mdash; one has to agree with much of what she said and what Senator Michael D. Higgins said&mdash;was scathingly critical of the Government for not leading from the front on this.  Surely we spend a lot of our time in both Houses complaining that there is not enough advance notice of legislation, that there is not enough dialogue and consultation and that things generally come into the House as a <i>fait accompli</i>, not affording the legislators ample opportunity to debate them.  This surely is one clear example where the Government are seeking to do otherwise, when we hope they will formulate views on the consensus that will emerge from the debate now taking place and about to take place in the other House.</P>
    <P>As I say, the motion and the amendment differ only in terms of timing.  I am in favour of a referendum, but I believe there has to be a long and informed referendum debate.  The time can be usefully spent in stripping down the misconceptions of decades and, indeed the misconception likely to be whipped up in this debate, that is, that if you are for a referendum you are automatically for divorce or, on the other hand, that this is a two-stage approach to divorce.  One has to admit that if the constitutional provision is removed the logical follow-up would seem to be the introduction of legislation to facilitate divorce, but not necessarily.</P>
    <P>I appeal for dispassionate, honest and clear debate&mdash;as I said earlier, a depoliticised debate &mdash; and I would ask that each political party leader would make a pledge that in all aspects of the debate no element of compulsion, implied or otherwise, whip or what have you, would apply.  I would not favour a referendum as long as you do not have general consensus in the three political parties.  I think it would be foolhardy to go ahead otherwise.  As long as any political party sit on their hands waiting uncommitted in the wings, waiting to ambush and exploit the personal views of their political opposites, we should tread wearily.</P>
    <P>I say to the advocates of the idea that we should have a referendum now, and to the sponsors of the amendment, that <Col N="699" /> they are unwittingly sitting back and prolonging the introduction of the legal remedy that they wish to see.  If we go ahead now we will have an emotional, supercharged, hyped-up debate and I honestly believe that would be in the interests of nobody let alone the people that we all set out to serve and to help in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. I think in the circumstances they found themselves in they did a wonderful job.  It is rather an emotional subject.  It was not easy to extract evidence in the way that the answers could be set out in layman's language and readable, if you like, so that Senators could get a grasp of it in order to make their contributions. However, they have done a good job there.  I possibly have one little reservation about it, that they have not been more positive about the question of dissolution of marriage.  The other point I would like to make in opening is on a remark that too much emphasis has been given to the debate on divorce, and I am not speaking about the last speaker; it was somebody earlier in the day.  In order to put that right I would like to read a few extracts from the Labour Party submission to the Committee on Marital Breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party does not seek to pre-empt the deliberation of the committee on a problem to which there are no easy solutions and which is the cause of very real human tragedy.  We believe that in setting before the committee the views of the Labour Party there will be a framework which is intended to assist the constructive deliberations of the committee members.  The Labour Party believes in the removal of the present constitutional prohibition of any law that provides for a grant of dissolution of marriage.  We believe there is a need for the introduction of a law providing for divorce in certain circumstances and we recognise the importance of other legislative and <Col N="700" /> social changes in order to strengthen the family unit, reduce the rate of marital breakdown and alleviate the suffering of adults and especially children involved.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Labour Party in their submission were not just talking about divorce.  While I will naturally be referring to divorce or cancellation or dissolution of marriage at various times throughout my contribution, I hope that I am not really hung up on the proposition that all marital problems can be solved by divorce.  On marriage breakdown there seem to be two conclusions: the conclusion on the one hand that we should not have divorce and, on the other hand, that we should have it but we should not rush it.  One of those conclusions will have to be resolved some way or the other.  The only argument then is when it should be done.  In my view the debate has got to a point when not only has the Committee on Marriage Breakdown been sitting for the past two years and hearing representations from various bodies but they have read fairly extensively and this debate has had a very substantial number of contributors.  That will be available also for consideration, plus the fact that when it goes into the Dáil a very lengthy and detailed discussion will take place, and by the time it has finished in the Dáil we will have provided ample information to the people.  It is a question of how we disseminate it.</P>
    <P>Something extra will need to be done on disseminating more information, but there is enough of it available and the people around who are in favour and the people who are against have enough to know what way they should go.  I would like to quote also from the Labour Party submission again just to make sure that we are not misunderstood.  Our submission went on to say:</P>
    <P>1º The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack. The State shall take measures to encourage adequate preparation for <Col N="701" /> marriage and to promote the stability of marriage.</P>
    <P>2º It shall be the duty of the State, in making provisions in cases of marital breakdown, to seek reconciliation between the parties to the marriage, to provide for the physical and economic protection of vulnerable family members and to afford a means for the disolution of marriages which have broken down irretrievably.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party urges the Joint Committee to give consideration to the proposal that the basis for dissolution of marriage should not be on proof of fault by one partner but on irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  We believe that proof of part of fault is likely to decrease the possibility of reconciliation and add considerably to unhappiness, particularly of the children.</P>
    <P>They go on to say:</P>
    <P>To this end we recommend that the financial provisions should not be confined to a narrow consideration of proprietorial principle &mdash; such as whose property is it?  has the partner acquired an interest by contribution? or in maintenance principles &mdash; such as, is there any reason why the husband should not fulfill his obligations to maintain his wife?  We urge the Committee to formulate financial proposals that will not be confined to Lump Sum Awards Income Payments, Limited Property adjustments.</P>
    <P>5.  The Labour Party urges the Joint Committee to undertake a comprehensive review of Court Proceedings to deal with marriage breakdown.  In particular it is suggested that Family Courts be enabled to provide a counselling and reconciliation service which will also ensure that due consideration is given to separation and financial arrangements before a judicial decision is reached.</P>
    <P>6.  The Labour Party reaffirms its commitment to the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy and requests <Col N="702" /> the Joint Committee to declare its support for measures designed to achieve this abolition.</P>
    <P>I am going on with this because it is very necessary to establish the fact that we are not just talking about divorce.  We are actually talking about the whole question of marriage breakdown, the problems it creates and the courses of action that are needed to assist in saving marriages and to deal with the question of marriages that have irretrievably broke down, to look after children and the spouses etc.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The Labour Party does not seek divorce as the only, or best solution to difficult and troubled marriages.  A divorce law which makes divorce easy to come by will add to the problem of marriage breakdown rather than help to deal with it.  However, any approach to the problem which ignores the real pressures which have led to the alarming increase in the rate of marriage breakdown cannot be said to be addressing the real problems, but merely the sysmptoms.</P>
    <P>The law which the Labour Party would support therefore is one based on the concept of irretrievable breakdown. Such a law would place a heavy onus on the petitioner for divorce to establish that irretrievable breakdown has indeed occurred and an equally heavy onus on appropriate agencies of the State to ensure that acceptable efforts at reconciliation have been tried and failed.  The Labour Party urges the Joint Committee to commit itself at an early date to the removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce. We suggest to the Committee that this would be achieved best by the deletion of the present provision but by substitution of terms similar to the following:</P>
    <P>Then they go on to give the working of the thing which I have not got to hand. The Labour Party submission went on to say:</P>
    <P>We urge the Committee to review the provisions of the Matrimonial <Col N="703" /> Causes (Ireland) Act 1870, with the objective of reforming the procedure for the granting of a judicial separation (divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>).  The Labour Party urges the Joint Committee to consider and propose a definition of what might constitute &ldquo;Irretrievable Breakdown&rdquo;.  We suggest to the Committee that this definition would include (a) desertion; (b) a substantial period of separation; (c) inability to live together consequent on adultery; (d) inability to live together consequent upon conduct.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party suggests that the Joint Committee would recommend that the question of joint ownership of the family home should be considered in the context of legislation to provide for the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that the approach of the Committee to the consideration of Financial Provisions in cases of marital breakdown should seek to place the partners, in so far as it is possible, in the financial position in which they would be if the marriage had not broken down.</P>
    <P>I want to apologise for being a little bit hesitant reading that.  It is a photostat copy which was not very clear.</P>
    <P>I merely started off my contribution by trying to get that on the record for the very purpose that people have suggested by their remarks, maybe not meant to be as damaging as I have taken them up, that the Labour Party is not interested in the question of the total issue of marital breakdown but rather have a hang up on divorce and that they are being pressurised in some way by the Divorce Action Group into going for it.  Everybody knows by now that the Labour Party, which was founded in 1912, which predates the State, has been advocating social change for a long time.  I will not say it was introduced in the seventies but certainly this question of the dissolution of marriages where there is irretrievable breakdown has been a hot issue within the Labour Party right throughout the seventies.  Before that it was on the cards <Col N="704" /> but it gained momentum in the early seventies and from then on it has been a regular feature of our policy year after year at our annual conferences.</P>
    <P>In trying to make some sort of a contribution I have to think about the question of why marriage and why divorce.  Perhaps a lot of what I am about to say may well have come across in the minutes of evidence in a different kind of way, but possibly to a great extent with the same meaning.  Nevertheless I can only walk my own path and put it in my own way, so that is the kind of a road I am going down.</P>
    <P>To open that part of my contribution I would like to say that to me anyway divorce and separation I can only describe as being a destruction of a mutually constructed edifice, that took a lot of effort, work, time and tolerance.  The marriage itself when it was being entered into has got to be looked at in the sense of whether there is permanency and reliability rather than just a marriage being entered into at first sight and without much thought.  We must recognise that the edifice has to be built together and the onus cannot be left on one particular partner.  It poses a couple of questions. Why marriage and why divorce?</P>
    <P>I do not think you can answer the question of why divorce or why marriage in total, but I will try anyway.  In the case of marriage it can be answered in the sense that if anything goes wrong with the marriage the children are protected legally.  That is to say, if divorce occurs or separation and one partner dies not having made a will a certain amount of financial security is afforded to the wife who, despite changes in the law, is still able to claim maintenance.  The demand for as long as ye both shall live calls for a lot of compromise and greater unselfishness than many of us are capable of giving.  Yet many people who are adult and mature enough enter into marriage with this in mind and it works in a great many cases.  It calls for a lot of compromise and great unselfishness that many of us just do not possess.</P>
    <P>We could ask, why marriage?  It is the <Col N="705" /> old fashioned ideal of an exclusive one-to-one relationship which is very much in keeping with tradition.  There are hundreds of thousands of marriages that can and do succeed throughout a lifetime. No doubt those marriages carry great satisfaction with them.  They carry the satisfaction of living with a permanent sexual partner who is both attractive and capable of sharing the sexual experiences in a mutually satisfying way.  There are other good reasons too why marriages succeed, for example when people get satisfaction from giving rather than just being takers.  These two factors seem to be the two main motivations for entering marriage.</P>
    <P>This is where the work of building the edifice comes in.  The longer the one-to-one mutually sexually satisfying experience remains, the more compromise becomes possible.  Besides the sexual benefits we spoke of there is the basic instinct of being satisfied when setting up a home.  No matter how frugal that home may turn out to be, it will be a home that will have signs of a happy shared experience, depending on the people's likes.  For example, toys and souvenirs give pleasure to some people who are sharing a happy experience.  This type of marriage results from living for each other.  Again, and many people mentioned it here in a different way, there is the blessing of the Church which most people following tradition in Ireland would always want.</P>
    <P>Why divorce?  Even though we have tens of thousands of marriages which are very happy none of us in this House would cod ourselves that there are not tens of thousands of marriages that have broken down.  There may be arguments as to the extent or the degree and how many of them would be at a stage where they could be rescued.  We are talking about a substantial number of broken down marriages.  We cannot just think of the happy marriages alone or the ones that it is possible to rescue.  The one that brings about the most difficulty is the one that has irretrievably broken down.  It is understandable then that people should <Col N="706" /> put more emphasis on this kind of marriage in a debate of this nature.  Having regard to my earlier remarks about the Labour Party's submission I trust that the House will not take it that that is all we are actually concerned about.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for marriage breakdowns.  The committee got them. There is the ill-matched relationships.  Ill-matched relationships do not always lead to hate and bitterness and brutality.  They just do not work; the people cannot live together; they are ill-matched.  On the other hand, in the case of many ill-matched relationships whether there is brutality or not, it is the beginning of the end of a marriage unless the people within that marriage are able and adult enough to be counselled and reconciled, depending on the stage to which it has got.  If it is an ill-matched marriage from the beginning then it is only a matter of time before the marriage gets into trouble and it would seem to me that in many of those cases it never was possible for the marriage to succeed in the first place.  It certainly was not possible to build an edifice in the manner I was speaking about where there is a mutual surrendering of rights, where there is co-operation and understanding, a giving rather than a taking, because if people are ill-matched it is unlikely that the necessary ingredients that I have just mentioned ever existed.  Consequently the marriage was bound to run into some difficulty.</P>
    <P>There are many other reasons to account for irretrievable breakdowns in marriage.  There is chronic ill-health, teenage unemployment, redundancy, the influence of the media.  Those are only some of the many contributory factors. There is the argument put forward that ease of achieving divorce, which has been mentioned here, increases the numbers seeking divorce.  It would be true to say that it would augment it.  The Labour Party recognise in their submission that it would augment the numbers.  I do not think it is an argument to suggest that it would actually cause a divorce to come about.  After all, the divorce is merely the legal termination of a contract.  It is not the cause of it.  Consequently, people who <Col N="707" /> have been living in a miserable existence throughout their lives because there was no &ldquo;out&rdquo; for them and who could not insulate themselves against the problems of the world may, if divorce comes about, find an opportunity.  Thay may augment the figures.  But that would not have been the reason for the divorce to be brought about.  The marriage was cancelled. People were living not in a postponed state but in a state where they had cancelled each other out and no marriage existed.</P>
    <P>There is also the argument that if the contract is terminated by divorce some people will not try so hard to preserve the marriage.  This debate is all about trying to find out why some marriages break down in Ireland and what the remedies are.  I am not talking about Irish remedies.  I am talking about remedies. In the long run if something is as irretrievable and facts are put forward which prove this then the position is not longer just a breakdown: something has been cancelled out of the lives of people; it is no longer a union.  All that holds it up is that there is no law there to provide for the divorce by which the spouse can be assured of maintenance, the children protected etc.  In the context I have so far used one could say that no edifice was ever built.  Maybe they began to try and build an edifice or something.  When no marriage exists obviously no edifice has been built.  The reasons for the breakdown must be gone into in greater depth.</P>
    <P>The committee have gone a good distance in stating some of the problem, not all of it, before us.  We are very glad of that and this facilitates this type of debate.  I trust it will facilitate the debate in the Dáil even further.  We can talk about all sorts of causes.  We can talk about sexual incompatibility, about resentment and frustration.  One partner might still be as keen for the sexual side of the marriage at 50 as they were at 20, whereas the other party could well have never felt too keen and by the age of 50 might consider himself or herself exempt.</P>
    <P>Therefore, all sorts of problems arise and can be contributory factors.  It may <Col N="708" /> not lead to marital breakdown.  In that sort of a relationship there is always the danger of fake enjoyment and consequently living a lie.  When you live a lie within a union that is supposed to be co-operative, supposed to be giving of yourself rather than taking, that will inevitably lead to frustration and humiliation. It may be the husband who is frustreated and humiliated.  The wife, then, will take on distress and anxiety or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>It might have been easier for me to say that where mental cruelty exists it will lead to the breakdown of marriage, but that would not be satisfactory.  There are many forms of physical and mental cruelty.  There is gross physical abuse; there are heavy fisted partners who do not normally fit in with the normal pattern of abuse but abuse their spouses in a different way.  There are alcoholics who might beat each other up but yet dote on each other and it would not make grounds for divorce.  The problem in that particular situation would arise where one of the spouses found some other sort of weakness, something that had been concealed for years and was then exposed, which would hurt the other partner more than the actual thumping they might have been giving each other over the years. This might be another area that might lead to the question of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I submit that divorce is destructive.  It should only be used in dire necessity and certainly never casually.  It is the destruction of something that has been mutually constructed.  In the first instance we must take particular note that the edifice that was supposed to be built, which took a great deal of tolerance, effort, understanding and adjustments, just never got to that particular point and therefore never existed.</P>
    <P>We have already asked why people marry.  We now have to try to find out why marriages get to the point of breakdown and then continue this process of deduction to understand why a substantial number of marriages become what I would describe, based on some of the case histories that I had the privilege of <Col N="709" /> looking at as a dungeon, and from there to proceed to provide an opportunity for those in that dungeon-like situation to be given a second chance.  I would like to talk about simpletons &mdash; I do not say that in a derogatory way &mdash; about love, sex and marriage.  They are very often deluded into believing that there is somewhere a fated, predestined mate, that it is a reality and that they have just to wait around for this love at first sight.  These people are carried away with these super-romantic notions.  They do not realise that entering into marriage is a serious matter, that it is only for emotionally mature people.  There is no full recognition by the simpleton of love, sex and marriage, that it is a serious business. It is not for people with super-romantic notions.  When I say that I mean those people who would be carried away by the movie model of so-called romance.</P>
    <P>Again, without being derogatory, these simpletons about love, sex and marriage have not a notion that love of a real adult kind is of slow growth, it is difficult and one could even say that it is rare.  In their own immaturity many of them think that it can happen of itself.  Therefore, we have in this category many people who enter into marriage without understanding that if they want a life of love which has real value, they have to build it together by mutual care and effort; it has to be created, fitted and tailored to the needs and well-being of both parties.  I do not want to over-use the word &ldquo;simpleton&rdquo; but when I was running the streets of Dublin it was a word which was used regularly.  In my experience there are simpletons about love, sex and marriage who have not the maturity to understand the two-sided nature of marriage which calls for a joining in a co-operative venture.</P>
    <P>All of what I have said so far points to the need for the giving of evidence by both parties of their own fitness in the courting or pre-marital stage of their lives.  I am not suggesting that if they follow this guidance or listen to this point of view or even this debate, that there will never be any hitches, but where hitches <Col N="710" /> occur, if they have taken the proper precautions of pre-judging and getting enough detail about fitness and permanence in both parties, then the chances of getting over problems in marriage would be much greater.  The early knowledge and experience gained would stand to their benefit to resolve their difficulties, even if those difficulties came to the question of divorce, where it could be by mutual consent and in harmony rather than the drastic ways in which some marriages end up.</P>
    <P>I mentioned looking for permanence before marriage but you can also get fooled.  I am not suggesting that if you do this nothing can go wrong.  In the pre-marital days if one spouse-to-be wants to capture the other he or she can put on fairly good performances.  Many of the old habits are shed because they realise the person they want to tie up just will not wear it.  Suddenly they shed these habits during the courting period.  After a couple months of marriage the old habits of self-indulgence start once more. Again, we can put it down to some immaturity. Most of us would agree that emotionally mature adults will, in fact, be on the look out for this sort of preliminary assurance and evidence from each other and the ability to be co-operative.</P>
    <P>We were talking earlier on about love and marriage.  There are many people who are carried away by thoughts of a temporary change and excitement.  This is interpreted as love.  People who enter marriage on the basis of those feelings enter on the basis of the heart.  They never come to realise that it is a heart and brain operation.  I do not know whether those particular things can be remedied by having pre-marital courses.  That does not mean that you cannot do a great deal in pre-marital courses.  I would be an advocate of them.  I always have been.  In this modern age if you get a lunatic who believes that somebody is fated to met him and that he is going to live happily ever after without knowing very much about her, then I do not think there is much hope for a counselling service or a pre-marriage course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" /> There is a major role for counselling in many aspects in marriage breakdown. People of immature nature do not pay much attention to the idea that marriage is more giving than taking.  They do not realise that it is an attitude in terms of your mate being more precious than yourself.  They do not realise that even if they enter into a marriage they have to go about it this way.  I would not suggest for one moment that this is an easy thing to achieve, but it is part of adulthood and it is not for the immature.  The immature people certainly would not complement each other, which is what marriage is all about.  I mean &ldquo;complement&rdquo; in the sense of for long term purposes and in the sense of making them more complete people. That is the context in which I made that point.  Those who believe in the romantic movie notion and act on that notion are uninformed about the fullest possible meaning of marriage.  They will always fall into the trap of opting for change and excitement.  They will always go for the temporary whirl.  They need a lot of help, guidance and assistance.  They are more prone to fall for the glandular excitement, which is a very far distance from working in co-operation and using constructive imagination to build a good marriage. It is certainly a far cry from searching for the fitness and permanence that were referred to earlier on before they make the commitment.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, I do not think there is any such thing as a mate being fated for you.  You have to work and build a marriage.  You have to understand how adult and mature each partner is before you enter into marriage.  I would submit that it is possible to see someone, for example, that would immediately excite you, even to the extent of believing that you could, in fact, say &ldquo;here is a possible mate&rdquo;.  It is known that some perfect marriages result from that.  We should be honest with ourselves, and say that whilst it is quite clear that this does happen it is also quite rare.  Where it does happen I would suggest that if that does happen the qualities that go to make up a marriage to which we have referred to earlier on in <Col N="712" /> this contribution must have existed in the first place.  There is no doubt that they had a blend of values of a physical and mental character, backed up with personality. That is what was there when this particular type of love at first sight lasted. It is obviously there.  It was present.</P>
    <P>Our difficulty is that we will always have irretrievable breakdown of marriage. Therefore, it is essential to go into it in great depth.  It is also essential to have a look at why marriages break down and to try to understand the type of people who are liable to walk into marriage breakdown.  Obviously, I cannot cover every one of them.  Many other Senators have, in fact, dealt with that.  I have to keep emphasising this because I have witnessed so much of it.  Naïve people do not understand the gravity of entering into marriage contracts.  They are either over-optimistic, or over-trustful. They have no idea of the deadly trap that they can actually fall into.  It would be offensive if you said it in another forum on another subject, but their own tender-mindness causes them to tread paths that are treacherous.  If they are not treacherous when they set out on them they become treacherous because they have not examined the whole position in detail, as we have explained. What happens when they find themselves in such a situation is that they start stumbling into pits of trouble within the marriage until, finally, the trap they have walked into &mdash; a deadly trap &mdash; becomes not just a bad marriage but a dungeon. It takes on all the misery that goes with a disturbed mind with nowhere to escape. They cannot isolate themselves or insulate themselves and consequently the mental and physical torture they go through is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>Apart from the naïve and those who go overboard on their impulses instead of waiting for more details and confirmation, there are many other reasons for marriages breaking down &mdash; some say breaking-up but breaking down is what we are dealing with &mdash; which have, as I said, been dealt with by other Senators. It is worth mentioning or repeating what some of them have said, or maybe say, <Col N="713" /> in a different way.  We have got to ask ourselves how many irresponsible people of low-grade character of a criminal tendency, who are morally defective and unscrupulous, enter marriages possibly in many cases knowing well that they are going to get the best deal out of them. They can manage to fool the other party for the time being.  They are obviously a dead loss.  The low-grade character type is a dead loss from the outset.  I will not go over the position of people who marry in the first flush of emotions.  We have discussed that.  There are other types and it is debatable whether, in fact, pre-marital courses could assist them.</P>
    <P>I would just make this point about pre-marital courses in the context of trying to get it across that no matter whether you have pre-marital courses, counselling services or anything else the question of marriage irretrievably breaking down is with us.  It has been with us and it is going to stay with us.  There are others who enter into marriage, who could be described as chronic drifters who do not need any fixed roots.  They do not need children because of their particular selfishness.  They do not want children.  If children arrive, children need roots.  Such people do not mind having the pleasure but they do not want the responsibility of children.  They have no regard to the roots that the children need.  The drifter could not care less.  That kind of guy would be very hard to talk to in any pre-marital courses.</P>
    <P>There are families who may slave and live in misery for the sake of trying to do something for the children for years on end and not look for an escape, not fully understanding that the possibility is that children might, in fact, be better in a one-parent situation.  Getting back to the question of the alcoholics, much has been said about the alcoholic and the compulsive gambler and the misery that he causes the family as a whole.  I did not hear all of the debate but I am sure someone dealt with alcoholism.  As regards alcoholics, we have the dipsomaniac.  I am talking about the guy who indulges in bouts of drinking and then pulls out and tidies himself up and gets right.  We would <Col N="714" /> call them controlled alcoholics.  When the full responsibility of what they are doing hits those people, they can, in fact, be counselled and brought back from where they have been doing damage in the home.  The family can be involved in that counselling service so long as it does not come to the brutality stage where there is beating and hurting of each other, and the desperate burden that it imposes on the children of the marriage.  The alcoholic is not necessarily the person who breaks up marriages or deliberately enters into a marriage like the low-bred criminal person I mentioned.  The alcoholic may be genuine enough.  He just has this particular weakness when the problems get on top of him.  The only crutch he has is a few drinks which lead to a lot of trouble.  While it is not the main cause of marriage breakdown, it does lead to a breakdown in marriage.</P>
    <P>On the other side, nobody speaks about a lot of people pursuing careers at the expense of marriage and this can cause their marriages to get into trouble. I do not think we have to go any further than lifting the papers and reading about the types of people in this area who manage to get divorces as a result of this belief that their careers are much more important than their marriages.  Despite the ability of a person who might be money-conscious, he or she can, in fact, be immature when it comes to the question of understanding what marriage is about.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to show causes as to why some marriages had little hope from the start.  The dreams, ideals and romantic hopes about marriage are never enough to make a marriage.  Even if you cut those romantic ideals, dreams and hopes down to size, a lot of work still remains to fix the marriage.  A marriage is not going to succeed just because you start doing a bit of tailoring.  I am sure some people will understand from what I have been saying that my concern is with preparation for marriage.  If we examine this we can help people to avoid the likely pitfalls.  As I said no matter what pre-marital courses you have or what advice is available, there are certain types of <Col N="715" /> people you just cannot help.  They just drift into marriage and cause marriage breakdown and so on.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do about this and how are we going to approach it in order to see if such a marriage can be rescued. There are certain types of people whom you will not reach.  There are many people that you can reach in a pre-marital way.  The irresponsible will be irresponsible. They will not be able, and will not want, to deal with the double-edged factor.  You can have one naïve person and one irresponsible person entering into a marriage.  That is the downfall of both people.</P>
    <P>I do not think our problem in tackling this debate is just the fact of divorce. Neither is it the fact of equipping people or teaching people to equip themselves for marriage.  Before divorce became a reality or popular in England, America or anywhere else, I would like to know how many marriages had broken down? Marriage breakdown existed then.  It existed after divorce was introduced.  No end of counselling or pre-marital education can take this kind of factor out of our consideration.  The pre-marital courses serve people well.  I know many people who have benefited extensively from them.  It is a pleasure to look at how the marriages are working out.  I am merely talking about the person you just cannot reach.  When you cannot get to someone you have to deal then with the inevitable consequences of a marriage that is breaking down.  I am not interested in the one that is not irretrievably broken down, but the one that is actually breaking down, to see if something can be done about it.  I would have to emphasise the causes of marriage irretrievably breaking down.  Where that happens there is only the one way to let people out of their misery.</P>
    <P>The naïve, chronic alcoholic and the compulsive gambler are with us.  They are going to be with us for a long time. Despite our own best intentions to play some part in trying to help people as a whole, we are on to a loser in certain situations of trying to stop marriage from <Col N="716" /> irretrievably breaking down.  On the logic of that, you can only come to one conclusion. There is the conclusion by some people that divorce is not the answer. There is the conclusion, on the other hand, where a marriage breaks down irretrievably that divorce is the answer. There is a conflict of two conclusions. One of those has got to be resolved.  It can only be resolved by giving the people the right by referendum to change the article of the Constitution that prohibits divorce.  In this way one of the conclusions would be resolved.  As long as nothing is done in this regard the conflict will remain.  We should do this as soon as possible to give people a second chance. To do nothing about giving people a second chance would be to declare ourselves in favour of the wrongs and injustices we very often scream out about in other areas.  The public would be entitled to look upon us as regarding it as none of our business.  We live in the world of reality.  Irretrievable marriage breakdown exists.  The only remedy is to allow a situation which will give the parties to those marriages second chance for happiness.</P>
    <P>In all societies, American, English etc. there is a large amount of self-deception, evil, roguery, low-level emotion, greed, fear, self-seeking, prejudice, suspicion, anger, hate, jealousy, envy and animosity. With such a mixed-bag society we should stop fooling ourselves that we will not run into the situation where irretrievable marriage breakdown occurs if we take certain courses of action such as good family courts, pre-marital courses, sex education and good counselling services. Obviously, there are many just, honourable and good people who enter into adult marriages which are very stable and good, but if you look at the various categories of people I have quoted it is reasonable to argue that most of these people will end up trapping either themselves or their partners in a dungeon-like situation, if they enter into the married state.  I do not use the word &ldquo;dungeon&rdquo; lightly.  The mental and physical torment, <Col N="717" /> stress and anxiety give the people concerned the feeling of being enclosed in a dungeon.</P>
    <P>Last week, I quoted from a poem I wrote myself about the South African situation.  I would now like to quote from another poem I wrote.  I cannot remember it all, but one line from it was &ldquo;I did not hear the sentence passed&rdquo;.  It is about somebody who is walking amid society. Everything is happening all around him. Buses are passing by him and trains are running overhead but he is trapped within his own mind through his marital problems and difficulties and he just did not hear the sentence passed.  I will probably use the full text of that poem on another occasion.</P>
    <P>With such a mixed-bag society you cannot trust people to be completely unselfish and dedicated to good, honourable conduct.  To try to do so would be to suggest that in Ireland, as distinct from everywhere else, all our people are to be trusted to be completely unselfish, dedicated and honourable.  We are fooling ourselves if we think we in Ireland are any different from people anywhere else. It is worth mentioning that within our society as within all other societies there is friendliness, love, justice, courage, sympathy, social concern and responsibility. Generally speaking, there is constructive help available within the nation. But on balance, with the percentage of the other types I have mentioned, marriage breakdown is likely.  While there is a higher percentage of people who want love and justice and who are willing to be helpful and co-operative, there still exists a high percentage of the other types I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Therein lies the problem.  With such a high percentage of these people society will suffer.  Many people will, therefore, become victims of the destructive side of the marriages entered into by these people.  The victims of these marriages have to be treated justly.  Whatever action is necessary has to be taken.  A marriage which has irretrievably broken down has to be cancelled legally.  As legislators we cannot stand by and watch the vilest acts of cruelty and unparalleled <Col N="718" /> calamities being imposed on any of our citizens.  As I said earlier, we cry out very loudly about civil liberties being denied to other sections of society.  We also take to the streets on many occasions over denial of civil liberties and injustice in foreign lands.  We are right to do so.  On the issue of divorce we have a strong case for a civil liberty to be conceded.  The victims of bad marriages are trapped and on the brink of despair.  They feel themselves to be in a dungeon-like situation where a sentence has been passed upon them which they did not hear.</P>
    <P>Dialogue on the issue of divorce has been very substantial.  By the time the debate on this issue has been completed in the Dáil everybody should have a good grasp of the pros and cons of the situation. I do not think we will have any complaints and therefore the referendum on the removal of the prohibition of divorce in the Constitution must be undertaken within the lifetime of this Dáil.  To get justice done we must be consistent.  When we are crying out loud for other people we must also cry out very loud for the people in marriages that have irretrievably broken down.  We must cry out loud to have their misery ended.</P>
    <P>On this very emotive subject I do not think we should let our feelings run too far with the belief that divorce will somehow solve all of the problems arising out of broken marriages &mdash; I made that point earlier on &mdash; or that we can, by granting divorce, do away with the causes, because the granting of divorce merely deals with the effects of a cause and not the cause itself.  Quite frankly, having regard to the category of people that I mentioned who enter into marriages and what motivates them, I do not know whether in fact the cause can be got at. With the right structures and advice available, the right education, not only of the young people who may marry but of their parents, entering into marriage can become much more deliberate and considered. There will be more emphasis on what is needed in the marriage.</P>
    <P>Those about to undertake it if they are not mature enough, can, through a friend or a parent, be influenced to wait until <Col N="719" /> such time as they understand all the supplications. I think it would be difficulut to persuade certain naive types to do that &mdash; the rogue, the chronic drifter, the low grade guy with the low grade morals, the criminal, the guy who just wants to trap someone anyway.  I am not terribly optimistic about it overall but a lot can be done to give a greater understanding of what marriage is all about, what the effects are of entering into a marriage, the results it might bring and how it can bring people to the brink of despair.  That can be got across but I do not think all of the causes of breakdown can be dealt with.  With proper premarital courses, with proper counselling services etc., the problems overall can be made less acute.</P>
    <P>When I say that, I am not backing off from the idea that if divorce is granted it will push the figures up a bit.  I have conceded that point; but I have also explained that divorce is not caused by divorce, that it is merely the legal ending of a contract &mdash; the makings of the divorce would have been there anyway. If you add that to the arguments of the people who are naïve and the romantic and the simpletons who enter into marriage you can see that trying to prevent irretrievable breakdown in marriage, while it is a very noble and very good goal, is going to be very difficult indeed to achieve.  We certainly will not escape having to live with the idea.  Therefore, we must think of a referendum as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Why the referendum?  Quite frankly, if people are in misery it seems to me that the only thing that is available at the moment to rescue people from the chronic misery they are going through is the prospect of using the referendum as a starting point.  The situation will not cure itself, despite all the compassion and understanding and the concern clearly to state the problem by people of all parties. In my view, a good starting point, having regard to the amount of dialogue that has gone on, the agitation that has been going on for some years, and the dialogue that is about to come, is the referendum, <Col N="720" /> because all other things will run along side that and can be put into place.</P>
    <P>In the political arena I know I use some emotional terms myself but I do not think I have got into a way that I sort of let my passions control myself: I do not think that is a good way to make law.  In fairness to most of the Senators who contributed, they did not do that either.  Like myself they realise that there is too much at stake in this issue.  Either side, for or against, might lose as a result of a referendum but I do not think that that should be a consideration, if it is held in the lifetime of this Dáil.  We are not talking about a winning and losing situation; we are talking about the question of trying to do something about the terrible state of marriages in a substantial number of cases.  I believe the referendum idea is good.  It is a starting point.  I think it has to be seen that the compassion and understanding of the Dáil are there and that other things would go along with it, such as dealing with family law and family courts, counselling services and advice, etc.  That would all run together.</P>
    <P>Even if the advocates of divorce happen to lose out I do not think a lot would have been done to hurt their cause because the whole debate would be still open.  It would have taken a very substantial jump forward.  I would want to see the referendum winning &mdash; I do not mean in a winning sense but in the sense that it would release people who are living in this terrible hell and give them another chance of happiness.  No citizen should be denied that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical in making this statement.  There are self-evident facts on occasions when we are debating things in this House, particularly emotional things, where the clergy might become involved, where we are a bit concerned about our own particular constituency and how the people react or think in the area.  We are inclined not to want to admit to statements of truth that offend the sympathies of constituents or inhibit what is perhaps the hatred that exists in some of us.  I cannot judge myself: somebody else will have to do that.  I may be guilty in this respect but <Col N="721" /> we often force ourselves to deny the evidence, hoping to deceive others regarding it.  In a very critical situation like this that is not the way to behave.  The Seanad have given the lead in this respect and we have not seen much evidence of such behaviour.  I am glad of that.  I trust that it will not enter into the situation in the Dáil and that we will get a clear understanding of the position and will be able to put it to an early referendum.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of the two causes.  You cannot adopt one while the two exist and so we must have the referenda to deal with the two conclusions that cause conflict.  The more we &ldquo;hunk-er-slide&rdquo; on this question the more wilful blindness will be evinced.  There will be a lot of pride tending to conceal facts which are with us and will be with us.  I know of one or two people who would be prepared to live in the agony of doubt rather than look this misfortune of marriage breakdown right in the face.  Maybe that sounds a little harsh but I suspect there are one or two people who will take that road.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a misfortune that may be someone else's but we must face it and even if the least happy outcome emerges &mdash; according to my thinking being in favour of an early referendum and hoping that it will succeed in removing the constitutional lien &mdash; and the Irish people decide that divorce is not on, I would be prepared to see that possibility as I am now.  I am prepared to support the consequences.  Most people who are making similar arguments would think along the same line.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Labour Party in so far as the whole question of our consistency on this issue of divorce is concerned.  I mentioned earlier that in the mid-seventies the Labour Party took a position on the question of marital breakdown for a variety of reasons, pluralism, social grounds and in response to the real conditions of a social kind which existed because they were making it unhelpful to have a constitutional prohibition on divorce.  It was never suggested by the Labour Party that the removal of the constitutional prohibition <Col N="722" /> on divorce would lead to a solution of the problems where other remedies would be more appropriate.  Dr. Browne, when he was a Member of this House, made the point that the rights of the minority should not depend on the size of that minority but rather that rights have a validity of their own.  The right to dissolve a broken marriage is a fundamental right, he held, especially when the parties involved are suffering intolerable hardship and stress and bringing what would appear to be unnecessary strain on any children of that marriage.  It has become an accepted fact in society and, indeed, in political circles, that the changing role of women in society, coupled with new stresses due to economic depression, have lead to an increase in the breakdown of marriages.  Then he went on to quote an ESRI survey showing that over 50 per cent of the population favoured some form of divorce laws.  As far as I am aware, that statement was made in 1983 by Dr. Noel Browne.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Higgins, speaking in the Seanad said that the first point he wanted to make perfectly clear was the position of the Labour Party in policy terms.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the mid-seventies the Labour Party, not capriciously, but after a great deal of consideration decided overwhelmingly at their conference that they were in favour of the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce. That is the position of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The significance of these points made by Senator Michael Higgins is that they spell out quite clearly that the Labour Party supported the removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce since the early seventies.  They took this stand because they believed in a pluralistic State which would respect the views of all its Churches and, indeed, because as a socialist party they respected the rights of individuals to make adult decisions about their private lives and seek legislative redress from a marriage which had broken down.</P>
    <P>This decision was not made quickly or <Col N="723" /> without due consideration of the complexities of the matter, but rather after much discussion and careful examination of (a) social pressures which lead to marital breakdown and (b) the stresses and intolerable hardship which families had to endure once a marriage had broken down.  The Labour Party did not view marital breakdown in isolation but as one of the greatest problems facing our society not in the eighties but going back to the early and mid-seventies and it was against this background that they brought the motion on divorce to their annual conference where Labour Party Deputies voted overwhelmingly in favour of the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce.</P>
    <P>Here we have a situation where the Labour Party have been the advocates of dealing with this whole question of marriage breakdown.  They did not confine themselves to the breakdown of marriage at their conference, as might be taken from those particular quotations I have made from Senator Michael Higgins and former Deputy Noel Browne at that time.  Anybody who cares to examine Labour Party policy on social matters will find that the whole question of family law and such areas are well documented and are updated from time to time in accordance with the developments that are taking place in society.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Seanad that in 1983 in the Seanad Senator Michael Higgins stressed:</P>
    <P>The people have now indicated in the polls that they&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; this was after a poll had been taken &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; want a referendum on divorce. Indeed, one might add that if a small unrepresentative group of people can approach the leaders of the main political parties and get a commitment to hold a referendum on abortion, when there appears to be no need for one, why must there be such long and arduous debate on a referendum on divorce?  The opportunism of the main <Col N="724" /> political parties in giving their commitment for the previous referendum may be pointed out.  The Labour Party will be anxious that the question of divorce, which is a painful and stressful experience for adults whose marriage has broken down, must not become the matter of similar opportunism.</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from Senator Michael Higgins and I do not go along with the total context in which he put that particular quotation.  The question of the referendum on abortion was somewhat different from this.  The social implications are of a different variety and need much more depth of understanding from the broader point of view of the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am not saying what he said there is dead accurate but I am quoting it as an indication that this is nothing new to the Labour Party.  We have been advocating it for a long long time.  I do not see that the situation of the institution of marriage would be in any way affected by the removal of the ban on divorce by an amendment of the Constitution.  It is incorrect to link divorce with a lot of social indicators because I do not think in the course of the debate, or even in the report, that we have proved a great deal.  There are many social indicators that have not been tested and have not been proved.  They are never proved, if you like, from the point of view of saying the availability of divorce would have a certain effect.</P>
    <P>Our position is that we hear the figures that are bandied about: I do not know how accurate they are and I am not trying to argue that they are accurate, but we are talking about 70,000 adults, or so it is alleged, who are insisting on the removal of the consitutional prohibition on divorce.  The 70,000 would not be the influencing factor in my mind.  I do not know what the real figure is: I know it is a substantial figure.  Let me be quite clear that if it was 10,000 or 11,000 or 12,000 my argument would not be much different. We are talking about a civil right for a minority that are being denied it and the principle of giving that civil right does <Col N="725" /> not, in my view, become less in value if the minority is 10,000 rather than 70,000. I am not making the 70,000 as the strong argument, rather the principle.</P>
    <P>We have heard arguments about the irrevocable effect that divorce has on the family.  Again, there does not seem to be any real, certified evidence that divorce does any greater harm than trying to keep a very unhappy marriage together.  It could not do any more harm than that.  I have not got access to very many reports. The matter has been covered here in the Seanad and I am sure there are many reports that could be produced to show that severe damage has been done to children where people have fought in front of them and have insisted on sticking together.  Evidence of violence in the home is there also and I am sure there are reports about it.  My limited knowledge comes from looking at British television on which we have seen some very interesting programmes on this whole question of violence in the home.  If there is evidence of it in this country I am sure our sociologists have got hold of it and when I get time to read all of the debate it is likely that I will find some evidence in it that the violence alone is not something that is transmitted from family to family in each generation.  People have claimed that if the father was violent the son will be violent and his marriage would be affected by it.  There does not seem to be any real evidence about that.</P>
    <P>The question of what impact the children have on violence in the home and what stresses and anxieties the children take out on the parents also arises.  Again I would like to see some evidence on that and the role it might play in bringing a marriage to the point of irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote Senator Robinson now.  She said:</P>
    <P>The present law in this area is a disgrace.  As legislators, we can only be ashamed of our lack of attention on this issue.  The law in the broad sense, our family law, because of the absence of proper procedures and mechanisms, <Col N="726" /> proper supports and preventive measures and also the absence of a legal remedy for a breakdown of marriage which enables the parties to enter into a second-stage relation, is indefensible, discriminatory and oppressive.  It has been said, and it is true, that our family law, including our matrimonial law has now become the most complex in the world because we do not have any straightforward legal remedy to terminate a marriage relationship which is totally broken down.  We have very complex partial remedies and links between relationships and remedies which try to meet the complexity of human relations.  It is only lawyers, social welfare officers, judges and people involved on the front line who realise how complex ordinary people's relationships can be and how oppressive it is when on top of a considerable degree of human pain and suffering one adds the oppression of stupid, inflexible, rigid, uncaring, unfeeling and out of date laws.  The basic law in relation to legal separation dates from 1870.  It is 113 years old and it is totally inadequate.  It is a totally inadequate response to the problem of marriage breakdown and so are all the other remedies that are being referred to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, in this quotation I am not necessarily supporting Senator Robinson to the fullest extent that the only people that know all about the problems are lawyers or barristers.  If you come through life and have been dealing with problems of people over a substantial number of years you may not grasp the legal implications but certainly you will not lack the social concern nor will you lack the understanding that they need help.  You may, however, find a difficulty in trying to get the type of help they need but certainly I do not think it is the privilege of lawyers or anyone else to understand these problems.  This debate has shown that quite clearly.  When we get into the Dáil probably the stockbroker will be as good as the lawyer when it comes down to cases.</P>
