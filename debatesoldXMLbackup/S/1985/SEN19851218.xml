      <P>I have notice from Senator Mark Killilea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, through the Government to make proposals to the EC to agree to a change of status for all Connemara, Co. Galway, from disadvantaged area to mountain region.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  It is proposed to <Col N="976" /> suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and at 6.30 p.m. to take No. 6.  No. 6 is a Private Members' motion in the name of the Fianna Fáil group in regard to the question of teachers' pay, and in respect of this there is a Government amendment.  Events have rather overtaken us so that the division of opinion represented by the motion and the amendment has now been considerably narrowed.  It is not indeed clear whether it has been so completely narrowed that each of us could vote for one another's motions.  I would propose to the House that it would be inappropriate for us to complete this business and to proceed to a vote this evening.  Accordingly, I am suggesting that only one hour of the one and a half hours remaining be taken today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the amendments to Standing Orders relative to Public Business recommended in the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges (T. 273) dated the 11th December, 1985 be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion refers to a report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which has been printed and circulated to Members.  The effect of the adoption of this report would be to amend our standing orders in such a way that it places an obligation on any Minister introducing a Government Bill to provide an explanatory and financial memorandum which makes absolutely clear what are the charges arising from this particular legislation and also what are the standing implications.  We should agree to this because in this way there will be more information in the hands of Members, who will be better able to carry out their duties as legislators with this information before them.  I might indicate that this applies to Government Bills only.  In <Col N="977" /> respect of Bills introduced in this House by a Private Member, there is no corresponding obligation, so that in the adoption of this change in Standing Orders Members will gain a good deal and lose nothing.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say that we would be taking Items 3, 4 and 5 in that order.  There may be some difficulty over availability of Ministers and I take it there will be no objection if the order in relation to Motions Nos. 3, 4 and 5, was varied in order to enable Ministers to attend.  I mention it now in case anyone would have any objection, so that Senators can be alterted and watch the monitor.</P>

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> This is a short and straightforward Bill to provide for:</P>
      <P>(i)  an increase from 14 to 15 in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court for a limited period;</P>
      <P>(ii)  an increase from 12 to 15 in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  an increase from five to six in the number of Circuit Court judges permanently assigned to the Dublin Circuit.</P>
      <P>At the moment there are two &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges serving in the Circuit Court in addition to the statutory complement of twelve permanent judges.  Accordingly, in practical terms, the net increase in the membership of the Judiciary which this Bill proposes to effect will be one judge of the High Court and one judge of the Circuit Court.  I might mention that necessary support staff will be made available to the new judges but that is not a matter that comes within the scope of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> The temporary increase in the number of High Court judges, as provided in section 1 of the Bill, is necessary to clear up a backlog of High Court jury actions which is beyond the capacity of the existing judges to clear within an acceptable period of time.  Most of these actions arise from road traffic accidents and delay in these cases can result in severe hardship and stress for the plaintiffs involved. These delays have, for some time, been the subject of much public criticism and the Government consider that if a substantial improvement is to be made in the present unsatisfactory situation an extra judge is needed and the present statutory restriction temporarily eased.</P>
    <P>To highlight the seriousness of the situation it is sufficient to point out that the overall delay between the setting-down of a jury action and the trial ranges from ten months at Dundalk to 12 months at Dublin and elsewhere, with the exception of Cork.  The delay at Cork has been as long as 30 months but following special steps taken by the President of the High Court, including extra court sittings, the delay has been reduced to about 26 months.  It is expected that this will be reduced to at most 22 months in 1986.  I would like to say at this point that the President of the High Court expects that to be 18 months in 1986.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that there are other factors which may delay hearings. In many cases, for example, a substantial period may elapse before proceedings are set down.  Senators will also be aware that there may be delays in proceedings which are not attributable to the non-availability of judicial time.  However, the proposed increase in the number of judges will meet the State's direct responsibility in the matter.  I should make it clear, of course, that the extra judge is not intended exclusively for Cork or anywhere else.  When the extra judge is appointed, his assignment to help with the overall arrears situation will be a matter for the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which an increase in the number of High Court judges took <Col N="979" /> place was in March 1982 when the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1981, increased the number of ordinary judges from 12 to 14.  At that time it was thought that the increase, together with the enactment of the Courts Act, 1981 &mdash; which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for an increase in the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £2,000 to £15,000, as well as the giving of extra family law jurisdiction to the District and Circuit Courts &mdash; would arrest and contain the arrears situation in the High Court.  This view has turned out to be only partially correct.  Following the coming into operation of the relevant provisions of the latter Act, in May 1982, the volume of new business being entered in the High Court decreased substantially and if this trend continues it is expected that the present number of High Court judges will, in the longer term, be adequate to deal with the reduced level of business.  However, there is still a substantial problem as regards the level of arrears which built up prior to the change in jurisdiction brought about by the Courts Act, 1981.  There is no substantial spare capacity among the existing judges which could be utilised to make inroads into the arrears.  It is against that background that a temporary, rather than a permanent increase, in the High Court Bench was considered to be the best way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the date shown in section 1 (2) of the Bill, that is April 1987, was chosen because there will be a retirement from the High Court Bench on 3 April 1987.  On that date the authorised number of ordinary judges will revert to 14.  The automatic reduction in numbers will allow for review of needs depending on the state of work in the High Court at the time.  Should it be found necessary to continue the number at 15 new legislation will be needed.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of permanent ordinary judges of the Circuit Court authorised by statute &mdash; section 30 (a) of the Courts Act, 1981 &mdash; is 12.  However, section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, <Col N="980" /> 1936, authorises the Government temporarily to increase that number whenever it appears to the Government that such a step is necessary to prevent the work of the Circuit Court getting into arrears either generally or in any particular circuit or circuits.  Successive Governments have, over the years, found it necessary from time to time to increase temporarily the number of Circuit Court judges to cope with the continuing growth in the business of that court.  As I mentioned earlier the full complement of Circuit Court judges at present includes two &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges.  These appointments were necessitated by the continuing growth in the volume of court business.  The Government are satisfied that the business of the Circuit Court will continue to grow for the foreseeable future and that an additional judge to the existing complement of 15 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court, is needed.  The Government are also satisfied &mdash; and I am sure the House will agree with them in this &mdash; that in such circumstances it is unjustifiable that two judges should continue to hold office on a temporary basis.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for an increase of three in the statutory maximum number of ordinary Circuit Court judges.  I may add that it is the intention of the Government that the two serving &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges be made permanent so that only one new appointment will arise as a result of this provision.</P>
    <P>The increase from five to six in the number of Circuit Court judges permanently assigned to the Dublin Circuit is necessary to cope with the increasing volume of business there.</P>
    <P>This Bill is vital to the proper administration of justice and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome any move to ensure that there is a speeding up in the administration of justice.  The delays taking place from the date of the start of proceedings to the end of proceedings is too long.  Because of this people have lost confidence in the courts.  The situation at present in too many cases is that because <Col N="981" /> of the small number of judges and the archaic method of administration of justice delays cannot be avoided.  The only knowledge I have of this is from going down to the High Court which resembles a cattle mart, a fair, or a temple of Mammon rather than a place where justice is being administered.  People in gowns are running around, shaking hands with each other.  The only thing they do not do is spit on their hands when they have a deal finished and so avoid placing a particular matter before a court.</P>
      <P>While we have such a situation it does not mean that in the courts themselves, when people get there, they do not have a system of justice which is fair and seen to be fair.  For a number of years we have been privileged with the judges we have had in all courts.  At times it may have seemed that in the sentencing policies of various judges there has been unevenness. This has been a cause for public concern.  It would appear that some sentences were too light and in other cases too heavy.  The differing circumstances of each case have to be taken into account when one is considering what a sentence should be.  It is not fair that one sentence should be compared with another; each case has to be isolated; one cannot generalise in court cases.</P>
      <P>People seem to be going into litigation on civil matters more often now than in the past.  This is probably one of the reasons why we see such an increase in the number of cases being processed through the judicial system.  Why is this so?  Is it because over the years we have seen an increase in the monetary amounts being awarded by juries as a result of civil litigation?  I feel that if one were to analyse all the cases that were taken in the civil courts the legal profession were the only people to gain in the long term. We have the situation at present that not alone do lawyers receive fees for the work they do but in many cases they are now taking 10 per cent of the actual amount of money which is given to them in judgment in civil matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It all comes into the reasons why we have to increase the number of judges in various places.  The increase from five to six Circuit Court judges in Dublin has to be welcomed because there has been a much bigger increase there in the demand for Circuit Court judges than there has been throughout the country.  If the number of people living in Dublin were to be analysed it would be clear that this is the case.  In Kilkenny, when the court comes on circuit, there are two judges present whereas in the past there would be one judge sitting for a week in a particular session.  Now the two judges are sitting for one, two and possibly three weeks at times.  It shows the build-up that exists.</P>
      <P>When judges go on circuit they have to be provided with the accoutrements of their trade.  They have to be provided with courthouses which are suitable for the job being carried out and litigants also have to be given accommodation where they can sit down with their barristers or solicitors to discuss matters pertaining to the case.  In many courts throughout the country we do not have the accommodation for this privacy.  It is the county councils that have to provide the courthouses.  During the Estimates every year at county council level we have this problem that the Department of Justice which should be providing the facilities for our courts and judges are not doing so.  These facilities are being provided in the main by the Department of the Environment.  This is partly why we have such a hassle about the estimate for the county registrar's department or the department dealing with our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a critical examination of the whole system of justice.  That includes the situation regarding the numbers of judges and justices needed.  It appears that in the area of justice in general we are working under archaic laws and under a system of law which is archaic.  It may be good in that it has been impartial but the ordinary citizen has absolutely no doubt that it is archaic.  It should be brought up to date and the <Col N="983" /> Minister should address himself to this as well as addressing himself to the increases that are being made through this Bill.  By increasing the numbers here we should have some increase in the efficiency of the courts throughout the country.  I sincerely hope this will be the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what training a person goes through on his appointment as a judge, or prior to his appointment as a judge, or after his appointment, to ensure that he just does not carry into his practice his knowledge of law either from the point of view of being a barrister or a solicitor.  The fact that one is a professional in one area of justice should not be the criterion upon which one should base an appointment to another area.  Is any training given to somebody who is appointed, and if not, why not?  I presume that judges, just like everyone else, must learn their profession; they have to learn how to be impartial; they have to learn how to behave in a reasonable and sympathetic manner on the bench.  Too often we have seen, in all areas, cases in which a judge makes a facetious remark or who, in sentencing somebody, makes a remark in which he calls somebody by a word which should not be used.  A judge sentencing somebody should impose the intended sentence and leave it at that.  The imposition of the sentence is enough without the sometimes facetious and very hurtful remarks.  No judge or justice should be allowed to pass a comment about the personality or personal circumstances of a person being sentenced.</P>
    <P>I do not see in this Bill any provision being made for the appointment of a judge for a family court.  No mention has been made of the setting up of family courts.  This is an area which must be addressed again.  I sincerely hope that in the very near future we will see some attempt being made to have family courts properly set up.  At present we have Circuit Court judges dealing with family matters; they have absolutely no training in the sensitivity which is needed in order to deal with matters of family importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is relevant but I have been kind enough to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I have almost finished.  The justice is dealing with these family matters in the same courthouse and on the same day as criminal offences and civil offences are being dealt with and everybody in these courthouses knows that when certain people go in they are going in regarding family matters.  We need training for justices dealing with family law.  I appeal for the setting up of special family courts with justices, trained in family matters assigned to them.</P>
      <P>If this Bill does shorten the period during which people have to wait to have cases heard that is to be welcomed.  I hope, with the increases which have been granted, the necessary accommodation will be forthcoming for these extra judges and that the various ancillary services which are needed will not be impeded by the embargo on recruitment to the public service.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us how he will be able to provide the necessary staff in the setting up of these extra posts?  If it is intended that this extra staff will come from the present numbers in the Department of Justice it would appear to me that you are on a hiding to nothing from the start because anyone who is dealing with the area of justice will tell you that everybody in this area is at present working to capacity.  If people from within the Department are assigned to help these judges in various areas the numbers will be decreased in other areas and you will not get the speeding up of the process which is envisaged by the increase in the number of judges.  Increasing the number of judges is one thing but if they do not have the ancillary services in terms of people and offices it will not expedite the process.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister somewhat dramatically concluded his speech by saying that this Bill is vital for the proper administration of justice.  In making that statement the Minister suggested that the <Col N="985" /> passage of this Bill would alleviate the problems existing within the justice system in this country.  I must differ from the Minister because whereas I welcome this Bill, on the one hand, in that it recognises a need within the court system and will alleviate some of the problems, the Bill goes no way towards relieving the major problems which exist within the court system and which have if anything, brought the administration of justice in this country into disrepute in recent years.</P>
      <P>There are many problems within the court system.  I regret very much that we are not debating here today a Bill which would address in the broadest way possible the problems existing within the court system and existing within the whole administration of justice.  We have to recognise the fact that the court system, as we now experience it, was established in 1924, reestablished in 1961 and other than minor amending Bills for the purpose of increasing judicial numbers and doing other minor matters, very little has been done to change the court structure existing and very little has been done to bring it into line with the modern age in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when his Department should look very critically at the entire court structure which was established 60 years ago.  We still have by way of minor courts &mdash; if I can use that phrase &mdash; a structure that was established in the 1920s and which I would submit is no longer working.  I am referring in particular to the Circuit Court system with which this Bill is in some measure concerned and also with the District Court system which, while there is no direct reference to that in the Bill, nevertheless has a certain concern because, of course, appeals come from the District Court to the Circuit Court and they can have the effect of clogging up that system.  Once again it is necessary to examine the civil jurisdictions of the Circuit Court and the District Court.  The Minister's Department must take steps to ensure that many matters which come before the District Court and which take up a considerable <Col N="986" /> amount of time there are removed from the court arena altogether unless an aggrieved party wishes to bring them before the court.  By that I mean the ordinary summary matters, the thousands of simple road traffic offences with which people are charged every single day and which upon conviction can lead to appeals to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>These are matters which should not come before the District Court in the first instance unless the aggrieved party disagrees with the charge against him. If the aggrieved party disagrees then he should have the right to have his case entered for hearing before a judge.  Other than that it is a scandalous situation that district justices are spending many hours of every day in District Courts, in the city of Dublin and courts throughout the country dealing with matters which could be dealt with automatically.  I believe if their time was spared from that type of work, then an amount of the civil work which is currently being dealt with by the Circuit Court could be given to the District Court which I believe should have an expanded jurisdication.</P>
    <P>The whole structure of our Circuit Courts should also be looked at.  I do not think the appointment of one additional Circuit Court judge or rather the making available of power to appoint an additional Circuit Court judge will deal with the problem.  Certainly the experience which practitioners have of observing the Circuit Court in rural Ireland is one whereby overworked Circuit Court judges are dealing with a whole plethora of cases.  Our Circuit Court judges are men who frequently work until 7, 8 and 9 o'clock at night dealing with a vast array of work, dealing with many appeals from the District Courts, dealing with licensing matters which should not be coming before them at all, dealing with family matters in which they have got no particular expertise and then at the end of the day dealing with road traffic matters and equity matters.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a speech the Minister made during the summer.  I did not realise until about 20 minutes ago that we were debating this Bill today. <Col N="987" /> The Minister spoke during the summer about the need to reduce costs in the Circuit Court.  Of course there is a need to reduce costs in the Circuit Court.  The one way you can do that is by completely overhauling the court structure and by ensuring that people who come into the Circuit Court are not coming back to the same courtroom five, six, seven and eight times and turning up for two years and three years because their case it not being dealt with.  There are such delays in some of our Circuit Courts dealing with particular types of cases.  I refer in particular to cases on the equity side which are frequent, cases that cause considerable hardship and distress and cases which by virtue frequently of the professional witnesses who are necessary to prove them, can prove expensive for the litigant, and that expense can be quadrupled or multiplied many times if the unfortunate parties to the proceedings with their witnesses are dragged back to court time and time again because there is not time for their case to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>That situation can be resolved if the entire court structure is looked at and if things which come before the courts are removed from them because our Circuit Courts in particular deal with many things which they should not have to deal with. I ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that the entire court structure which we have and which in many respects has served us well until recently, is examined with a view to providing a better service.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that necessary support staff will be made available to the new judges but that that is not a matter which comes within the scope of this Bill. I agree it is not strictly a matter that comes within the scope of this Bill but it is relevant to the Bill.  If the Judiciary and the court structure are not provided with sufficient staff, then it will not work properly.  One of the problems that the Circuit Court has at the moment is that it is totally understaffed.  At the moment suggestions are being made by people in Government that certain aspects of what county registrars do should be removed <Col N="988" /> from their jurisdiction, that is, the work of the sheriff's office.  The reason why that suggestion is being made is that there is no staff there to deal with it.  The opposite also follows in relation to court work.  There is not adequate staff in the Circuit Court offices to assist county registrars, thereby assisting the judges and thereby assisting the legal profession and the public who use the system.</P>
    <P>I would also take up the point made by Senator Lanigan in relation to the condition of courthouses.  It is a most appalling travesty that people are expected to come in, have their cases pleaded on their behalf in the most appalling surroundings.  We can appoint additional Circuit Court judges, we can appoint additional staff and we can try and improve the situation, but that is doing very little good if the conditions within which people have their cases dealt with are as deplorable as they are at the moment.  Certainly anybody who goes in and uses most courtrooms at present is in danger of leaving with pneumonia.  They are draughty, dank, dangerous, badly heated, badly lit establishments and certainly an urgent injection of capital is needed from central funds to ensure that the work which local authorities are attempting to do in this regard is improved and that court buildings are made more suitable.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting fact that we have in this House debated in recent times Bills which have established a new rent tribunal. Members of this House and indeed of the other House came into the two Houses and supported that Bill on the basis that it was unfair to bring people affected by rent problems into court buildings or unfair to bring them into the court structure because it was inadequate. That was a clear response by the Oireachtas to the fact that the court system was unsuitable for trying many cases.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is urgent movement on that front.  So long as there is not movement on that front the lack of confidence which is increasing in our court system will increase further and that in turn can lead <Col N="989" /> to far more serious problems in our society.</P>
    <P>In relation to the High Court and the Circuit Court there is an urgent need for the rules committees to examine the rules of the various courts and to ensure that there is simplification.  I believe that many of the delays which occur in the High Court are due to the cumbersome rules of court existing and an urgent examination and a simplification of the procedures which practitioners have to deal with in getting their cases for hearing is urgently needed.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that steps are taken in that regard.  I do not know what the reason is for the delay in producing new rules or examining existing rules.  The rules of the Circuit Court in their primary form go back to 1950 and they have been amended in many respects.  The rules of the District Court go back to 1948 and whereas we are told there are new rules, we have been told that for years they still have not been promulgated.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to two of the sections of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with the temporary increase to 15 in the number of High Court judges.  The Minister indicated that the number was purely for the purpose of getting rid of an existing backlog of cases.  The suggestion has been made that when the next normal casual vacancy occurs in the High Court that will not be filled.  That is my understanding of the suggestion.  I disagree with the Minister's suggestion that the delays are minimal in the areas outside Cork and Dublin.  The delays in the High Court in Galway between the moment of setting down and the moment of trial of an action is longer than the period the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why the increase in the number of High Court judges is not being made permanent, why is it to be a mere temporary measure? The Minister referred to the increase in jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Court and he said that when that increase was brought about it was felt that it would alleviate permanently the backlog of cases in the High Court.  The Minister also admitted it had not done so.  There <Col N="990" /> will still be a backlog in 1987 in the High Court.  There should be an additional roving judge made available to the public, to the legal profession and to the courts to deal with backlogs wherever they may occur or to deal with problems that might exist in any particular place.  I would like to know why the increase is not a permenent rather than a temporary increase.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (a) increases to 15 the number of circuit judges.  I welcome this increase but I fear that the increase is purely for the purpose of ensuring that the number of permanent judges assigned to the Dublin circuit will be six rather than five.  There is a need to assign additional Circuit Court judges to deal with backlogs which occur in the rural circuits.  My belief is that the reason why we do not have that is resistance by the Bar because they do not find if possible to be in many places at the one time. There is pressure on the Department of Justice from the Bar Council to ensure that the number of sitting Circuit Court days is kept to a minimum and to ensure that the number of judges operating on any particular day is kept to a minimum. Obviously if the number of judges sitting on a particular day expands, junior counsel cannot be in two places at the one time, briefs have to be handed over, with the result that the amount of fees earned by some of these gentlemen and ladies will be less than heretofore.  I believe that is the reason why we are not having the same kind of support afforded to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>If that is not the reason I would like the Minister to tell me what the other reasons are.  I would also like to receive an assurance that in the next courts Bill there will be provision made to provide the kind of necessary support within the Circuit Court.  I will not accept that there are not delays in the Circuit Court.  If the Minister wants to get copies of court lists existing in some of the circuit-going towns in my part of the country I will provide them for him and he will see from those lists that there are many cases listed six, seven and eight times and unfortunate <Col N="991" /> litigants are not getting what they deserve.</P>
    <P>There is a need to restructure the whole court system.  Many of the Circuit Court judges with the best will in the world find a problem in dealing with family law cases.  The problem is not their inability or their lack of expertise; the problem is that there is an appreciation on the part of the Bench that these are cases which must be dealt with in a very definite, particular and careful way.  These cases cause delays and hold up other work in the Circuit Court.  The time has come to ensure that there are two or three Circuit Court judges who would circuit the entire country dealing with nothing other than family law cases.  It would, on the one hand, assure those troubled by matrimonial problems that they were receiving attention from a judge who was absolutely conversant with that area of law and secondly, it would ensure that an amount of pressure would be removed from the normal Circuit Court lists.  This is becoming a problem in the Circuit Courts areas of which I have got experience.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill so far as it goes.  I hope the Minister will take steps in the course of his reforming ministry &mdash; and that is what his ministry has proved to be to date &mdash; to ensure that the entire administration of justice and the court system is critically examined with a view to gearing it for the next 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to briefly comment on the Second Stage of this Bill. The Minister has made an impressive case for the increased number of judges both in the High Court and the Circuit Court.  I would like to give him the benefit of my limited experience in the matter, to re-emphasise a lot of the points he has made and maybe, together with Senator Lanigan and Senator Durcan, indicate what the position is on the ground in a lot of places.  The Minister might find that helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a continuing problem in the High Court in general which has not been solved by the increase in the <Col N="992" /> jurisdiction of the Circuit Court because of the delay in bringing cases to hearing in the High Court.  The delay that has been a feature of the High Court work in the last few years has meant that the prechange in jurisdiction is only now in some parts of the county being revealed but the reduced workload has not become apparent.  I believe the Minister is justified in bringing before the House legislation to increase only temporarily the number of judges who will be in operation in the High Court.  I think we should work on the principle that the High Court and the Circuit Court and all the branches of the court and the back-up facilities of the court must gear themselves to be as efficient and as cost effective as possible. I think the Minister's decision in making a temporary appointment to the High Court, recognising that he may have to come back and change that to a permanent appointment is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The situation is fluid enough to relieve the matters still unresolved with regard to the number of permanent appointments which are necessary.  In the context of the growth in the number of judges over the last few years and in particular since the limits were set in the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1961, one must take a number of things into account.  One of the things that should be taken into account is the growth in the population of the country and the growth in the number of the population active in an economic sense.  It is inevitable that the facilities of a personal kind which are represented by the court, by barristers and solicitors and other officials, have to respond to the increase in the population. The increased number of people will give rise to the increased number of cases and in particular the younger age structure of our population has given rise to a situation where the amount of petty crime has disproportionately increased.  That increase in crime, petty or not so petty, must be responded to by making the facilities available on the criminal side to ensure that society is adequately protected in that area.  We should not underestimate the change that has taken place in the population of our country over <Col N="993" /> the last few years.  We see a change in prosperity.  It is a little bit shocking to think that between the 1971 census and the 1981 census there was an increase of almost 500,000 people or one-sixth in the number of people in the country.  That did not just start in 1971.  It predates that by a number of years.  Of course, since 1981 there has been a continuing increase in the population.  This, of course, gives rise to the demand for extra facilities. When that is coupled with the age structure of our population coinciding with the age in which it is likely that people will come in contact with the law &mdash; which is the younger age group, both on the civil and on the criminal side &mdash; the growth in the amount of work being demanded of the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court is to be expected.  In that regard the Minister is on very solid ground in seeking to increase the number of judges who would service that population.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also right in saying that a lot of the delay in the High Court is delay which takes place before the setting down of cases.  This is not widely enough recognised.  It is not always necessarily the case that the delay before the setting down of cases is the responsibility of the lawyer, or indeed of the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be.  Many of the complaints which people make in this area are related to personal injuries.  A lot of them have arisen because of the necessity to proceed down into a pattern which can make for a realistic assessment which will last and which will take into the account the settled effect of the injuries during the whole life of the person claiming compensation.  There are certain procedures in law which take a length of time to come to fruition.  The Minister is quite right in recognising that not all delays would be eliminated even if one were to supply overnight judicial availability in respect of every item set down for the High Court and the Circuit Court.  There would still be substantial delays necessitated by the preliminary work, which is such an essential part of preparing a successful <Col N="994" /> case for somebody in the High Court or the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>It is very important to recognise that many people who go to court go only once in their lives.  It is a very important day in their lives and they are entitled to the proper preparation for that.  That takes time.  The number of people involved &mdash; the solicitor, the client, the barristers on both sides &mdash; have all to be consulted at each stage to ensure that the case is properly handled.  This is a time-consuming process.  I am not saying that it cannot be improved or speeded up, but it is a time-consuming process and one which we should not assume will automatically disappear just because an increased number of judges are appointed.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention also the Circuit Court problem.  The Minister is quite right in saying that the increased jurisdication of the Circuit Court has given rise to an increased number of cases at the upper end of the scale.  These have taken a proportionately greater amount of time to deal with.  That is only right and proper.  If the previous jurisdiction of the High Court was £2,000, which is my memory of what it was, and it is now £15,000, obviously the care and attention which is necessary in order to adjudicate on something with a potential value of £15,000 is in excess of what would be necessary in respect of £2,000.  The client will demand a standard of attention which will reflect the financial benefit or penalty which the successful or unsuccessful court action will mean to him.  Therefore, in those circumstances, while the number of writs might not have increased because of the increased District Court jurisdictions, the complexity and the quantum of the Circuit Court has increased substantially. The Minister's comments in that regard are justified.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly the question of Cork, both in the High Court and the Circuit Court context, but particularly in the Circuit Court context.  I do not think the Circuit Court in Cork &mdash; and I am using that term in a broad sense &mdash; has been fairly treated with regard to facilities.  It is not generally recognised that there are over 12 per cent of the <Col N="995" /> people of the country living between Cork city and county.  The general pattern has been, except for the last few years, to have only one judge out of 13 or 14 available for that job.  In other words, 7 per cent of the judges were expected to service 12 per cent of the population.  As a result of that everything got behind.</P>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to assume that Cork people are less litigious than the remainder of the population.  There is no indication that they are more litigious, but there is certainly no indication that they are less litigious.  The correct proportion for the Cork situation is one and a half Circuit Court judges.  We are far short of that at the moment.  As a result of that there is a very serious backlog in the Cork area which has been used as a springboard for attacks on our court system, quite unjustified attacks by some people who should know better &mdash; people not in this House but some people in the other House.  In addition to that, the population in the Cork and Munster region has contributed again to the very serious problem which has arisen in the High Court in Cork.  That is a problem which this Minister and the President of the High Court &mdash; the present one and the last one &mdash; are tackling.</P>
    <P>In tackling it they must recognise that there are 12 per cent of the people living in the Cork area and, naturally, they require approximately 12 per cent of the service.  They have not been getting that. As a result justice has been seriously denied in the Cork area.  That has been particularly important in the area of criminal law.  I refer to the length of time people have been forced or have willingly delayed the hearing of criminal matters in the Cork area, the way in which criminals have been able to postpone cases by using the long list and by using the natural priority which must be given to people who are in custody.  The result is that the punishment for a crime in the Cork area is separated by a long distance from the actual commission of the crime.</P>
    <P>That is against all logical principles of <Col N="996" /> jurisprudence, under which the punishment and the crime itself should be as close as possible.  Take a person of 17 or 18 years of age who commits a crime. There is not much point in leaving that person unattended by the court until they are 21 years of age.  By so doing one is almost giving them a licence to carry on with their previous life.  They have not had the benefit of the experience which a conviction and a trial would have meant for them if it had been speedily carried out in the first place.  In regard to the Circuit Court in particular, with its criminal input, it is very important that this matter would be properly dealt with.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which the Minister might consider in regard to the Circuit Court but which, I am sorry to say, are not in this Bill.  For example, the variety of cases coming to the Circuit Court has changed dramatically.  The Minister will be aware of the changes which have come in the last few years whereby employment appeals matters, for example, have come before the Circuit Court.  There is now the ludicrous situation with regard to employment appeal cases that they are held first before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  They may or may not have been investigated by the Labour Court previously.  Then they are appealed to the Circuit Court and then they are appealed to the High Court on circuit.  It is really over-stretching the case and putting extreme pressure on the system in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with Circuit Court judges who are forced to deal with family law matters.  These are matters for which they feel inadequately trained, and they feel unwilling or uncomfortable dealing with them.  That is quite understandable. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to this problem.  The whole principle of justice &mdash; and, ultimately, the failure of a marriage leads to a judicial situation &mdash; has to be handled by people who have as broad a view as possible of life.  I certainly am not in favour of the specialisation which would be involved in one judge specially dealing with all family law matters.  That would be a very <Col N="997" /> unhealthy development.  I am not necessarily against the idea of judges from time to time being put into a family court situation and taken out of it again, but the idea of a person dealing with family matters and nothing else would, in my opinion, have a restricting effect on the person's breadth of vision which would not be to the ultimate benefit of the unfortunate protagonists in the family law matters before the court.  I am sure that is something which the Minister will consider in the context of the various discussions taking place in this House and in the Dáil with regard to these problems.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the jurisdiction of the various courts, we can have a discussion on that at any time.  It obviously has a considerable relevance with regard to the number of judges and justices. I think it is important that the Minister, having established what I consider to be fairly realistic levels between the District Court and the Circuit Court, should look regularly at these levels and change them.  The sum of £15,000 is not the same as it was when it was originally decided on.  There should be a system whereby, on a bi-annual or three-year basis, there would be a look at, and an automatic change in, the levels of jurisdiction in so far as they relate to monetary values in order to take into account any change in the value of money which is taking place.  Similarly, the sum of £2,500 which was set for the District Court has not kept its value in that period of time. That matter should be looked at, not necessarily in the sense of doubling it or anything like that, in order to make an orderly change in the level which can be claimed in these jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the other matters which have been mentioned with regard to family courts.  I have introduced the question of employment appeal matters. There is also an important matter which has developed over the last few years. The number of appeals from the District Court to the Circuit Court is taking an increasing amount of time in the Circuit Court.  Everybody is entitled to appeal, and we must preserve that right.  But appeals very often arise because the case <Col N="998" /> has been inadequately dealt with in the lower court, usually through no fault of the accused.  For example, a substantial portion of the time of a Circuit Court is taken by examining certificates of insurance which should have been adequately dealt with in the District Court.  All this is a terrible waste of time and is distracting the court from its main work.</P>
    <P>The device used by the Minister in section 1 (2), whereby he will reduce the number of ordinary judges immediately after 2 April 1987, is the correct approach to this, and the Minister has my support in that regard.  Finally, I congratulate the Minister on steering this Bill up to this stage.  It has something to contribute to the system of justice in the country which, in spite of all its flaws, has considerable support among the ordinary citizens as being independent of the Government, the courts being tribunals which can be appealed to in order to protect the rights of the citizens which, in the final analysis, is their only justification and primary role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Senators who contributed to this debate. This is an important piece of legislation and I am glad it is passing through the House expeditiously.</P>
      <P>When I came into office there were very long delays, indeed, especially in the High Court.  Those delays were averaging around 30 months from the time of setdown to the date of the hearing of the action.  The reasons for the delays were threefold.  First, there was a lack of accommodation.  There simply were not enough jury courtrooms, especially in Dublin city, to deal with the amount of business that was being transacted.  We put in two new courtrooms in the Four Courts building, with full jury rooms. That has helped very much in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested to me from time to time that some of the preliminary work could be done by, for example, the Master of the High Court.  I have legislation in preparation which will increase the role of the Master of the High Court. <Col N="999" /> I think that will help as well.  But it became clear during this year that if we were to deal effectively with the backlog we would need more manpower.  In the High Court we would need an extra judge, at least for 12 to 15 months.  The courts have been working very efficiently.  I compliment, in particular, the President of the High Court and his predecessor for the work they have done in clearing backlogs.  There has been a significant improvement and, as I said, the modifications which were carried out in the Four Courts now allow three High Court judges to sit simultaneously in Dublin.  For example, in the 1984 legal year there was an increase of 84 per cent in the number of jury actions disposed of during the year, that is, 5,725 as compared with 3,107 in the previous year. There was an increase of 26 per cent in the number of non-jury common law actions disposed of.  Tremendous credit is due to the President of the High Court who organised this and to his judges who co-operated so effectively with him.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation in the High Court where the judges are disposing of more business than is actually being set down, so if there was not a backlog the present complement of judges could deal with the business that is coming before the courts.  That is why I am asking this House to pass the Bill in the form in which I have proposed it.  I do not think we will need the extra High Court judge as a permanent appointment.  If that judge is used to clear the backlog, which still exists in Cork in particular and in other places in the country also, the problems will be removed and the existing complement of judges in the High Court will be able to deal, as they are dealing now, with the amount of business that is being set down.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible to bring about a situation where there were no delays at all.  We are talking about, principally, jury actions and people who sue for damages as a result of car accidents.  When somebody is injured in a car accident in the normal course of events he goes to hospital and it takes a while for him to <Col N="1000" /> recuperate.  Of necessity, time must elapse until the injured party has fully recuperated before a court is in a position to assess damage.  That, I am told, is usually nine or ten months.  When we are talking in terms of 12 month delays we are talking about a situation where we can only reduce the delays by two months.  Otherwise, one would be simply waiting for the medical evidence and it would not work out.</P>
    <P>I hope the situation in Cork will improve substantially.  It has improved already this year.  The President of the High Court went down there and called over the lists.  He is putting extra judges there.  There is an absolute blitz intended for Cork in 1986.  I hope the delay that is running now at 20 months will be reduced substantially in line with what is happening in the rest of the country.  I hope the extra judge which the President of the High Court will have at his disposal as a result of the appointment which will ensue from this legislation will help him in that respect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Circuit Court, there is a delay in Dublin of approximately 11 months in the hearing of criminal cases. Custody cases as Senator O'Leary pointed out, are given priority and dealt with as expeditously as possible.  There are no delays in the Circuit Court on the civil side in Dublin.  In Cork, there is an arrears situation in the Circuit Court, both in the civil and criminal cases. Again, priority is given, as is the practice everywhere, to people in custody.  There has been a huge increase in Cork. Between 1979-84, for example, the number of criminal cases increased by 50 per cent and the number of civil cases increased by 35 per cent in the Cork area. During the legal years 1983-84 and 1984-85 a second Circuit Court judge sat in Cork for a total of 64 days and 70 days respectively.  There will be one new appointment when we allow for the 12 permanent Circuit Court judges and add on the two temporary Circuit Court judges whom we are now making permanent. I know it is the intention of the President of the Circuit Court to appoint this judge to Cork.  Rather than having a <Col N="1001" /> second judge there for a number of sitting days, there will be a second permanent appointment of a Circuit Court judge to Cork which, I think, will effectively deal with the backlog there.</P>
    <P>One final comment of a general nature before I go to specific points raised by Senators is that the practice of having temporary judges is something I have been uneasy about for some time.  There has never been any suggestion that because judges were temporary they were at the grace and pleasure of the Government and the Government would not make them permanent.  There was always the possibility of a challenge because of the position of the temporary judge, since constitutionally the Judiciary are independent.  No Government since the foundation of this State made any attempt whatsoever to direct a judge on the grounds that he was a temporary appointee and, consequently, was there at the grace and pleasure of the Government. That is not the point which is at issue.  The point which is at issue is the very fact that the situation pertaining, where somebody is temporary rather than permanent, takes away somewhat from the independence of the Judiciary and their independent role.  As I said in my opening remarks, it is the intention that the two temporary judges who are practising at the moment in the Circuit Court would be made permanent, and that then there would be a new appointee who would subsequently be assigned to Cork.  That is it, in effect.</P>
    <P>There were a number of points raised by different Senators which I would like to deal with very briefly.  Senator Lanigan talked about training of the members of the Judiciary.  On the question of training, as we know, there is no formal training. In the District Court the appointee needs to be a barrister or a solicitor of ten years' standing.  In the Circuit Court or the High Court the appointee needs to be a barrister who has ten years' experience.  One can ask what training has a Senator, a TD or a Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not think the idea of running AnCO course for judges particularly appeals to me.  If we pick our candidates <Col N="1002" /> carefully, as we do, we know that they are people of repute who are familiar with the courts because they practise in them. They learn quite a lot over the minimum period of ten years, which every judge has to have in practice.  As well as that, the President of the District Court is empowered, for example, to bring all his justices together for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of business of the court.  He has the formal power.  The other presidents bring their judges together informally. They have discussions on sentencing policy and on various other matters. There is no provision in law for that, but the Chief Justice has over the past few years convened regional and national conferences of judges and justices in order to discuss the administration of justice. The holding of regional conferences was recommended in the twelfth interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.  Also, members of the Judiciary regularly attend national and international meetings and conferences, which keeps them in touch with new ideas and developments.  Because of the constitutional independence of the Judiciary the initiative regarding briefing, training and so on must be left to the judges themselves.  Certainly, they are very well in touch with what is happening in Europe and America.  That area is not being neglected at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan and other Senators also asked about staff.  We are appointing the necessary staff and they will not be drawn from the existing pool of staff. There will be new registrars appointed as well as criers, drivers and so on.  Such staff are provided with the appointment. That sanction was obtained before we came this far with the Bill.  There are certain problems of staffing in various areas.  The courts are subject to the embargo, as are other areas of the public sector, but there are some improvements. The courts are coping better now than they were.  It might be of interest to Senators to know that there are a number of developments &mdash; for example, the assignment of 57 temporary clerical trainees. <Col N="1003" /> Most of them will go into District Court offices.  That will help quite a lot. A lot of routine work causes the backlog. Also, there is a major computerisation project now, particularly in Dublin, but also in Cork and Limerick.  The issuing of summonses, fines and warrants is computerised. That will help also.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan made quite a number of points.  He talked about removing from the courts certain matters which should have automatic penalties &mdash; fines on the spot for Road Traffic Act offences and so on.  It is something that has been suggested before.  There is an objection to it. I am not ruling it out completely.  I will certainly consider it again.  But there is an objection.  I do not think it is the best procedure to have the gardaí on duty handling money.  I do not think that is necessarily the best way to do business. If there are fines on the spot, obviously the people who find the transgressor transgressing will have to collect and then to account for money.  Gardaí have a lot of problems at the moment.  I do not want to put another duty on them of having to keep track of money while on duty.  They would have to account for it and pay it in when they came back.  We have to weigh that against the advantage of removing matters such as this from the District Court.</P>
    <P>We are doing quite a lot of work on buildings here in Dublin, but court buildings around the country are the responsibility of local authorities.  There are enough people in politics in both Houses who are members of local authorities and who can make an impact in their own areas.  I cannot see why county councils and corporations should decide that the local court house is always the last item on the list of priorities.  If local government is to mean anything those involved in local government certainly should have a very strong interest in the dispensation of justice in their own areas.  We have district justices appointed to local areas and I cannot see why the local authorities cannot accommodate them better, because it is their responsibility to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1004" /> Nationally, we have a number of building projects under way at the moment. Everybody knows that work on the construction of an office block on the site of the former Four Courts Hotel commenced early in 1984 and will be completed by 1987.  It is expected to be ready for occupation before the end of 1987. When it is completed the office block will facilitate the redevelopment of the existing accommodation within the Four Courts to provide additional accommodation and ancillary accommodation.  As well as the jury rooms already provided, and, the court rooms in the Four Courts buildings, we are providing extra space in the Four Courts.  When the Four Courts Hotel office block is built all the office facilities which are in the Four Courts can be moved.  There will then be extra accommodation in the Four Courts for actual court work.  That will help quite a lot.  It will make a major improvement there.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the various other items in my preliminary remarks or now. I was particularly impressed by Senator Durcan's speech.  There are a number of points there which I will be taking up to see can we implement some of the suggestions he made.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary went over some of the ground covered by some other Senators.  I would like to thank him very much for his support.  I am aware of the Cork situation. This Bill will help the Cork situation in particular.  It will probably help Cork more than any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I also agree with what Senator O'Leary said about family cases.  There is a danger that we would go for over-specialisation to deal with a very real problem.  Certainly, family cases must be dealt with sensitively, but I would agree with the view that somebody has to have a broad view of life which is open to change.  One should not be restricted in a specialised way for an over-long period in the area of family law.  When the deliberations which are at present going on in the other House are concluded and when decisions are made, obviously the area of family law is going to be very important.  We <Col N="1005" /> will have to provide the facilities, the judges and the training, if necessary, to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senators again for their support.  As Senator Durcan pointed out, the claim in the last sentence of my introductory remark may be extravagant, but it certainly will make a contribution to the easement of a problem which has existed now for a number of years.</P>

The present rates at 70p for cattle and 7p for sheep have remained unchanged since 26 July 1982.  The new rates proposed are £1 for cattle and 10p <Col N="1006" /> for sheep.  Section 28 of the Coras Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979, provides that orders increasing levies payable to CBF may be made only after a resolution approving the new rates has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Córas Beostoic agus Feola is a statutory body which replaced Córas Beostoic agus Feola Teoranta, a company limited by guarantee, in 1979.  Its purposes are, broadly, to promote the export of cattle and sheep and their meats, to provide promotional and marketing support to exporters and to promote beef, mutton and lamb on the home market.  Its activities have included intensive promotion of vacuum-packed beef on the German and United Kingdom markets, as well as a continuing emphasis on the market intelligence work which it developed in previous years.</P>
      <P>CBF have two sources of income, namely an Exchequer grant-in-aid from the Vote for Agriculture and the proceeds of levies on cattle and sheep slaughtered within the State or exported live.  It is estimated that in 1985 income from the levies will amount to about £1,300,000 while the grant-in-aid will come to £787,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CBF corporate plan for the years 1986 to 1990 envisages a significant increase in funding to enable it to expand and develop its promotional work.  The estimates for 1986 contain a grant-in-aid of £1.1 million for CBF which represents an increase of almost 40% per cent over the 1985 level.  That increase demonstrates the Government's commitment to the marketing of meat and livestock, and to the activities of CBF in particular. CBF have consulted producer and trade interests and they have agreed to increase the levies as their contribution towards expanded activity by CBF.  The draft order now before the House will give statutory effect to this increased contribution. It will raise the levy on cattle from 70p to £1 and that on sheep from 7p to 10p.  The new rates are expected to yield an income of £1.8 million in 1986, which with the £1.1 million from the Exchequer will give CBF a total of £2.9 million next year as compared with about <Col N="1007" /> £2.1 million this year.  I propose to bring these rates into effect on 1 January 1986.</P>

      <P>I was only asking because if the two motions were taken together it would broaden the scope of the debate.  In that way we would possibly have more to say on the matter.  However, I abide by the ruling of the House.</P>
      <P>In a year like this any increase in levies would have been resisted.  Indeed, I am sure none of us like to see those levies being increased, particularly when farmers' incomes are taking a tumble and when the prospects for 1986 seem very gloomy, according to the forecasts emerging at present.  However, I accept that CBF are doing a good job in the export market.  They have developed markets in many countries where we did not have a market before.  There is still very considerable scope there for CBF to develop those markets further.  The last increase given was in 1982.  We are fortunate, in one sense, that we have got away with it for so long.  When you consider all the levies that are imposed on farmers at marts and creameries, and so on, it all adds up to a sizeable sum.  It is all being taken out of the profits of the farming community.  Those profits are small enough at present, particularly with the weather conditions that we had this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little that we can say on <Col N="1008" /> this order except to agree reluctantly to the increase being granted.  There will be an increase from 70p to £1 on cattle and from 7p to 10p on sheep.  It is hoped that that will yield £2.9 million next year as compared with £2.1 million in the current year.  I hope that CBF will make this increase worthwhile for the farmers who will be paying it and that they will be able to develop the market further.  I think there is considerable scope for the development of the market in the &ldquo;vac-pack&rdquo; meat area.  This has worked very well in Germany and other countries.  I feel it can be developed further in other European countries.  I hope that the increase we are giving here today will enable CBF to undertake an expansion of that market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the measure of increase proposed to support CBF financially by increasing the levies is necessary.  It is warranted.  I am confident that it will yield the results we all expect. As was stated by Senator Hussey, it is more than three years now since there was any adjustment in the amount of the levy.  It is no surprise that a levy increase would be necessary at present.  I believe that, as an indication of the Government's absolute sincerity about the role of CBF, the contribution can highlight the fact that the Government are increasing their contribution by 40 per cent.  The Government's contribution as stated by the Minister, is now £787,000.  This is a measure of the Government's confidence in CBF.  It is true to say that an organisation like CBF, which is a promotions body, is difficult to assess entirely.  It is difficult to quantify precisely what it has done and what it has not done.  At this stage the need for an effective promotions board was never greater.  I feel, and I have stated this in this House before, that CBF rather than being entirely as it is, a promotions body, should have some degree of direct marketing responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the various ramifications of the marketing of meat and meat products but, at the same time, I believe the Minister and the Department of Agriculture <Col N="1009" /> should look at the whole question of the future of CBF as a promotions body exclusively.  They should examine the desirability of their being given a degree of responsibility in the direct marketing area.  At a stage when the whole future of intervention and the buying of beef is very much to the fore, when we are informed that intervention for the coming season will operate only in special circumstances, it makes it all the more important to have a dynamic and vigorous promotions body like CBF to ensure that we sell in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The present chairman of CBF, Mr. Brosnan, and the chief executive, Mr. Moore, are excellent people to head an organisation of such importance.  It is also relevant to put on record that CBF are representative both of the trade and also of those at producing level.  There is a direct input of all parties concerned into the operations of CBF.  It is also worthy of note that the farming organisations and others directly involved in this entire important area are supportive of the measures announced today.  One could not overstress the importance of marketing. Up to now in the area of meat marketing and other marketing spheres we have been tinkering around in many instances.  It is good to note that there is now a programme up to 1990.  This is very encouraging.  This programme, while it concentrates a good deal on marketing within the European Community, also, of course, extends to third countries.</P>
    <P>Emphasis will be placed on the whole question of added-value.  Added-value is something that has often been referred to in relation to meat, but not enough has been done about it.  There is great potential in the area of added-value where we would aspire to process meat to a stage where it is suitable and fit for consumption and that we get as near as possible to the consuming stage rather than sending out as at present a large amount of our beef exports in the form of sides of beef.  There is vast potential if we were to concentrate meaningfully on added-value in the beef sector.  Many jobs could be created.  A great deal more <Col N="1010" /> could be earned for the economy which would alleviate serious unemployment and at the same time help significantly the balance of payments deficit.  For that reason the areas which CBF will be concentrating on in the future are deserving of the fullest support possible.</P>
    <P>When speaking about added-value it is important that we couple with it the whole area of research into consumer tastes, because we have not concentrated sufficiently in the past on finding out and ascertaining what precisely the consumer wants.  This effort by CBF in the future will do a great deal to ensure that we are producing for the needs of consumers rather than merely trying to sell our products. This point cannot be overstressed. It is being accepted by practically everybody that we must produce for the marketplace rather than trying to market what is produced.</P>
    <P>One could talk at length about the whole area of CBF, their activities, projections, plans and so on.  There is no question but that CBF have a very vital role in the future.  The adjustment in the levy for CBF to £1 and 10p for cattle and sheep respectively is indeed warranted.  I subscribe to the view expressed by Senator Hussey that people are not in favour of levies.  As a producer of beef I would prefer if there was no levy at slaughtering stage.  But one has to accept the reality of the situation.  If we want a good job done it must be paid for.  It behoves us all not alone to support fully the measures proposed by the Minister with regard to CBF but to ensure on an on-going basis that we would contribute in whatever way possible to making CBF more effective.  There is one important point I would put to the Minister, that is in regard the performance of CBF.  In so far as it can be done their performance should be monitored on a fairly frequent and on-going basis.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the £2.9 million that CBF require to operate on an annual basis is quite realistic if one were to compare it with other organisations and bodies who might not have anything like the far-reaching responsibilities that CBF have.  In order to arrive at that figure the <Col N="1011" /> Government have shown their absolute sincerity towards CBF by increasing by 40 per cent their contribution to the total amount.  It is something which both sides of the House must support very fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This order, which increases the levy from 70p to £1 for cattle and from 7p to 10p for sheep, gives us an opportunity to discuss the area of agricultural development.  Whereas I accept that it is vital that CBF play a dynamic role in the promotion of the product at home and in particular abroad, it is important that they be funded to the best of our ability as a nation and by the industry itself.  For that reason I am pleased that in the consultations that took place between the producers and the trade agreement was reached on the principle of increasing the levies, which have remained at their present level for a period going back to 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CBF in their corporate plan have envisaged that they would have to develop their promotional role.  Any of us with knowledge of the working of the intervention system will realise that it is vital that we have an agency to play a dynamic role in the marketing of our product. There is about 700,000 tonnes of beef in intervention.  Anybody with any regard for the future of the industry will realise that that situation could not continue without some dynamic body to ensure that these products are marketed outside of the intervention system.  Otherwise that system is likely to collapse, and the case we would make for the retention of CAP would be undermined, particularly when we are talking about a product which, out of intervention storage, does not lend itself to be transported to the starving people in Ethiopia and Sudan. Once the product is out of intervention storage the problems associated with transporting it to warmer climates ensure that the product will be inedible within a day or two before it gets to its destination. For that reason beef intervention is a very tricky matter.  Therefore, this new role that CBF are taking upon themselves with assistance from this levy will be vital <Col N="1012" /> to the maintenance of what is a very important industry.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of people employed in the production of beef. There are many people employed in factory jobs in the processing of beef products apart from what is exported on the hoof.  We must welcome every opportunity to ensure that as much processing as possible take place in this industry to create as many jobs as possible at home and to add as much value as possible to the end product.  If we take that into account and if we take into account also the corporate plan recently announced by ACOT for the development of agriculture, we will see the importance that ACOT have put on the development of the beef industry.  For the past number of years those involved were either earning no profit or a very small margin of profit because of the marketing situation. With most of our milk producers faced with a milk levy it is important to know that farmers can turn to the production of beef in the knowledge that a market will exist there.  As Senator Hourigan stated, it is time we went out to sell what the market requires rather than producing what is not required and then trying to sell it.  This is a fallacy and such a policy has been a failure.</P>
    <P>The Irish beef producer has made many changes in recent years in trying to ensure that the proper standards of grading were achieved and that the right type of breeding was used to produce proper beef at the end of the day.  We have made a major change in this already.  Any effort to open up new markets, whether they be in Germany, the United Kingdom, in any other part of Europe or in the Middle East, must be assisted in every way possible by this House and by the industry.  I am glad that agreement has been reached on this in principle.  It is imperative that the industry realise that they as producers have a responsibility also to be associated with marketing.  CBF are the correct agency to handle this.  They have already made contacts and have a very good standing throughout the world.  I will not go into <Col N="1013" /> the recent controversies about the personnel involved in that marketing board. It is imperative that the industry can turn to some body with the contacts and the expertise which CBF have to sell the product at the best possible price, thereby producing results for the producer, the consumer and those employed in the industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the order to the House.  I hope it will have the desired effect and that the overall increase in the allocation to CBF will be sufficient to allow them to carry out the kind of programme they want.  I trust that, when the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, makes a report on this area, the results of today's work will be reflected on the ground and that the Irish farmer, beef producer, worker and indeed the nation as a whole will be the beneficiaries of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>While most of us as producers normally do not welcome any increase in levies, the increases under the headings of both cattle and sheep are too small to talk about at present.  Agreement has been reached with the producers in regard to these increases.  It is very important in these times that CBF, a board with renewed vigour, should go out to search for markets.  We all know from television and other sources about the beef mountain, the butter mountain and the milk lake.  The producers of both cattle and sheep are always concerned when they read about these surpluses. The main worry of most producers at present is to find a market, and we hope that this increase will result in better markets for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of uncertainty in the cattle trade over the past number of years.  We have some excellent producers, but the margin of profit at the end of the day has declined in recent times.  For that reason it is important to producers to get the right price for their produce.  Marketing at present is very competitive.  In recent times we have seen certain signals from the EC regarding intervention.  They are inclined to cut back on intervention, which would be a serious blow for the producers.  However, <Col N="1014" /> we have a Minister who is fighting our case daily and weekly in relation to these cutbacks.</P>
    <P>In regard to the prices we receive, it should also be mentioned that the restrictions on hormones or implants for cattle will reduce further the profit margin at the end of the day for the producer. Therefore, it is necessary that we find the right markets.</P>
    <P>In regard to sheep, it is true to say that the margin of profits, plus certain subsidies in recent times, has been reasonably good.  Therefore, the increase of 3p is nothing to talk about.</P>
    <P>In an all-important sentence in his speech the Minister said that CBF have drawn up this year a corporate plan for the period from 1986 to 1990.  He went on to say that the plan recognises that in those years livestock and meat producers are likely to find themselves operating in an increasingly competitive market, both in the European Community and in third countries.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the beef and sheep producers we have to mention the milk producers also.  The good prices we have had for our beef over the last number of years meant that the producer was in a position to pay very high prices for calves, perhaps in some cases too high.  When they saw a future for their livestock perhaps they were encouraged to pay those prices.  This was a great help to the milk producers because if they did not get the necessary increases &mdash; I am not saying they did not &mdash; it meant that the price of their calves adequately compensated them for any loss they might have on the other side.  I know from speaking to many farmers who are quite prepared to continue producing cattle that their only concern is the markets.  As Senator Hussey mentioned earlier, the cost to the producer can amount to a lot of money. Nonetheless, there is still enough confidence left in the trade to enable people to continue.  People are still encouraged to produce more cattle and they always respond to the call &mdash; down through the years this has been the case.  It is important to keep these people producing cattle and sheep because if they were to produce <Col N="1015" /> something else, such as milk or grain, we would also have over-production in those areas.</P>
    <P>In these days when one talks about finished cattle one is talking about a price of £700, £800 or £900.  The levy would mean about £1 off at the end of the day, which I do not think matters too much. We should give this new board all the help and encouragement possible.  We have the right people there to do the job that is so badly needed to be done.  For that reason it is good to see them getting this 40 per cent increase from the Government.  I commend this motion to the House and I wish the new board of the CBF every success, because, naturally enough, their success will be our success at the end of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations deal with <Col N="1016" /> insurability of employment under the Social Welfare Acts and the need for it arises specifically from a particular problem with which the Church of Ireland has been faced.</P>
      <P>By virtue of the provisions of paragraph 7 of Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, where a person is a minister of religion any employment which he may have is excluded from insurability under the Social Welfare Acts.  In recent times the Church of Ireland has introduced a new auxiliary ministry as part of its pastoral ministry.  Auxiliary ministers are persons who are ordained in Holy Orders but continue with their normal day-to-day jobs in the secular world.  They carry out pastoral duties in their leisure time, voluntarily and on an unpaid basis. Because they are ministers of religion who are ordained in Holy Orders, auxiliary ministers are excluded from insurance under the Social Welfare Acts in their secular employment by virtue of the existing legal provisions.  The number of persons involved are few &mdash; no more than ten I understand &mdash; but some have been paying social insurance contributions for a long time and the Church of Ireland has represented to me that it would be inequitable that they should be deprived of continuing social insurance cover in their normal day-to-day secular occupations because of their voluntary spare-time pastoral activities.  I am satisfied the existing statutory provision would constitute an inequity in so far as the auxiliary ministers are concerned and I have agreed to meet the representations made to me by the Church of Ireland authorities.  I am grateful to Senator Catherine McGuinness in particular for bringing this problem to my attention in the first instance.  I would like to thank her for the interest she took in the matter and for the advice she gave me in dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the regulations, therefore, is to remedy the position by amending paragraph 7 of Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1981.  For constitutional <Col N="1017" /> reasons it is necessary to draft the regulation in such a way that it may be applied to all religious denominations and not to one denomination only.  A provision of a somewhat similar nature was made in 1974 to bring into social insurance ministers of religion who are engaged full time on pastoral work for which they receive remuneration and in respect of whom the appropriate Church body has made representations to the effect that they should be insurable.</P>
    <P>In practice what will happen is that an appropriate body or authority for a religious class will make representations to the effect that it is unreasonable that their secular employment should not be insurable employment under the Social Welfare Acts and this will enable me to have the employments in question treated as insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The Church of Ireland is the body immediately concerned but, by virtue of the way in which the regulation has been drafted, it can apply equally to any religious denomination.</P>
    <P>Under subsection 6 of section 5 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, the regulations may not be made until a resolution approving the draft regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The regulations were considered by the Dáil on 10 December 1985 and were approved by that House.</P>
    <P>I am happy to recommend the draft regulations to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>What can be said generally and with some degree of certainty is that in the whole area of the social welfare code there are many anomalies and many cases of injustices.  At this time of the year one immediately thinks of the free fuel scheme where, unfortunately, only certain categories of social welfare recipients benefit from the scheme, whereas the need is the more important thing. Here we have a situation where, in my opinion, you have a degree of injustice.  It is a further anomaly in the social welfare code and I am pleased that the Minister has responded to it quickly and has acted correctly and wisely.  As the explanatory <Col N="1018" /> note attached to the draft makes quite clear, under the provisions of paragraph 7 of Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, where an employed person is a person in Holy Orders or other minister of religion or person living in a religious community as a member thereof, the employment of that person is not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Further on, it makes the point that the regulations provide for the insurability of the employment of such a person in a secular capacity where the person is a member of the class of persons in respect of which the appropriate authority, acting on behalf of members of that class, has represented to the Minister that it is unreasonable that their secular employment should not be insurable employment. As the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated here, while it is a general statement and we know it is for a specific purpose it, nonetheless can, I believe, and would apply in the future, as the Minister has indicated, and could apply to any religious denomination.  Here we are talking about a specific group of people &mdash; the Church of Ireland.  As the Minister has clearly indicated in his own statement to us, the Church of Ireland has introduced a new auxiliary ministry as part of its pastoral ministry.  I am sure &mdash; the Minister has not mentioned it &mdash; that we are talking about a handful of people; but, nonetheless, a handful of very important people and obviously dedicated people.  It is right and proper that the Minister has responded positively to the Hierarchy of the Church of Ireland in this area.  As I said, they may be only a handful of people, a handful nonetheless of dedicated people and it is their right not to be discriminated against in the area of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This draft is not one that we would dwell on for too long.  All we can say is that the Minister has acted wisely and well and has responded well to the request of the Hierarchy of the Church of Ireland.  It is there for other religious denominations should a case present itself in the future.  My view certainly would be that they have my support and <Col N="1019" /> I have pleasure in welcoming the entire draft regulation as presented to us here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in welcoming the draft regulations.  I congratulate the Minister on the promptness with which he has acceded to the request made to him by the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland.  It would be inequitable that ordained ministers who are willing to do pastoral work in their leisure time voluntarily and on an unpaid basis should be excluded from insurance under the Social Welfare Acts.  The draft regulations propose to amend that and I am glad to see it happen.</P>
      <P>We live in a time when a great deal of pastoral work by qualified people is necessary.  It is a very welcome thing in society that we have people such as these auxiliary ministers who are ordained first of all in Holy Orders but who are prepared to devote their leisure time and on an unpaid basis to voluntary work. Society is much better for having people of that kind.  It certainly would not be the wish of the people to penalise them in any way because of the work that they do in that field.  For these reasons the draft regulations are very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision also.  I want to commend the Minister on the speed with which he set about this problem when Senator McGuinness brought it to his attention.  Indeed, I had discussions with Senator McGuinness myself on the problem.  Because the numbers are so small, were it not for her intervention it is possible that it might never have come to our notice.  The Minister must be commended for his action. Even if there were only ten people &mdash; even if there was only one person &mdash; involved, obviously it would be discrimination. Particularly in the case of auxiliary ministers ordained in Holy Orders, but who continue a normal life and give up their leisure time to pastoral duties, it is vital that they should not be discriminated against in any way under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> We know, as Senator Fallon has said, how complicated the social welfare code is.  At times it is difficult to explain to ordinary people the various intricacies of it.  The consolidation of the social welfare code has been a major problem and an area of major difficulty in trying to communicate with people about their entitlements.</P>
    <P>This is a simple provision, one in that it now extends to this particular category the appropriate benefit.  I note it is a matter for the Church of Ireland to make a formal request to the Minister.  Then the order will come into force and these Ministers will automatically be covered.</P>
    <P>The reverse probably could happen in other religious groups where you have priests who give most of their time in teaching posts or in other community work as well.  It is important that when people give of their time without remueration or indeed any other compensation the Social Welfare Acts should not discriminate against them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the humane way in which he has approached this matter.  The fact that so few people are involved in irrelevant, but I congratulate the Minister for having acted with speed and compassion, I commend the order to the House: it has, I feel, the support of everybody.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments.  It is altogether appropriate that we should make an accommodation under the social welfare code for this provision.  This tradition whereby the Christian ministry is combined with everyday work is one that is long established even if, as it were, intermittent in the history of the Christian Church.  Peter continued to fish even after being called to the ministry.  It is, I think, in the Acts of the Apostles that we read that at certain times in his ministry Paul supported himself by his own trade of tent-making.  In my own denomination we had the movement of worker priests for a long time.  That has now gone into recession because of the difficulties in combining full involvement in the workplace with the pastoral ministry.  This is <Col N="1021" /> a long tradition but it is one that in the different denominations has waxed strong at times and waned at others.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to something the Minister said in his speech.  He thanked Senator Catherine McGuinness for bringing this question to his attention.  It is only right that I should say that Senator McGuinness had hoped to be in the Chamber this afternoon in order to thank the Minister for having dealt so thoroughly with the problem which she raised.  Unfortunately, she has been delayed by a professional engagement in court.  She had hoped that, with the court rising at 4 p.m., she could have been in the House at this time, but that was not so.  I would like to express thanks on her behalf and the general thanks of every Member of the Seanad to the Minister for what he has done in this instance.</P>

      <P>May I thank Senators for their commendation on the introduction of this measure.  I would stress that, whereas the regulation specifically applies to the Church of Ireland Ministers in this instance, it is framed so that it can apply to all denominations.  I have no doubt that in the years ahead we will receive affirmative representations from a number of areas which will give the regulation a universal application.  I am very pleased to be able to bring in this basic reform.  It also shows that the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, under which the regulation is enacted, is an exceptionally valuable piece of consolidation. The enabling provisions of that Act have stood the test of time and are very useful on this occasion.</P>

      <Col N="1022" /> Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1985</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, which was introduced at that time to secure a financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programme.  The rates of levy were £3 per animal slaughtered or exported and 0.5p per gallon of milk.</P>
      <P>The levies have since been adjusted from time to time.  The current rates, yielding an estimated £13.4 million in a full year, were introduced in the context of the national plan.  They stand at £3.80 a head on cattle and 0.6p a gallon on milk and apply up to the end of 1985.  The House will recall that these rates were settled in association with the introduction of a number of changes in the TB eradication programme &mdash; all designed to accelerate the elimination of that disease.</P>
      <P>In fixing the Estimates for 1986 it has been decided to continue the existing rates of levy.  In coming to this decision the Government had to take account of the overall budget prospects for 1986 and of the fact that there has been a substantial shortfall in revenue in the year just ending.  As the House will be aware, the Government have been very responsive to the serious difficulties faced by farmers throughout 1985 and made substantial extra funds available to alleviate those difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House will be aware of the significant changes that have taken place over the past year in our approach to the problem of bovine disease.  Despite committing large resources to the eradication campaign we had not succeeded in recent years in making worthwhile inroads against the disease.  It was against this background that the Government decided on the introduction of important changes in procedures, which were outlined in the national plan, and which have <Col N="1023" /> since been put into operation under the current programme of testing.  At the same time, they gave a commitment to funding for the programme over the three year period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The new, more streamlined and disciplined arrangements have been working well since the start of the current round last June.  While the overall level of disease prevalence, that is 3.62 per cent or 6,917 herds locked up as at the end of November, still gives cause for concern, I am satisfied that the intensive nature of the testing this year has enabled us to identify the extent of the disease problem and provides a basis for a significant improvement in the situation in 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>As far as brucellosis is concerned, about 500 herds are now restricted because of the disease.  Our aim is to cut this figure by half by the end of the current round next spring.  I would expect that, barring some unexpected reversals, the national herd should be virtually free of brucellosis at that stage.  Also at that stage I will be in a position to give serious consideration to the question of declaring the national herd officially brucellosis free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time that the Minister has come before us today asking for an increase in levies. This is a terrible situation at a time when farmers are so hard-pressed trying to meet their commitments.  I had hoped that the Minister would have some good news to deliver on this occasion, but unfortunately he has not.  Apparently the disease levies are going to continue for another period.  The levies may seem small but when they are all added up they are quite sizable.  There is a levy of £3.80 on every animal slaughtered at the factory or exported live.  There is a veterinary inspection cost of £3.25 and a CBF levy which was increased today by £1. This brings us to a total of over £8 on every animal.  You also have other deductions which go to the farming organisations such as the IFA and the ICMSA, so that a sizeable amount is <Col N="1024" /> deducted from the farmer who sells his cattle at the mart or at the factory for slaughter.  When you consider that he also has to pay transport for those cattle and pay the vet to test them it certainly is eating into his profits.</P>
      <P>The dairy farmer is faced with the same situation.  He has his own share of levies to cover.  He has the disease levies, the butter inspection levies, the super-levy and so on.  I suppose this amounts to 5p or 6p per gallon on every gallon of milk produced, If you take a dairy farmer who has a herd of 30 cows, for all the levies he would pay in the region of £1,050 in a full year; a 40-cow farmer would pay £1,400; a 50-cow farmer would pay £1,750; a 60-cow farmer £2,100; an 80-cow farmer £2,800, and so on.  These people are making their contribution to the Government under the bovine disease levies.  This levy was introduced mainly to secure a financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication programmes.  Rates of £1.90 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live and 0.3 pence per gallon of milk produced were introduced with effect from 1 January 1984.  Of course, these figures have been doubled again to £3.80 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live and 0.6p per gallon of milk produced from November 1984 to the present time.  When we were introducing this increase last year it was expected to produce a figure of £7 million in 1985. We all accept that money has to be provided for the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.  A figure of £31.5 million was provided in 1985 for the eradication programme, an increase of £10.4 million on the 1984 allocation.  The figures before that averaged around £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brucellosis eradication is at an advanced stage.  That seems to be more or less under control.  Britain have declared a brucellosis-free area.  As the Minister knows, this has created problems for farmers, particularly in the west of Ireland who are exporting heifers.  In spite of all the money we have spent on the eradication programme the measures <Col N="1025" /> applied have managed only to contain the disease at an incidence of around 2.5 per cent of herds.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister here today to tell us how successful the measures which the Government introduced last year have proved.  Have the direct nominations of veterinary surgeons for TB and brucellosis scheme testing proved successful? Has there been any tightening up of the supervision at marts or has there been any increase in prosecutions for breaches of disease regulations?  These are measures which we were promised last year when we were giving the Minister the go-ahead for the increase in the levies we are discussing here today.  We are entitled to know how successful those measures have been.  Are there any changes to be made or does the Minister see the incidence of TB dropping substantially? We are entitled to know that at the present time.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme to date, I suppose, is in the region of £800 million, excluding the administration.  This of course has been a massive drain on Exchequer funds.  I cannot understand why we cannot or have not come to grips with this problem before now, if all this money has been spent on it.  We have the expertise, the advice; we can see what has happened in other European countries; and we must be the laughing stock of Europe to think that all those countries have got their disease under control while here we still find, in 1985 after about 30 years operating the scheme that in certain areas the incidence of disease is higher today than it was ever before.  That is a terrible statement to have to make after spending all this money on that scheme and after draining the Exchequer to the extent of £800 million over those years.  A lot could be done and everybody has to accept responsibility for it.  But the example has to be given by the Government.  The laws are there, if they are enforced.  We can see areas where the scheme can be tightened up, where the law can be applied and where people who are breaking the law can be prosecuted, and are not being prosecuted.</P>
    <P>The one area that I see where there is <Col N="1026" /> complete laxity is in the sale of reactors. This is an area that should be tightened up substantially.  I cannot understand why the vets testing the animals should not be permitted to issue a certificate and have that animal removed to the factory immediately.  As far as I am concerned reactor animals should not be sold to dealers because that is only prolonging and spreading the disease.  I see no reason why those animals could not be sent off to the mart or factory right away and disposed of.  If we are serious about the eradication of the disease all those measures, no matter how drastic they might seem, should be taken and should be enforced to see that this disease is eradicated from our national herd.</P>
    <P>The national herd is very important to the economy.  As regards our exports of live cattle and beef we have gained substantial ground in the European market; we have made our mark in North Africa and Egypt, in Libya, Germany, France and so on.  It is unfortunate that we still have to be struggling with this problem of disease eradication.  The time has come for the Government to be serious about this problem.  It is costing too much money and is causing great hardship to farmers who have their herds locked up for considerable periods of time, which is a great loss to them.  Steps should be taken to minimise the hardship for all those people.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some outline of how successful the scheme has proved which was introduced last year and which is part of the Government's national plan and whether any changes are envisaged in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hussey said that the disease situation had not improved from the day it began.  Back in 1954 in my own parish in Bansha the late Father Hayes, who was a very far-seeing man, started what was then termed a pilot project for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. At that time the level of infection in herds was unbelievably high, so high indeed that if action was not taken at that time on a voluntary basis by farmers &mdash; and in later days by the Department in a <Col N="1027" /> compulsory scheme &mdash; I have no doubt that no market would be available today for our produce, either live cattle or in the whole area of cattle trading at all.  For that reason I would disagree with Senator Hussey when he says that no progress has been made.  We set out that time to ensure that a market would be available for our produce.  I am glad to say that a major achievement of the whole scheme, no matter how slow it has been, is that we have been able to go into the marketplace with animals which have passed a stringent tuberculosis test which ensures that they are available to be sold on the markets, whether it be in Britain, Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  From that point of view the scheme has been successful.  It has involved a lot of effort from many people; from the farmers themselves, who have been the major losers in this whole area; from the veterinary profession, who have put a lot of effort and work into it; and, indeed, from the Department.  As a member of the Animal Health Council I want to commend the officials of the Department on that council who are well aware of the problems of tuberculosis and of what needs to be done to ensure we can achieve a status for our national herd which cannot be surpassed by anybody else in Europe.  We are not aware of the figures from Northern Ireland or Britain but I am sure they also have their isolated pockets and areas and levels of infection.  On a monthly basis Mr. Noonan, who is with us today as an adviser to the Minister, makes available to us statistics from the whole country indicating the level of performance of the testing, the level of reaction to the tests, the level of reactors isolated in the factory and the level of lesions available from animals either tested positive or indeed having been sold as clear cattle.  The Department, in fact, have got their act together on this over the last number of years to such an extent that I am optimistic now, for the first time, that we can deal with this major scandal of disease and disease eradication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also that the media have treated the subject in an unfair manner.  You can <Col N="1028" /> make any figure relative to anything; but if you relate the cost of this scheme to the overall value of the herds, it is a significant contribution to the whole industry.  For that reason it is appropriate that the people involved in this, the farmers, should and have been making a contribution towards the eradication of the disease.  I admit that the plan envisaged that these levies would be eliminated at the end of this year, and I also had hoped that that would be the case. But if one looks at the overall input by Government into the scheme, running at something like £30 million or more &mdash; and possibly over the next three our four years an additional £10 million per annum will be required to really rid the country of this problem &mdash; the contribution made by way of these levies and the continuation of them is proportionate to the risks involved.  Any fair thinking farmer will realise that, like everybody else in the country, people always have to make a contribution in the interests of their own industry.</P>
    <P>We have had some problems in the scheme.  We have had problems with tags, going back as far as I can remember. The IIRS have done a lot of work on it and I think we have made progress on it.  I am pleased that the amount of tag switching that went on in the past has, to all intents and purposes, disappeared. This is because we are able to check back and because of the fact we have perfected a system whereby the advantages in tag switching are not as great as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>There has also been increased levels of compensation.  I would like to see further revaluation of that, if we are to make progress.  There is a social as well as an economic factor involved in the eradication of the disease.  I am pleased that in the past 12 months the Department have come to grips with the whole trauma of depopulation.  For people who are faced with the dreadful situation that all their animals are taken from them, even if they are not all reactors, the additional compensation is of some benefit.  I am suggesting to the Minister and his officers that this part of the scheme should be <Col N="1029" /> constantly reviewed to ensure that the fullest possible participation by and cooperation of herd owners would be forthcoming; and one of the ways to do that is to ensure that adequate compensation is available in the event of reactors being discovered.</P>
    <P>More emphasis will have to be placed on fencing and on the importance of double fencing.  This is an incubating disease. It can strike a herd which has been clear for a long time.  It can spread easily through inadequate fences.  We have the problem of lateral spread &mdash; it is not recognised by many as important, but it is very important &mdash; particularly by wildlife and other movement of animals. Animals move more often here than in any other country in Europe.  This is a transferable disease, it incubates reasonably quickly and can be transmitted from one animal to another at a frightening pace.  However, the levels of disease eradication we have managed to achieve is some recognition of the efforts that have been put in.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department on their development of the epidemiology service. Farmers want to know where they have gone wrong, if they have gone wrong.  They want to know where the disease has come from, expecially when they have taken all the precautions they consider necessary.  When the department get around to installing computers linked up to the various DVOs around the country, that will also make a major contribution to the reduction of the disease levels.</P>
    <P>We must also pay a compliment to everybody concerned for the figures we have achieved in the area of brucellosis eradication.  I look forward in the new year to the Minister making the necessary order to declare our national herd officially brucellosis free.  That would be a major achievement through a scheme which was started because of the widespread economic disaster caused to the owners of herds which were stricken down with brucellosis.  The difference between the two diseases is obvious.  You can immediately recognise brucellosis; you immediately suffer the economic <Col N="1030" /> consequences of an aborted calf and, indeed, of the loss of milk production. For that reason farmers are more aware of that type of disease than they are of tuberculosis.  Tuberculosis is not a visible disease.  Very few animals die of tuberculosis on the farm.  But the reality is that, unless our herds achieve the standards required, we will not have a market, particularly in the UK.</P>
    <P>There are individual pockets of disease around the country which have concerned me over the last 12 months.  There have been outbreaks of disease which nobody could explain.  There were outbreaks in west Tipperary and in other parts of the country which we have now come to grips with because through testing we rooted out the cause of the problem. In this regard the new scheme, in spite of its controversial start, has, assisted the Department in having more regular control over the process of testing, the rate of testing and the distribution of testing.  Credit must be paid to everybody concerned in this, particularly the farmers who have facilitated the veterinary profession and, indeed, the veterinary profession themselves, who initially had reservations about how this new scheme would work.</P>
    <P>From the information available to me on the Animal Health Council I am satisfied that the change was worthwhile.  We are now beginning to see the results we wanted.  The level of testing is right up to the schedule the Department needed. The number of herds locked up, although a worry, is not unexpected because last year the Department, for financial reasons or otherwise, did not carry out a full round of testing.  It is inevitable, when tests are not carried out on a routine basis, when there is still a level of infection around, that the number of reactors initially is likely to be greater than what it would have been if we had continued the full programme of testing.</P>
    <P>However, I would be the first to admit that testing is not the full answer to the eradication of the disease.  We must have farm control of it, we must be conscious of how quickly it can spread and that <Col N="1031" /> testing is only a means of identifying reactors. More work has to be done through the new developments in epidemiology to find out the sources of infection.  If we can all put our backs into this problem, and with the Exchequer's funding and the farmers' funding of the programme, then I believe within a reasonable number of years, we could do something about this scourge of tuberculosis which has been with us for so long.  It was identified first in the fifties and we realised that, if we did not do something about it, we would not have a market left.  For that reason the Department and all concerned who have put so much effort into this have done so for one reason only: to ensure that our national herd remains intact.</P>
    <P>Although I know nobody wants to pay additional contributions, I hope that this money will not be begrudged.  The sooner we can come to grips with the problem the sooner the whole burden of expenditure on the farmer and on the taxpayer will be lightened, because if the problem is dealt with we would then only be required to carry out controlled testing on a nominal basis every second year or so.  But we are still quite a way off from that.  I feel that the present speeding-up of the process will have to be continued for at least two or three more years before we can safely say we have identified how the outbreaks of this disease occur.  We have climatic conditions in this country which other countries do not have to contend with.  We had a disastrous year in farming this year because of the extensive rain and flooding.  Coming into this winter and early spring next year animals will be undernourished, probably underfed, and certainly not as disease resistant as they would have been after a sunny year with ample food.  Therefore, at the end of the present round of testing it would not surprise me if the incidence of tuberculosis was higher, because it strikes at animals which are not healthy and it tends to ravage through herds which have not had an outbreak for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hussey in regard to the disposal of reactors.  Once reactors <Col N="1032" /> are identified it is imperative that they arrive at the factory at the earliest possible opportunity.  That will need the cooperation of the farmer, if animals are in calf, and of the DVO, who would be aware of the outbreak.  A farmer should be visited the moment a reactor is discovered in his herd so that all the advice necessary to protect himself and his neighbours can be given by the Department and the DVO.  I suggest that we should regularise the collection of reactors in some way.  We agreed to do it in regard to brucelosis because the number of reactors is smaller.  If we could also implement it in the case of tuberculosis reactors it would be a major contribution towards ensuring that the disease would not spread from a reactor herd.  There will be problems in that the farmer will have to deal with a named factory, which, possibly, he may feel may not give the best price for reactor cattle in that week. That is the only disadvantage of a centralised collection system.  At the moment the farmer has the choice of picking out his own factory and moving the animal himself to the factory giving the best possible price in his area.</P>
    <P>The whole problem of disposal of reactors is something we will have to grapple with quickly, because these animals are a source of infection.  I hope the farming community will accept this situation, unpalatable and all as it might be.  It is in their own interest, in the interest of the national herd and indeed, in the interest of the common good.  From a human health point of view, too, it is important that our national herd should be as healthy as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope that the regulations will be subject to review if the time comes when this additional income is not required to supplement Exchequer funding.  By that time the farmers will have contributed enough to the eradication of the disease. One cannot really be compensated for the loss of good animals which are producing milk and are part of one's herd. Herd owners become attached to animals they have bred themselves.  It is important that we all have a responsibility in this area.  The farmers, through their losses, <Col N="1033" /> have made a major contribution in the past: they have been the only real losers in this whole area of eradication.  Anything we can do to help them in that regard would be appreciated.  I do not think they will begrudge this increase in the levies if it helps to reduce the incidence of disease from its present national level of 3.6 per cent.  If we dig in our heels, ignore the media and do what we have to do as a nation, then our national herd will be the better for it and our own economic situation will be improved as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In a year when we have had the most disastrous summer on record, which obviously had a very considerable impact on reducing farm incomes, the Minister of State this evening has brought in a nice additional Christmas box for the farming community.  While I have no fundamental argument against the principle of farmer contribution towards the management, marketing and protection of the health of the national herd, this increase should have carried with it some more positive approach from the Minister. After all, it is only five or six months ago, on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, that the Minister for Agriculture stated that by the end of 1985 he was proposing to halve the levy contribution from the farming community. Instead of fulfilling that promise taken from that bible of the National Coalition <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; now tattered and torn, pages added in and some taken out &mdash; we now have a situation where, once again, you have gone back on your own promises, your own statements and your own commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I consider a two-page statement, in which a Government are going back on their own principle is an insufficient indication to this House why this drastic change of plan was necessary.  We do have some statistics in relation to present levels of TB and brucellosis.  I, like other speakers, acknowledge the great strides that have been made with regard to the eradication of brucellosis.  Instead of blaming the media, as Senator Ferris <Col N="1034" /> has done, for highlighting the cost of disease eradication in the context of the contribution by the taxpayer generally, we should not hide a situation where mistakes were made.  Any sensible person looking at it would have to say that we did not have a consistent approach to the eradication of tuberculosis in our national herd.  For two years we did not do any testing at all.</P>
    <P>There is no point in blaming veterinary surgeons, Departmental officials or the press for this.  There were other periods when moneys were voted for disease eradication and, large as it may have looked to the taxpayer and to the community at large, it might have been more beneficial if we had looked at this disease once and for all and said: &ldquo;we will have a five-year plan and get down to the guts of what is wrong and tackle it in a much more streamlined and disciplined way.&rdquo; The character of the operation of the scheme over the last 30 years does not convince me that the political approach towards this disease carried the impact which was necessary.  It is clear from the Minister's statement that the improved situation which has operated this year &mdash; and I acknowledge this &mdash; has detected more animals infected by disease.  The incidence of 3.62 per cent is higher than one would have expected but it may be that with the greater intensity in testing we are detecting more animals and removing them more quickly.</P>
    <P>I welcome this but if you look back over the period of the last 30 years, how many times did we have this streamlining and disciplined, continued effort between different Governments coming in and out of office?  We certainly did not have it. Therefore, I say that we should not cry too much about what the media might say from time to time in relation to the expenditure on this because there were flaws.  There are not sufficient funds provided for research into the character and durability of the TB germ.  Unlike the bruscella it can live in extremely difficult circumstances for very long periods.  A veterinary specialist told me that it could live for as long as two years even in <Col N="1035" /> cement.  If this is true it indicates its durability and the necessity to have on a continual basis, without interruption, a streamlined, disciplined and co-ordinated effort to deal with the overall situation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to my original point, that we have a dramatic change of face by the Government and we get no explanation as to why this has happened. Instead of telling us that he is to carry out what he promised last May, the Minister has proposed to increase the amounts of the levies.  This perhaps would be acceptable &mdash; regrettable though it is in a year which has been devastating for farming &mdash; if it incorporated some notion from the Minister as to how he is to spend this money.  I have an abhorrence of increases of this kind when we are not made aware what is to happen to the additional money.  Is it being sucked back into the Exchequer?  Is the Minister going to provide additional aid to the special groups in the farming areas that have been badly hit by the weather conditions with supplemental aid for fodder or what is he now proposing to do with funds which last May were not required?  In fact he stated that the amounts needed would be substantially less in 1986 than in 1985?  In view of these contradictions and in relation to the bad year we have had, that is a sensible question and it is one which the Minister should answer.</P>
    <P>As I have left a meeting to attend this debate and should like to return there, I am making a brief contribution to this debate.  I should like the Minister to address himself to the questions I have posed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris, who is a member of the Animal Health Council, has covered this area very well.  I, like the other Members of the House, who have spoken and those who have yet to speak, do not welcome any increase in levies.  We all dislike any increases in levies but in the circumstances there is not much that can be done about it.  Farmers who have had to suffer the effects <Col N="1036" /> of this disease for many years would be happy to continue paying, at least during 1986 and for a few years after that, if they thought that at the end of that time we would have got to grips with the disease and have complete eradication.  I have had personal experience of the disease. The greatest loser in this is the farmer. Sentor Ferris pointed this out.  Many farmers have lost their livelihoods because of this disease.  Most of them, if not all of them, had complied with the regulations down through the years.  For some unknown and unexplained reason, this disease can hit herds which have all been reared on the one farm and which have not been bought in.  When we make inquiries we cannot get an explanation as to how this happens.</P>
      <P>Down through the years we have had all sorts of accusations made: the veterinary surgeons were blamed; the farmers were blamed and the cattle dealers were blamed on a great number of occasions. I do not know who shares the blame.  It could never be put fairly and squarely on the shoulders of anybody at any particular time.  What matters now is the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government have taken a positive step within the past 12 months to get to grips with this problem. Speaking as a herd owner, I would not mind paying disease levies if I felt there was some light at the end of the tunnel.  Down through the years we have had reasons put forward why we were not getting to grips, with the problems.  There were veterinary strikes.  Cattle move three, four or five times from farm to farm during their lifetime.  This happens more often in this country than in any other country in the EEC.  Herdowners have another axe to grind, which is the level of compensation for cattle.  This was rectified to a certain extent but not necessarily for the younger stock.  While progress has been made in relation to compensation, it is still not adequate.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you would give me an opportunity to speak for about half a minute.  Unfortunately I was detained and I gather I missed, by about ten minutes, the previous item with regard to the draft Social Welfare Regulations. I know that Professor Dooge very kindly expressed my appreciation of the Minister's action in bringing in these regulations but I should like the opportunity, in about two sentences, to add my personal appreciation of the way in which the Minister for Social Welfare dealt with this matter when I approached him about it and how quickly he managed to deal with it so that the regulations have been able to be brought in before Christmas. I know there were only very few auxiliary ministers of the Church of Ireland affected but nevertheless each individual was very severely affected in that they were in danger of losing their entire social welfare entitlement.  I would like to personally express my appreciation of the speedy way in which the Minister dealt with this and the successful way in which this business has been concluded.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Mullooly on Wednesday, 11 December 1985:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government (a) to re-assert their commitment to the agreed procedures of Conciliation and Arbitration for teachers and (b) to enter into immediate <Col N="1038" /> discussions with the three teacher unions.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that in keeping with the Government's adherence to the agreed provisions of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for teachers, steps are being taken to convene a meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council to discuss the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Dooge.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned when I was speaking last week certain aspects with regard to the arbitration system and how it was set up.  In this case the public service arbitrator awarded teachers a 10 per cent pay increase in two phases.  The first phase of the award was to take effect from 1 September 1985 and the second phase from 1 March 1986.  This 10 per cent was half of what the teachers sought in their submissions to the Government. The public service arbitrator who was appointed by the Government is chairman of the teachers' arbitration board. Following the hearing of a claim it is his duty to decide on the amount of an award, if any, to be made and to present his recommendations in a report to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Government and the unions concerned have always considered themselves bound by the recommendations of the arbitrator.  In the present case, however, the public service arbitrator drew up his draft report in accordance with established practice and supplied copies to the parties.  However, contrary to established practice, some person or persons decided for their own purposes to leak the terms of the draft report to the media.  All the indications are that the leaks came from Government sources.  I would ask the question: why?  Obviously, it was to prepare the ground publicly to scrap arbitration awards or to test the <Col N="1039" /> teachers' reaction.  The teachers' reaction was simply one of fury.  They have been appalled at the devious underhand attempts to leak the terms of the award. They feel that they have been insulted by the Minister lecturing them on the morality of their claim.</P>
    <P>It prompts me to ask the question: who was immoral?  The teachers, who went through the normal channels to present a claim and abided by the guidelines laid down, or the people who broke confidence and leaked the terms of the draft? On 19 August, the Minister, in a singularly inept and offensive attack on public service unions and the teachers' unions in particular, made the demand that those organisations who publicly clamour for increases should address themselves to the morality of what they are about.  I do not believe that it was a slip of the tongue. It seemed at the time to be a deliberately calculated insult by the Minister or her mentors.</P>
    <P>I would ask this House to stop and think: who prepares the children for their first holy communion, confirmation, teaches them their prayers and inculcates in them a love of God and country?  Who has kept the idea of the Gaelic Ireland alive?  Who has nurtured the youth of Ireland in the skills of Gaelic football and hurling?  Who but the teachers?  This is hardly the work of an immoral band of people.</P>
    <P>The one-day strikes and rally in Croke Park and the march to Leinster House were supported by the vast majority of teachers.  They were not led by their executives into hasty action, as the Government would like us to believe. They led their executives.  Teachers, old and young, travelled from all parts of the country at their own expense and at the loss of a day's pay.  They feel very hurt and insulted by the Government's attitude towards them.  The children have suffered also.  Is this the kind of confrontation the Government want in our schools?</P>
    <P>As I mentioned last week, there has been peace in our schools for countless years.  The teachers are a peaceful and <Col N="1040" /> conservative group of people.  They are being driven out of their schools and on to the streets by Government action. Twenty thousand teachers sat in the Hogan Stand listening to their executives. They vowed that their campaign will continue until justice is done.  It is a curious twist of fate that the headquarters of the GAA, in the founding of which the teachers played such a noble part, should be the scene of their protest against unjust treatment by this Government. As the arbitrator said, it would be unjust to single out the teachers and reduce their award.  To my knowledge teachers have co-operated in all the educational advances proposed by the Department of Education over the years and, indeed, have initiated many of them themselves.</P>
    <P>We have an educational system in Ireland of which we can be proud.  It is one of the most advanced in Europe. Yet, at the same time, as figures to date will prove it is the most underfinanced educational system in Europe, with the highest teacher-pupil ratio.  Savage cutbacks in education have put great strain on those involved in the educational process. The teacher-pupil ratio has not been lowered for many years.  What used to be an annual audio-visual grant is now given every fourth or fifth year.  Grants for the repainting of schools have been abolished. Caretakers and school secretaries are not being replaced.  Necessary repairs to buildings are now engulfed in governmental red tape for years with the result that many fine schools all over the country are decaying at an alarming rate. There is a serious shortage of remedial teachers and career guidance counsellors for the pupils in our schools.</P>
    <P>Teachers have a further problem on their hands at present, and they have had this problem for a number of years. Corporal punishment, which I do not fully approve of, was abolished with the stroke of a pen by a former Minister.  A code of discipline which was promised has never, to my knowledge, replaced corporal punishment.  It is against that background that I speak in support of the motion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> I come from an area in North Meath where we are awaiting a school extension to our post-primary school and gymnasium which had been promised as far back as 1969.  We are awaiting a replacement roof in our national school.  The school was only built a few short years ago but the roof has deteriorated to such an extent that teachers have to use umbrellas&mdash; believe it or not &mdash; in a classroom. We are awaiting new schools in the town of Ceanannus Mór, in the village of Bobber and in Castlepollard.  It is in this mood of frustration that teachers find themselves today in serious conflict with this Government.</P>
    <P>Our motion is very clear and specific. It simply calls on this Government to re-assert their commitment to the agreed procedures of conciliation and arbitration for teachers and to enter into immediate discussions with the three teachers' unions.  When I look at the amendment tabled by the Government parties I fail to understand why they feel it is necessary to table such an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the motion and the amendment to the motion reference is made to the agreed procedures of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers.  In this connection I would like to say a few words on the purpose of the C and A Scheme and how it operates.</P>
      <P>The present C and A Scheme dates from 1973 and is a common scheme covering teachers in national, secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community schools.  This scheme replaced three separate schemes which had been set up in the 1950's for national, secondary and vocational teachers.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the scheme is to provide means for dealing with claims and proposals relating to the salaries and other emoluments payable to whole-time serving pensionable teachers in national, secondary, vocational, comprehensive and community schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parties to the scheme are the three teacher unions &mdash; INTO, ASTI and TUI &mdash; the managerial authorities of national, <Col N="1042" /> secondary and vocational schools and the Ministers for Education and the Public Service.</P>
    <P>It is stated in paragraph 2 of the scheme that its existence &ldquo;does not imply that the Government have surrendered or can surrender their liberty of action in the exercise of their constitutional authority and the discharge of their responsibilities in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is provision in the scheme for the process of conciliation and the process of arbitration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conciliation process, there is a conciliation council at which all parties to the scheme are represented. Claims or proposals relating to the pay of teachers may be submitted by parties to the conciliation council.  If agreement is reached, such agreement is recorded in an agreed report of the council and the report is submitted to the two Ministers.  I should mention that the council can only make recommendations and it is a matter for the Ministers to decide whether to accept or reject such recommendations.  Agreed recommendations of the council have invariably been accepted by the Ministers.</P>
    <P>If agreement is not reached on a claim, disagreement may be recorded in an agreed report of the council.  If the subject of the claim is listed among those items which may be arbitrated under the scheme, the claim may be referred to the Arbitration Board for Teachers.</P>
    <P>All of the parties to the scheme are represented on the Arbitration Board. The chairman of the board is an independent person, normally a Senior Counsel, who is appointed by the Government, on the nomination of the Ministers, in agreement with the other parties to the scheme.  Also on the Arbitration Board there are two representatives of the Labour Court, one of whom represents employer and the other employee interests.</P>
    <P>When the board has considered a claim the chairman submits a report on the claim to the two Ministers.  The report of the board is, in effect, the report of the chairman.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the C and A <Col N="1043" /> Scheme the Government have three months from the date of receiving the signed report to decide whether to implement or modify or reject the findings of the Arbitration Board.  If at the end of that period of three months payment has not been authorised, the scheme requires that the Government introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann proposing rejection or modification or deferment of a final decision until the budget for the next financial year is being framed.</P>
    <P>It is against the foregoing background that the motion and the amendment fall to be considered.  I would urge on all concerned that the most important requirement at this point in time is that everything possible should be done to facilitate a resolution of the current dispute with the teachers unions.  This applies to the Government and to myself as Minister for Education.  It applies also to this assembly and I believe that the views I have expressed accord with the feeling on both sides of the House.  It applies to the teacher unions and to the teachers.  It applies to everyone with the interest of education at heart.  I, and the Government, are firmly dedicated to the resolution of the dispute.  I am satisfied, therefore, that the least said about the situation at this time the better.  The House will be aware that a meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council took place on Monday last and that it has since been agreed that the Minister for the Public Service and myself should meet the teacher unions.  I am hopeful that our meeting, which has been arranged for 2 January, will bear fruit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's short speech here this evening.  It is better to put the claim for who is responsible for the current dispute at the door of the Minister and the Department and not on the teachers.  I appreciate what the Minister is saying: that the least said at this delicate time the better.  But, at the same time, I must say a few words.  This upset need not have taken the path it took.  The teachers themselves, and certainly <Col N="1044" /> the people around them, will not forget this uspet for some time.  They did not want to take the days off and they did not want to march.  The teachers we are dealing with are, on the whole, a responsible body.  They did not intend at any time to stand up to the Minister and the Government.  I would worry that if they accept what is now being said and this possible change of heart, they may yet be conned in the end.  Again they are showing their goodwill in accepting the Minister's change of thinking.  The move this evening certainly takes heat out of some very sad weeks that have gone by. The teachers' cause was just and from day one the Government knew &mdash; and if they did not there are very foolish people in the Government &mdash; that they would find themselves in the end having to talk to the teachers.  I suppose using the word &ldquo;having to talk&rdquo; or saying that any group should make a Government do anything may be too severe.  It would be much better if the decision taken around Cabinet this week was taken some weeks ago. We would have had less upset.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of propaganda and talk in recent weeks about the hours teachers work and the soft jobs they have.  I could not support the view that they have short hours in class and long holidays.  If I were to single out any group as being very committed to their jobs after the nurses of this nation, I would have to single out the teachers. Their claim started in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many meetings with the conciliation council.  The three teacher unions talked to the Department but no offer whatsoever was made to the teachers' side.  The claim was referred to independent arbitration.  Maybe this is where the hassle started, because the very concept of the negotiation machinery was being challenged.  This award to the teachers is the outcome of that negotiation machinery and the direct result of the independent third party investigation of a claim with arguments on both sides. At no time &mdash; and I repeat again at no time &mdash; did those teachers intend to teach this present Government a lesson.  I would not feel as strongly as I do here <Col N="1045" /> this evening &mdash; and for some weeks past &mdash; if I felt that that was what the teachers were trying to do.  We must remember that they have a greater role in this nation than they had in past times.  I am quite sure that the Minister, as a parent as well as a Minister of this Government, would agree with me that there is probably a greater responsibility on teachers today because of the change in the situation in many homes.  There are many homes in this country where the pupil has only the teacher to turn to.  That might sound soft when it is being said, but that is the reality of the Ireland outside this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to arbitration there were private letters to Ministers.  The point of the arbitrator's letter was clarified and it confirmed his position.  He felt that needed to be done because of media comments. This letter was used again by some person to suggest that he had changed his mind.  In the letter he said that as was mentioned in the arbitrator's report he recognised the position of the State finances but in the final analysis it was the Government's decision whether or not to honour &mdash; and pay &mdash; the award. He further stated that this did not alter his recommendation.  A day or two later he stated that his letter was private and was only clarifying the position and not altering his original recommendation. Figures are thrown around again about the cost of this award.  They should be put on the record.  This is not over at all yet, and having listened to the Minister's speech I do not know what the teachers are going to get.  I appreciate that she could not tell us this evening when she intends to talk to the teachers.</P>
    <P>Let us put this right again.  Figures are being thrown around here by the Government back-up boys and the Press indicating that the cost of this award is in the remainder of the year 1985 £7.9 million, when actually the net cost is £4 million. There is a figure of £53 to £60 million for the year 1986 when actually the correct figure is £26 million net.  Let us get the record right before we do any more.  Let us get the figures right, too.  We also have been told that the Irish teacher is being paid much more than his EC counterpart. <Col N="1046" /> We have not been told that it takes that same teacher 26 years to reach his maximum salary when he is 50 years of age.  While we are being told about the money they have in the EC there is no record of the number of pupils per teacher in the classroom.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment by Ministers and, indeed, by the Taoiseach about who started this strike.  The leaks were directly responsible for the sadness that followed them.  I do not know who leaded the document.  There was some leak again in the past few days.  The unions of which the teachers are members could not ignore these remarks. They have to respond.  There were comments about the two days off for the protests.  Everyone of us here who has reared children knows well that two days less schooling is not going to make one whit of a difference to a child.  The teachers are being accused also of not taking into account the finances of the nation. We all know here about the finances of the nation.  We will know it better when the budget figures come before us shortly. I want to quote the arbitrator's report which reads:</P>
    <P>Full regard has been taken of the economic state, but this cannot mean that the claim should be rejected.  Such an approach would constitute an unjustified discrimination against the teachers as distinct from all other professional grades in the public service.</P>
    <P>Let us all be quite clear on what the teachers are asking for.  They are not asking for more money than their counterparts in other Departments.  They are only asking for parity with others of their grade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mary O'Rourke asked in the Dáil that the teachers should be met.  I am glad that the Minister now thinks it fit to meet the teachers.  I hope that the whole position will work out well.  I feel sad that the situation has reached the stage it has.  They did not want to march, but somebody decided to be tough.  I am not saying it was the Minister who decided to be tough.  Perhaps it was some of her advisers who made the decision.  I <Col N="1047" /> am not supposed to criticise them.  Where do we go?</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly last week, and Senator Kirwan also, asked for this meeting. I am glad, even in this week before Christmas, that commonsense has prevailed. I hope I will be proved wrong but I feel there is nothing here to say that the teachers are going to get their due.  There is no politics in this where I am concerned and that is a bit unusual for me.  I see the role of teachers in this nation, particularly in the housing estates, as greater and tougher than it used to be.  They have commitment to their jobs.  They are only asking to be brought into line with their counterparts in other sections of the economy.  I appeal to the Minister to grant them their award.  We are all worried that after 35 years the whole machinery seems to have been ignored.  It was a crazy step, with due respect to the Minister through the Chair to ignore the advice given in the arbitration award.  I ask the Minister again to replace the chairman. We have learned a hard lesson.  I hope that more talking will be done and that you will award the teachers what they are due.  The teachers did not intend taking that line, but they were driven to it.  I appeal to you this Christmas week to grant the teachers their award.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somebody who might be described as having an average exposure to teaching and teaching problems in that scarcely one year has passed since I was a practising teacher.  I have been vice-chairman of a vocational education committee, I have sat on numerous boards of management and, therefore, I can claim to have a fairly thorough and intimate knowledge of the strains, stresses and tensions, both financial and otherwise, that confront teachers. Nowadays teachers face stresses, strains, tensions and pressures that heretofore were not the lot of their predecessors. What we have to do in this debate is to be as detached, as objective and as unemotive as possible and to address ourselves to the facts as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> We must look at the special pay award which arrived on the desk of the Minister for the Public Service on 5 December 1985.  The award is barely two weeks on the Minister's desk and we have already had pre-emptive strikes, marches, objections and emotionally supercharged debates in this House and in the other House.  We have had a lot of disruptive action.  We have heard many emotive phrases about leaks.  It has been implied in this House that the leak has come, if not from the Minister, then from some Government source.  Despite the fact that it came through the airwaves of Radio Telefís Éireann on 7 August, the educational correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Christina Murphy, stated on 14 November: &ldquo;This correspondent understands that the source certainly was not the Government&rdquo;.  That was from an objective independent analyst whose job it is to objectively analyse evidence of all matters pertaining and relating to education.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch used the words &ldquo;underhanded and insulting&rdquo; in relation to the leak.  That is the type of remark that should not be made in this House nor in any forum without adequate evidence of the fact that it came from a Government source.  On 14 August the Government issued the public pay guidelines.  On 19 August, as a result of this so-called leak, the secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland was quoted in the papers as saying that the teachers unions were having meetings with their British counterparts on the mechanics of selective strikes and that if they went ahead they would be aimed at Mr. Boland's and Mrs. Hussey's constituencies. The Minister said that the Government do not have the money to pay.  That is a fact.  The Government do not have the money to pay any of the other 59 special awards that are now waiting in the pipeline to be discharged, dealt with and paid. The net loss to the Government by way of revenue is a mere £24 million.  It is the gross cost that has to be addressed, and the gross cost of this claim is £60 million. It is very significant in any economic context but it is particularly significant in <Col N="1049" /> terms of the public sector pay talks that are currently underway.  This £60 million, if paid, would represent a 2 per cent increase in the pay of every single public servant in Ireland.  Therefore to wave it aside with a flash of the hand and to say that it is of little consequence is facile and simplistic in the extreme.  It would have profound implications for public pay.</P>
    <P>It is also understandable that the Government would try to have this pay award dealt with within the framework of current on-going negotiations with regard to the public service pay agreement. One of the liabilities or handicaps of teachers is that there are too many of us; I say &ldquo;us&rdquo; because I am also one of them.  There are 40,000 teachers in all. When one looks at the 1985 bill of £724 million one sees that teachers' pay represents 80 per cent of the total education budget.  Something has to suffer when you are dealing with limited resources. I would dearly hate to see curriculum development or any other of the many facets currently being developed by the Minister suffering to any degree.  The teachers unions will be the last to subscribe to that view.  I make my remarks as a teacher.  There was an over-hasty and spontaneous reaction to the initial divulgence of this award.  The Government have not yet decided what has been done in this regard.</P>
    <P>I, along with all the Members of the House, welcome the commitment by the Minister to meet the unions face to face on 2 January 1986.  It is one of the many problems and one of the many special awards with which the Government have to deal.  It is the reverse of the position that pertained in 1980 when a special tribunal on teachers' pay made a recommendation of 7 to 17 per cent increase. On that occasion the teachers threatened to strike.  I understand that there was an all-night meeting with the then Minister, Deputy John Wilson.  At that time the teachers eventually triumphed and got a special pay award of 12 to 34 per cent. That was on top of the national wage agreement that operated at that time. Some people say the teachers are well paid; others say they are not well paid. <Col N="1050" /> Teachers are reasonably paid; they have an average wage.  A 20-year-old graduating from a college of education as a primary teacher starts off with a salary of £9,749 per year.  A secondary teacher with an honours degree and a higher diploma gets £10,360 per year.  A teacher with a post of responsibility can rise to £17,049 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Principals of schools can rise to a maximum of £24,000 per year.  I take the point made by Senator Honan that very often teachers are castigated and derided by virtue of the fact that they are alleged to teach for only 180 days in the year and that at times there is not adequate cognisance of the amount of extra curricular duty and activity.  The total professional commitment which they give on every occasion is something that is relevant in rural Ireland where they are expected to be involved in every community organisation.  One of the problems of teachers is that it takes them 23 years &mdash; and not 26 years, as Senator Honan said &mdash; to reach the maximum of the scale.  It seems to be a long time.</P>
      <P>One of the problems to which the teachers should be addressing themselves is the burden of taxation, which hits everybody across the PAYE sector and largely nullifies the salaries they receive. I know that some teachers find it difficult to make ends meet.  I appreciate that at times it is difficult for teachers to see their pupils passing through their hands, entering third level and being able to avail of third level grants &mdash; I am not saying free, gratis and for nothing but at the expense of the taxpayer &mdash; while they themselves at times are unable, by virtue of financial pressure, to send their own children to such colleges without incurring some considerable liability.  But I do not think that the type of action that has been undertaken in this case is the answer to their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was visited by teachers' unions and I had to address them to the fact that we have now gone from a situation where we had 21 per cent inflation down to 5 per cent inflation.  Petrol prices have come <Col N="1051" /> down 6 per cent in the last 12 months. Our balance of payments are on the right side.  The nuts and bolts and components of the economy are beginning to come right.  A pay increase now of £10 in real terms means only £3 into one's pocket. The consequences for the economy in terms of blowing the lid off it again would totally negative the consequent advantages. It is a shortsighted objective to go head, neck and heels for a 10 per cent award in view of the fact that within a relatively short period of time spiralling inflation will more than cancel out the consequent effect.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I take exception to the remarks made in relation to the Minister. I heard Senator Mullooly saying it was more about pay, about standards and about resources for education.  I would say again, as Senator Bulbulia said, that no other Minister has devoted more to capital expenditure than the present Minister for Education.  No other Minister has tackled outstanding problems in relation to curriculum development, and in relation to other areas such as the need to regionalise education, than the present Minister.  We have had unprecedented, imaginative initiatives.</P>
    <P>In relation to my county, this month last year the Minister opened the new vocational school on Achill Island, there is a new vocational school in Belmullet, a new vocational school in Castlebar, a commitment to a new regional technical college in Castlebar, 12 new primary schools underway at present and a new community school committed for Ballinrobe. This is the type of commitment that counters very effectively the nebulous criticism from anybody who would dare to slight the Minister.  The Minister is a lady who has a knowledge of the job, who has a grasp of the job, who is forward thinking, imaginative and, I am sure, has the necessary understanding and ability to deal competently with the problem that now confronts her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak briefly and with restraint on this motion.  The Minister in her own brief contribution <Col N="1052" /> called for a certain restraint and sensitivity. She said:</P>
      <P>I would urge on all concerned that the most important requirement at this point in time is that everything possible should be done to facilitate a resolution of the current dispute with the teachers' unions.</P>
      <P>I am sure that on all sides of the House there would be agreement with that.  But my main point in contributing to this debate is to say that it is by no means the only issue.  Even at this delicate stage we must be aware of the importance of the broader framework issue which is at the back of the dispute as it is called.  As a society we cannot place enough emphasis on the importance of both safeguarding and confirming the role of conciliation and arbitration machinery.  It has served us well down the years.  It has frequently meant that it is the union side which has had to take the hard decisions and accept them because they are as a result of arbitration. It is of incredible value as a way of getting a kind of social contract, of getting agreement because the ground rules are laid and adhered to.  In any society, if you do not accept the ground rules, value the importance of them and ensure that they are adhered to, you take an enormous risk.  The Minister might well say that nobody has broken the ground rules here because, as has been pointed out, the agreement only reached her desk at a date in December and has the three months to run.  We all know that.  That is a debating point that can very well be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since early August we have had a very worrying situation.  In this House, without being too political about it, we can reflect on that situation.  It is probably more important for us to address this motion than the specifics of the teachers' dispute for the very good reason, as the Minister pointed out, that she is going to have negotiations in very early January on the specifics.  On the values and the broader framework, it is probably more important in Ireland in 1985, going into 1986, that we adhere to the ground rules and the machinery than at any time in <Col N="1053" /> the last 35 years, because it has never been so clear what the dimension of the problems is.  Senator Higgins referred, very honestly and speaking as a teacher, with considerable courage to the extent of the problems that we face.  I would agree in large measure with the points he made.  We cannot run away from them or be superficial about them.  We have enormous problems on the budgetary side.  We have enormous problems in meeting any pay commitments, and we have to be aware of that.  But we also have problems as a society of how we move and actually make progress.</P>
    <P>What happened?  I do not even want to talk about the details of who was right, who leaked, and who made a speech that he or she might not have made in August if they were being very wise about the position.  What I am talking about is the undermining of an important process. There is no doubt at all that the trade union leadership of the teachers' union reflect the grass roots on this.  There is very real hurt, annoyance and fury at the grass roots level, not so much at the actual cost which is included in that 10 per cent but because that side of the bargaining process had been negotiated over a period of years, that the claim had been taken step by step, submitted to the independent arbitrator and that it had as they knew, been ruled upon at that stage. It was being said (a) that they were immoral in insisting upon it and (b) that it could not be paid.  There is actually a distinction to be drawn between the ability of the Government to pay and the importance of safeguarding, validating and confirming the conciliation and arbitration process.  They are two different things.  The importance is to confirm the process and confirm it in the sense of accepting an award which emerges from the process.  If at that stage the situation warrants it, it is possible to consider opening discussion on phasing in, for example, what is agreed to have been awarded by the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>I am saying this as a lay observer.  I am not really a teacher, though I do teach part time at third level.  I do not claim to be somebody with an expert minute <Col N="1054" /> knowledge of this particular dispute.  I have the kind of knowledge that most Members of the House have.  I follow it in the media and have met the teachers unions' representatives.  I have received some information from that side.  I have also received some information, as I am sure other Members of the House have. It is likely that the Minister will now enter into a discussion with the tachers' unions and one of the issues that may be on the table is the question of a possible phasing in of the arbitration award.  I do not know, but if that is the case then we as a society have paid a very high price since August for reaching that position.</P>
    <P>Important representative unions who have accepted the ground rules, who have played them and who have brought members along with a time lag involved in playing them, saw that being undermined. The whole trade union movement saw it.  It actually sends the kind of tremor through the system that we cannot afford. I believe firmly &mdash; and I share Senator Higgins' point and, I am sure, so does the Minister &mdash; that we have to take very hard decisions over the next few years, particularly those of us who have jobs and who are in secure employment.  Let us not run away from that.  It is absolutely vital that we take very hard decisions, and that means the trade union leaders are going to have to sell very hard decisions to their own members.  But you do not get that kind of debate going or any willingness to listen if you undermine or erode the only possible established system.  It is extremely important that we confirm it.  One step in the process is to re-appoint an arbitrator, either the existing arbitrator or some other arbitrator. That confirms a willingness to accept the process.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her brief speech outlined the arbitration machinery.  She referred to the fact that there is a custom &mdash; it is certainly the position with the outgoing arbitrator &mdash; that the arbitrator is a senior counsel.  I would like to reflect a little bit on that arbitration process and on the hearing before the arbitrator, because a lawyer is basically trained either to accept a brief or, in the case of <Col N="1055" /> the arbitrator, to listen to the evidence and to come to an independent decision.</P>
    <P>One of the issues we could look at in this dispute is how well the Government case was presented to the arbitrator and how clearly was it brought home what the Government were going to say afterwards. Putting the evidence before the arbitrator is one thing, because then you make your case strongly and cogently and adduce your facts and figures.  The arbitrator, as an independent lawyer with legal training, assesses the evidence and comes to a decision.  But if you have not done your homework before the arbitrator you cannot afterwards say &ldquo;We are changing the rules.  We will not play the game.  We are invoking the clause allowing the possibility of a motion before the Dáil because we cannot afford to pay this&rdquo;.  Nothing has been decided, but all these issues have been raised.  It is the raising of these issues and the undermining of the process of conciliation and arbitration that I have been very concerned about.  I believe it certainly affects the teachers' unions.  It has also affected the whole trade union movement at the worst possible time in our development of the country and with the particularly difficult decisions we have to face into.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators Higgins and Honan who made the point that it would be a tragedy if one of the short term effects was that was that we did not see early progress on the positive side of development in education.  I pay tribute to the Minister for the initiatives she has taken in the area of the curriculum and for at least beginning a process in relation to the devolution of powers.  These are very important issues which should be discussed, because they require very considerable discussion and consultation before there can be any beginnings of a draft of a possible Bill or decision-making process on it.  Therefore, the lead time is long.  At the moment the process is not commenced because there is no willingness for a discussion.  That is very sad indeed.  For that reason, as well as the other reasons, I hope there will be an <Col N="1056" /> early resolution of this dispute in the context of validating the framework so that we can ensure that there is a willingness to enter into broader negotiations on established ground rules, the only basis for our society to cope with these powers.</P>
    <P>There is another value which has been touched on by Members who have contributed and that is the commitment and dedication of individuals teachers.  I do not really disagree with the analysis of Senator Higgins on this point.  I would agree with his estimate that to a considerable section of the people &mdash; those who are unemployed, dependent on social welfare and those in low-paid jobs &mdash; teachers seem to be well paid and secure and to have good hours and reasonable perks.  Teachers feel that their income has been eroded, that they cannot do for their children what teachers were able to do a decade or a decade and a half ago. That is also true.  The erosion is not as abrupt or as harsh as it would for somebody who becomes redundant or finds that they no longer have security of employment or the pay that they had. Nonetheless, there has been an erosion for teachers as for other income groups.</P>
    <P>We have had and still have in Ireland something of inestimable value, and that is the dedication and commitment of teachers &mdash; I am not saying all teachers but we have a high proportion of dedicated teachers.  Here I would simply refer to my own subjective impression &mdash; I could not call it an analysis &mdash; in talking quite a bit at seminars or discussion groups in other countries &mdash; in the United States in particular and in Britain to a certain extent &mdash; about problems in relations to schools stemming from a lack of commitment by teachers.  It is a horrendous problem where the approach of the teacher is completely different from our broad perception.  We must be very aware of this.  It is probably the most fundamentally important contribution to education and it must be continued and not in any way undermined or eroded.</P>
    <P>I did not want to refer to or in any way complicate a delicate situation but I want to emphasise very strongly the importance of the machinery of conciliation and <Col N="1057" /> arbitration, the importance of building on the ground rules that we have for resolving these disputes, not undermining them, and of facing up to the fact that we are going to have to make very hard decisions indeed.  Those of us in employment are going to have to face up to the fact that over the next half decade at least in Ireland we will face a continuing erosion of our incomes.  But we are lucky because if we are in employment it will be gradual rather than the kind of sudden shock or harsh reality which so many of our fellow citizens have to cope with.</P>

      <P>It is important that the opportunity would be afforded of putting the Labour Party position on the record of the House.  As spokesperson on education I had the opportunity of meeting the general presidents and the general secretaries of the three teachers' unions to discuss the whole issue of teachers' pay and the dispute that has arisen.  I had that opportunity together with other members of the Parliamentary Labour Party.  The discussions ended in an understanding between the members of the parliamentary party and the teachers' unions on our position on the issue, what we wanted and what our views were.  We should put that position on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bill Norton, a Labour Minister, established the system of conciliation and arbitration for the public sector.  The use of conciliation and arbitration machinery for the processing of claims has always been supported by my party.  The present claim has gone through those established machineries.  Therefore, as I have stated in public statements previously, the integrity of the arbitrator's award must be accepted by us.  To do anything else would be to devalue and, indeed seriously damage the mechanism that was so carefully built up over the years and that has been in this case rigidly adhered to.  It is a cause of deep concern and sincere regret that we have already experienced disturbances in classroom work at this relatively early stage in the negotiations and in the processing of this claim.  The claim <Col N="1058" /> is still before the Government and still subject to machinery.  The time is available for the decision to be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The causes of the interruptions, therefore, are a source of grave annoyance to politicians and parents.  The sources of that aggravation are a cause of dispute. However, a matter on which there is agreement around this House is that some of the blame must be levelled at some Cabinet Ministers whose attitudes I do not think have been helpful in the whole processing of the claim.  I welcome the decision to defer further work stoppages until the deadline for a Cabinet decision has been arrived at.  This decision will be welcomed by all concerned. Many Senators, particularly Senator Robinson just now and Senator Higgins before her, outlined again the difficulties faced by Government in meeting this award.  Those difficulties cannot be minimised by anybody nor can they be ignored.  This reality has been accepted by the public at large and I believe by the majority of teachers themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say a word of appreciation to yourself, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise such a very fundamental matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that we ask the Minister through the Government to ask the EC to change the status of this disadvantaged area of Connemara, severely handicapped as it is, to the new status of a mountain region for all of the peninsula of Connemara.  Under the rules of this House I will try to make the case for this important matter.  In saying that I am at a disadvantage &mdash; but we must accept it &mdash; that I do not know what the Minister is going to say until I have finished.  However, I will make the case as I see fit as to why I should ask for this very important decision to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one of the most important matters <Col N="1059" /> that has ever come before this House.  It concerns emigration and the depopulation of a most beautiful part of our country which enshrines the heritage of our national language and culture.  If something is not done rather rapidly about the depopulation problem there will be in the very near future areas of land with no habitation at all.  I want to suggest to the Minister and to the Government that it is most important that they immediately make those proposals to the EC to change the status of this severely handicapped area of Connemara to that of a mountain region.</P>
    <P>I would like to make the case for so doing on comparisons that are available to me.  The comparisons that I have are only those that are available in a general way: I am sure the comparisons the Minister can find are of far greater depth than mine.  However, feeble as mine may appear to be, they are still very fundamental. There is an area in the south of France with which I make a comparison. It is a place called the Cantal.  It is a region which has a population of approximately 166,650 people and covers 2,231 square miles.  It has been declared and is functioning as a mountain region.  As for comparisons between what is viable in the mountain district and in Connemara, the case for Connemara is quite distinctly in line for change.</P>
    <P>The Connemara district I speak about is approximately 718 square miles and it has a population of approximately 28,500 people.  According to the census of 1971 to 1981 in all the rural district electoral divisions the population drop was approximately 10 per cent.  Since then the population drop has been even more rapid in the parts of Connemara I speak of.  If the present situation is not changed, massive areas of Connemara will become severely depopulated in the future.  What a tragedy that would be for this country.</P>
    <P>I make the comparison between the Cantal and Connemara because the Cantal, as I said, is a mountain region.  If it has succeeded in being designated a mountain region &mdash; and I do not begrudge it that because there are hardships there <Col N="1060" />&mdash; I think the case for Connemara is outstanding.  For example, the population per square mile works out at about 74.7 in the Cantal, whereas the population of Connemara works out at 41.78. The average size of holdings in the Cantal is about 90 acres per unit and in Connemara it is about 106 per unit.  But, of course, as the Minister is well aware, 80 per cent of the land held in Connemara is in commonage.  That is a major handicap and always has been and always will be.</P>
    <P>The total number of holdings in the Cantal is 10,750, whereas in Connemara it is only 4,303.  Other factors which are comprable show that in Connemara the rainfall is 100 inches per annum and that the length of the growing season is about five and a half months, whereas it is about six months in the Cantal.  Then the fundamental difference comes in.  There are 23,600 arable hectares in the Cantal, whereas there are only 1,251 arable hectares in Connemara.  It is known that at a height of approximately 3,000 feet in the Cantal maize, barley and other crops are sown in arable land.  The comparison with Connemara speaks clearly for itself because, as we are quite well aware, not alone is our land not arable, but in parts it is not even accessible.  Where it is accessible the slopes and the inclines from the mountains are so severe that, even with the assistance of good fertilisation programmes, access for the purpose of grazing would be difficult.  So, if we can have included a mountain region with arable land growing barley and maize and other farming products in a part of the south of France, surely there must be a strong case for including a part of Connemara at 3,000 feet which is not even accessible.</P>
    <P>We must take into account also the question of milk production.  It is well known that 77 per cent of the milk of that region in the south of France comes from the Cantal area.  In addition they have the unique benefit that there is no superlevy applying in a mountain region area. Regrettably, in the Connemara region there are 13 or 14 farmers producing 0.4 of 1 per cent of the milk of the area, which is very small.  While those facts <Col N="1061" /> speak for themselves, there may be other reasons that I am not aware of as to why the Cantal has been successful in its claim and Connemara has not.</P>
    <P>The hazards in Connemara are not the same as in the Cantal.  For example, the average number of days with no sun is 37 in the year in the Cantal and 69 in Connemara.  The average daily temperature in Connemara is 9º centigrade and in the Cantal it is 15º.  This bears out the fact that in Connemara there are 1,200 hours of sunshine in the year and in the Cantal there are 2,061 hours per year.  In giving these statistics I am pointing out that while the Cantal was lucky enough to get mountain region status, it does not compare as regards the necessity for a change of status with the Connemara region.</P>
    <P>While it can be said that the severely handicapped areas of Connemara were nourished and helped by headage payments and the other schemes from which severely handicapped areas benefited, the problem now is that the disadvantaged areas were extended and the money was not extended to the same degree and therefore the amount of payments made to our severely handicapped areas, taken individually, has diminished. Hence there is urgent need for change in this area.</P>
    <P>Taking 718 square miles out of the disadvantaged areas and putting them into the mountain region classification would allow the Government to extend the other severely handicapped areas slightly, particularly in north and south County Galway where an extension is needed, as the Minister is well aware, so that equality would prevail right across the whole of the disadvantaged areas in regard to payments and assistance.  I think that is a good point to make.  The Deputies and Senators from this area are harassed year after year on the area divisions that are made and the drawing of lines between what is &ldquo;in&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;out&rdquo; of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the change in status of Connemara would mean quite a lot.  For example, from the Cantal figures which are available, new buildings and farm <Col N="1062" /> development would get a 25 per cent direct cash grant; there is available a 15 year term loan for buildings and equipment at 3½ per cent; there is a nine year loan for purchase of quality livestock and husbandry which is available at 4 per cent; there is a further seven year loan for machinery at 4 per cent.  Headage subsidies continue to apply in Cantal at the same level as in the severely handicapped areas.  This would of course also apply in Connemara.</P>
    <P>What would be fundamental to Connemara is the development agency in the Cantal known as La Somival dealing with tourism, argiculture, light industry and irrigation.  A similar development agency could be set up in Connemara which would carry the functions I have mentioned, which are appropriate to the region.  We could add fisheries and forestry, the national language, culture and heritage to that agency.  All these could develop together within one single entity. Without any great cost we could put together an integrated plan which could be submitted through the local authority, the Galway County Council, to the Government agencies and from there, with the assistance and help of the Minister, to Brussels.  The cost of this would not be extraordinary to the State and it would bring tremendous benefits to the Connemara region which needs them very urgently.</P>
    <P>The first result one might expect from the change of status of Connemara would be that it would stem the massive emigration from the region.  This is something which has got to be taken on board immediately.  All the other schemes, while they have been beneficial initially, have petered out to the extent that people cannot make a living there.  This would encourage those living at home, who are highly skilled and educated, to live in the knowledge that there was a future for them in this mountainous region; the efforts that could be made by them, particularly in the areas of fisheries and forestry would be rewarding.  One has to take on board also the fish farm products and projects which are now part of the scene in the heart of Connemara.  Wonderful <Col N="1063" /> progress has been made in the development of oysters, lobsters and all the different shellfish in the laboratories in Carna, headed by Galway University Fisheries Research Laboratories in conjunction with the ESB and other companies. This is spearheaded by the most renowned Professor O'Keady, whose contribution to shellfish farming, salmon farming and indeed all types of fish farming, is unique and recognised internationally. This is something which we have not yet harnessed and it is something further which could be of benefit to the region.  It is a development which could be nourished and cherished under the mountain status scheme which I propose here today.</P>
    <P>The roads in Connemara are the bane of life to public representatives in County Galway; they are the bane of life to the people who have to live there today and the many tourists who have to try to tumble over them during the tourist season.</P>
    <P>All in all, this is a new idea emanating from the Connemara region.  Some years ago the Joint Committee on EC Legislation had adopted a broader stance taking into account a much larger area.  I do not know what happened to that report. There was unanimity at the time on that proposal when it was taken to Brussels. Recommendations were made but I believe no action was taken in this area since.  I am not here to foster that proposal. The Minister, as a Galwayman, who understands the district, can see before his eyes the denuding of Connemara and the situation that exists there today.  It is the heritage point of the country. We must take it as a symbol not only of what is known not alone locally as the fostering of the language &mdash; which is of vital importance &mdash; but of the existence of our people who speak it and their right to live comfortably.</P>
    <P>I boldly suggest to the Minister and to the Government that forthwith they should set up a distinctive section in the Department to which this programme could be referred.  They will have all the assistance of the different organs of the <Col N="1064" /> State, and private enterprise in Connemara will lend all their support in the preparation of this proposed programme. I commend it to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to compliment Senator Killilea for putting the case very strongly on behalf of the people of Connemara.  In the time that is available to me I will try to get through some of the points he has raised and to give some indication of the efforts we have made and the efforts we hope to continue to make.</P>
      <P>First, I want to talk about disadvantaged areas.  The disadvantaged area scheme provides grants to qualifying farmers for maintaining cattle and sheep in designated areas.  Three headage schemes operate throughout the disadvantaged areas according to the degree of handicap, that is, according to the category in which any particular area is officially classified. firstly, the cattle headage payments scheme operates in the more severely handicapped areas and applies to all types of cattle over six months. Secondly, the beef cow headage scheme is operated in the less severely handicapped areas and applies to beef cows only.  Finally, the sheep headage scheme is operated in all disadvantaged areas, including the designated mountain sheep grazing lands in the east, with payment on mountain type adult and hogget ewes.</P>
      <P>Connemara has been classified as a severely handicapped area since the inception of the disadvantaged areas scheme in 1975.  As a result, it qualifies for both cattle and sheep headage payments. The rates of payment which applied under these two schemes in 1985 are as follows.  Under the cattle headage scheme £32 is paid on each of the first eight livestock units and £28 per livestock unit on the next 22 livestock units.  The maximum grant payable under the scheme is £872.  Under the sheep headage scheme £9.50 is paid on each of the first 150 ewes, and for each ewe in excess of 150 up to 200, £6.50 is paid.  The maximum grant payable under this scheme is £1,750.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> These grants represent a considerable boost to farmers' incomes in Connemara, as in all other disadvantages areas.  Payments under the headage schemes to eligible farmers in designated areas now run at approximately £37 million per annum.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive and detailed review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas scheme has been undertaken to see what additional areas could be included and to see whether existing designated areas could be reclassified as more severely handicapped.  Earlier this year the EC Commission completed its examination of the submission made by the Government on the adjustments to the boundaries.  The proposals for new areas were finally approved by the Council of Ministers in the summer and these areas will be included in the headage payments schemes for 1986.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Government's negotiations on this issue, 168,000 hectares have been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme for the first time and some 215,000 hectares of mountain sheep grazing lands have been reclassified to handicapped status.  In addition, 137,000 hectares in the western region have been reclassified as more severely handicapped. As a result of these adjustments it is estimated that 14,000 farmers will benefit.  In addition, 111,000 hectares of the 168,000 hectares which were classified for the first time adjoin the western region and this is now eligible for the whole range of grants available under the Western Package.  The Council of Ministers also adopted a regulation (797/85) last March on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures which replaces the former directives on the modernisation of farms and on mountain and hill farming.  This new regulation will ensure a greater concentration of resources in the more disadvantaged areas of the country such as Connemara.</P>
    <P>The case for reclassifying the more severely handicapped areas of the western region to mountain area status has been one to which we have given considerable attention.  A submission in this <Col N="1066" /> regard was received from the North Connacht Farmers' Co-operative Society and Donegal Co-Operative Creameries two years ago.  This question has been raised on a number of occasions at official level with the European Commission but it did not prove possible to make any change in the current situation.  During the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the new regulation on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures and the new directive on the reclassification of and extensions to the disadvantaged areas, efforts were made within the framework of the EC Council of Ministers to have the relevant criteria modified so that the most severely disadvantaged areas in the West of Ireland would be put on a par with mountain areas in other parts of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Commission, however, was not prepared to put forward a proposal to that effect.  I want to make that very clear to the House.  The Irish Government was not the only Government that tried to have such a change effected.  It has been tried on a couple of occasions but the Commission have refused to respond.  I will come back to that in a minute.  In this situation there is no prospect of any proposals to the Commission to change the status of Connemara from a more severely handicapped area to a mountain region being successful.</P>
    <P>There were a number of points raised by Senator Killilea to which I would like to reply.  It is true that the Cantal area of France, which he talked about, obviously got in at the very beginning on the basis of altitude.  That is the greatest problem we have.  At all the negotiations in which I have been involved in Brussels over this issue the problem did not relate to Ireland alone.  Obviously, if the Commission were to &ldquo;give&rdquo; on this particular subject many areas in Europe would have the same qualification as Connemara would have.  That is why the original directive referred to &ldquo;mountain status&rdquo;.  It is a question of altitude at that stage.  I accept that everything Senator Killilea says about the Cantal regions is, as far as I am concerned, correct.  I pay compliment to NCF for the fantastic input they have <Col N="1067" /> made to this programme.  They went so far as to measure wind speed and so on to ensure a comparison could be made in a favourable way between the west of Ireland and the Cantal and other such regions.</P>
    <P>Another problem which arises is one which I should mention in the House this evening.  From what I can gather it would be extremely difficult to take an area like Connemara out on its own.  Obviously, the proposals that were put up earlier were for other areas in the west including Connemara.  They are all severely handicapped. There are parts of County Mayo, Donegal and so on which would reckon they have as good a case for mountain status as Connemara would.  If there is ever a chance of being successful it goes without saying &mdash; and the people of Connemara know this &mdash; that such a proposal would have my greatest sympathy and support.</P>
    <P>As the Senator is aware, we have brought a number of innovations to Connemara in the last couple of years.  He mentioned them himself.  Under the western package we brought out a new system whereby fertiliser can now be applied by helicopter to hills where heretofore a man could hardly walk across.  It is against that background that we have changed the system of fencing grants and mountain roads.  This is done with the same aim that Senator Killilea talks about to make life that bit easier for the people who live in that area.</P>

      <P>The other thing which will be seen as something of great benefit is that I introduced the Connemara pony as an item for payment under the headage payments this year for the first time ever. That is something that will help a lot of small farmers in Connemara as well.  Under the new western package when it is announced, and indeed under the old one that existed, there is a fair amount of on-farm investment that can be used because of the fact that it is a <Col N="1068" /> severely handicapped area.  It is a well known fact, as the Senator mentioned, that one of the great problems we have in the Connemara area is that so much of the land available there would be involved in commonages to one degree or another.  We have tackled this problem to a certain extent.  I must admit that there have been areas easier to deal with than the Connemara hills, but we are delighted with the progress to date.  When the revised edition of the western package is announced it will be seen that we have very much in mind the problems of the severely handicapped areas like Connemara.</P>
      <P>Finally on the whole question of the European scene I can assure the House that the Government's commitment is at all times to keep up the pressure.  We are not alone in this.  That may or may not be a good thing.  Other Governments, for obvious reasons, have much the same interest in this reclassification as we have. The problem is that it becomes a Commission problem very quickly on the basis that there are many countries with huge tracts of land similar in soil type to Connemara. It is obviously going to be a fairly big decision by the Commission to actually reclassify such areas.  It is something that I hope will happen some day and I assure the House that I will do everything possible to put the case for the west generally.  I believe our case would best be met by including all areas of the west.  We would have certain problems of designation if we were to take one small area alone.</P>

      <P>We must try to get the Commission to see that areas like this are as handicapped as areas with mountain status.  This confers certain privileges that we do not now have.  The milk quota is one.  The other important one is the co-responsibility levy.  The milk producers would not have to cough that one up.  We have a system in disadvantaged areas whereby we reimburse, through a particular fund, producers below a certain level of production.  This is another aid to small producers which many farmers in Connemara would receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see quite a good future for areas like Connemara, provided it is properly <Col N="1070" /> handled.  I agree with Senator Killilea on the overall strategy to be used from a development point of view.  Údarás na Gaeltachta, I thought, would have been the agency which would have done that. They are in the right place with the right terms of reference.  I hope with all the pressure from all sides that a day will come when we will successfully negotiate a part of the north west to be reclassified from severely handicapped to mountain status.</P>
