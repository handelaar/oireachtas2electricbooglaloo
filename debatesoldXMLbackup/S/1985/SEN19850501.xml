      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The decision by the Minister for Justice to seriously curtail the educational facilities in the Arbour Hill and Cork prisons.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take <Col N="2" /> Nos. 1, 2 and 3, with a break from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., No. 3 to be taken at 6.30.  For the information of Senators, I might indicate that it is proposed to sit tomorrow in order to take No. 4 and if that does not occupy us beyond lunch time, to take No. 5 after lunch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be excessively combative.  I suppose I have reason to be grateful that No. 2 appears as high on the Order of Business as it does but we may be unduly optimistic in thinking that it will arise this afternoon. It always seems to come high on the agenda on days when there is something which will take an enormous amount of time to be discussed and it slips further down the Order Paper on days when there might be a possibility of it slipping in.  It was on 13 December last year that <Col N="3" /> the Deputy Leader of the House said that while he would do his best he could not give a commitment before Christmas.  At this stage I have to wonder which Christmas he was talking about, whether it was Christmas 1984 or 1985.  The reason I am so concerned is because I wonder whether the Leader of the House knows anything about a report in today's <i>Irish Press</i> which suggests that the Government Bill on homelessness will be published tomorrow, or is it perhaps the case that the newspapers know more about the Government's business?</P>
      <P>Finally, in my desperation to see if the Government did perhaps give some indication I came across a reference to grants in respect of homes and shelters which have been increased by 25 per cent. The trouble is that they are grants for homes and shelters for stray animals, which seem to come higher in Government priorities since the actual grant is bigger than the assistance given to those dealing with people who are homeless. Therefore I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that item No. 2 be taken at 4 o'clock or earlier if item No. 1 is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I do not see any reason for not being combative about this and I make no apologies whatsoever for asking the Government why time is not provided for these pieces of legislation which have been on the Order Paper for a long time and which are very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to support the plea made by Senator Brendan Ryan that this Bill should be taken today at a definite time because otherwise I can see it retreating to the horizon yet again and I feel it is a matter which should have been dealt with long ago and should be dealt with today at a specific time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On another matter on the Order Paper, I would just like to ask &mdash; in a non-combative fashion &mdash; the Leader of the House if he has any notion in regard to when we will be proceeding with the Second Stage <Col N="4" /> of the National Archives Bill.  We have been waiting for this Bill for very many years and it is a matter of urgency as far as the records of the State are concerned. I am anxious that the Bill should not be allowed to sit around for ever and ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ryan in seeking time to continue the debate on the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.  Indeed, I have been waiting for some time, as I know other Members of the House have been, to contribute to the debate on that important measure.  Equally, I am anxious that we would continue and possibly even conclude the Second Stage of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill this afternoon.  I am anxious that that Bill, as a Government Bill, would be processed rapidly and that the agency would be fully established. Instead of seeking to change the order for this afternoon, and although agreeing with Senator Ryan that it seems unlikely that item No. 2 will be reached as the business is ordered at the moment &mdash; I think he is right to raise the matter &mdash; it seems to me that it would be more appropriate that item No. 2 should be ordered for this afternoon and if not reached then ordered for tomorrow, because if the House is sitting tomorrow and taking a motion on disadvantaged areas followed by a motion on small businesses, it seems that it would be an appropriate day on which to continue the debate and perhaps conclude the Second Stage of this important Bill on housing the homeless.  I would see that as a preferable course.  I would not be able, in fact, to support the proposal to take the other Bill at a particular time because I think this Government Bill should get priority today.  However, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill if it is not reached today should be taken tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask your advice, in your capacity as Leas-Chathaoirleach, on how I might properly raise in the House the matter of unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of my telephone in Donegal.  The reason I ask <Col N="5" /> is that since the setting up of Bord Telecom I realise that it might not be within the ambit of the Department of Communications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that both pieces of legislation before us are attempting to deal with deprived people in our society and it would seem that priority should not be given to either one or the other of them.  When we take them is a matter of irrelevance in a sense.  The sooner we get both pieces of legislation on the Statute Book the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to ask the Leader of the House when is it intended to take the report of the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries, which is No. 11 on the Order Paper and which is something that we should be discussing before that report is out of date?  The other matter that I think we should be dealing with as a matter of urgency, and I think it is something on which the Leader of the House would have a particular input, is motion No. 15 on the Order Paper.  This is an item that has been discussed on a regular basis in the newspapers and on television over the past number of weeks <Col N="6" /> and both Houses of the Oireachtas are coming in for a lot of stick because we have not discussed the question of European Union in either House.  I think this item should be discussed as soon as possible. It would allay many fears that the public have as to what might or might not happen in regard to our continuing participation in the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I would like to send word to the Cathaoirleach to wish him a speedy recovery from his illness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to concur with the last remark before I make my comment about Senator Ryan's suggestion about changing the Order of Business.  It puts Members of the House in an unfortunate situation in that they are now being asked to choose by way of a vote on the Order of Business between what are two very important pieces of legislation.  It goes without saying that all of us want to ensure that the Combat Poverty Agency is set up as a matter of urgency in view of the level of poverty throughout the country.  There would be no doubt in any of our minds that that is a Government Bill and it is of paramount importance that it be taken as the first item on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, we have agreed that that is also very important legislation.  The fact that it has remained on the Order Paper in spite of being ordered on numerous occasions has not been deliberate, certainly from the time when I was dealing with the Order of Business.  It has not been a deliberate ploy as has been insinuated by Senator Ryan.  I know that irrespective of whether Senator Ryan had a Private Members' Bill down on this subject, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, the Minister responsible in this area, has legislation which he informs me about every week, because I ask him, that is almost complete. I have no worry whatsoever about Senator Ryan's Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill because I know there is a Minister prepared to legislate in this area in any case.  To anybody who worries about making choices or worries because we do <Col N="7" /> not take this at 4 o'clock, or tomorrow, or next week, or whenever we take it, I say the matter is being dealt with expeditiously and efficiently by the Minister. This is a very complex area of legislation. Senators who are members of local authorities will know it is complex.  We have housing lists of people and families who are technically homeless because they are living in mobile homes, etc.  I have already made a contribution on the Bill but I want Members to see which is the more important piece of legislation to take as a first item on the agenda today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the questions that have been raised, I would suggest that it is appropriate that we should finish the Second Stage of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill.  Many Senators made the presumption that this would occupy us between now and 5.30 p.m.  I am not so sure about that.  It might conclude before then, in which case we would be able to take up the debate of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the suggestion of taking this Private Member's Bill tomorrow, I would be against that.  We have made a general arrangement that for the next few months we will deal with legislation on Wednesday and that we will endeavour to clear the backlog of the reports of joint committees on Thursdays.  I am, however, prepared to say that I see no reason why there should not be at least two hours of next Wednesday's sitting devoted to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.  There may be some short motions that will have to be dealt with next week in Government Business, but in view of the extremely long delay I would be prepared to recommend the allocation of two hours of Government time on Wednesday next to this Bill.  I would like to say that there has been Government approval for the proposals of the Minister for the Environment in regard to a comprehensive housing Bill which will deal with this among other matters.  It is only a question of the length of time it will take to complete the legal drafting of that Bill before it is published <Col N="8" /> and circulated.  To think it would be circulated tomorrow would be a reflection of a speed in the parliamentary draftsman's office that would be something of a record.  But the Government's decisions in regard to this Bill are made and the legislation is in the final stages of drafting. I see no reason why there should not be two hours of Government time given next week and I am prepared to give that undertaking.</P>
    <P>In regard to suggestions made in relation to No. 11, on development co-operation, this is a very important report.  It is one the Seanad would like to discuss and I suggest that we have discussions to see which Thursday during this month would be the most suitable for taking it.  I think it would occupy the whole of one day.</P>
    <P>In regard to item No. 15, which is the report of the joint committee dealing with the draft Treaty on European Union, I understand that the Dáil intends to discuss that in a few weeks time.  There are very few occasions on which I am prepared to give way to the Dáil as having a right to priority in debate but I think this is such a vital issue that it would be more appropriate if the initial debate took place in the Dáil.  I understand that will take place in a few weeks time and we could easily arrange then to debate it in this House one or two weeks following the Dáil debate.  I see no difficulty in regard to that.  So, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I suggest to Senator Ryan that he withdraw his amendment on the understanding that there will be at least two hours devoted to this Bill on Wednesday, 8 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Senator McGuinness, but so many matters have been raised that I forgot the Senator's question.  With regard to the National <Col N="9" /> Archives Bill, Senators will remember that the Taoiseach, who has taken a great interest in this legislation, was prevented by illness from introducing the legislation to the House.  He is extremely anxious to be here when the debate is resumed and to be able to reply to the debate.  As Senators will know, the Taoiseach is now out of the country and will not be back for about two weeks but I can assure the House that I am pressing him to make himself available for the debate in the Seanad as soon as possible after his return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to item No. 15, I can see the point the Leader of the House is making as regards the Dáil debating this motion, that is a very important motion and that, therefore, he possibly would give way on this occasion.  I cannot see why, on this occasion, both Houses should not deal with the matter simultaneously.  It is not a Bill but it is something of extreme importance.  It is something about which a lot of rubbish has been expressed and a lot of fears have been raised and the sooner we debate it in this House, irrespective of what the other House does, the better.  I hope the Leader of the House will see his way to going along with my thinking on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I can agree with the Leader of the Opposition that a certain amount of rubbish has been expressed on certain areas of European Union.  I think there is a difficulty of timing here, and perhaps it is as well to mention it.  It is necessary for the Seanad to dispose of the Finance Bill before the end of May. We might well be in the difficulty, if we did want to discuss European Union simultaneously with the Dáil, that at the time when the Dáil would be discussing it, having despatched the Finance Bill, would be the time when we would have to deal with the Finance Bill.  That is why I said we could discuss it very shortly afterwards.  I agree that simultaneous discussion &mdash; or the Dáil discussing it on a Wednesday and the Seanad discussing it on a Thursday &mdash; would be desirable <Col N="10" /> but the difficulty over the Finance Bill may hamper us somewhat there.</P>

    <Title>Combat Poverty Agency Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start my brief contribution on Second Stage by stating that I am aware that there would be no Member of this House who would not be fully behind any Bill or indeed any move to deal with this terrible problem of poverty.  This Bill is largely an extension of one introduced by my party and therefore I have no hesitation in welcoming the Bill.  To deal with the problem of poverty and to get maximum benefit from any Bill it is necessary to ask very many questions and to find proper answers to them.  There are some questions that it is absolutely imperative and essential to ask and to answer before a satisfactory Bill can be implemented.</P>
      <P>First of all, we have to ask ourselves what is poverty?  What is the extent of poverty?  What causes poverty and what steps can be taken to solve the problem? Qualified experts are necessary to help us in this area.  On the last occasion in this House some Members felt it might be inappropriate and wrong to spend too much finance in this area and that the finance should go directly to solving the problem.  We must have the help of sociologists and social scientists.  This is an important piece of social engineering and for that reason everybody would agree that it is most important to have the services of social engineers.  They will isolate the problem and suggest what can and should be done.  Then the solution will be a political one to be implemented by the politicians and by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some well-intentioned and sympathetic people say that we know all about poverty, we know who is poor and we know what should be done.  In a general sense this may be true but to get maximum benefit from the Bill and from any <Col N="11" /> legislative move we should have the services of those experts.  I am aware that much research has been done by private individuals, by groups and by experts in this field.  I would like to pay tribute to them and to their hard work.  In the implementation of any policy the results of their research and their work will be used.</P>
    <P>Social surveys and research can be carried out in various ways.  One of these is participant observation in which the person carrying out the survey will become involved with those among whom the survey is carried out.  Interviews may be carried out in two ways, structured or unstructured.  The structured interviews would set certain questions and the unstructured ones would give more scope.  They would set questions but perhaps lead people into expressing views of their own on those issues or on related issues.  There is also the system of questionnaires which is the cheapest and the most straightforward. People are given specific questions and they give their answers and then on the basis of those answers the survey is completed. We have some considerable information already available from Government reports and other sources and these will be taken in to account as well.</P>
    <P>I believe the success of the survey depends on the quality and validity of the data collected.  The surveys will measure rather than explain the problem.  Methodology is very important.  There are those who believe that social science is not what might be termed an exact science.  There are some sociologists who feel that logic methods and procedures of natural sciences are applicable to the study of mankind.  This I believe is regarded as positivism.  On the other hand, there is the other side to it, phenomenology, which feels it is not an exact science, that man does not respond to situations and to effects in the same way as inanimate things and so this would have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>When we get down to examining poverty itself it can be expressed in three <Col N="12" /> ways &mdash; in absolute terms, in relative terms and in subjective poverty terms.  In absolute poverty, from the 19th century, when serious studies of poverty began, researchers have tried to establish a fixed datum line against which to measure poverty.  Below that line, poverty would begin and above it it would end.  This involves judgment of basic human needs, resources for health and physical efficiency. This is also know as subsistence poverty.  It involves pricing basic necessities such as food, clothing and shelter. Some concepts would include basic cultural needs which, to some extent, would reflect the value of the researcher.  They would also include education, leisure, recreation and finally security in old age.</P>
    <P>In this country we had a tradition where people provided for security in old age by having very large families.  There are many problems with this method of determining poverty.  For example, as regards food, how do we know the exact amount of food that is required by any particular individual?  Do we make allowances, for example, for situations where a person would buy a parcel of potatoes and maybe half of them would be unusable?  Do we take for granted that people are good cooks, that there is no wastage?  There are many other issues to be taken into consideration as well as shelter.  On a different level, is colour television essential?  Is radio essential?</P>
    <P>Then we have relative poverty. Because of the difficulty, many researchers do not employ the absolute poverty concept but they work to standards related to the particular time and place and this is known as relative poverty.  It is measured in terms of what is considered an acceptable reasonable standard in the community and so will vary with time and is constantly changing.  There are problems in this regard as well because there is a difficulty in deciding on proper standards of norm for large numbers, ethnic groups, different classes, different age groups, religion etc.</P>
    <P>Would it be regarded as necessary in this respect that people should have access to those standards?  Would that be <Col N="13" /> regarded in relative terms?  As far as I am concerned, I think so.  The concept of relative poverty makes it difficult to compare the past with the present and to compare different areas, for example, the Third World.  To overcome this there are two standards suggested: the national relational, which is relative poverty and world relational, which is absolute.  Finally, we come to subjective poverty where individuals and groups may feel they are poor.  Some individuals may feel they are poor while other might not necessarily think so.  This is important in one sense because people generally behave in response to the conditions in which they find themselves.  My own definition of poverty is resources which would not enable a person to develop to full potential throughout life and so he or she would be inhibited in this sense and for this reason would be a second-class citizen.</P>
    <P>When we come to examine the extent of poverty it very much depends on the concept of poverty that is adopted.  I have no doubt that the surveys which have been carried out &mdash; in particular that carried out by Sister Stanislaus which refers to over one million poor people &mdash; are correct.  I believe that there is no reason to question them.  Then we come to the causes of poverty.  Some people refer to the vicious circle.  They say that poverty breeds poverty from one generation to another and that people are trapped in this situation.  They feel there is no escape from it.  There are people who have not got sufficient food and are therefore unable to work or to study properly.  They are unable to get out of this situation.</P>
    <P>There is also the culture of poverty. Poverty has common characteristics, similar problems and similar responses in different societies.  These develop into a sort of culture.  Culture is regarded as the learned, shared and socially transmitted behaviour of a social group.  The result of this is marginality as has already been stated in this debate, helplessness, dependence, inferiority, resignation, tatalism and living for the present, or present-time orientation.  It is stated that <Col N="14" /> culture has a life of its own and that if the circumstances were to disappear the culture of poverty could continue.  The culture theory sees the poor as different from the remainder of society with a distinctive sub-culture.  It sees this sub-culture as maintaining the poor in unchanging circumstances.</P>
    <P>The situation in America in the sixties, when war was declared on poverty, has already been mentioned in this debate. The welfare state in the United Kingdom has been referred to.  Poverty has persisted and grown in both those places.  I believe this is because in the USA there was no shift of wealth, which is necessary in order to solve the problem of poverty. I believe that social engineers and those engaged in this area must erect canals and viaducts out of this morass and not be simply creating a labyrinthine series of ways within it.  In the UK, the benefits were not sufficient and so the poor generally remained poor.</P>
    <P>I have said before in this House that poverty is not simply an individual condition. It is a social problem; a class phenomenon of the working class.  A massive redistribution of resources away from the wealthier classes is needed in order to solve the problem.  What is needed is something of the situation created by the &ldquo;Wild Colonial Boy&rdquo; mentality, without the gun to rob the rich and serve the poor.  Perhaps not in that sense, but a redistribution is needed, away from the wealthy classes to the poor if the situation is to be solved.  In reading through books on sociology it is interesting to see the references to all the different classes, the upper class, the middle class, the working class, the lower class and the down-and-outs. In one sense this does not appear to be correct.  Nevertheless, I accept that we must have some divisions of this kind. We have the shame of poverty where people feel they are responsible for their positions.  This is not true.  I would like to know if inequality can be abolished.  I am sure there will be difficulty in this regard.  Is poverty endemic?  We have the new poor being created.  Like sand in a sealed vessel a certain number will go to <Col N="15" /> the bottom no matter what is done.  I feel that poverty undermines society.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, section 9 is most important. It deals with finances.  It will be necessary to measure the results of this legislation periodically.  It should be an integral part of social policy and social engineering to do away with the dole concept in this country.  People do not want to get something for nothing.  They are prepared to work; they want to work; they want productive employment.  I have made the plea on many occasions in this House and elsewhere that we should strive to arrive at a situation where work of a productive nature &mdash; in housing, roads and many different areas including the provision of fuel &mdash; could be undertaken.  People should have job satisfaction.  The position has been described in this House on many occasions of people queuing for the dole in the rain.  When they get this dole it is a mere pittance.  I do not think that progress can be made in this situation until we have abolished that and arrived at a situation where we have full employment. I think it is possible to arrive at a situation where we have full employment.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that what I have to say on this subject in this House has no great significance.  We all feel when we get into public life that we can do something at local authority level or at Seanad level. The reality then is rather disappointing when we are in a situation where very little can be done.</P>
    <P>My own experience of poverty may not be appropriate but nevertheless I would draw on it in some sense in this situation. Patrick Kavanagh has said that poverty is largely in the mind and I believe that is true to a large extent.  Looking back on it at my stage in life, I look back at youth &mdash; torn clothes going to school and to Mass, wearing mother's clothes at secondary school; no fuel, no light; hiding on the rent collector when he called, sick and delirium after sickness; no food.  I remember a few months old baby sister dying simply and solely because of poverty: nursed in a suitcase; no heat in the house.  The memory is still with me <Col N="16" /> of a little baby snuggling to get some warmth where there was none; waked on a table with a little candle, the coffin a cigarette box hammered together, unpainted, carried through fields of fat cattle; a small group digging a small grave and comback with a spade, passing by windows where they pulled back the curtains to peep out unable to come out and then a broken-hearted mother crying.</P>
    <P>Those memories never leave anybody who experienced these realities.  I remember my father at the beginning of the last World War, a farm labourer working at 13 shillings per week.  He had to walk seven or eight miles to work and the same home.  For that he had breakfast, dinner and tea and a big issue was made of the breakfast for a family of six.</P>
    <P>We were brought up to accept poverty in our environment and our religion, without question.  If I were starting life all over again and know what I know now, it would be different.  We had that concept of &ldquo;the poor you have always with you&rdquo;.  There is no poverty now like there was then.  I honestly feel that.  That is not to say that we do not have poverty: we have poverty on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>Looking back on it, there is no shame or pride in the way I was brought up. Many others were brought up in similar circumstances and, I believe, worse but on looking back it was the concept of the drowning rat: charity kept its head from sinking when it might have been more charitable to push it down under the water because the effects of poverty are irreversible.  When that happens to some people they try to make sure that it will not happen to their children if humanly possible and for that reason among others, I hope that this Bill will be successful. I feel that education should be provided not simply with a view to helping the poor to analyse their problem and lift themselves, as somebody has said, by their own shoe strings &mdash; not for that reason but eduction should be provided to get them through life and to lead full lives and to get employment for them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in some cases poverty has been caused by a lack of commonsense or <Col N="17" /> gumption, or savvy, whatever it may be called.  I do not think that this is simply confined to the poor; I have found a lack of commonsense in well-educated people and brilliant people.  I think that commonsense is something that, as a nation, we do not have in large quantities.  The poor, of course, have muscle.  Poverty in religion may be all right.  Some people have a romantic notion of poverty.  They look on it as frugality or discipline of some kind.  It is nothing of the sort: it is really a case of pushing people to be second or third or fourth-class citizens. In my time that was acceptable.  I do not think it is acceptable now.  It is only right that it should not be acceptable now. That is probably the result of educating people.  As some Members have said here before it may be partly the result of being educated also by the media, by television for example, by seeing the way other people live, the opulence and the fullness that they have.  Why should a certain section of the population be denied some kind of reasonable income?  They see this on television.</P>
    <P>It is not simply a transfer of resources that is needed.  People should be taught responsibility at school.  If money is got too easily it is not appreciated.  We need to be educated and to become mature.  I see this in the situation at discos where I feel that the young people have a wrong sense of values.  We have too much drink and we have too much money spent on drink.  In schools much can be done, and much can be done by example from people who have resources and who are in a position to give a lead.  In my young days to go for &ldquo;home help&rdquo; was a last resort.  Many people would die in shame before they would do it.  Now we have a situation where people have almost to become professional beggars in some instances to get what they deserve and what they are entitled to.  That is wrong and something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>In dealing with poverty I think that women's role has been a very difficult one, far more difficult than that of men. In a situation like this it is appropriate that we should think of the travelling <Col N="18" /> people and the position they are in.  Not enough is being done when you have young children, babies, brought up under a canvas tent in winter time.  It certainly does not fit in with the concept of a Christian country, what our behaviour should be and our consideration and care of people in those circumstances.  We should also pay tribute to so many different bodies and groups like the Samaritans, the St. Vincent de Paul Society and all those who have helped out in that area.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by once again stating that I fully support any Bill or any move that will do anything to help in the area of poverty.  We will be able to deal more fully with the Bill when it comes to Committee Stage and we shall have some amendments at that stage.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh na baill ag obair go dian agus nach mbeidh siad ag caint lá i ndiaidh lae nó b'fhéidir, níos measa fós, bliain i ndiaidh bliana gan aon rud tairbheach á dhéanamh.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend either to define poverty or deal with some of its causes.  Those who are caught in the poverty trap are not interested in why they are in it or indeed as to what poverty really is.  They are suffering it and they know what its effects are.  I would like to refer to two aspects that perhaps the incoming committee might deal with.  Many of the people who are in financial difficulties at the moment have lost jobs and are unemployed and that is a major factor. They do not want to be unemployed and it is not their fault but at least there is some hope that if work becomes available they will be able to take it.  I have sympathy for two other types of people: first, those who are on medical certificates.  It is becoming more and more of a problem that those who are on medical certificates <Col N="19" /> are waiting a day or two or longer for payment.  From their point of view the cheque that they should get on a Friday is the very same as the payment that any of us get for doing the work we do.  I would like to ask the committee dealing with poverty to tackle this problem and see how it can be overcome.  I know that there is a certain amount of checking to be done and a certain amount of red tape concerning forms, but people are being victimised as a result of this.  I have the utmost sympathy for people who are waiting for a cheque on a Friday and do not get it.  They then hope it will come on Monday or Tuesday and if it does not and they look into the matter they are told that the certificate did not arrive.</P>
    <P>It seems to be a system that lends itself to having things go wrong.  It is not possible to have certificates going in on time and at the same time having cheques coming out on time.  I would ask the Minister and the committee to have a look at that aspect and see if the problems can be ironed out.  The second aspect which is causing many problems for those who are unfit to work concerns the medical referees.  This is something I have spoken about before in public and I was astounded at the response which I got. Medical referees are sent throughout the country to assess people's ability to work. I have had cases where people had been in hospitals under specialists and surgeons and when they were released they had to go before a medical referee.  I do not think it is possible for any medical referee &mdash; I do not care what qualifications he has in medicine &mdash; to sit down behind a table and decide that a person is fit to work.  I have had the situation where a person who only survived for a few months afterwards with a serious illness was declared fit for work.  I fault the medical referees in that they take on too much.  If they had sense, they should be able to see from the medical reports that people are not capable of working. I blame the system that decides that in this day and age of medicine any man can sit down, look at a person, and perhaps <Col N="20" /> examine him or perhaps not and decide that that person is fit for work.</P>
    <P>This is causing untold hardship to people because they are cut off and cannot get any money.  They know they are not fit for work and they feel aggrieved. This is something which must be dealt with quickly.  Again, I hope the Minister of State here and the agency will look into this.  We may have poverty and we may be paying out money that should be a help to those who need it but if it is not going to arrive on time and if this is going to cause frustration &mdash; some people seem to be always in difficulty with payments &mdash; then there is something wrong with the system.  The system is supposed to prevent people from fooling the Department but in an effort to prevent one person from &ldquo;codding&rdquo; the system it ends up with nine people being victimised.  I would certainly like to see this changed.</P>
    <P>The other part of poverty is something that is nearly part and parcel of our life: it is the way we are.  A lot of poverty can arise from the abuse of one partner by another and alcohol often plays a leading role in this.  I had an experience some time ago in a pub when a person became very abusive over the local charges and what it would cost him.  Actually, about two other Saturday nights would have supplied him with all the money he needed to pay the water charges had he stayed at home.  It is doubtful if all the money that is spent on drink should be spent on drink by people who have the responsibility of a family but that is part of what we are.  Without going into any more detail on all the causes and side effects of it, I would like to see the two points I have made considered in helping to combat what is a problem, the payment of social welfare benefits.  Benefits should come on time and they should come with the least amount of formality and red tape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, warmly welcome this Bill and I hope it will have a speedy and well-supported passage through both Houses.  I would like to thank my colleague, Senator McGonagle, <Col N="21" /> for enabling me to participate at this stage because I have certain time constraints. For that reason also, I do not propose to speak at any great length on this Stage of the Bill although it is an important Bill which will give rise to very detailed consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in particular because it is an important step in creating the conditions for a new direction in our social policy.  Clearly &mdash; and a number of Senators have already stated this &mdash; establishing an agency will not of itself abolish or indeed significantly diminish the level of poverty in our society but it is important because it will create a framework for positive action and for the kind of structural change which is necessary.  We still under-estimate the extent of the radical structural change that will be necessary if we are serious about our commitment to combat &mdash; meaning to reduce and hopefully, perhaps, even eliminate &mdash; poverty in our society.</P>
      <P>In the speech introducing the Bill, the Minister of State traced very fully the background over more than a decade and the development of a consciousness, a perception and an awareness in particular by those who had either taken the trouble to inform themselves or were working with disadvantaged groups, of what would be necessary.  The Minister referred to the developments both at national level and also at EC level in which Ireland played a very significant part.  In that regard I would like to pay a personal tribute to Deputy Frank Cluskey when he was a Minister of State for Social Welfare.  There is no doubt that he, the Government of the time and his Department, played a significant role in ensuring that the Community adopted a combat poverty programme.  He piloted programmes in that regard and supported initiatives at national level.  These were instrumental in giving the necessary support to those who were working on the ground here in Ireland and perhaps led to the developments which have brought about this legislative proposal to establish a national agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Looking at this 12 years or so of development of consciousness and growing expertise and a growing realisation of what needed to be done in the area, I would focus on one landmark, namely, the final report of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty which reported on experiences which had been drawn from all the developments from 1971 to 1977, and then the various projects and pilot programmes in the programme for action from 1977 to 1980.</P>
    <P>I want to refer, first of all, to a brief but sobering paragraph in the preface to this final report.  The report notes the statistics which again have been referred to by a number of Senators.  We have approximately 25 per cent of our population living in poverty.  It is characterised as being relative poverty in that it is poverty as judged in comparison to average income &mdash; and various other indicators &mdash; in our society.  That is a very high percentage.  The report also refers to other inequities in our society.  It refers to the fact that the top 20 per cent of households received 43.4 per cent of the national income whereas at the bottom 20 per cent of households received just 4.5 per cent of the national income.  Then I come, as I say, to the sobering paragraph which we should have before us in considering this Bill and in considering our approach.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>Poverty does not come about by accident.  Rather our system is planned in such a way that poverty is an integral part of it, emerging from social, economic and educational policy which favour the non-poor.  The whole structure of our society is underpinned by a philosophy which is totally inimical to the poor.</P>
    <P>That, if we think about it, is a very sobering statement.  It also highlights what I was referring to earlier.  If we are going to tackle poverty then we had better know what we are about because we are going to find that we will need radically to alter and structurally change many of the policies and methods by which we distribute <Col N="23" /> national income in our society.  We must have a debate which ensures that we have a perception and realisation of that.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers of a Bill entitled as this one is, the Combat Poverty Agency Bill is that is tends to lead to a perception that we are going to establish an agency to deal with poverty, that it is out there somewhere, that it is going to do things and that is going to help people, rather than realising that an agency in itself can do nothing, or very little, or can merely be an optical illusion unless &mdash; and again this is reflected in the report &mdash; the policies of the Government of the day are addressing the same issues and are running in tandem with the agency and are completely supportive of it.  Its policies must redirect it to realise the aims and objectives which are behind the establishment of the agency.  We need to look closely at the lessons that were learned in the seventies in gradually improving our understanding of the incidence of poverty and of the extent to which our own policies, our own Government policies and our own State policies, create and perpetuate the incidence of poverty in our society.  I would like to refer to these briefly and consider them before turning to the text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In chapter 10 of the report the committee draw on the implications and then make their recommendations arising out of the work of the programme.  At page 239 they summarise the experiences arising out of the work of the programme and under a heading &ldquo;Poverty &mdash; the Reality&rdquo; the report stated as follows:</P>
    <P>What comes through from the reports and studies may be summarised as follows; the difficulties disadvantaged people face in trying to be part of and have a say in events that shape and affect their lives; their helplessness or frustration in the face of official structures, vis, of Church, State, etc.; their poor `self image'; their dependence on others to achieve their rights, e.g. politicians, social workers, clergy, teachers, etc.; the obstacles created by the complexities of services and structures <Col N="24" /> in areas such as education, housing, the legal system, planning, etc.; the inadequacies of income maintenance services to provide a decent life for those worst off.</P>
    <P>That is a summary of the general areas which are the reality of poverty.  We would need to address ourselves to those. We would need to be aware that if we are establishing a national agency it must have adequate powers, resources, teeth and functions to address all of these areas.  I am not convinced as yet that it has those powers fully.  The Bill is well framed and to a very considerable degree I am impressed with the format and approach but I am not fully satisfied that it goes far enough.</P>
    <P>First of all, if one takes the difficulties that disadvantaged people face in trying to be part of and have a say in events that shape and affect their lives, the helplessness that they feel, are we prepared, in fact to contemplate very real changes in decision making, a greater devolving of power and a greater openness in our society?  In other words, will we have less centralisation, less secrecy, less non-responsiveness of decision makers?  As Senator Browne said, we need far less delay in taking decisions affecting people with no explanation of why the delay was taking place.  Indeed, that was a matter that was noted in the recently published report of the Ombudsman.  His report noted the significant factor of delay in our social welfare services which particularly affect those who are most in need, the long delays when a matter is appealed and the absence of any explanation for it.  He noted the absence of any power of participation of that kind.  Secondly, there is this poor self image.  This is worsened by the worsening conditions in geographically located areas.  Unemployment is getting dramatically worse in certain areas so that now in some areas around Dublin there is over 50 per cent of the working population unemployed. There we have a potentially very poor collective self-image as well as a very poor individual self-image in different families.  They have very poor prospects <Col N="25" /> and because a person coming from such a geographical location is already feeling vulnerable and deprived by that factor this is a very important element.</P>
    <P>Another matter summarised there is this concept of the dependence of those who could be characterised as living in poverty on others such as politicians, social workers, clergy, or teachers.  Is it not the truth that we do not want to admit that politicians perpetuate that dependency and that we live off that dependency? We must admit that there are very few who want to change that.  Politicians service their constituencies to perpetuate a dependency, to try to get across the message to constituents that they are there to serve them by getting everything from a grant.  We say, &ldquo;I will get on to the Department.  I will see so-and-so, rely on me,&rdquo; and then we send a letter saying, &ldquo;I am glad to know you have got your&rdquo;&mdash; whatever it may be housing allocation, grant &mdash;&ldquo;I was glad to be of assistance to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Politicians perpetuate that dependency as part of a political support system.  Are we prepared to see a very different basis operating there?  I might be interested to hear clearer commitment in relation to that.  I think that at the moment if anything we see it perhaps more clearly, running up to the local elections.  There is this extraordinary desire to perpetuate the dependency by claiming responsibility, or seeking to claim responsibility, for various entitlements of people as being somehow in the gift of coming to the person more quickly or more surely because of the intervention of a politician with a Department.  I think that this is something that we would have to tackle if we are genuinely anxious to change the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I come now to the other factor which I think is relevant when discussing poverty and discussing the establishment of a national agency in relation to it and that is the implications that are drawn from the realities that I have been outlining. Here again I think the report summarises these well and I would like to put this on <Col N="26" /> the record, from page 241 of the report where it stated:</P>
    <P>The positive implications of the work may be summarised as follows: given support by way of personnel, small financial aid, information training and co-operation, disadvantaged people can: (a) do things for themselves and their communities; (b) they can participate effectively; (c) they can come to terms with the complexities of official services and structures; (d) they can provide new insights into accepted practices.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about all of those positive aspects is they are very much based on the self-help, self-reliance, devolving of power, and the creation of structures which allow participation. That is very different from the present political culture, the present norm, the present situation in which we as politicians operate.  I think we would have to be prepared to support very substantial changes, cultural and structural, in that area.</P>
    <P>Then the report goes on to deal with the negative implications:</P>
    <P>The negative implications which have emerged are:</P>
    <P>participation by disadvantaged people does not happen overnight; challenges to traditional leadership and practices are not always welcome; bringing about change cannot totally be the responsibility of the poor.</P>
    <P>These in a sense are obvious but perhaps they are better stated clearly at this stage. This will be something that will have to be worked at in a structured and very concerted and committed way.  That is why I particularly welcome this Bill because I think it is a necessary component in effecting change.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the reference in this final report to the recommendation that a national agency such as this should be established.  It is dealt with on page 267 of the report and the first point that is made, which I have already made but will <Col N="27" /> re-emphasise by quoting it, is where the committee say:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the establishment of a national agency cannot replace the need for a central government social policy or for departments to review their existing policies and programmes to meet the needs of the poor.</P>
    <P>As I read the Bill, that is not something that is required by the legislation.  There is no requirement, either on central Government in relation to their social policy or on Departments, to review their own operations.  There is plenty of scope for the agency to call for this perhaps in the future and to prepare reports to do research in the area, but there is not legal obligation or any proposal in the legislation requiring this kind of response from the Government.  I think that may be an omission, which would be regrettable. It may be something that can be introduced by way of amendment to the legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the part of the report which recommends the establishment of a national agency:</P>
    <P>What is, therefore, proposed is the establishment of an agency capable of operating at national, regional and local levels, which would develop and expand the work of the pilot schemes. Its responsibilities would include: (a) the refinement and promotion of new ways of dealing with the problem of poverty along the lines pioneered by the Committee; (b) the development of a national forum which would enable poor people to speak on their own behalf; (c) recommending to Government agencies and Departments particular actions in the fight against poverty and working with them in their implementation; (d) co-ordination and dissemination of relevant information to deprived groups regarding their rights and entitlements on a range of issues; this would require the provisions of resources including library facilities and equipment; (e) provision of specialist resources, advice and <Col N="28" /> assistance to such groups and others engaged in self-help activities including priming grants and training; (f) promotion of issues research both to help deprived groups tackle the problems facing them and contribute to evaluation of policy at national level; (g) provision of specialist services and in-service training for community workers; (h) publication of a journal or magazine for the promotion of awareness on poverty and related issues; (i) acting as a focus and liaison for various community and social work interests and other groups, Government Departments, and relevant statutory and voluntary institutions.</P>
    <P>It would be the intention that the agency would be innovative in its aims, structures and methods of operation. The agency would also have a recognised policy-shaping role in regard to advice on social economic policy arising out of its action and research findings.</P>
    <P>I submit that a number of those objectives are catered for in the Bill but there are also significant omissions.  The particular omissions that concern me are that it is not clear that the committee would have among their functions the promotion of projects on the ground which would continue and expand the work which had been developed in the pilot projects and which would engender this local community self-help, community self-reliance and individual self-reliance of the individuals and groups affected. It is not clear that there would be the commitment to developing the kind of national forum which would enable poor people to speak on their own behalf.  This is something that we need.  We need to give a voice in our society to those who come within the category of being below the poverty line or disadvantaged.  At the moment they are the voiceless.  They are those who are spoken about by others but do not have the direct experience of having a forum in which to communicate and speak on their own behalf.  There are a number of other areas where, for example, the provision of specialist <Col N="29" /> resources and assistance to these groups could be used for that purpose but it is not clear in the legislation.</P>
    <P>If I might turn to the Bill against that background and look at the scope of its provisions, I would like to make a number of comments and raise a number of questions on the text of the Bill.  These are matters which obviously we can come back to on Committee Stage.  First of all, we look at the Long Title of the Bill.  I just question why it is framed as being &ldquo;An Act to provide for the establishment of a body (to be known as the Combat Poverty Agency) to advise the Minister for Social Welfare on all aspects of economic and social planning...&rdquo; Would it strengthen the scope of the agency if it were to advise the Government?  Granted it could have a special relationship with the Minister and obviously the Bill is intended to have a special relationship with the Minister for Social Welfare.  If we are talking about an agency that is really going to affect the social and economic planning of the Government, then should it not have direct access to the Government of a more significant nature, rather than simply access to the Minister and then to rely upon a particular Minister at any point in time to promote further within Cabinet, or at Cabinet level whatever recommendations may have come from the agency?  That would be my first question as to whether, if the agency is genuinely to be an instrument for the kind of social change which appears to be envisaged, it should relate directly to the Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 2 on the establishment day, I think it would be important that the Minister should make it clear what timescale he has in mind for the establishment day.  I see the necessity for the Bill actually to refer to an establishment day because that is the day the agency itself will come into operation as a body corporate.  Equally, I think it is extremely important that there would be no delay in that.  I do not see any reason why there should be a delay.  There is an interim board at the moment and apart from some administrative machinery being put into operation there should not <Col N="30" /> be any delay on it, and it is very important that the agency get underway rapidly, because section 5(2) of the Bill requires the agency to draw up a strategic plan and requires that the first plan be for the period ending 31 December 1987.</P>
    <P>Working backwards from that, the agency should be in a position, at worst, to have the first strategic plan from the end of December 1985, to the end of December 1987, which is a two year period.  In order to have a strategic plan for that period the agency should be established not later than next October, preferably even earlier than that &mdash; perhaps in June or July.  If we are to stick to the timescale that the Bill seems to envisage then the agency would have to be established.  I would welcome if the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    <P>I now come to section 4 which is a very important section relating to the functions of the agency.  It is couched in two parts.  It warrants some further explanation from the Minister in replying to the debate.  Section 4(1)(a) sets out the general functions of the agency.  I will come back to what these functions are in a moment.  I just want to get the structure of it at this stage.  They are not amendable or changeable by the Minister.  I welcome that.  They are in the Bill &mdash; the Act when passed &mdash; and they are not subject to being modified.</P>
    <P>We then come to subsection (2).  We have further functions set out without prejudice or generality.  Particular functions are set out.  There is a provision in subsection (3) whereby the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance by regulations, amend subsection (2) of this section, so as to modify or withdraw any functions to which that subsection relates or to confer such additional functions on the agency as the Minister thinks proper.  I am a little concerned at establishing an independent agency in this area and giving it powers and functions, and then saying that the Minister can wipe out all of the functions if he so wishes or, indeed, in fairness add to these functions.  Why is this felt to be desirable?  Why should the Minister want to take unto himself this kind of power? <Col N="31" /> That is a provision that would need to be explained.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the intention is that the agency would be innovative and that it would be able to achieve the kind of <i>modus operandi</i> that is clear from the final report of the committee then it seems to me to be unnecessarily restrictive to have a provision such as subsection (5) which says:</P>
    <P>The agency shall, in the performance of its functions, comply with such directions as may from time to time be given to it by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Again, why does the Minister need the heavy hand for giving directions to the agency on how to achieve its functions? If we are establishing an agency with commitment to its aims and objectives, have we not faith in the approach of the agency?  It may, by being innovative, be a thorn in the side of a Government of any particular time.  I would have thought that if an agency of this kind is not a thorn in the side it is probably not doing its job.  If it is not being quite a dynamic motor for change, and therefore to some extent an embarrassment to any bureaucracy or establishment at any point in time, then it is probably not doing its job properly.  I am concerned that the Minister is looking in that subsection for a power to direct the agency in relation to its performance and functions.  That is something that we will have to debate further and see what the Minister says in his reply about it.</P>
    <P>I referred to the requirement for strategic plans and review when I was looking at the timescale for the first plan.  That is a very good idea.  It is desirable that the agency should be encouraged and, indeed, required under the Bill to plan in that way.  That will improve the performance.</P>
    <P>I do not have any strong comment on the composition of the agency except that it is relevant to question the standard exclusion of Members of the Oireachtas. Perhaps it is particularly relevant because the members of the agency will not be <Col N="32" /> paid, apart from an allowance for attendance at meetings of the agency.  Therefore, I presume that members of the agency will not be full time in any sense, but that they will be people who will have a particular commitment.  The global exclusion of Members of both Houses does not seem to me to make any sense in that context.  It is a standard for all agencies that we establish.  It has been questioned in this House before.  I would like to see it questioned seriously in relation to this particular agency for the reasons that I have given.</P>
    <P>I come to section 9.  I would agree with Senator Fitzsimons that section 9 is very fundamental as to how this agency is going to operate because it relates to the purse strings and to the funding.  It would be important to get full information from the Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate on the manner of the funding which will be provided.  It will be provided in such amount or amounts as the Minister may fix with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister himself is already under that constraint, which is a normal constraint for Ministers. Whatever the size of the funding, it will be with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The level of funding will, to a significant degree, determine the capacity of the agency to make a substantial impact.  We have had other statutory bodies &mdash; take, for example, the Employment Equality Agency &mdash; which have not been adequately funded to discharge the tasks which were placed upon them by the legislation.  There has been argument for years on this.  It is most important that we ensure that this particular agency, which has such a significant and important role for our evolving social policy, should have adequate funding.</P>
    <P>There are other matters that are more appropriate to Committee Stage.  I am very pleased that there is express provision for disclosure of interest in proposed contracts.  This should become a standard measure for statutory bodies of this kind.  I note that there is provision that the regulations made by the Minister must be laid before the House and can be annulled by motion in the normal way. <Col N="33" /> I still think that the Minister has at this stage sought to exert too much control over an agency which, by its very nature, must have the capacity to be innovative and flexible enough to decide on how it will discharge its functions in the best manner.  It deserves the confidence of both Houses in doing that without the heavy bureaucratic hand being laid on it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the establishment of the agency and I hope that it will be achieved within a very short time and enabled to carry out the tasks set to it in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking here on the national plan some months ago and I emphasised how significant the National Development Corporation idea was then and still is.  We are now discussing an agency to carry out basic research into the causes and effects of poverty, and to deal with some measures to reduce, if not eliminate, the poverty figures.  To get the thing into proper perspective, we have to look at and examine motivation. Here are two instruments.  The average person looking at them would consider that there is no relationship and that they are different.  They are not different. They have been determined out of the social and economic thinking manifested by the existence of the kind of problems associated with unemployment, plus the fact that other people and other groups suffer from material loss by being near the poverty line or below it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are two instruments, and the question of unacceptability of unemployment and the poverty arising from it was the pressure which must have been in the minds of the people who thought up the idea of the urgency and who thought up the idea of the National Development Corporation.  There is a direct co-relation in the thinking that produced two instruments. Many people do not think that they are related but they are.  They are related because the basic thinking is the same.  They are endeavours to tackle the unemployment problem and produce, as <Col N="34" /> Senator Fitzsimons has said, full employment. He said also that he thinks this is possible.  It is possible provided that society accepts the fundamental changes which will be necessary to bring about full employment.  Up to now I see no indication, outside the two instruments, of a fundamental change in the kind of thinking that our society has involved itself in since independence.  The telephone kiosks were painted green but we copied the capitalistic thing from Britain and we are now trying to break out of the capitalistic thing because the Combat Poverty Agency will carry out extensive research and study into the poverty problem. They will make recommendations to the Minister or to the Government, if that is the way it has to be done, to deal with the problem of poverty arising from unemployment in the main so that the wellbeing of widows, orphans, old people and the sick can be looked after by material and financial measures.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is different because by reason of unemployment the nation loses the creativity, the intellect and the drive by way of loss of application to work of the best in the nation.  Even if men were to get money for nothing at full industrial wages levels I as a socialist would not be satisfied, because men and work are natural to one another.  Along with the poverty which arises from unemployment there is the denial of the opportunity to create or to use one's intellect not only in the interests of oneself and family but in the interest of the nation and the State.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency will carry out their research and will make recommendations, and I hope they will not remain a research body but will in some way be seen to be active.  It can be argued against me that the National Corporation will be an active body showing that the Government are determined to intervene where intervention is necessary.  The National Development Corporation therefore can be a very useful instrument working alongside the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>I should like to contratulate Fine Gael and my Labour colleagues for producing the idea of State activity and intervention <Col N="35" /> through the National Development Corporation in that they will be actively involved in investment as a means to an end of providing gainful employment for the unemployed.  But if fundamental rethink is necessary I wonder who will be responsible for the re-thinking.  I said also that economic pressures produce this thinking.  The Marxists call that economic determinism, and there is truth in economic determinism.  The motivation to be pure is that we cannot accept poverty but the pressure is economic.  There is truth in the idea that economics determine the way in which we move to produce a given situation or to cure given circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Here are two instruments and as a socialist I applaud the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>These are socialist measures.  Many things are done that satisfy social justice and are done by people who are not socialists. Nevertheless they feel compelled to navigate along that road.  It is not that the socialists know all the answers.  All we want is social justice so we are colleagues and fellow travellers of those who share that aspiration.  We produce instruments from time to time that are motivated by economic pressures and the big pressure is that the unemployment problem in Ireland is not acceptable.  Poverty is not acceptable.  The people who have produced these two instruments are to be commended and I congratulate them without reservation.  They are two of the most significant pieces of legislation to be brought forward in this country.  They are progressive and have been devised as a result of intelligent thinking.</P>
    <P>I note with approval the significant role to be undertaken by means of community development.  It is at community level that the effects of poverty on those sections of our people so affected are to be seen.  It is proposed in that context that the agency will promote local action programmes either on their own or in conjunction with local authorities, health boards or other organisations.  In the category of other organisations I would name trade union branches and local trade union councils, because the latter <Col N="36" /> named bodies would be only too willing to participate in local action under the auspices of the agency, especially since it is envisaged that the agency will act as a resource centre for community development in relation to poverty.</P>
    <P>The question of community development in the field of examining the causes and effects of poverty is very important. I point out the importance of grasping the real meaning of the phrase &ldquo;no one shall be in need&rdquo;.  This expression was used by the Labour Government when they were returned to office in Britain after the war.  Everyone's mind is tuned to the idea that this simply meant handing out dole.  It meant more than that.  It meant that there is an extension beyond the narrow limit of material needs or of being a recipient of a subsistence allowance or income.  Because of living in poverty, people suffer the loss of the feeling of identity, a diminution of dignity and a feeling of being shunned by society. That has a very bad psychological effect on any man, woman or family.  The impoverishment of life under these circumstances is inevitable and requires corrective action.  I hope that the combat poverty agency will pay attention to that particular area for examination.</P>
    <P>If the agency are to succeed in this area, they will need to give attention to the diminution of dignity, to the awful effects of poverty and to the problem of being shunned by society.  Therefore, I am greatly pleased to read that the objectives of the agency, as set out in the explanatory memorandum are &ldquo;to assist and encourage poor people to involve themselves as much as possible to achieve their rights and have a say in decision making&rdquo;.  That becomes very important to the human being involved, more important perhaps than the material needs to be satisfied, at least equally important.</P>
    <P>There are two specific requirements towards resolving the effects of poverty. One is the material assistance I have referred to and which involves the redistribution of wealth.  The problem is caused by maldistribution or imbalanced <Col N="37" /> distribution in the machinery of production and exchange.  That is what causes poverty and unemployment.  The machinery is not working properly and there is imbalance in redistribution.</P>
    <P>No one denies that a capitalist society &mdash; and our society is fairly capitalistic &mdash; can produce.  It can produce.  It has produced.  The big fault is that sometimes it over produces.  Over production is rampant in Europe.  They produce too much of this and too little of that.  There is efficiency in production and anarchy in distribution.  A capitalistic society cannot distribute equitably.  No matter how efficiently it seems to work in the production arena, its redistribution machinery simply does not work, so there is unemployment and its consequence, which is poverty.</P>
    <P>The second requirement is the need for personal development, the psychological effect of poverty.  I mean personal development in the sense of active participation in the life of the community.  When one becomes impoverished, one is shunned. Perhaps the second requirement is more important than the first.  It could involve education or re-education, retraining and possibly in some cases a form of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>Our society has committed itself to what is proposed in this Bill and to the setting up of a national development corporation. These two instruments represent an effort to clear the unemployment problem.  One cannot eliminate poverty unless there is full employment.  One cannot reduce poverty and eliminate it if one fails to produce full employment.  Therefore, that is what this combat poverty agency is about.  That is what the National Development Corporation are about.  They are about State intervention because they are being prepared by way of economic pressure or economic determination.  Those affected by poverty have to be brought into the mainstream of community life and all the associated activities.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the agency might simply remain a research body and not an active body but I trust that will not happen.  I am satisfied that as long as the <Col N="38" /> National Development Corporation are in being, they will be an instrument to actively promote and implement any recommendations that are made by the agency.  I congratulate the Coalition Government on these two instruments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I agree largely with the remarks of Senator McGonagle and I do not propose to go back over ground that has already been covered by the previous speakers other than to participate in the general welcome for the setting up of this new agency.  I welcome the title of the Bill. The opening word &ldquo;combat&rdquo; seems to indicate immediately that there is a forward thrust intended, that we are talking about a positive agency, an aggressive agency that will begin to tackle this indictment of and very sad reflection on the society of which we are all participants and component members.</P>
      <P>The memorandum to the Bill, as Senator McGonagle has said, sets out quite clearly, the purposes of the Bill.  They are set out under four headings; (a), (b), (c) and (d).  An adjustment was possibly called for in relation to the actual functions in that function (c) as listed on the memorandum might have been listed as (a) and that is the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the state and for that purpose the promotion, commission and interpretation of research.  Senator McGonagle rightly fired something of a warning shot when he said that he hoped his apprehensions about the agency becoming a research and advisory agency simply and solely would not be well founded and that the agency would take onto themselves the positive action which is part and parcel of their remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to establish the root causes of this indictment which is so indicative of the malaise that is prevalent in modern society.  It is very important that we face up to reality, that we appraise, evaluate, look at but above all else translate into positive action the decisions, recommendations and advice that comes from the agency.  The purpose <Col N="39" /> of the agency is to advise and assist but above all else to act.</P>
    <P>When one considers that within the past few days the St. Vincent de Paul Society produced a report for the Minister for Social Welfare about poverty, identifying some of the causes of poverty and so on and identifying that today the average family spend something in the region of 60 per cent of their income on food alone, it sets in perspective the very onerous task that is thrust on the shoulders of the people who are to man this agency.  There is underlying poverty and there is obvious poverty.  If this agency undertake the work they will be expected to undertake, I have no doubt but that some of the statistics that will emerge therefrom will serve to waken many of us out of our complacency.  When one considers that people are expected today to rear a family of nine on unemployment assistance amounting to something over £120 per week and that 60 per cent of that money will be spent on food, with clothing, fuel, rent and other expenses having to be met also, one can appreciate the stress, the strain and the pressures so many people have to cope with.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the recent budget increase of 6 per cent in social welfare benefits, an increase which is greater than the anticipated level of inflation during the coming year, I must acknowledge that the level of social welfare benefits is ridiculously low.  People cannot live on these amounts.  They merely exist at subsistence levels.</P>
    <P>I would like also to stress that one of the tasks of this agency should be to eliminate some of the anomalies which are so prevalent in our general social welfare code.  In a situation where a family are living on £120 per week unemployment assistance and where the breadwinner is genuinely unemployed, having relentlessly sought work to no avail, and where the family can prove that because of some compelling circumstances &mdash; and in most circumstances people cannot exist with any degree of comfort on that weekly allowance &mdash; community welfare officers should be <Col N="40" /> empowered to augment, supplement and top up the level of unemployment assistance. At present this is not happening. On several occasions I have approached community welfare officers in my health board area bringing to their attention a particular pressing problem where a person on unemployment assistance simply was not able to subsist or exist but the standard reply I get from community welfare officers &mdash; and I have great respect for the discretionary manner in which they generally discharge their functions &mdash; is that for as long as the person is qualifying for unemployment assistance from the Department of Social Welfare, that money cannot be topped up.</P>
    <P>This is something that should be tackled. The very nature of the word &ldquo;supplementary&rdquo; implies that it is there to augment incomes and to alleviate hardship.  I acknowledge that the welfare officers do marvellous work in relation to providing interim payments while the applicant is waiting for his or her entitlement to come through from the Department of Social Welfare but the vast majority of people, and I am not talking about people on smallholders assistance, living on unemployment assistance today cannot survive on the level of payment I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the fact that we have also an anomaly where we find medical referees assessing people for disability benefit and where the referee sets out to disprove, to disclaim, or to refuse to accept the work of acknowledged proven specialists in the particular area of malaise, injury or disease with which the applicant is afflicted.  I do not think that the word of an eminent orthopaedic surgeon or specialist should be discarded cursorily, as seems to happen in relation to establishing people's genuine injury, illness, disease or other disability.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the family income supplement.  Here we have an example of what I am calling for in relation to the application of the supplementary welfare allowance.  The kernel of the success of the agency is outlined at <Col N="41" /> the bottom of the explanatory memorandum. It explains that the statutory authorities and the local organisations are welded together to provide an integrated response to the needs of the poor.  If we can achieve that and eliminate the overlapping, if we can get purposeful decisive action, if we can get money &mdash; a key component to the success of this agency &mdash; we will be well on the way to the achievement of the objectives of the agency.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that money is the answer to all cases.  There is a crying need for an advisory service, to advise families who are trying to exist on very limited resources, as to the best method of deploying these resources.  I am talking about the area of home economics, of dieting and dietary requirements, budgetary provisions and household budgeting.  I would see this as being one of the very useful functions which will be realised and fulfilled by the agency.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGonagle that until such time as we eliminate the real scourge which afflicts our society today, and which is responsible for so much poverty, we will not have broken the back of the problem.  I refer to the scourge of unemployment.  Again I appeal to all agencies, all Departments and all Ministers to purposefully set about exploiting the indigenous resources we have and which we are not utilising.  Last year we imported foodstuffs to the value of about £800 million, all of which could have been produced in this country and which could have reduced our balance of payments as well as giving very useful employment in the production, the marketing and the processing sectors.  One appreciates fully the resources we have but which are under-utilised.  It is that situation that has brought about the need for this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>On inspecting the explanatory memorandum of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill I made a few notes. Section 2(a) is to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in the State.  The first question I would ask is, on <Col N="42" /> what criteria will that advice be obtained? Whose advice will be sought?  It is important in our changing society that we seek the advice not only of experts but of the people generally.</P>
      <P>The next section is about the initiation of measures aimed at over-crowding poverty in the State and the evaluation of such measures.  I should like the Minister to consider this as a challenge, not to see it as a means of rationalising resources to get better economic use out of them but rather trying to create a politic and a community interest which will liberate the resourcefulness of the people.  For far too long in Ireland, both North and South, we have been very concerned with limited resources and not concerned enough about the limitless talents of our people and of how to mobilise these talents and to trust the people to mobilise their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we turn to the examination of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in this State and for that purpose, the promotion, commission and interpretation of research.  When we consider the nature of the poverty, I do not think that it is too much of a cliche to emphasise yet again that poverty and powerlessness in Ireland go hand in hand, particularly at a time when Ireland seems to have done what it took England much longer to do, depopulated its countryside and stuck many of the people into Dublin.  There is a great sense of futility, there is a great feeling, even among those who are invited to participate, that their participation means nothing because they do not have the power to make it effective.  The promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty requires not just knowledge. There is a tendency when one reads this to feel that we are going to do a lot of research and to find out a lot of facts.  It requires a heightened awareness of what is going on.  That again means contact with the people where the poverty exists and a facility provided for a whole new generation to become much more aware of the various strands and facets of the society in which they live so that they, from a point of awareness, can mobilise <Col N="43" /> the resources to do something about poverty.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that I do not believe we will succeed any more than we succeeded in the Litter Bill if it is thought that by legislation and by the setting up of an agency to determine what the woes of the people of Ireland are we will then tell them what is best for them, give them the medicine and everything will be fine.  We have got to do something much more fundamental, that is to engage the people in a dialogue about their own condition and to challenge vested interest where vested interest is not prepared to engage the people so that we can show a new sense of trust in each other and out of that trust, even if a considerable portion of it may be misplaced, will evolve our own solutions to our own very unique problems.  I want to give one short quotation from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Thursday, 18 April.  It is headed: &ldquo;Redeeming Ireland's Bartered Pride&rdquo; and it is the second of two articles by Professor Joe Lee.  I quote:</P>
    <P>We need a shift in our whole mental axis, but not one that sacrifices our residual scraps of identity for nothing better than servility to subsidise squatters, instead of fostering the self-reliance that requires an education of intellect, imagination and character. When the foundations are fragile, the frantic effort devoted to keeping up the paint work is doomed to futility, however lucrative it may be for the decorators of the day.</P>
    <P>I think there is something to be learned from that rather salutary statement.</P>
    <P>If we look around us and look at the problem of poverty the one thing that Ireland has perhaps more than most Western European countries is a very over centralised and over governed society.  We talk about our levels of deprivation. I have not heard many of the speeches on this Bill, but I feel certain that much has been made of deprivation in regard to housing, community life, living, lack of opportunity amongst youngsters and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> From that we find that a whole argument and debate goes on about justifying all manner of deviation in our society on the basis of this social deprivation.  What are we going to do about it?  First of all, we have to acknowledge that we are living at this moment in an era of a greater rate of change than man has ever been confronted with before.  At the same time we seem to have a more rigid system than ever before, more centrally controlled. We should be seeking a much more flexible political system particularly at local community level to try to respond to the ongoing difficulties as and when they arise.  If people are subjected to either a rate of change or a depth of change which is beyond their adaptive mechanism to respond to positively then they will respond to it negatively.  We all know what that means in terms of violence and apathy.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago both in this part of Ireland and in the other part of Ireland imperial order reigned supreme.  There was a sort of unwritten imperial code.  As long as one held onto that code then society did not seem to be in any risk of fragmenting.  In today's world the imperial code is fragmenting.  It does not have to be the English form of it.  The whole institutional framework of imperialism has fragmented in recent years. We have yet to put something in its place. What we have to put in its place is a new society based on trust.  I do not believe we can get trust unless we reduce the scale of our enterprise rather than increasing it.  It is in an emphasis more on diminishing size and relating to a more healthy scale of enterprise rather than perpetuating centralism and institutionalism that we will find the answers to the sort of problems that are posed by this Bill and the need for it.  This bring me to the need to have a radical change in our political outlook so that we can allow the people to help with the institutions to create a response to their own need and to have that need supported and subsidised where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>Let us take the business of change.  In an unresourceful person or a fragmented community if change is imposed from <Col N="45" /> outside it is inevitable that that community and the people in it will react rather than respond, will feel threatened rather than challenged.  If we are going to change that so that they feel challenged, so that they will respond, then I think we have got to give them back what they have lost, trust, accountability to themselves, responsibility for themselves and the power to make their decisions effective where they live.  It is no good talking about this unless we are concerned with the economics of it.  The economics of it will require a shift of economic power as well as political power from the central institutions of the State to local communities so that the people, where they live, can decide on their own priorities.</P>
    <P>The danger of this is that one can move from one extreme to another and end up with petty village type feudalism again. That is not what I am suggesting.  I am suggesting a need to create a new dynamic between the central institutions of the State and the citizen in community. We need to shift from those prosperous and privileged communities economic power to the deprived communities and to try to encourage those deprived communities to set up the political structures in them, to try to determine how they will use the social space that we are going to share with them, how they will undertake creative work to give people creative things to do and how they will begin to feel that the society they live in is inviting them to participate and is giving them the power to make that participation effective.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at a few of the figures to see how over centralised we have become.  In 1926, Dublin city and county contained 17 per cent of the population, in 1985, 30 per cent of the population. I understand that the European capitals on the whole, apart from Greece, contain less than 20 per cent of the population. France has grappled with this problem.  I mention France in particular because in the late seventies it was seen as perhaps the most over centralised country in Europe with all the power located in Paris.  There has been a struggle to decentralise France.  It has not <Col N="46" /> come to its full fruition, but there certainly have been moves to create a more constructive type of society in which the ordinary citizen feels that he has again a role to play.  I would, therefore, suggest that in combating poverty and in setting up this agency to combat poverty the agency should go out to seek from the people the suggestions which will bring about their own salvation, because we will have to seek some very fundamental salvation of our plight.  As we all know, we have moved into the high tech era. There is no way, much as we might like it, that we can develop alternative technology to compete with high technology. High technology is here to stay.  High technology must mean either fewer and fewer hours in employment, or if we continue to employ people fully for reasonably long hours then they must be pushed into service industries because to employ them industrially would be to invite ecological destruction.  On the other hand, if we push them all into service industries are we not actually increasing the controls on our lives, which again is part of a vicious circle and we are back to where we started.</P>
    <P>We should be encouraging less and less time in employment but a greater sharing of the available employment, perhaps the pursuit of a new human right, the right of access to an equitable share of available employment in the community, the right of access for the community to available employment in the region and the right of access of the region to an equitable share of available employment for the nation.  In that sense you would not only be bringing a decentralisation of employment opportunity but you would also be emphasising the need to share that opportunity, and right of access does not imply any form of compulsion.  It implies the right to have it but to be sure that that right can be exercised and to ensure that the employment that there is is, in fact, shared.  It also requires us to look at how do we determine what people will be employed to do and how do we determine or who decides what we are to produce. On the other side of the coin, as I have <Col N="47" /> said, how do the people use their talents constructively?</P>
    <P>I, therefore, conclude with a few suggestions, ones that I made in this House over a year ago.  We should address ourselves to the need for a new style of politic in order to bring about this redistribution of power so that central institutions in the State, and this is what I hope this advisory body can address itself to, will be seen as serving need determined by the people in community rather than dictating to them what that need should be.</P>
    <P>First of all I feel that every home in the island should be part of a tenants' association and that these tenants' associations should put forward an elected representative to serve on a local community council.  When we come to talk about the district council or the county council we should start to address ourselves to the need perhaps not only to have direct representation from the people but also indirect representation from the council immediately below the one that we are talking about so that you would end up in Northern Ireland with a district council which would be elected by the people but would also have representatives from the community councils.  The attempt would be to try to break out at local level of a party political control or at least give the party politicians at local level the challenge of a more independently minded representation.  Let us take the tax system.  Is it not high time we addressed ourselves, if we are really interested in giving the people back the right to participate as Irishmen in Ireland and to determine what direction their endeavours will take them, the economic power to decide their own priorities? There would be a great danger, and this would be pure communism, if all the taxes were collected locally and the local people acted almost with complete autonomy.  We are not talking about that. What I am suggesting is that we should collect our taxes in such a way that it is quite clear that a small percentage goes to the centre of the State, a slightly larger percentage to the regional government in <Col N="48" /> the State and the largest proportion of all is held in local communities.</P>
    <P>May I just take three figures which I mentioned before?  If all the four million people in Ireland were to pay 10 per cent of their total tax to the centre, 20 per cent to the regional assembly and 40 per cent to the local district council then the 40 per cent would be available for decision making locally on local priorities. There is still 30 per cent left over.  This could be used on a sliding scale to shift economic resources from the privileged communities to the deprived communities and with the emphasis on the right of the people where they live to determine priorities for themselves and yet to do it in such a way that it would be within the overall strategy, regional or national, of the society in which they live.  I am not suggesting that you give back complete power to people in local communities, because there are tremendous dangers in that.  I am suggesting that we should look more seriously at the balance between the centre, the citizen and the community and that at the moment it seems to be much too much loaded in the central direction; and when we talk about decentralisation all too often the state centre, in this case Dublin, is talking about giving to the natives as little as possible to keep them happy in order to hold on to as much as possible and to continue to manipulate power as before.</P>
    <P>What I am talking about is autonomy and the interbalance between autonomy which gives the people back the right to determine for themselves what they are going to do with their talents and resources and how they relate with those talents and resources to the rest of the State to which they belong in a much more politically dynamic manner than is done at present.</P>
    <P>In order to provide the information &mdash; I emphasise here again something I have overemphasised by repetition, is the need for a statutorily well serviced citizens' advice bureau in every community in the country, properly equipped with audio video cassette service and, as we move into the high tech era, presumably with proper computer terminals so that you <Col N="49" /> can find out at a moment's notice your entitlement, whatever you need to find out about the State apparatus and how you can mobilise the resources of the State within the context of the law to meet the particular demands in the local community.  This becomes more and more important among deprived communities and the poverty bound people in those communities.  They must have access to the State machinery, they must have access to the knowledge of what their entitlements are and they must also have the power, as I emphasised earlier, to do something to break out of the situation. It cannot be broken merely by prescription from the centre.  Prescription has its place, but the final solution must be in trusting the people and giving them the power to exercise a trust in a fully mature way.</P>
    <P>With regard to our institutions at present there are many institutions in Ireland, particularly State, semi-State institutions and big corporations, that are controlled by capital located elsewhere, where the ordinary people round about that particular enterprise or organisation and the people working in it feel powerless to determine or to make decisions which are meaningful in the course of their everyday life.  I am convinced that for those enterprises in Ireland where the organisation is a semi-State or State organisation or where capital is located outside of the community in which that enterprise is situated we must set up a tripartite co-operative principle, and that tripartite co-operative principle will require representation from those who work in the organisation at annual general meetings, representation in the case of a State service of the community which is served or in the instance of some corporation which has a plant in a part of Ireland, the right of the local citizens to express an opinion with regard to matters of pollution, employment and so forth.</P>
    <P>That is the second leg.  The third leg is of course, the institution leg.  In my own situation in a hospital you have got to relate to the institutions which have brought the development of the service to the point at which it now is.  So you <Col N="50" /> have to relate to the royal colleges, the general medical councils, the general nursing council, the trade union movement and so on.  Those three legs of a tripartite co-operative system will become more and more essential in a high technology era facing the challenge of a high technology economy in an over-centralised society.</P>
    <P>We should encourage everywhere the development of community guilds, guilds dealing with health, with matters of work in employment, the environment, education, where we engage the voluntary and the statutory bodies and oblige them to meet annually, bi-annually or quarterly in each community throughout the country to discuss openly the problems which face the people who are involved in the whole business of promoting health, developing education and so on, so that we become aware of what is available, we become aware of how it interrelates and we open up our society to have a much more productive and constructive debate than we have had heretofore.  The community guild is a matter of selecting the health agencies, the educational agencies, the agencies involved in employment and the problems of ecology. The community forum, on the other hand, is something that should be held in the local hall, again, quarterly, bi-annually or annually or whatever is thought fit, but there should be a statutory obligation to have a minimum number of times to meet to discuss matters of fundamental importance.  Are our talents being mobilised, are they being liberated, are they being developed?  Have we got the facilities in our community to allow these talents to develop?  We could have a session on power, how is it distributed?  We could have a session on resources, how are they used and how are they owned, but we have got to spark the enthusiasm of the people so that they feel they are living in a country that cares and because it cares it invites them to participate with the institutions of the State to evolve a new approach, a new sense of direction and to charge the people with a new spirit.</P>
    <P>It is a challenge to vested interests, <Col N="51" /> and vested interest does not like being challenged, but we will never attack poverty in the sense that this Bill is attempting to attack it if we believe that it can be attacked by prescription through a combat poverty agency being set up to find out the facts and saying what the solutions are.  The solutions must be found by the people, and this must be the catalyst whereby the people find their solutions.  This must not be a prescription.</P>
    <P>Finally, something I would love to see happen in Ireland is the development of national social service.  Every child who leaves school before he gets any third level education of any sort, be that third level education at the work bench or in the university library, should be obliged to become more aware as a citizen of the country he lives in by a period of national social service where, if he is privileged, he meets poverty head on, where, if he comes from a deprived community, he has the opportunity to go out and see how other people live, where ideas and feelings can at long last be interchanged across all the ridiculous boundaries that we have and we begin to see ourselves as an organic community working for the common good.  The common good is something that we will feel more and more instinctively the more we know about the rest of the commonality.</P>
    <P>If I see power at the centre of things I can see a reversible equation going towards the citizen in the community in this direction, and a reversible equation going in that direction towards the central institutions of the State.  The central institutions of the State seem to be charged at present with imperialism and centralism, and this centralism and these imperial attitudes are sustained by the interests of class, capital, church, and State institutionalism. You can rest assured that you will see in many parts of Ireland where people claim to be good community people that once the interests particularly of class and capital are challenged community goes out through the window and those two interests seem to come in.  I do not believe we will be able to cope with <Col N="52" /> our poverty and deprivation and all the social malaise we have at the moment unless we are concerned with the citizen's awareness, the responsibility he has for himself and for those around him, his accountability to others in the community in which he lives and the need to educate in the form of development rather than refinement.  Our whole education process today is the business of refining talent, alienating people from the whole when it could so easily be about developing the person and relating him to the whole, to be more conscious of the whole, to know more about it and to try to take on board some of those items which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, welcome this Bill.  I hope the combat poverty agency, when it is set up, will see its functions as a catalyst, to catalyse the people to do something for themselves and in the process to realise that the more deprived the people the less opportunity they will have to do anything for themselves.  This means a shift of economic power so that power, economic and political, will go hand in hand with participation and that the institutions will struggle with the people in the community to create the answer to these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think Senators for their very wide-ranging and constructive comments on the subject matter of the Bill.  There is no basic disagreement amongst Senators on the fact that poverty exists on a wide scale in this country and affects a very large number of people.  The increasing level of unemployment in recent years has brought more people into poverty and at the same time has made it more difficult to redistribute resources in sufficient quantity to deal adequately with the various manifestations of poverty, whether financial poverty or otherwise, in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators drew attention to the link between poverty and other social problems including crime, drugs and a general alienation of some sections of the population from society as a whole. <Col N="53" /> The Members of the House are keenly aware of this aspect of the problem and I do not have to emphasise the seriousness of it.</P>
    <P>Indeed I think it is fair to say that the present Government and earlier Governments have for some time been acutely conscious of the need to improve the conditions of the poorer sections of the community and a considerable amount has been done in this respect. In the publication <i>Poverty and Income Maintenance Policies in Ireland 1973-80</i>, which updated the data in the Joyce and McCashin study from which Senator Michael Higgins quoted extensively, John D. Roche concludes that the extent of poverty in 1980 was substantially lower than in 1973 and estimates that the total population poor was reduced by 27 per cent or more.  In this regard income maintenance policies have had considerable success.  However, the incidence of poverty has altered in the meantime because of the growing numbers of unemployed.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan laid great stress on the need to give the unemployed an adequate income.  I think we all agree about this, and the present Government have given concrete recognition to the importance of maintaining the income of the unemployed not only by keeping their payments in line with inflation but also by giving special increases to the long term unemployed.  This extra assistance should go some way to easing the additional problems of people who have been on a low income for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also mentioned the large numbers of low paid who can also be classified as poor.  The Government have already taken steps to ease the burden in this area through the family income supplement which came into payment last September.  Although the number of applications has not been as high as expected there are some 5,500 families now receiving an additional weekly supplement which at least brings their total disposable income over what it would be on unemployment of disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The problem of financial poverty is <Col N="54" /> dealt with mainly through the social welfare system, which is primarily an income maintenance service.  Senators Fallon and O'Brien made the point that, of course, financial poverty was not the only problem.  Many people on reasonable incomes are unable to provide adequately for themselves and their families, and I have no doubt that were we able to substantially increase unemployment payments the problem would still not be solved.  The reasons for this situation arise to a great extent from environmental and educational conditions.  These are some of the fundamental problems which I would expect the new agency to explore.  There are some basic conditions in society which cannot be solved by increased cash resources alone.</P>
    <P>It is important to examine the efficacy of many of the existing policies and programmes and their impact on poverty.  It is equally important, where programmes are found to be ineffective, to search for alternative approaches.  This will be the main task of the new agency.  There is no doubt that to deal adequately with the problem of poverty in the long term, major changes will be needed in economic and social policies.  The Government have recognised this fact in their programme, which refers specifically to the drawing up and implementing of an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning concentrating on a more just distribution of wealth, income and power.  The new agency will have a central role to play in this context and, as Senator Michael D. Higgins pointed out, this aspect of the agency's role is listed as the first general function of the agency in section 4 (1) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The agency is also intended to be an action agency and not just an agency which promotes research and gives advice.  Senator Fallon expressed some doubts about the need for further research in relation to poverty.  I agree that a considerable amount of study has been done and I would expect the agency to have regard to it in drawing up its first strategic plan.  The agency may also need further information on specific areas, and <Col N="55" /> it would be advisable to obtain this in order to ensure that its planning is as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>In this connection I might refer to what was said by Senator Fitzsimons concerning the need to make use of the expertise available &mdash; sociologists, social scientists etc. &mdash; who can assist through their research in identifying the problems which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The new research, however, should be linked to practical action.  We need practical solutions and approaches to making policies on social welfare, health, housing, education and other areas more effective in tackling the problems.  The agency will be responsible for testing new methods of dealing with poverty, and it will have to closely monitor the progress and results of the projects it will promote for this purpose.  If these methods are successful they can then be applied on a wider scale.  The existing agencies will be responsible generally for putting the new methods into effect.  The new input of the Combat Poverty Agency will be done when a project has been tested and evaluated, but care will have to be taken that the evaluation has been thoroughly done.</P>
    <P>One of the benefits of research is that it helps to increase the level of general awareness of the existence of poverty, and the promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State is one of the general functions of the new agency as set out in section 4 of the Bill.  While people are aware in a general way of the various manifestations of poverty in our society, it is obvious from a number of surveys which have been carried out in recent years, and to which Senator Higgins and others referred, that attitudes to poverty and to poor people often show a high degree of prejudice and misinformation. There is clearly a need for more information and education in this area, and I would hope that the agency will pay particular attention to this aspect of its work.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, during the course of their contributions, referred to certain items of detail.  These will be dealt with <Col N="56" /> in more detail on the various sections of the Bill.  I should like, however, to refer briefly to some of them now.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons spoke in some detail about the question of how poverty is to be defined and the causes of poverty in our midst.  Many books have been written on this subject, and it will be one of the tasks of the agency to examine this question from the Irish perspective.  We are also, of course, looking to the agency to put forward constructive proposals for action to combat poverty.  A number of the detailed aspects of this raised by Senators can, as I have stated, be dealt with more appropriately in the context of the debate, particularly on section 4 of the Bill, which outlines the functions of the agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson quoted extensively from the final report of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, 1974-80 which analyses the characteristics of poverty and stresses the need to consider radical solutions to the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that the establishment of the agency will not in itself solve the problem of poverty, but the Government commitment in this area is set out in <i>Building on Reality.</i>  The new agency will have a central role in advising on the drawing up of the anti-poverty plan referred to in that document and the Bill enables it to do so.  It is agreed, however, that it will be for the Government to adopt the necessary policies based on that advice.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also questioned the provision referred to in the Long Title under which the agency will advise the Minister.  She stated that she would prefer if the agency had direct access to the Government as a whole, as Government policy is involved in action to combat poverty.  It had been intended from the outset, as set out in the Programme for Government, that the agency would be the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the agency should deal directly in all aspects of its activities &mdash; its financing, strategic planning, and so on &mdash; with the same Minister.  The <Col N="57" /> agency will have the right to publish its report, so that its views on poverty will be generally available and not only to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also questioned section 4(3) of the Bill which enables the Minister to amend the functions of the agency by regulations.  She was worried that the Minister might use the power to restrict the agency as she pointed out, the power extended only to the amendment of the subsidiary functions of the agency and not to the four basic functions contained in section 4 (1).  The purpose of section 4 (3) is to enable the Minister to amend the functions without having to amend the legislation.  It is envisaged that the power given in section 4 (3) would only be used if the Minister wished to expand the functions of the agency rather than to restrict those functions in any way.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also referred to section 4(5) of the Bill which provides that the agency must comply with any directions given to it by the Minister.  She felt that this would unduly restrict the agency in the performance of its functions.  This is a standard provision when agencies of this kind are being set up; there must be ministerial responsibility for the agency and the Minister is the one who must report to the Government on the agency and ensure that the agency fulfils its functions adequately.  He is responsible for the funds allocated by Government to the agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also referred to section 9 which concerns the funding of the agency and expressed concern for the adequate financing of the agency.  I would like to point out that under subsection (2) it will be a matter for the agency, in the first instance, to submit its estimates. This is obligatory.  It will then be for the Minister to settle the grants to be paid.  The consent of the Minister for Finance will be required because he has overall responsibility for the allocation of public funds.  This is a standard provision with regard to agencies of this nature.  It is not intended that the agency should be hamstrung by lack of funds in so far as <Col N="58" /> resources allow.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the inadequate level of social welfare payments and to the other defects of the system such as delays in payment.  The Government see the need for a complete review of the whole social welfare system, and one of their first actions was to set up the Commission on Social Welfare to take a new look at the whole system.  This is the first time since the social welfare code was set up in 1982 that this has been done.  The Commission report is due out later this year, and I look forward to recommendations which may give us a more effective and more equitable system for the society of the present day.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb mentioned the need to foster the development of local community structures to combat poverty.  The Bill provides that the new agency would act as a resource sector for community development to combat poverty.  This will be a very important part of its work.  I fully agree with Senator Robb that we must enable people, encourage and facilitate them, to identify their problems and to come together to solve the problems in a community context.</P>
    <P>The House has shown its concern over the problem of poverty in our society and has not challenged the need for an integrated approach.  The agency which is proposed in this Bill represents the correct basic structure for a new anti-poverty campaign, and I hope to have the support of the House for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to take special measures to arrest the decline in output and employment in the building and construction industry and to deal in particular with the special difficulties of the private house building sector.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of moving this motion even at this late stage. This was first put down in February of this year.  Unfortunately, motions are often overcome by time but in regard to this particular one there is greater deterioration since it was introduced.  It could be regarded more as an emergency motion now than it was earlier because no corrective measures whatever have been taken by the Government to try to restore some stability to the building industry.  As with agriculture, if there is a healthy, viable building industry in the country you have a lot of satisfied customers. It gives a very high measure of employment.</P>
      <P>Building houses has many results, whether they be local authority houses or private houses.  There is an increased grant from £1,750 to £2,000 in the local authority section.  This has occurred as a result of the £1,750 grant being exhausted in full by the increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  There must have been an awareness on the part of the Government, and they introduced that increase.  It was the only measure introduced since budget time and, indeed, since we put down this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a four year period the level of construction activity has fallen by 32 per cent and the impact of the decline in construction output over the past four years on employment has been that some 24,000 building workers have lost their jobs.  The official figure for unemployment in the construction industry in December 1984 was 45.607.  This represents an increase of 3,542 on the December figures of 1983.  This amounted to an <Col N="61" /> increase in the level of unemployment by 8½ per cent.</P>
    <P>The level of the capital programme is a major factor in determining the amount of activity in any one year.  Over the past four years the capital programme has fallen in real terms by 25 per cent.  This, coupled with the sharp decline in investment, has resulted in the decline in the industry's fortunes which I have referred to earlier.  In March 1983 the rate of VAT on the construction industry was increased from 3 per cent to 5 per cent. It is estimated that this resulted in an additional £25 million in VAT receipts for the ten months of that year.  It is further estimated that in 1984 £75 million was collected in VAT from the industry as a result of the increase in March 1983. The effect of increasing the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent is that an additional £63 million will be collected over the period of March to December. The impact of deferring the increase until 1 May would reduce this by approximately £50 million.  Overall the projected VAT receipts in 1985 for the construction industry will be in excess of £130 million. Now the reason for the increase in the VAT on housing is that the output of the industry has dropped more sharply than the output in other sections such as the industrial and commercial building sections and projects funded by the capital programme.</P>
    <P>House completions from 1981 to 1984 have dropped considerably from 28,917 in 1981 down to 25,000 in 1984.  Local authority house completions, however, have increased from 5,750 to 7,000 in 1984.  Private housing has dropped from 23,000 to 18,000 in the same period. Speculative housing has dropped from 10,000 to 6,650 and once-off completions have dropped by roughly 500 houses. Overall housing completions have declined by approximately 15 per cent over the past four years.  Of greater significance, however, is the decline in speculatively-built houses and to a lesser degree in the once-off houses, which is a real phenomenon.</P>
    <P>The decline in speculatively-built <Col N="62" /> house from 10,000 in 1981 to an estimated 6,650 last year represents a serious problem for a Government who in accordance with their national plan are dedicated to developing policies to encourage more people to opt for owning a house rather than to rely on the local authority for the provision of such accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have not got the figures for the £5,000 grant to encourage people from local authority housing to build their own houses.  I do not think it has worked in the rural parts of the country as much as it has in other parts.  Definitely from the information I am getting I do not think that it has worked or that it has lured people from local authority houses in my area.  Private sector housing has declined by over 25 per cent in the past four years. The area where this decline has most impact is in the speculative market.  The reasons for this decline are as follows: decline in real disposable incomes; increase in VAT from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in 1983; reduction in mortgage interest relief in April 1983.  This measure reduced the extent to which house purchasers could set off interest on mortgages against income tax.  Of course, the introduction of the residential property tax is another reason.  The increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent can only further accelerate this decline.  It has been stated that the increase in the house purchase grant for first-time buyers from £1,000 to £1,750, and now to £2,000, was intended to offset the effect of the increase in VAT.  It should be noted that this is only a partial offset because one must remember that 40 per cent of all the houses built are privately owned.  Only 60 per cent of houses built are local authority or other houses.  For that reason for the 40 per cent of the first time buyers, the 5 per cent increase in VAT would increase the price of that house.  The Government increased the grant to £2,000 because the £1,750 must not have been sufficient to offset that increase.</P>
    <P>On the supply side, the trend in house building costs and new house prices point to a sharp deterioration in builders' margins. Between the first quarter of 1980 <Col N="63" /> and June 1984 house building costs increased by 66 per cent whereas new house prices increased only by 39 per cent.  This is totally against normal traditional trends.  It is our view that the increase in VAT will meet with consumer resistance.  House building firms are unable to absorb this increase in their costs given a weak market situation.  This will reduce the level of building activity, therefore reducing the supply of new private housing.  This can only translate itself into a demand for increases in the level of local authority house building, which has implications for capital expenditure and current expenditure as far as the Government are concerned.  It is my view that as a result of the increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent further jobs will be lost in the construction industry.  It is very hard to monitor a figure on the number of jobs that will be lost, because of all the ancillary services that are required from the bench to the turning of the key in any particular building.  With all the people that will be involved down the line it is very hard to monitor the number of people that will be unemployed as a result of this reduction in house building.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy as outlined in the national plan and the Programme for Government which sets a target of 30,000 houses per annum will not be successful as a result of the increase in VAT and the other measures which I have referred to.  The stark reality facing the construction industry in general and the house building industry in particular is for a continuation of a decline in the level of building activity, and a decline in the numbers of people employed.  As I said earlier, I see no good coming out of this increase in VAT at a time when we should be trying to rescue the building industry. Indeed, many builders are going to the wall each year as a result of all the taxation following the passage of legislation. While the Government say they are going to offset the VAT by increased grants, it does not work out that way, because lesser amounts of money will be available for the 60 per cent local authority houses. <Col N="64" /> If there is less money for housing we are going to have fewer houses built.  I know that without ever seeing what the Minister has in his hand, he is going to say to us on this side of the House that more money has been given to housing this year than was given in previous years. That is not the end product, Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The end product will be that while the Minister gives more money that does not mean that he is going to build more houses because when he increases the cost surely he is going to get a bigger capital grant allocation.  But that does not say that the Minister is going to build more houses.  There are a number of categories other than houses in the construction industry that are affected. We must consider schools, hospitals, agricultural offices, advance factories and all types of buildings.  I would like the Government to publish a public construction programme, such as for hospitals, schools, sanitary services and all projects of an infrastructural nature which would create opportunities in the construction sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers employed to service these houses is enormous.  From the beginning of the construction, plumbers, electrical engineers and heating engineers are employed.  There are carpet suppliers, furnishers, painters and decorators. People are employed as internal and external decorators and landscapers. Other services are required to build a house on a site and to make it fit to occupy.  You are unable to monitor the number of people involved at every level. It is impossible to calculate the number who have lost jobs as a result of the reduction in the manufacture of materials. In my own area of Westport one of the most traditional suppliers has gone out of business.  One of the suppliers who imported materials through Westport harbour and who had a tradition behind him in business is gone as a result of deceleration in the building industry.  A <Col N="65" /> number of Irish workers and their families who have returned from abroad over the last ten years to work in the building industry here must now rethink their futures, and that of their families and decide whether to return to previous employment or to continue on the dole. The loss of their expertise is enormous.</P>
    <P>A large number of people are employed in the acquisition of large tracts of development land in cities and throughout the country, many people are employed in design and planning.  Large numbers of solicitors and their clerks as well as auctioneers and estate agents are employed also.  Many people lose their jobs when the construction industry suffers a decline.  The whole economy needs attention. The private sector especially needs some input.  There is a drop in the number of private houses.  In 1981 there were 22,000 new houses.  That figure has been reduced considerably every year down to 18,000 at the moment.  It is suggested that we should build 25,000 to 30,000 houses a year, but we are trying to lure the people from the local authority scene to private housing.  With the population explosion 20,000 new family units need housing every year.  That is a statistical figure.  The policy of the Government is insufficient to meet this trend.  It is not good enough for the Government to defend their policy on housing by saying to me that more was spent last year than this year.  The reality is that fewer houses have been built and that there will not be enough houses to meet the population explosion.</P>
    <P>This is the time to take initiatives to combat the unemployment problem.  The Government should turn their attention to this area at this time when so many are unemployed.  People on loans are finding it impossible to meet their repayments because of a number of deterrents.  For instance, it costs an additional £28 per month on a £20,000 mortgage as a result of the 2 per cent increase being allowed to building societies.  Many other people with mortgages are caught by unemployment. The breadwinner of families &mdash; or indeed in some cases the two breadwinners, the husband and wife who may have <Col N="66" /> been working in order to try to meet their repayments &mdash; are unemployed.  I hope some corrective measure will be taken as early as possible to correct this trend.</P>
    <P>We are glad even at this late stage to get an opportunity on this side of the House to bring this to the notice of the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to do something for the building industry. Nothing has happened since February. Every day people who have come from England to set up here and who were in secure employment in England are going back again or else staying on unemployment assistance.  I ask the Minister to try to improve the position in the building industry.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorses the overall economic strategy as set out in the National Plan of sustained and soundly based growth in the economy; recognises the importance which the Government attaches to the Building &amp; Construction Industry and its special role in the overall development of the economy as evidenced both by the high level of public investment provided for during the period of the plan and the increased share of total PCP investment in the industry over the same period; commends the special measures taken to underpin the housing sector of the industry and supports the Government in its continued efforts to ensure a healthy economy from which the building industry will benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That amendment is based first of all on the proposals that are contained in this <Col N="67" /> plan, and for the first time ever in the history of this State we have a Government committed to a spending programme over a specific period in which everybody in this country knows the kind of capital investment that will be made by this Government whether it is in hospital construction, infrastructural development such as roads, sanitary services, sewerage schemes, housing, local authority building.  All this is contained in <i>Building on Reality.</i> In addition to that I think it is appropriate that we get an opportunity to identify why the amendment is necessary to this motion.  The only way you can identify something is to prove conclusively and positively that something specific has been done under the various headings under both the control of the Minister, Mr. Liam Kavanagh, who is present and indeed many other Ministers.  Particularly I am proud to speak of the Labour Party Ministers in this Government.  First of all, I would like to say as a member of a health board that I am aware that for the first time conclusive proof has been given in agreement within this plan of hospital developments throughout Ireland and particularly in my own region which had never been identified by any Government previously in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I am talking about hospital development in Dungarvan which we were endlessly promised from election to election for 20 years.  That development is now under construction.  I am talking also about a 100 bed psychiatric hospital in Clonmel itself, a town you know well, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and which now for the first time after 25 years of promises is almost complete.  That is a public injection into a building programme in areas where the public demand that the necessary services be provided.  I am talking, too, about a major capital project in Ardkeen Regional Hospital, proposals in respect of which are now before the Government and which are included in this plan.  The people know that when a hospital is started now, it will be completed in a period of six or seven years.  The total <Col N="68" /> capital investment required and promised by this Government to develop the hospitals in Waterford is £31,170,000.  We also have approval for a major hospital development in Kilkenny city, a further aspiration towards the general hospital development programme, and indeed in Wexford we have a capital project of about £6 million or £7 million.</P>
    <P>Surely the Opposition are not serious when they suggest that all this construction by way of public money is not an injection into the construction industry. Of course it is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When one wishes to be negative one forgets what is positive and what is being done.  It is easy to say what should be done.  What I am suggesting in this amendment is that many projects are already in the course of construction, projects that have been promised for years.  That is good for the construction industry.</P>
      <P>This motion refers specifically to the private building sector.  It is debatable whether the private building sector would be the total beneficiaries of all public projects, because all these projects are offered for public tender.  Usually the private sector construction and development industry tender for such projects. The very fact of this Government initiating major capital projects stimulates private sector development.  It gives them an opportunity to tender and produce jobs for people in the construction industry.  I accept that over a period of years, not just two or three years but four to six years, because of the economic decline the amount of building of private houses in the private sector was probably diminished to a very dangerous extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his foresight in ensuring that additional grants were made available to the local authorities to stimulate a movement of people out of local authority houses and into the private sector area where they might purchase ordinary <Col N="69" /> houses, whether secondhand or new houses but preferably new houses.  To encourage local authority dwellers to buy new houses additional grants were given of up to £2,000, plus £5,000 to leave the local authority houses, plus £3,000 in mortgage subsidies for five years.  This must be an indication that this Government are committed to stimulating the building of houses in the private sector.</P>
    <P>More houses have been built by this Minister in the past year than were built since the booming years of the mid-seventies. In one year 7,000 houses were built.  That also gives employment in the construction industry.  The facts will prove that more people are now employed in the construction of local authority houses than has been the case for a long number of years.  In a preelection period it might be difficult to accept those figures but they are there as conclusive evidence that this Government have put a lot of work into the building programme, have provided a lot of houses and have created situations were many of our housing estates are now the pride and joy of many people and not the low cost housing that the party opposite provided and in respect of which this Minister is now giving an 80 per cent subsidy for the purpose of reconstruction. I do not know what the interest involved then was, but somehow or other the Department at that particular time decided to provide low cost housing throughout the country and thereby to clear the housing list.  The result of that policy is that there are now houses which cannot be let to people simply because they cannot be maintained by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister present is left with the job of doing something constructive about those dwellings and has promised local authorities an 80 per cent subsidy to make the houses liveable.  That is a positive gesture towards what is being done in this whole area.  These houses cost as much to build as the traditional houses cost. Central heating was installed in all of them.  This took the form of electricity but the tenants had no control as to how <Col N="70" /> much any individual would be responsible for, with the result that the unemployed and old age pensioners were liable for very large bills which they could not meet.  This Minister has also given grants to ensure that stoves and solid fuel cookers as well as chimneys could be installed in those types of houses.</P>
    <P>I am saying in all seriousness that there has been a specific effort, particularly since this Minister came to office, to ensure that there was a major capital allocation both in housing and in infrastructural development.  The document produced by the Minister &mdash;<i>Policy and Planning Framework for Roads</i>&mdash; is proof conclusive that the amount of money in millions that will be spent on the infrastructure of our main roads system will also be a stimulus to the environmental conditions in our areas and will go towards coaxing industrialists to set up factories throughout the country. With the advent of the national development corporation and with the possibility of equity share of £200 million, employment can be generated by them both in the private and the public sectors. Both will dovetail into ensuring that rural Ireland and the towns and villages can prosper for the first time and that this whole country will not be based within the context of Dublin, where there has been a massive injection of infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>Some of the figures are spectacular.  I am sure the Minister in his speech will itemise some of them.  But the only way one can relate to millions of pounds is to consider the housing or roadwork development in progress in one's area.  One need not be parochial to consider it that way.  In my own little village of Bansha previous administrations in a hundred years produced ten houses.  This administration in a short number of years produced 34 houses.  That is progress in the building and construction industry.  Most of the builders would be supporters of the people opposite.</P>

      <P>These are the facts.  It is a pity that we have this negative motion before the House.  Are the Opposition suggesting that if we had unlimited resources we should pour them into the private sector merely in the interest of creating employment but ensuring that the private sector make the profit?</P>
      <P>We have a major role as a Government first to ensure that the infrastructure of the country is right, that the hospital services and buildings are correct and that unemployed people, poorer people, and people who are at work all have a good standard of housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has effected a major improvement in the quality and standard of the houses built by local authorities. These houses are now the envy of everybody engaged in co-operative housing or in private speculative building or otherwise. The quality, standard and design of the local authorities' houses are a credit to those involved in the design whether they be local authority engineers or architects or departmental architects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Minister and his predecessor by their achievements in office have earned a place in history.  Mr. Jim Tully, as Minister, built more local authority houses than any previous Minister built. He was condemned by a previous Taoiseach of a Fianna Fáil Government for so doing.  The cry at that stage was that he was building too many houses for local authority tenants.  This Minister will even surpass that and he has all our support. As Minister, he has gone quietly about his business and has produced facts and figures that will stand up to any criticism. I have no hesitation in promoting this amendment on behalf of the Government and in assuring our colleagues that we are <Col N="72" /> not unmindful of the fact that there are a lot of people still unemployed.  We want to make sure that they are employed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour have brought in a scheme which will be implemented by local authorities and which will give the impetus to people who are now unemployed to do productive work in the community within the local authority areas.  That piece of legislation was also decried by the Opposition.  I did remind them that they should give it an opportunity to get off the ground.  In the number of weeks since the scheme was launched by the Minister for Labour, 20,000 people have applied to come off the unemployment list and go into the workplace again, even if only for two and a half days in the week.  At least they are doing something productive and all communities are being stimulated to employ people to do something useful. The youth employment money has been generated through AnCO and other agencies like that.  The labour and materials for projects are supplied within communities and I have no doubt that with a continuation of this policy, this Government will be able to stand on their record as being second to none, particularly in the area of the construction industry.</P>

There is none so blind as he who does not wish to see.  Even the Minister, whom I welcome here this evening, was rather restless in his chair when Senator Ferris roamed carelessly over the areas where he with undoubted blinkered vision sought to disprove what Senator O'Toole had said by using statistics which, as I will try to illustrate in a minute, do not stand up.  In the earlier part of his contribution Senator Ferris suggested that the expenditure in the health services was so fantastic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not represent his region but in the one I do represent a new maternity unit has been built for the past couple of years.  This is in Cahercalla and it is supposed to serve the people of Clare.  This hospital is ready for occupation but we have not been able to get sufficient funds to enable us to open it and thereby ensure that the women of Clare, who now must travel 60 or 70 miles to Limerick city to be delivered of their babies, would be accommodated in their own county.</P>

      <P>We are closing wards in the hospitals that we built over the years. Unless a woman is pregnant, she cannot have her teeth extracted under the medical services though the gynaecologists tell us it is not wise for women to have dental treatment when they are pregnant.</P>
      <P>In the past four years 25,000 people who were employed in the building industry prior to 1981 are now on the dole.  It is an established fact in practically every area of that industry, whether in cement sales, private housing output, general employment or any other, that the building industry is in dire trouble. When we are proposing additional incentives here to revamp and to try to instil a bit more confidence into the economy generally and since this industry depends so largely on indigenous materials, we are not acting merely on a political basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that all of us here this evening who are interested in trying to see that this country improves and that more jobs are provided would try to face up to the problem fairly and instead of choosing statistics which favour one side or another of the argument act in a more positive way.  At the moment we are spending between £6 million and £7 million per day on social welfare.  That is more than £2,300 million in a year and does not take into account that most of the beneficiaries of these services also <Col N="74" /> qualify for medical cards.  In many cases, too, they are on lower differential rents in their local authority houses.  There is also the cost of security as we try to control the drift into criminality.  That phenomenon has resulted from having so little to do, nothing to look forward to during the day, nothing to work at.  For those people who have lost their jobs in the past two years in the building industry we must find ways other than the dole queue.  It is not that we want additional taxation, or additional borrowing, though borrowing for good capital development can always be justified.  One has only to consider the Naas carriageway as an example of what progress can be made and how one can justify in the long term borrowing for essential infrastructural developments of that kind.  To pay 10,000 married people the average social welfare unemployment benefit or assistance per week costs a cool £1 million.  For a full year the cost is £52 million.</P>
    <P>That money has to be produced by the taxpayer, and we need to be able to channel it into productive infrastructural development to the maximum possible extent.  I know that steps have been taken by way of the social employment scheme which I welcome.  Many good developments will flow from all of that, but we must extend that right into the fabric of the construction industry and use up the talent that is undoubtedly there but which is lying dormant.  I accept that one cannot create jobs by the stroke of a pen.  We are in a mixed economy.  We must have the right kind of balance.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not good enough for Senator Ferris in his support for the Government motion to refer as the base for the growth in the building industry, to the document <i>Building on Reality.  Building on Reality</i> can now be called building on quicksand. The unemployment estimate in that plan for this year is 17,000 less than the actual figure.  Tax revenue estimated in that plan is millions of pounds less than what it is supposed to be.  Investment on every front is practically down and growth in the economy generally is confined to a few major areas.  There is no point in the Government coming here this evening <Col N="75" /> and basing everything they say on a plan, however well written and presented the document concerned may be.  That plan includes clauses which may well mean that we will have a mini-budget later in the year to correct the imbalances in the finances which are already developing in the economy.  I therefore put it to the Minister that he will have to find answers additional to those provided for in that plan.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words in relation to our road network.  Senator Ferris spoke proudly of the developments taking place on the roads in his county.  He is either living in wonderland or the amounts of money being provided by the Minister for the Environment are notoriously out of line in all other areas with the exception of south Tipperary.  I thank Senator Ferris if he has been able to extract from the Minister funds to do the kind of job in County Tipperary that is not being done anywhere else in the country. Regarding the Estimates this year the county engineers have spelled out that the resurfacing programmes for our county roads are now spanning out a grand 36 year stage.  We are told by the experts that in regard to the development of our road foundations, maintenance and so on, the ideal span is between seven and ten years for resurfacing but the average around the country is something like 36 years.  If one lives to be 72 one will see the roads tarred once or twice and if one is extremely lucky to live to be 100 one might see the roads tarred three times in one's lifetime.  These are the facts.  They are based on the words of independent people.</P>
    <P>We spend about 25 per cent of total tax revenue, car tax and so on, on the roads.  In America the figure is 96 per cent.  In Japan it is 143 per cent.  In Europe generally it is almost 60 per cent. In a few years from now we will have to spend millions of pounds restructuring, putting back foundations on roads which we have neglected very seriously.</P>
    <P>Twenty per cent of the people who drive cars do not have their cars taxed, while those who tax their cars are being <Col N="76" /> loaded to the hilt.  Accidents are being caused by these bad roads.  Business and commerce is being slowed up.  Additional costs in transport that are making us less competitive here at home and abroad are all additional barriers to the development and growth of this economy.</P>
    <P>Let us talk about health in this area.  I do not know the percentage but I remember reading sometime in the last couple of years that 20 or 30 per cent of health revenue is spent on hospitals catering for cases arising from accidents on our roads. I am not saying that every accident on the road is caused by a bad road, but it is fair to say that a considerable portion of them are caused by bad roads.  If one considers the congestion in our towns and cities, the loss of time, the use of energy and so on, one realises that we must find a way to transfer resources from other areas into this very much needed development. I would ask the Minister to refer specifically to this.  Many of us are members of county councils.  I am not being political about this, but there are real problems when a county engineer says that a road will be resurfaced but not for a further 36 years.  There are milk lorries, school buses and so on to be considered plus such matters as axle weight to meet EC requirements.  We must find resources to deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>South Tipperary is a unique place.  It has a long historical cultural background. Senator Ferris, obviously in that wall of security, living aloof from the main problems that I have referred to, can find answers which are not to be found anywhere else.  When most county councils must lose a road workman per month we realise how we are managing our system. These are not statements which are open to question.  I am sure the Minister is all too well aware of how the road working staffs in local authorities throughout the country have been diminished in recent years.  He may say that there is an improvement in the main arterial network. But so far as the county road system is concerned, it is clear that the situation is extremely serious.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the VAT <Col N="77" /> increase of 5 per cent on building.  Perhaps the Minister is having second thoughts on this matter.  We would like to argue that so far as that industry is concerned it is not able to sustain that weight.  The increase will further exascerbate an already difficult situation.  It will drive more of that industry into the black economy.  It will make building more difficult for local authorities, more costly for individuals and will do nothing for the overall employment situation.</P>
    <P>The time is right for the Government to change their minds on this increase. All the evidence available to the Minister would indicate that that should be done. I would not consider it a weakness on the Minister's part to change his attitude in relation to that matter.  In terms of overall employment, I ask the Minister to accept the motion that is being put forward here as being a genuine one, one that is aimed at using the vast resources that are in our economy and transferring them into this vital building area.</P>

      <P>On Monday last I had the great pleasure of being in Mayo, Senator O'Toole's constituency, and there we had the very pleasant task of opening a new water scheme for Achill Island to provide that island with 600,000 gallons of water per day.  A great tribute should be paid to the councillors and the officials in Achill for their foresight, but let it be remembered that we had to provide the money from the Department of the Environment.  He did not mention that during his speech.  I was a bit disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Smith has just gone.  I want to make a couple of comments on what he said before I begin my speech.  He mentioned tarred roads and county roads.  He is quite right in saying our roads programme is to benefit national primary and national secondary roads.  He never mentioned block grants which could be spent on country roads.  He came up with an extraordinary figure of tarring roads every 30 years because this Government are in power.  Fianna Fáil were in power <Col N="78" /> from 1977 to 1981.  Therefore, if the tarring process, which is necessary only once every ten years, was done in 1977 the roads should be OK up to next year.  Any road that was tarred in 1981 should not need to be done until 1991 according to what he said.  He also mentioned accident figures because of these roads.  I am glad to say that the accident figures for last year are considerably down.  A great deal of credit is due to various organisations, the gardaí, the National Road Safety Council and others and indeed the good sense of many people who are on our roads too.  They are down for both deaths and injuries, considerably down.  We will always have accidents, unfortunately, but it will be our job in the Department of the Environment to try to continue that trend.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment with responsibility for the building and construction industry I am pleased to have the opportunity presented by the debate on this motion tonight to speak on a number of important issues related to the policy of Government for the industry.  It is important to set the record straight on the present state of the industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, no, but I am sure we can get a copy for the Senator.</P>
      <P>It is important to set the record straight on the present state of the industry, on the fundamental cause of the problems affecting the industry, on the Government's response to these problems and to explain why the simplistic solutions to these problems being advocated in some quarters are completely inappropriate and would only damage the industry in the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that recent years have been very difficult ones for the <Col N="79" /> building and construction industry.  While a downward adjustment was inevitable in the aftermath of the disastrous debt financed inflation boom of the late seventies and the early eighties few commentators expected that the industry would have to pay such a high price in terms of falling output and high unemployment for the mismanagement of the industry in those years.  The fundamental cause of the problems affecting the industry has been the dramatic and continuing decline in private investment, which fell by 50 per cent in the period 1981 to 1984.</P>
    <P>The fall in private investment has been particularly acute in the areas of industrial and commercial development and to a lesser extent in the area of private housing apart from the first time buyer market.  While a certain amount of commercial and industrial development continues to take place the harsh reality is that the surplus of office accommodation, retail units and factory space is discouraging new investment.  This underlines once again the irresponsible nature of the policies adopted by the previous Government in the late 1970's and early 1980's which created massive surpluses in particular sectors of the industry.  It also underlines the difficult nature of the fundamental problems affecting the industry and the need for a planned and well thought out response on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>This Government are determined to tackle the problems affecting the industry, to reverse the decline in output and employment and to ensure a resumption of orderly and sustainable growth. Our strategy to achieve this desired outcome covers three broad areas.  First, we aim to create the general economic conditions and a favourable climate for business and enterprise that will lead to increased private sector demand for the output of the industry and therefore increased private sector investment. Second, public expenditure affecting the industry has been raised to the highest sustainable level and has been concentrated on those areas that will yield the highest return in terms of building output and employment.  Finally, a range of <Col N="80" /> special measures has been introduced designed to boost the construction industry as a whole and the private housing sector in particular.</P>
    <P>The national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> sets out an integrated programme of action for the main areas of Government activity, including the building and construction industry, which will enable considerable progress to be made over the period to 1987 in achieving increased output and employment, in stabilising the burden of taxation and in restoring order to the public finances.  Indeed I would suggest that we are already seeing this to some extent.  Recent reports and statistics show a much improved economic situation, thus indicating that the Government's economic strategy is the correct one in all the circumstances and is now beginning to show success.  The plan will enable the private sector, for the first time in many years, to plan with confidence in the knowledge that a coherent set of Government policies are in place to tackle the fundamental problems of the economy.  It will create a climate of confidence about the future development of the economy that will encourage private investment in general, including investment in construction.</P>
    <P>The plan also sets out projected public capital programme investment in the building industry over the years 1985 to 1987 which is set to rise from £1,166 million in 1984 to £1,300 million in 1987, an increase of 11½ per cent approximately. These figures speak for themselves. It is huge investment by any standards and certainly by the standards of the total PCP expenditure for each of the years of the plan.  Indeed, PCP investment in the building industry shows an increasing proportion of total PCP over the years of the plan.</P>
    <P>It is in this context of encouraging enterprise and efficiency that the recent far reaching reforms of the VAT system must be judged, and not as an isolated measure.  The need for a major overhaul of the complex, inefficient and expensive VAT system has been obvious to many for a long time.  The new rate structure has simplified the system considerably <Col N="81" /> and will in time result in increased economic and administrative efficiency and reduce evasion.  The reforms have been widely welcomed because they will give a major stimulus to output and employment across a wide range of sectors.  The changes were good for the economy and for enterprise and they will lead in time to increased private investment, which will be good for the construction industry.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the industry has to cope with the new VAT situation, and it is important to set the record straight on the effects this will have on the industry in view of the irresponsible claims that have been made by certain commentators and interests.</P>
    <P>Firstly, a considerable part of total building output will not be affected at all by the change.  I refer to output of direct labour units of local authorities and Government Departments, which will not be affected.  Similarly the output of private individuals building their own houses will not be affected.  Demand for building in the agricultural sector, in the industrial and semi-State sector, and in the commercial sector is unlikely to be affected, because most enterprises in these sectors can reclaim any VAT they pay including VAT on buildings.  The area of the building industry that will be most affected is publicly funded construction work carried out by private contractors. As regards publicly funded construction work I am confident that the increase in the level of PCP expenditure affecting the industry over the three year period 1985 to 1987 set out in the Government's National Economic Plan largely compensates for any adverse effects of the VAT increase.  This is particularly the case as regards the programmes of my own Department &mdash; roads, sanitary services and local authority housing. The overall effects of the VAT changes will not be significant in comparison with the additional investment that has taken place in recent years or the expansion due over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>As far as building output is concerned, any adverse effects of the VAT increase are likely to be largely confined to the <Col N="82" /> private housing sector of the industry.  To overcome any difficulties that may occur the Government have announced a 100 per cent increase in the grant for first-time buyers of new houses from £1,000 to £2,000.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increased grant for first-time buyers of new houses the reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 35 per cent to 23 per cent will also help to alleviate any increase in the overall price of a house.  The cost of a wide range of household goods, many of which are necessary for the purpose of providing modern facilities in the house &mdash; I refer to such items as washing machines, fridges, dishwashers, televisions etc. &mdash; has been reduced appreciably.</P>
    <P>My determination to tackle the problems of the construction industry generally has been given practical expression in my commitment to the construction programmes and schemes administered by my Department particularly in the major programmes involving roads, sanitary services and housing.</P>
    <P>One particular area of my Department's programme &mdash; I refer to the roads programme &mdash; is an excellent example of detailed planning on a sectoral basis.  This Government are acutely conscious of the need to view roads construction as a priority in infrastructural development. The road development plan for the eighties has been subjected to detailed examination, its shortcomings identified, and it has been replaced by a new road plan, Policy and Planning Framework for Roads, launched by me in January last.</P>
    <P>Significant increases in the provisions for roads improvement and new road construction have been made in the plan. In 1985 the provision will be £125 million or an increase of 20 per cent on the allocation for 1984, and it is planned to allocate £140 million for improvements in 1986 and £155 million in 1987.  The allocation in 1987 will, in fact, exceed the 1984 allocation by 53 per cent.  This level of financial commitment will ensure that work can start immediately on the various schemes and projects detailed in the new road plan Policy and Planning Framework for Roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Housing output constitutes a considerable proportion of the value of total construction output.  It is now nearly 50 per cent.  This fact has been uppermost in determining housing policies over the past two years and in designing policies to complement the particular strategy adopted in the national plan.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme has been remarkably successful over the last two years.  In 1984 a total of 7,000 houses were completed, a record level of completions for any year since 1976.  Again, the employment implications have been very positive, with an average monthly employment on the programme of 6,800 approximately, or 400 greater than the corresponding figure in 1983.  The success of the programme in the recent past has been due to the high level of capital investment by the State, coupled with the operation of carefully designed cost control procedures.</P>
    <P>Housing demands are extremely varied, and housing policy and schemes have been organised accordingly.  A number of policies have been introduced which will facilitate those who wish to purchase their own houses.  Local authority tenants of three years standing and tenant purchasers may avail of the new special grant of £5,000 to enable them to purchase private houses.  Arrangements to extend joint venture housing are well in hand, and a special site subsidy has been introduced for those on approved local authority waiting lists, or those tenants not eligible for the £5,000 grant who wish to purchase joint venture housing. In addition to these incentives purchasers will also benefit from the increased new house grant and mortgage subsidy scheme as appropriate.</P>
    <P>An arrangement whereby local authorities can purchase private houses for renting will provide a considerable boost to the private builder while creating a more durable social mix.  I would like to see this procedure adopted where possible.</P>
    <P>As promised in the national economic plan, the 1985 Finance Bill extends the scope of the tax incentives designed to <Col N="84" /> encourage the provision of private rented accommodation.  At the moment these incentives are confined to cases where either a new house is provided for renting or where a building is converted into two or more dwellings for renting.  The provisions of the Finance Bill extend the income tax relief to cases where buildings already in multiple use are refurbished to provide multiple residential accommodation of a better standard.  &ldquo;Refurbished&rdquo; in this context allows a much wider range of work to qualify for tax relief than was allowable under the earlier schemes.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I want to refer to the future prospects for the industry.  I refer in particular to the report of the Sectoral Development Committee which is representative of trade unions, employers and the State and which has been engaged in charting a course for the development on a sector by sector basis.  That committee have recently issued a very worthwhile report and recommendations on the building industry which was based on a very thorough evaluation carried out by a consultative committee on which the various interest groups associated with the industry were represented.  The recommendations cover such areas as reducing output volatility, encouraging growth, promoting private sector investment and increasing efficiency and value for money.  The establishment of a development council is also recommended in the report to provide a forum where representatives of the State, employers, trade unions and the professions can assess the performance of the industry and develop measures to improve effectiveness and efficiency.  My officials have met most of the interests proposed to be represented in the council in order to discuss the proposal in detail including the operation, financing and terms of reference of the council.  A final decision will be taken in the light of these discussions. In the meantime a number of committees' recommendations are already in course of implementation and are being incorporated in Government policies in relation to the industry.  Work on implementing other recommendations of the committee is in hands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> In the past the industry has developed in a piecemeal unplanned way with an inordinate amount of volatility in its output.  While accepting that there must be an element of volatility in any industry, it has to be accepted also that undue volatility increases problems.  If I might give an example of what I am talking about &mdash; in the late seventies and early eighties, the so called halcyon days for the industry, the price of houses rose by 88 per cent in the three year period between 1978 and 1980.  Commentators were even talking of the £100,000 semidetached house.  I think it is fair to say that we do not want to return to this kind of situation where the demand for housing was very strong, which of itself is good thing, but the price of houses was very quickly outstripping the ability of potential purchasers to afford them.</P>
    <P>Let me clearly state, therefore, that the Government are determined to see the decline in the industry reversed and growth resumed as quickly as possible. The aim must be to eliminate undue volatility in output and put the industry on a sound footing, more closely related to the general level of activity in the economy as a whole.  It is no use talking about pouring more public money into the industry; even if it was there it still would not be the right solution.  However, it is not there, and that makes such a suggestion all the more ridiculous.  We must look for stability and steady and sustained growth of a kind which is based on policies which are bedded in reality.  This is the Government's aim and this is what we propose to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in favour of the motion proposed by Senators Michael Lynch and Martin O'Toole:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to take special measures to arrest the decline in output and employment in the building and construction industry and to deal in particular with the special difficulties in the private house building sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very important motion, and I am sure everybody is aware that the industry <Col N="86" /> is suffering.  The construction industry suffered a severe body blow from the Coalition Government in the past two years or more, but a measure proposed in the recent budget will have disastrous effects for what remains of the industry, that is the increase in VAT on building materials from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to understand why the Government are hell-bent on driving people out of the building industry.  Tax incentives which attracted private investment have been dismantled; public capital investment has been reduced by one-quarter, while increased planning charges, development levies, VAT rates and PRSI contributions have been piled onto the industry, adding to costs and reducing output.  Employment in the construction industry in 1980 was at the level of 108,000 but because of the policies adopted, particularly in the past two years, this figure has been reduced to 80,000, with 100 being added to the list of unemployed every week.  This is a vast decrease in employment in the building industry which has developed over the past two years.</P>
    <P>There was great euphoria in the Fine Gael and Labour parties when the Minister for Finance announced an increase of £750 in the new house grant.  This was subsequently increased to £1,000.  There was complete silence from the same people when the Minister allowed an increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on the VAT rate on building materials. As a result of this increase, a house which cost £30,000 would now cost £31,500.  The increase in the grant for the first time buyers does not offset the increase in the VAT rate.  While it is welcome it will go nowhere near making up the cost of a house as a result of the increased VAT even in the case of houses in the lower price range because contractors almost exclusively pay VAT on a cash receipt basis.</P>
    <P>Housing is a basic human requirement. The State has a moral responsibility to the homeless.  We should have an enlightened housing policy which would encourage people to purchase houses for themselves while we provide houses for <Col N="87" /> the less well off.  The policy pursued by the Government will put housing outside the reach of the average family.  The Government should remember that we have the youngest population in Europe; more than half our population are under 25 years of age, although legislation was initiated by the Government recently and passed successfully by both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that we will have an ageing society.  We still have a very young population so in the next ten years there will be an increase in the demand for housing.</P>
    <P>In my own area there are several young people living in caravans because the local authorities cannot provide adequate housing.  I do not think there was one local authority house built in my own parish, which is a rural one, for the last 30 years.  I have a path worn to the county council offices to impress upon them that there is a demand for housing.  There are people living in caravans and living in with their parents, which is causing problems in homes.  These people are in dire straits for housing.  The council told me they looked for land and could not get it. Now there is land available and offered to them at a price.  The county council are very slow in paying the price.  The difference would be about £250 per house.  This should not deter the council from buying this land.  It would not meet the problem.  The county council officials inform me that the Department of the Environment stopped them, that they cannot provide them with the money. This is the situation that we are in today in relation to providing housing and employment.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 the annual private house completions have decreased from 23,000 to 18,000.  The industry was expecting a stimulus through a reduction in VAT in the budget; it got a surprise when VAT was, in fact, increased.  A number of big building concerns have abandoned operations here and moved to the United Kingdom.  Cement Roadstone are looking for growth outside the Irish economy because they know there is no future here.  The construction of farm buildings <Col N="88" /> is at a complete standstill.  I have met several people involved in this field and they are going to the wall also.  People who supply gravel and who are depending on it for a living have told me that since the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme farm buildings are not going ahead any more.  This is a loss to the development of agriculture and to those who earn a living from farm buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister, referring to Senator Michael Smith's contribution, said that block grants could benefit county or country roads.  These block grants must be minimal as the roads were never worse than they are now.  I would like to see evidence of these block grants in the form of better roads.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from <i>Building on Reality</i>, page 110, 5.72 under the heading, &ldquo;Housing&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The central objective of housing policy is to ensure that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every household can obtain a house of good standard, located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent they can afford.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 5.73 it states:</P>
    <P>The recession has inevitably weakened the effective demand for private houses in recent years.  An increase in the number of new houses provided by local authorities has partially offset a fall in private housing output.</P>
    <P>Further on, at 5.85 (b) it states:</P>
    <P>ease the demand for local authority housing by retaining the present range of incentives to private housing (which cater particularly for people on local authority waiting lists)...</P>
    <P>I see a contradiction here.  I cannot see how this can be done with the increase in VAT and the difficulties with which the industry is confronted, especially in trying to provide private housing.</P>
    <P>The road development plan for the eighties was mentioned.  It states in the programme <i>Building on Reality</i> at paragraph 3.25:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> While capital investments in road improvement works has increased substantially in real terms since 1979, it has fallen short of the objectives set out in the plan by about 21 per cent. In addition, expenditure by local authorities on road improvements and maintenance financed from their own resources decreased in real terms by 13 per cent on average between 1979 and 1983.</P>
    <P>I have a copy of the road development plan for the eighties, and in my own city of Limerick, under which the Ennis ring road was supposed to be completed in the early eighties, that road is still under construction.  This proves the inadequacy of the present Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment, and indeed I welcome the presence of the Minister of State for this debate.  Senator Catherine McGuinness has indicated that she has a particular interest in the subject, and I propose to stop my own contribution in time to enable her to participate in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two major criticisms of the decision by the Minister last week to close even temporarily and in practice seriously curtail the educational facilities at Arbour Hill and Cork prisons.  The first is the decision itself, which runs contrary to the fundamental principle that the penal system should as a primary objective ensure the provision of full rehabilitative services designed to meet the <Col N="90" /> needs of individuals in the prisons.  In other words, imprisonment should offer the individual the opportunity for rehabilitation and should respect the fundamental rights of the individual.  The second major criticism is the manner in which the decision was taken.  It was done arbitrarily, suddenly and without consultation. As a result, years of dedicated commitment by teachers and indeed months of effort and commitment by individual prisoners themselves were simply brought to a full stop.  The inevitable effect has been to undermine the values involved and to denigrate and lower the respect for and the self-esteem of participants in the courses and indeed to undermine the work and the professionalism of the teachers involved.</P>
    <P>I propose, in a few moments, to trace the sequence of events which took place last week to illustrate how arbitrary and unreasonable the decision was.  Personally, I cannot believe that the Minister could have been adequately and fully advised, and I would implore him, and implore him through the Minister of State who is here this evening, to take immediate steps to minimise the damage which has undoubtedly been done and to restore as quickly and as fully as possible the educational facilities and the services in both prisons.  The Minister is a teacher himself and does not need to be preached at or told about the values of education. It appears to be a decision taken without adequate thought, reflection, consultation and preparation, but it has been a decision which has already caused considerable damage and which must at this stage be remedied and ameliorated as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it very clear that no one denies that there is a very serious problem of over-crowding in our prisons. This is a problem which has been worsening over the years and particularly over the months.  It has been the subject of a good deal of public debate and it is not something that has sprung up overnight; it is not new.  It has been an increasing and a serious problem that has been gradually coming upon us for a variety of reasons. You cannot solve it at the expense of an <Col N="91" /> essential service for the rehabilitation of prisoners without being completely counter-productive. If we withdraw all educational facilities or reduce them to an unacceptable minimum, while cramming more and more young offenders into our jails, then we will reap a bitter harvest and we will reap it within a very short time.  Therefore I want to use the time which this debate allows to trace briefly, first of all, the background to the provision of educational facilities in our prisons and then to turn to the sequence of events last week which I have described as being unacceptable in the manner in which the decision was taken as well as the substance of the decision.</P>
    <P>Looking at the general background, I am going to concentrate on the two prisons, on Arbour Hill and on Cork. Arbour Hill, of course, is a long-term prison and in many ways perhaps is even more a place where we should be concerned about the capacity to offer educational services and rehabilitation.  It was opened in 1975 and at the time it was designed to accommodate 101 prisoners. However, because of the pressure on prison accommodation that number has increased.  I am informed that at the beginning of last week there were 130 prisoners in Arbour Hill and that it is anticipated that the figure could shortly rise to about 180.  This has meant that there is necessarily further crowding in cells and some larger cells are being used to house three prisoners.  This overcrowding inevitably increases tension and anger and confrontation within the prison.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised by prison governors and by prison officers that the provision of educational facilities makes a very valuable contribution in defusing tension, in providing an opportunity for rehabilitation, in providing an alternative source of interest and involvement by prisoners.  Even at that level we are doing two things which are likely to build up the tension &mdash; withdrawing opportunities for educational facilities and increasing the numbers who are being crammed into the prison.</P>
    <P>The background to the provision of <Col N="92" /> education is one of great effort and commitment against a lot of difficulties.  It has never been easy to provide teaching facilities in our prisons.  It has never been a case where all the doors were open and it was easy to do.  The vocational education committees have been involved with the organisation of the educational services in prisons since 1972.  In Dublin, the VEC was involved first of all in St. Patrick's and then in Mountjoy, and when Arbour Hill was opened in 1975 these educational facilities were first provided there for approximately 60 prisoners by three teachers.</P>
    <P>Initially, they were provided in a recreation hall, and the hall was divided into different sections used for pottery, art, English and physical education.  In 1976 mathematics was included in the subjects provided, and indeed in that year five students took maths and six took English in the group certificate examinations. Since then students have taken examinations at leaving certificate level.  During the mid-seventies securing educational facilities in Arbour Hill was not an easy task.  It was a constant effort on the part of the prison authorities themselves and the teachers who were providing the service. In 1976 and 1977 the recreation hall was used and partitioned into four sections.  In 1977, 1978 and 1979 there was a four-roomed prefab in the east yard. In 1979-1980 and 1982-83, for that period of four years, a facility known locally as &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; was used.  This is a four-roomed prefab placed in a barbed wire isolation cage and therefore, I suppose, aptly and accurately called &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; by everybody involved.</P>
    <P>During that period it was promised, and indeed that promise was fulfilled in April 1984, that a custom-built educational unit would be provided, because it was recognised by the Department of Education, by the prison officials, by the VEC and by the teachers involved with the prisoners themselves, that &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; was not an adequate location for the provision of teaching facilities for a number of different reasons which I think do not have to be further spelt out.  The education unit, therefore, was brought on <Col N="93" /> stream just over a year ago.  It is that unit which has now been suddenly arbitrarily and immediately closed last week by a decision of the Minister, and whatever temporary facilities may be provided in the meantime will be of an inadequate nature.</P>
    <P>There was talk about going back to &ldquo;The Cage&rdquo; etc, but it is that unit which was for so long aspired to and waited for that has been suddenly removed from the teachers and the prisoners involved.  The particular tragedy of it in a way, the heartache of it, was that the teachers themselves were very much involved with the planning of the unit.  It is a very fine point, I gather.  It is one that they are very proud of and it reflects their approach to the curriculum, as to how they see the provision of the educational facility and the facilities in it are such as we could be very proud of.</P>
    <P>The facilities that were provided in this unit comprised the following units: four large rooms which were used for woodwork, pottery and art, drama and music and home economics, quite a wide and representative range of subjects.  As well as that, in this unit were three general subject rooms, a staff room, two offices for private consultation for use with individual prisoners who were taking the courses and for career advice etc, and also &mdash; I think this is a practical aspect of it &mdash; two toilets, including a toilet for females because in fact a number of the teachers involved are female.</P>
    <P>The number of teachers increased when the educational facilities were there.  In 1975 there were only three teachers, as I said: in April 1985 the number had gone up to 15 teachers. There were eight wholetime teachers, including a guidance teacher, seven part-time teachers, of whom two were doing full-time hours, and I think this was an important aspect.  It allowed a very exciting and full curriculum development on the basis of this custom-built unit in which the teachers themselves had a very large part.  That is what, if you like, has been swept away by the decision.  The increased capacity for the teaching and involvement of teachers is reflected in the <Col N="94" /> involvement of the students, because up to the middle of last week, 70 per cent of the students were taking courses &mdash; five were taking group certificate examinations, five were taking leaving certificate, 12 were taking basic literacy courses and seven were taking open university courses.  Now, all of that has been suddenly stopped.  Last week they were doing courses leading to examinations: this week they are doing nothing.  Yet these are vulnerable citizens who are deprived of their liberty by the State, who are imprisoned in our prisons and this is how we are dealing with them.  That is the position in Arbour Hill.</P>
    <P>The position in Cork is similar in this respect, that in Cork also there was a custom-built education unit and therefore a facility which had been thoughtfully provided in order to enable this education facility to be supplied.  There were eight rooms involved and eight teachers.  I understand that the teachers have not been deprived completely of access to this unit.  They have been confined to three rooms.  I understand there was a meeting of some representatives of the teachers and the Minister for Justice this afternoon and an issue arose about another section of Cork prison which at the moment is not being used but which had been intended for use as a workshop area.  The teachers in Cork have raised the point that this area could have been taken over for necessary accommodation since it was not actually in use. The Minister seems to have been under the impression that the teachers had been offered that area.  My information from the teachers and from their union is that this was not the case, that they had not been offered it, that they were given access to three rooms which would greatly reduce their teaching capacity and that there was a possibility of four other smaller rooms in a different section of the prison becoming available in a corridor.  In any case, there was a very substantial reduction in the capacity.</P>
    <P>Now how did this happen?  I think it is worth looking at how these decisions were arrived at.  As I understand it, the governor of Arbour Hill was informed at <Col N="95" /> a meeting on Wednesday, 24 April, that it was intended to close the educational unit in Arbour Hill.  He informed the teachers at 2 p.m. on the Thursday that this would happen and therefore they would not be teaching on the Friday. There was no consultation, no prior discussion, no warning, no lee time offered.  They were presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I will finish with a very brief synopsis of what happened because I think it is relevant.  On Friday 26 April the teachers in Arbour Hill planned to hold a staff meeting there. They could not even do that because prisoners had been assigned to clear out the rooms.  It was as sudden and brutal as that.  Subsequently they contacted their union and on the advice of their union presented themselves at the resource centre office accommodation in Mountjoy.  That is as far as they have been able to go at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the questions to which I hope the Minister will be able to give some answers are first, when is it intended to restore these two custom-built education units for education in the two prisons. Secondly, in the meantime while we are waiting for that to happen, what accommodation, what resources are going to be available?  They are not even talking about the same prison accommodation. The additional prisoners who have been moved to these two prisons are entitled to access to educational facilities, and it is extremely important that the Minister in replying puts on the record of the House the fullest information to reassure and indeed to restore morale and to restore some of the confidence and indeed to match the dedication and professionalism of the teachers involved.  I will stop at this point to enable Senator McGuinness also to contribute.  It is hard, <Col N="96" /> when one feels so strongly about something, to be brief, but I would hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to respond fully to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Robinson first for her courtesy in allowing me to add my words to hers on this matter because I feel particularly strongly about it.  I do not want to repeat what she has said.  I have very little time, but I would simply say that I had personal experience of going around all the prisons and places of detention in this country during the period of March to May 1982 in preparation of a report and study of them which has just recently been published under the title &ldquo;Punishment and Imprisonment&rdquo;.  In particular, the group with which I was associated was extremely impressed by the efforts of the teachers in the prisons and the development of prison education.  When we went to Arbour Hill we were shown precisely the developments that were going to take place, the building of this special educational unit and we were shown with pride by the governor of Arbour Hill and by the officials of the Department of Justice just what was being done in Arbour Hill and the hope that was being offered in particular to long term prisoners there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very important has been the way in which prison education has been specially developed to suit the needs of prisoners as opposed to the ordinary people who are going through the educational system.  I think we must accept that a very large number of prisoners come into prison with a low level of educational attainment and many of them are virtually or completely illiterate.  If we expect these people to go back into the community on release and try to live a normal life, go straight, try to get jobs and so on, the one thing that we must offer them to enable them to do that is education to qualify them for some sort of work.  Here we have a position of people who are in a somewhat despair-creating atmosphere of serving a long term of imprisonment, who have made the effort and who are doing all they can to work for the group <Col N="97" /> certificate and the leaving certificate and so on and suddenly, just before the season of the annual public examinations they are told that their education facilities are to be taken away at a moment's notice.</P>
    <P>This is a totally wrong way of dealing with the present situation.  I know that we all come under pressure from constituents and others &mdash; I just have about two more sentences, a Chathaoirleach &mdash; to deal with the present criminal situation by saying: &ldquo;throw them all in jail and throw away the key&rdquo;.  I understand how people feel.  I, too, have had my handbag snatched, my house burgled, my car stolen and so on.  But that does not mean that this is the way to solve the problem. I would beg the Minister to give answers to the questions that Senator Robinson has asked and to restore the educational facilities in the prisons because we are not going to solve the problem of criminality and above all the problem of young criminals by taking away the one hope in the prison system, which is the provision of proper education.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible blow to the system to find that these teachers who have put so much into the situation and who have developed prison education in a way that needed a great deal of initiative and devotion should be told at a moment's notice that their services in this area are no longer required and that the specially-made educational facilities that they had worked for for so long were to be shut down.  I would ask that this decision should not only be explained but be reversed.</P>

      <P>In replying to this debate I would like to say that the position in regard to the need to utilise the education units at Cork and Arbour Hill prisons as accommodation for prisoners was fully explained by the Minister during the course of his public statement of last Thursday.  The need to increase prison accommodation is illustrated by the fact that on Thursday last the prison population stood at 1,799.  Today it has increased to 1,832.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> The decision to use the educational units to accommodate prisoners was not one taken lightly.  The decision was taken after a full review by the Minister of the options open to him and in response to a situation which arose from circumstances over which he had no control.  The units to which we are referring were opened only last year, teaching services having been provided until then in temporary accommodation.  It certainly gave no joy to anyone involved in the administration of the prison system to have to take this decision.  But the only alternative would have been to order the release of prisoners so as to make room for those being sentenced by the courts on a particular day.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement last Thursday the Minister indicated that efforts would be made to relocate teaching services in temporary accommodation. I am happy to be able to inform the House that consultations have taken place with the vocational education committees in Dublin and Cork aimed at identifying areas which can be adapted to enable teaching to go ahead.  Earlier this afternoon, as Senator Robinson said, the Minister met representatives of the City of Dublin VEC and representatives of the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  Certain proposals in relation to the provision of alternative accommodation were discussed with both parties.  I understand that these proposals are to be discussed at a meeting tomorrow between the VEC and the teachers.  Consequently, I do not propose to disclose the proposals at this stage.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said publicly by some people, it is not intended that teaching services should cease or even be reduced at either location or at any other prison facility for that matter.  However, there is an important matter of priority here, and there must be a recognition that the primary concern of the prison system is to contain those sentenced by the courts.  The education units will be returned as soon as suitable prison accommodation becomes available.  It is not possible to give a date because it is not possible to foresee how these trends <Col N="99" /> will develop.  However, as soon as such accommodation becomes available the units will be returned to use as educational accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is also a factor to note that the gardaí are meeting with success in their efforts to combat car thefts in particular, the rate of car thefts in Dublin having been reduced by 50 per cent over the last few months and crime generally having been reduced last year for the first time in very many years.  On the points made about the use of alternative sanctions, community service orders which were introduced last December have been imposed in 104 cases.  In addition social inquiry reports have been requested by the courts in a further 100 cases.  There is little doubt that but for community services those 104 offenders would have been sentenced to imprisonment.  Also, the financial resources available for hostels etc. have been increased by 133 per cent since this Government took office and expenditure this year will total £1.285 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the comments made to the effect that the taking over of the education units represents evidence of a lack of commitment by this Government to education for prisoners, the facts are that there are now more teachers working in the prisons than when we took office. Educational services now available include third level courses, and teachers are now working in Limerick and Portlaois prisons, which had never previously been the case.</P>
    <P>I can only conclude by saying that if <Col N="100" /> the gardaí are to continue to have the success which they are currently having in dealing with criminals, additional space must be provided in the prisons and that it is inevitable that some reduction in services to prisoners will occur.  Hopefully, those who have taken part in criminal activities up to now in the knowledge that they would only have to serve a small part of their sentences due to overcrowding will realise that this is no longer the case.  The reduction in crime, in particular car thefts, is attributed in part at least by the gardaí to increased prison accommodation.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister one question arising from what the Minister said, that it was not intended that the teaching facilities would be reduced, but I thought at the end she did say that they would be reduced.  If we could just know, for example, from now until the end of July, which would be the normal teaching period in Arbour Hill and Cork, will facilities be available so that the same number of teachers can teach approximately the same number of prisoners?</P>
