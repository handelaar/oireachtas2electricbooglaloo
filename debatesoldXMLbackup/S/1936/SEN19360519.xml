      <P>Dáil Eireann has this day passed the following Resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill, 1934, having been sent on the 6th day of February, 1936, to Seanad Eireann in pursuance of a resolution of this House passed on that day under Article 38A of the Constitution, and the period of sixty days mentioned in that Article having elapsed since the said Bill was so sent to Seanad Eireann, it is hereby resolved that, as Seanad Eireann did not pass the said Bill within the said period of sixty days the said Bill be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas at the expiration of the said sixty days in the form in which it was so sent to Seanad Eireann on the 6th day of February, 1936.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 30) Order, 1936, made on the 28th day of February, 1936, by the Executive Council under the Control of Imports Act, 1934 (No. 12 of 1934).&mdash;(Minister for Lands).</P>

      <P>This is the motion that was discussed at the last meeting, and it was adjourned because the desire had been expressed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce might be able to tell us just how the relative proportions of foreign and British <Col N="2415" /> cement were to be adjusted.  Perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be able to give us some information now on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the allocation of licences under the quota orders is concerned, the general quota and the special quota are administered as if they were two separate quotas.  The manner in which the licences are granted is provided for in the terms of the Control of Imports Act.  Notice is given that application should be made for licence to import, and every person upon the register of importers is entitled to make application before the commencement of a quota period.  Such persons can make application for a licence to import either under the general quota or under the special quota, or both.  The allocation of licences, having regard to the amount of the quota fixed for the period concerned, is determined in accordance with the information which is furnished by importers as to the amount of cement imported by them during a previous period.  The allocation of licences is determined in that manner, and by the position in regard to the total amount applied for by all the applicants.  The applicant, therefore, may get a licence to import under either the special or the general quota, and, as the total amount to be imported under both quotas is only 75 per cent. of the amount to be imported during the period, it is to be assumed that, during the course of the period, each importer will come back to seek a further percentage of the 25 per cent. un-allocated, and an additional licence will be issued to him if he can show that the licences previously issued have been utilised. Perhaps I may say, by way of illustration, that an importer who desired to import 100,000 tons of cement would get two licences&mdash;one under the general quota and one under the special quota <Col N="2416" />&mdash;the total amount being 75,000 tons. During the course of the quota period the importer would apply for a further licence amounting to 25,000 tons, and would get this further licence if he was in a position to show that the 75,000 tons already licensed had been already imported by him.  In practice it means that each importer gets two licences&mdash;one under the general quota and one under the special quota.  The general licence can be used by the importer to import cement irrespective of the country of origin, but the licence under the special quota embodies the condition that the cement must be produced in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>The making of this latter order followed on the trade agreement with Great Britain at the beginning of the year.  Previously the importation of cement was controlled under the Cement Act, but because of the necessity of ensuring that, in accordance with the agreement with Great Britain, at least one-third of our cement requirements would come from Great Britain, it was not practicable to continue the provisions of the Cement Act as it stood.  Consequently that was dropped, and the provisions of the Control of Imports Act took its place. It is true that certain importers in the past imported Continental cement exclusively, and that certain other importers imported British cement exclusively, and apparently certain importers still wish to import Continental cement exclusively.  However, we are required by the Act to issue a licence to every registered importer who applies for a licence under the special or the general quota.  It may mean that some importers, who wish to import Continental cement exclusively, may be required to import a certain proportion of British cement.  The purpose of that is to ensure that our imports of British cement will be in accordance with the agreement we made some months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the price of cement is concerned, the trade agreement with Great Britain involved that consultation will take place between the representatives of the cement exporters in Great Britain and the importers here, through their respective Government <Col N="2417" /> Departments, with a view to ensuring that the price of cement will be satisfactory.  In other words, any attempt by the cement exporters in Great Britain or by the cement importers here, to exploit to their own advantage this agreement between the two countries, will be checked.  Discussions are proceeding and arrangements have already been made concerning cement to be imported through the Port of Dublin.  The price is regarded by importers as satisfactory, but prices have not yet been fixed for the importation of cement through the very large number of ports around the coast of Ireland.  I have no doubt an arrangement will be made covering all ports similar to that already made for the Port of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is misinformed. Nobody is required to import Continental cement.  A licence under the general quota can be used to import British cement.  There is no condition of origin at all attached to the licences issued under the general quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

      <P>Before Senator Brown moves the motion on the Order Paper, I think it was put down contingent on another motion to be passed in the Dáil.

      <P>As to the question of postponing the motion, I am in the hands of the Seanad.  Personally, I would very much regret if the motion could not be taken to-day.  We have a very full meeting of the Seanad, and this is a matter that ought to be dealt with by a full meeting.  For that reason I would be very anxious that it should be taken to-day.  It would be very difficult suddenly to get a meeting of the Seanad called again, and to have anything like the numbers we have to-day.  Personally, I am in the hands of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is hereby resolved that, in the event of the existence of Seanad Eireann as a constituent House of the Oireachtas being terminated by the enactment of the Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Bill, 1934, the Cathaoirleach be directed to offer the casket presented to Seanad Eireann by the late Senator Mrs. Alice Stopford Green, together with the contents thereof, as a gift for <Col N="2419" /> preservation to the Council of the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
    <P>On the 26th November, 1924, it fell to my lot to present to the Seanad, on behalf of Senator Mrs. Alice Stopford Green, the beautiful shrine which stands to-day for the last time on the table of the Cathaoirleach.  Too ill to make the presentation herself, she sent with her gift a message which, describing its purpose, read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My purpose was that the shrine should contain a vellum roll, on which every member of the First Irish Seanad should sign his name; and that the shrine should be placed on the Table at the opening of each meeting of the Seanad&mdash;now and in the future&mdash;to be a perpetual memorial of the foundation of this body, and a witness in later times of its increasing service to the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To-day, after less than 12 short years, it falls to my lot to propose a resolution which provides for the perpetual safe-keeping in other hands of this gift to a Seanad which will cease to exist within the next few days.</P>
    <P>Our shrine is an object of peculiar beauty, and is the work of a lady metal-worker whose art is an honour to this country.  It is the property of this Seanad; and we hold it in trust for the purpose declared by its donor.  That purpose is about to fail, and we have now to determine how it is to be disposed of.  This question was carefully considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and they came to the conclusion that the most fitting custodians of this beautiful object would be the Council of the Royal Irish Academy.  We have reason to believe that the Council will be willing to accept the gift for preservation; and I may add that it will be placed in the National Museum, and will be seen there along with the other objects of Irish art in the keeping of the Academy.  The resolution which I move has been framed to carry this into effect.  It was my great privilege to be admitted to the intimate friendship of Alice Stopford Green.  She was a very remarkable woman&mdash;one of <Col N="2420" /> the most so I have ever known.  She was an historian of great authority, especially of the early centuries of Irish history.  But, above all, she was imbued with an intense love of her country.  After the establishment of the Free State she had the highest hopes of its future, and in that future she believed that the Seanad would, in her own words, &ldquo;be of increasing service to the country.&rdquo;  Well, Sir, its services to the country, great and manifold as I hold them to have been, are now at an end.  But may I express the hope, which I believe to be the hope of the majority of our people. that, within a short time, this House will have a successor.  It surely cannot be beyond the wit of our statesmen of all Parties&mdash;for all Parties should join in the effort&mdash;to devise a Second Chamber truly representative of the various interests of our people, and chosen without regard to Party politics.  That, Sir, is my earnest hope.  And if Alice Stopford Green were with us still, it is a hope in which she most certainly would have joined</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I had certain misgivings about the fate of the casket, which were allayed when I heard that it was to go to the Royal Irish Academy. I understand now that it is to be in the custody of the Academy and to be exhibited in the Museum with other objects of art of a contemporary period.  That, I take it, is contemporary with the 8th century and with the casket of the Book of Kells.  That casket was stolen in a period of non-culture, but the book was ignored. The book is in Trinity College.  It may be that the names in the casket cannot be obliterated.  I suggest that the autographs of Senators which are contained in this casket should be photographed.  It now represents a cultural period with the beginning of the Seanad in 1922, and its destination in the Museum is particularly appropriate, though the appropriateness comes from contrast.  I hope the casket will go on the ground floor with the gold ornaments, and not upstairs with the contribution of the second <Col N="2421" /> cultural period&mdash;President de Valera's boots.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the names in that casket at any rate represent a certain period comparable to Grattan's Parliament, which ran for 17 years and that this House ran for 14 years.  We are going to end that and be comparable to Costa Rica. I would like to have on record and to have photographs of the people who stood in the storm and stress and upheld the Constitution against those who became nothing more than weak representatives.  In other words, the Free State has not been improved upon by the Republicans who attempted to break up the Seanad, and who have not improved conditions one iota except to gain a little further freedom&mdash;freedom from income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The making secure of the future of the casket is perhaps of more value than would appear from the motion on the Order Paper.  I have no doubt the facade of Government that is eventually set up will be a fitting memorial to the architects and to the workmen who designed and built it, but no facade of Government can hope to endure unless it has a sound foundation and a solid background. I believe successive Governments in this country are merely laying the foundation and that we, by securing the safety of this little casket, are adding to the background.  Every effort should be made to preserve everything historical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that attaches to our history, whatever it is, from a gold ornament to the statue of Queen Victoria, which is the greatest artistic antithesis I can think of.  One belonged to the golden age and the other to an iron age; the one impossible to remember, <Col N="2422" /> the other hard to forget.  I would preserve not only a gallán inscribed with Ogham writing, but I would even preserve the corner stone of a prison with the broad arrow, everything that would remind future generations of our history.  It is quite conceivable that the contents of the casket might not be of any particular interest to Irishmen in years to come. It might even be that they might not have as good taste as we have, and that they might not admire its style or its beauty, but at the same time it represents a period of our history, and I do believe that in this matter we should have some thought for our people some hundreds of years hence. We should make every effort to preserve in our time everything that will help them to know and to understand different phases of our history.  So much has been lost to us, whether it was good or bad, that we should like to have now, that it is our duty to preserve for future generations of Irishmen everything of a similar character appertaining to our own day.</P>

      <P>I formally seconded the motion, reserving my right to speak later, as I had some doubts as to the exact course which the discussion might have taken, and I thought that it might have been necessary for me to reply to some points.  I had the honour of a very close friendship with the late Senator Mrs. Stopford Green.  I received more kindness, personal kindness, from her than from anyone else outside my immediate relatives.  I had the highest conceivable regard for her.  I believe that she had a definite object in presenting the casket to us, and I should like to see every Senator re-reading, or perhaps reading for the first time, the letter which she sent to this House when she asked the House to accept this gift.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I should like to see it printed again in detail in the Press. Whatever our opinions may be about the future of this House or of the Government of this State, this is not a suitable time for controversial discussion.</P>

      <P>Whatever the future may be we can unite in loyalty to the country.  We had recently a full opportunity to state our views as to the action proposed to be taken by the Dáil, and some of us did so in no uncertain manner.  To repeat these views now in connection with a motion for the preservation of the casket would serve no useful purpose, and I do not propose to do so.  I am not without hope that the time will come when the words written by Mrs. Stopford Green when presenting this gift and the spirit underlying her action will be appreciated to an extent which I fear they are not in the Party policies of to-day. It may be that when this casket is on public view it may lead those who see it to read the letter which it contains &mdash;one of the noblest and most inspiring pieces of prose ever written by one of Irish blood.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Cathaoirleach be requested to acquaint Mr. Donal O'Sullivan, Clerk of the House, and Mr. Diarmuid Coffey, Assistant Clerk, that this House desires to express its appreciation of the manner in which they have uniformly discharged the duties of their important offices during the long period spent by them in the service of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion, which it is my privilege to move to-day, is possibly the last that <Col N="2424" /> the House will be asked to adopt. Regardless of Party affiliations or commitments, and notwithstanding the varying viewpoints which we hold on many questions, I think I can claim with confidence that there will be complete unanimity on the part of every section of the House, and of every member of it, so far as this motion is concerned.  I had the great privilege of being a member of the first Seanad. I have had a continuous association with it from its first meeting until this day.  I took part in its first discussion and it is my lot to-day to initiate what may be its last.  I shall personally carry away many abiding memories of these anxious, historic years, but none more enduring than my recollection of the efficiency, loyalty, tireless energy and unfailing courtesy of our brilliant Clerk, Mr. Donal O'Sullivan, and his able assistant, Mr. Diarmuid Coffey.</P>

      <P>When we came together in the early days of the infant State, we were largely an Assembly of individuals without Standing Orders to regulate our work, without established tradition to guide us and with only a few of our members having any previous Parliamentary experience. They were abnormal days, for there was civil war in the land and the future was dark and gloomy in the extreme.  It was in these very unique and difficult circumstances that our newly-appointed officers took up their work, and well they discharged their task.  It is only one like myself, who sat on the first Committee of Procedure and Privileges, who can form any comprehensive idea of the variety and the complexity of the task with which they were faced and the work which had to be done in order that this House might function efficiently and smoothly as a Parliamentary Assembly.  It is true that in theory this work was primarily the responsibility of members of the House, but as happens in all such cases the great bulk of the duties devolved upon our Clerks.  By intelligent research, by able memoranda, by assembling a whole fund of indispensable information, as well as by helpful suggestions put forward with great modesty, they made a major <Col N="2425" /> contribution to the creation of the elaborate and smooth-running machinery by which the Seanad has since been enabled to discharge its various duties.  Since then they have had many new duties and they were not easy.  They have had many problems and they were complex, but they have brought to bear upon these the same unfailing ability and the same fidelity to the discharge of their duties, as they brought to their first task.</P>
      <P>The Seanad had good cause to be thankful for the fact that it had for its first officers&mdash;and as it now proves, probably its last also&mdash;officials who were the best that any country could produce.  Procedure and Parliamentary etiquette have hitherto prevented us from giving any public expression of our appreciation of their services, but the circumstances in which we meet to-day enable us to do so for the first and, I suppose, for the last time.  I am sure every section of the House will avail of the opportunity with sincerity and enthusiasm.  In saying that we shall be very sorry indeed to have to terminate our long association with Messrs. O'Sullivan and Coffey, may I be permitted to say, because of the circumstances in which we are assembled, what I think is uppermost in the mind of each of us-that we also regret having to say farewell to one another, at least in the capacities in which we have been working for the last 13 or 14 years?  By our contacts and associations as members of the Seanad we learned to understand one another's viewpoint much better than if we had not met.  We learned to put forward sharply opposing political viewpoints without recourse to that churlish and disorderly behaviour which has impaired the proceedings of other Assemblies older and more experienced than ours. We gradually learned that as citizens of the country we had more in common with one another than we thought originally to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, am grateful for having had the privilege of playing a part in the contribution which this House has made to the legislative code of this country during what was, perhaps, the most critical period in all its long history.  We remember, too, with pride the fact that the House included at one <Col N="2426" /> time or another in its membership, leading men and women of whom any country might well be proud, people such as the late Mrs. Stopford Green, the late Dr. Sigerson, Dr. Douglas Hyde and Dr. W.B. Yeats.  We have had amongst us poets, dramatists and great writers.  We have had also eminent representatives of industry, of the learned professions, of finance and of agriculture.  We have had the lords of the manor and we have had the representatives of labour.  In short, representatives of every aspect of Irish social and economic life have had their place in this Assembly and made a contribution to its deliberations.  I believe personally that there have been no enemies of this land on the membership roll of this House.  I believe that at heart each member was passionately devoted to his country, proud of its traditions, its history and its storied past.  After all, different people have different methods of working for the same ideal, and patriotic speeches replete with fiery national sentiments are not the only means by which one can serve his country.</P>
    <P>The battle for the life of this Assembly has been fought and lost.  We must probably leave to other days and other men to say who has taken the right course and who has taken the reverse.  At all events, I hope that every member of the Assembly voted for the course which he or she considered the best calculated to serve the nation's interest.  That being the case, we, individually at least, accept the result without complaint and without asperity, although, perhaps, not without a little anxiety as to the future.</P>
    <P>We met originally almost as strangers.  We part to-day as colleagues and friends.  With every apology for this digression, because of the special circumstances in which we are assembled, I would like on my own behalf and I believe on behalf of every member of this Assembly to assure Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Coffey that we deeply and sincerely appreciate the able and unselfish services that they have rendered to this House during the whole of its chequered history.  We wish them and theirs the best of luck down through all the coming years.</P>

      <P>As a member of this House since its inception, I desire to second the motion proposed by Senator O'Farrell, and to be associated with the expressions of appreciation of the untiring energy and unfailing courtesy of Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Coffey in their office as Clerk and Assistant-Clerk of this House.  As you know, Sir, I am one of those who, from time to time, have exercised the right of private judgment in certain matters. At certain times I did not always agree with the decisions given by you, and subsequently went to discuss them with Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Coffey. Whether or not I agreed with them eventually, I never failed to come away satisfied that they were only actuated to do the right thing for the service and dignity of this Assembly, and for the well-being of the country.  I am sure we all wish to be associated with the expressions of goodwill, happiness, success and good luck that have been voiced in their regard.</P>

      <P>There was no member of the House, I think, better qualified to bring forward this motion than Senator O'Farrell.  I have been associated with him from the beginning. Looking back over all the years that have passed since this House was established, when, if I may so put it, we used to be in each other's wool, I think I may say that as time has gone on we have learned to acquire a greater respect for each other's views. Senator O'Farrell has a very full and intimate knowledge of the work done by this House from the very beginning, so that in my opinion no better selection could have been made to bring forward a motion such as this.  He has had an excellent opportunity of estimating the value of the work done by Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Coffey. The Senator's motion sets out in excellent diplomatic language what I am sure every member of the House feels. I would like to say, on behalf of both myself and of all those with whom I have been in the habit of working as a member of the Seanad, that we feel we owe a great debt of gratitude to both the Clerk and to the Assistant Clerk.  Not only do we feel that, but we think that the whole Seanad owes them a great debt for the amenities <Col N="2428" /> with which all our debates have been carried on.  Their advice and their knowledge have ever been at our disposal. When difficult and critical legislative matters were to come before us, we have been able to go to them for advice, and in that way many of our difficulties were smoothed out beforehand for us.  Both gentlemen have had a great effect upon the course of our debates here, and of the conduct of business in the House. That, I am sure, is what all of us feel, and what I know the latest recruits to the House must recognise.  I am sure that both thoroughly understand that, as legislators and personally, we are parting with them with great regret indeed.  We wish them in the future all health and happiness, and we feel that they will never regret the labours which they have rendered to this House.</P>

      <P>As a member of the House since its inception, I would like to associate myself with the views expressed by previous speakers in praise of the services rendered to this Assembly both by Mr. O'Sullivan and by Mr. Coffey.  Personally, I would like to express my own sincere appreciation of the help which I received from them.  When I became a member of the House I had no knowledge of Parliamentary procedure, especially in regard to the drafting of amendments to Bills.  I knew, of course, what I wanted to get done, and when I put my views before Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Coffey they were able to translate them into the correct Parliamentary forms, and in my opinion they always did so with great efficiency. It was a labour of love to them to assist every Senator who came to them seeking their advice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>As, perhaps, the Senator with the shortest service in the House, I wish to say that I agree with the Senators who have already spoken in regard to the manner in which the officials of the House have discharged their duties: very often difficult and delicate duties.  As a member of the Government for a considerable time, I had contact with the officials of the House from another angle.  I must <Col N="2429" /> say that I always found, while the Government was met in every way, as it ought to be met, that the care that should be taken for the dignity, the right and interest of this House was taken by the officials, and that just as they discharged their duties impartially and courteously as between members of the House, they discharged them with the same courtesy and the same impartiality and the same correctness as between the House and the Government of the day which might have wanted business dealt with in a particular way, or which might have wanted concessions of one sort or another in regard to facilitating matters which the Government wish to be hurried.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly sure that the work of the officials contributed greatly towards making the work of this House as efficient as it was, and towards giving this House a character that was in keeping with its duty and with its particular constitutional status.  There is no doubt at all that the proceedings of the Seanad have always been marked by, I will not say an atmosphere of aloofness, but an atmosphere of impartiality and an absence of heat which undoubtedly gave great weight to the views expressed here.  The rules of order, the precedents that were established and the influence that was exercised by the officials undoubtedly contributed very much towards that result.</P>

      <P>May I add my small word to the gratitude that has been expressed and that we all feel so deeply towards Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Coffey?  A woman, I think, feels it more difficult than a man to fill a position such as membership of this House entails.  I have had my own difficulties since I came here, but in all my difficulties I had only to go to the two gentlemen whose names are included in this motion, when they were always smoothed out with unfailing courtesy.  No matter how busy or how hurried they might be, both always found time to attend to my smallest request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a thing of which I am proud&mdash;<Col N="2430" /> perhaps it is the proudest boast that any woman could have&mdash;that I, in a very small, unworthy and humble way was found to be the person to fill the place left vacant by the death of Mrs. Stopford Green.  I do not for one moment believe that I have been capable of filling that place as it should have been filled, but it is my greatest pride that the members of this House who gave me their votes when I was elected felt that I was in some way fitted to fill that place.  If they had not thought so, I am sure they would not have given me their votes, and for that I am deeply grateful to them.  I am very glad to be here to be able to give this small expression to my feelings on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I think I am the only member of the House present who was on the committee appointed by the House at its first meeting to interview and to select officers for the House.  I think that the best tribute that I can pay to the officers that we selected on the recommendation of that committee is that I have no regrets for the recommendations which the committee, of which I was a member, made on that occasion. With regard to the general question, this is probably the last occasion that I will have the opportunity of meeting my colleagues in this House.  At different times and on different issues I have had big differences of opinion with the members of all Parties, except my own.  I think that I may say that I was delightfully impartial in attacking the members of all the other Parties who could not see the point of view of the Party of which I am a member.  As I have said, we had our differences of opinion and our arguments about one thing or another, each one putting forward what he conscientiously believed to be right.  I think it is highly creditable that during the history of this House, in the last 13½ years, our business has been conducted in a manner at least as good as that in which business has been conducted in any other Assembly of the kind throughout the world. That fact is noteworthy because of <Col N="2431" /> this, that this House was born during a period of civil war and continued to carry on its business during a subsequent troubled period.  It is there fore, I think, a great credit to our people that we are able to place on record the manner in which the business of the country was done in this Assembly.  It is a tribute to the people at large.</P>
      <P>We must have some regrets at parting on this occasion, in view of the fact that we have been associated together for such a long time.  We can congratulate ourselves on this, that no matter what our differences of opinion may have been on the various issues that cropped up from time to time, our personal friendships were maintained and will, I hope, continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the member of the House who had the honour of proposing the first Chairman of this House, I should like, Sir, to convey to you, on behalf of the members of our Party, an expression of our indebtedness for your dignified, courteous and impartial conduct of affairs in this House.  I do so the more willingly because I was one of those who dissented when you were originally proposed for the Chair.  I must confess now that my judgment has been revised, and I should like to record my appreciation of the choice made by my colleagues.  When you succeeded such a brilliant Chairman as the late Lord Glenavy, a man whose high legal training and intellectual gifts particularly fitted him for the position, there were many who thought that your chairmanship would suffer in comparison. They have been agreeably disappointed.  Your chairmanship has <Col N="2432" /> been just as successful as that of your distinguished predecessor.  For eight eventful years you managed the affairs of this House with tact and skill, and defended our rights and privileges with courage and ability.  I have no doubt that you, Sir, feel as some of the rest of us do in our own cases, that President de Valera has done you an unwitting service in relieving you of public responsibility, but I do not think that the service he has done you is a service to the nation.  You have added lustre and dignity to this House by your conduct in the Chair.</P>
      <P>As one who has no ambition to be a member of a Second Chamber as in future constituted, I do not pretend that it is without a wrench that I sunder the many pleasant contacts I have made in this House, contacts, I am glad to say, not confined to the Party to which I belong.  I notice that some of our friends on the right profess to look forward with enthusiasm to the disappearance of this stronghold of feudalism and West Britonism. I do not think the majority is quite so enthusiastic about it.  The last moments are always the saddest, and, in spite of this forced gaiety and enthusiasm for their own destruction, there are, I think, amongst the Government and Labour Parties, a few concealed tears.  The tears may be, of course, for the nation which is being deprived of their unselfish services.  I have already said what I thought about their conduct in voting for the abolition of the House of which they were members.  I will on this occasion spare their feelings and merely express the hope that they will all enjoy their well-earned obscurity.</P>
      <P>Again, Sir, I thank you for your courtesy and for your services to this House and to the nation.</P>

Every section of the House is, I think, agreed as to the impartiality of our Chairman.  You, Sir, have been at all times most courteous and helpful to every member of the House with regard both to legislation and to the motions which came before us.  You have given fair play to all of us, and you have been a perfect Father O'Flynn so far as this House is concerned.</P>

I suppose no member of the Seanad has fallen foul of you oftener than I have.  I recognise now that, in the words of Senator O'Farrell, we are cutting as under old associations.  Although at times I felt aggrieved at your decisions, I was convinced, deep down in my heart, that there was no personal animosity on your part, that you were guided solely and entirely according to your lights.  I regret some of the remarks made by Senator MacLoughlin, but I should like to join with other members in expressing my gratitude to you for many kindnesses, and, as we are now about to separate, I trust you may live long, enjoy your life, and have many years of prosperity.</P>

      <P>I thank you very much, indeed.  We have finished our labours, and nothing remains to be done but to ring down the curtain.  I think we may congratulate ourselves on having done the State some service. For my part, I owe a special debt of gratitude to you all for your sincere help to me during the many years in which I tried to fulfil with impartiality the duties of my office as your Chairman. On the 11th December, nearly 14 years ago, we met here in bleak December.  We met in darkness.  We emerge in light, conscious that we did our duty, and conscious that, in our every act, we tried to build and strengthen this infant State.  We met, <Col N="2434" /> as I say, educated in different environments, animated by different political ideals and ambitions, possibly distrusting one another.  Yet, in a few short years of contact, as Senator O'Farrell said, we realised that each one of us, in our individual capacity, was working for the good of the State, that each was doing his best, playing his part, and pulling his weight in the boat. And so now we come to the end.  No recriminations may or should be allowed.  All I ask leave to do is to express the hope that we who have striven for the up-building of this State will continue to uphold this State so far as we can.  If I might venture to express a hope, it would be that my voice, addressed from this Chair for the last time, would go out over our heads to the country at large in an appeal for respect for the law. The law is being made by our representatives for all of us.  There is no safeguard for democracy but in the keeping of the law.  I hope it will be kept.  If we, who are in the sere and yellow leaf, are approached for our counsel, I hope we shall say: &ldquo;Work for the law, by the law, and with the law.&rdquo;  Thus only will democracy be preserved and strengthened.  We met in darkness; we emerge in light&mdash;the light of May, before us the glory of summer and the hope of autumn, with the reaping of the harvest.  The harvest will be reaped by some men of goodwill&mdash;a harvest which will be great, giving a return which will be bounteous.  I was struck some little time ago by a poem written by a Northern lady.  Perhaps it was the sadness of the poem that appealed to me.  The authoress was attuning her mind to the various responses of Nature and she was struck by the robin.  This is what she said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Maybe you mind the robin</P>
      <P>Sitting his lone on the thorn,</P>
      <P>Preening himself on days that are gone,</P>
      <P>Brave with a joy forlorn.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Tis true, it is bleak December,</P>
      <P>And no Spring hopes has he;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2435" /> I thank you all.  We shall remember the contacts we made here.  We shall remember our friends of different creeds, of different politics, of different ideals, animated by one desire&mdash;the advancement of this State.  So far as <Col N="2436" /> God gave us light we fulfilled our duty, and we leave the stage conscious of our own rectitude.  I thank you all, and I declare the Seanad adjourned <i>sine die.</i></P>
