      <P>I move that the Report be adopted.  The first question involved in the Report is the most important one, and is also a rather complicated one.  Perhaps I may be allowed to state, very shortly, the circumstances under which the question arose and the reasons for the findings of the Committee.  I am taking it directly from the Report of the Land Purchase (Guarantee Fund) Bill, which was certified by the Ceann Comhairle as a Money Bill.  It was received from the Dáil late on Wednesday night, 11th December, and it appeared on our Order Paper, on the 12th, for Second Stage.  There also appeared on the Order Paper a motion in the name of Senator Robinson to enable the remaining stages of the Bill to be taken on that date.</P>
      <P>Before the House sat on Thursday, it came to the knowledge of the Cathaoirleach&mdash;the mode being stated in the report&mdash;that steps were being taken by members of the other House to request the reference of the question whether the Bill was, or was not, a Money Bill, to the Committee of Privileges which, under Article 35 of the Constitution, came to be constituted for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances the Cathaoirleach was faced with a very difficult question.  There was no Standing Order of our own which applied to this particular case.  We had always been in the habit of treating, as far as our procedure was concerned, a Money Bill in the same way as a Bill that was not of the nature of a Money Bill.  The only section that applied to the procedure at that time was the one which applied to Bills which were not Money Bills.  The Cathaoirleach was, therefore, <Col N="1662" /> bound, there being no Standing Order of our own on the matter, by our Order 39 which provides: &ldquo;In all matters of order which may arise and are not provided for in these Standing Orders, the Cathaoirleach shall rule as to him seems right, having regard to such precedents as may have been established, and to the circumstances of the case.&rdquo;  But a case of the kind had never arisen before and, therefore, there were no precedents, and the Cathaoirleach had to do what he deemed to be right in the circumstances. The circumstances with which he had to deal are set out in the Report and will be found in paragraph 10.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach had three courses open to him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to make no ruling in the matter, but to allow the Second Stage and the motion to take all stages to be taken, if the House so decided;</P>
    <P>(b)  to allow the Second Stage to be taken but to disallow the motion for the remaining stages.</P>
    <P>Therefore, he could allow the Second Stage to be taken and disallow the motion for the other stages of the Bill, or (c) he could take the decision which he did, in fact, take, and rule that the Second Stage could not be taken until the three days had expired within which a request for the Committee of Privileges could be demanded by members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I may mention that it is a curious fact that, under the Article of the Constitution dealing with this question of reference as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, there are seven days allowed for a request for that Committee of Privileges, but under the Standing Orders of the other House only three days are allowed to members of that House in which to demand such a committee.  It is further provided in the Constitution that if a Money Bill is returned by the Seanad to the Dáil within the seven days, the power to demand a Committee of Privileges is at an end as soon as the Bill has been returned.  Now it is easy to see how, if the Cathaoirleach had made no ruling, this position could have arisen.  If the Cathaoirleach had adopted the first alternative, <Col N="1663" /> that is, to let the Order Paper stand as it was, and if both the motion for the Second Reading and the motion in the name of Senator Robinson had been taken, the Seanad might have passed the Second Reading of the Bill and also the motion in the name of Senator Robinson.  In that case this House would have deprived the members of the other House of the right which they had to refer this to the Committee of Privileges under Article 35, and so the Cathaoirleach rejected the first alternative.  If he adopted the second alternative and allowed the Second Stage only to go on, disallowing the motion of Senator Robinson, the decision of the Seanad on the Second Reading might very seriously have prejudiced the decision of the Committee of Privileges under Article 35 of the Constitution for reasons which are set out at length, and which seem to be conclusive, in paragraph 12 of the Report.  The Cathaoirleach, therefore, rejected the second alternative also, and adopted the third one.  He ruled that the Second Stage of the Bill could not be taken until the expiration of the three days and allowed the members of the Dáil, under their own Standing Orders, to require a reference to the Committee of Privileges.  Now, that ruling having been made and carried into effect, it was questioned under our own Standing Orders in the ordinary way and duly referred to our own Committee of Privileges.  It came before them on the 18th December.  There were eight members present, including the Cathaoirleach, one member being indisposed at the time.  The question was fully discussed, and the majority, as appears from the schedule to the Report, was 5 to 2.  The opinion of the majority of the Committee is stated in paragraph 14 of the Report:</P>
    <P>We are, accordingly, of the opinion for the reasons stated: (1) that the subject matter of the Cathaoirleach's ruling was a matter of order not provided for in the Standing Orders, and that Standing Order 39 therefore applied to it; (2) that, the case being unique, <Col N="1664" /> no precedents had been established in regard to it, and that the Cathaoirleach, in accordance with Standing Order 39, had to have regard solely to the circumstances of the case; (3) that, in the circumstances, his ruling was justified.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach's ruling is, accordingly, approved by us.</P>
    <P>The Report winds up:</P>
    <P>We report accordingly.</P>
    <P>I now move the adoption of the Report.</P>

      <P>Arising out of this Report, there is one matter that I wish to draw attention to.  It is rather unusual, and therefore I claim the indulgence and support of the House in bringing it forward.  On the day that that ruling was arrived at the President of the Executive Council speaking in the Dáil that evening on Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Bill made this reference:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even to-day you can see the Party attitude that is being taken up already&mdash;the Chairman of that Seanad anticipating an action of one of the Parties here because of a report in the newspapers, and preventing business which was on the Order Paper from being transacted. Then we are supposed to believe that the Seanad is not a Party Seanad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1665" />&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and that this question of the majority of a majority is not going to operate there as it operated here.  Of course it is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pass over the extremely bad taste of such references in the Dáil to the ruling of the Chair in this House. There is a more serious aspect of that statement which cannot be allowed to pass without comment.  The President of the Executive Council impugns the impartiality of our Chairman and the bona-fides of members of this House without a shadow of justification, and, so far as one can judge, merely in order to try to make a partisan debating point in the Dáil.  There is also a definite imputation in his statement that there was collusion between the Chair and a Party in this House in arriving at the ruling of the Chair. I consider it imperatively necessary that such a statement, and the imputations it carries, should be at the first appropriate opportunity categorically denied.  As to the suggestion of collusion, the very opposite is the fact. So far as the members of the Seanad for whom I speak are concerned, I may say that we met at half-past two that day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickLynchKC" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to accommodate the tender susceptibilities of Senator Lynch, I will try to refrain from the actual reading.  I may say that so far as the Senators for whom I speak here are concerned, we met at half-past two on that day.  I presided at the meeting.  We decided to act on the assumption at that meeting that all stages of the Bill would be taken that afternoon.  We drew up recommendations to be considered on the appropriate stage of the Bill.  It was only when one of our members arrived at the office of the Clerk of the Seanad at five minutes to three <Col N="1666" /> o'clock to hand in the recommendations that we learned what the decision of the Cathaoirleach was going to be.  I may say when we heard it we felt somewhat disconcerted at the decision.  I think what I have said should dissipate any credence that might be given to the statement of the President of the Executive Council that there was either collusion or Party influence brought to bear in order to bring about the ruling of the Chair.</P>
      <P>As to the ruling of the Chair itself. I think all members will now agree that it was a wise ruling to have made. It is one that reflects credit upon the judgment of the Cathaoirleach, as well as one which definitely preserved at a critical moment an important right guaranteed by the Constitution to the other House in Parliamentary procedure.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable to have to make these comments on a statement of the head of the Government, but when that statement reflects so seriously, as it does, on the good faith of members of this House, and especially on the probity of the Cathaoirleach, who has, during his tenure of office, preserved an attitude of strict impartiality in such matters, it is essential a protest should be entered on the records of this House and an emphatic denial given to such a statement and its imputations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBennett" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order for a member of one House of the Oireachtas to make personal references to a member of the other House; but I did not stop Senator Milroy, as I thought it only equitable that he should be allowed to reply to the President in so far as the remarks of the latter may have made an unfair imputation on the Party to which the Senator belongs.  So far as the charges against the occupant of the Chair are concerned, I propose, of course, to ignore them.  I shall not allow any further reference to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the Committee of Privileges to which the ruling of the Chair was referred, and I was one of those in the minority who dissented from that report.  I would like to state the reasons why I <Col N="1667" /> dissented.  In the first place, I consider that the only channel of communication between the Dáil and the Seanad is the recognised legal channel through the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  When the Cathaoirleach made a ruling refusing to take up this Bill, which was, I think, first on the Order Paper of the day, he gave as his reasons that there were reports in the public Press to the effect that certain members of the Dáil, who had not then reached the legal number, were going to challenge the ruling of the Chairman of the Dáil that the Bill was a Money Bill.</P>
      <P>I say, with great respect, that the business of Parliament cannot be carried on with dignity or legally, if the statements made in the public Press from time to time, even though they may be unanimous&mdash;they rarely are unanimous&mdash;are to be taken as a ground for the ruling of the Chair either in the Dáil or the Seanad.  We are governed by certain rules of order; we have a procedure clearly defined; we have officials regularly appointed and it is through these officials that all communications from the Dáil to the Seanad or the Seanad to the Dáil should go.  If you adopt any other method you will have confusion and want of respect for each or both Houses of Parliament.</P>
      <P>This was the first occasion on which a ruling of the Chair was challenged. I think that the judgment of the Chair on that occasion was wrong.  I signed a requisition to challenge that judgment. I still think that the judgment of the Chair was wrong.  Of course I make no imputation whatever on the honour of the Chair.  Why should I? At the same time, each member of the Seanad has a right to his own opinion, to the exercise of his own judgment and to the expression of his own judgment. I think my friend Senator Brown has made only a very poor defence for the ruling of the majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules of this House, as drawn up by the very eminent man who supervised these rules, are sufficient for all the purposes of this House. If the rules had been complied with, very many difficulties would have been avoided.  The first item on the Order Paper that day was this Bill which was certified by the Ceann Comhairle to be a Money Bill.  We might very well have taken that measure into consideration and passed the Second Reading.  Item 2 on the Order Paper was that all stages of the Bill were to be taken on the same day.  All stages could not have been taken if there was objection by any single member of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not challenge that ruling at the present moment.  All I say is that when Item 2 came up, that was the time for members of the Seanad to say &ldquo;Now, the question as to whether this is a Money Bill or not is about to be challenged and the further Stages of this measure ought not to be taken at the present time&rdquo;, and that would be a sufficient reason for postponing the further Stages until such time as the requisition had been signed by the members of the Dáil.  My last objection is this, that the proceedings of this House should not be regulated by the whisperings of political gossipers or by statements in the Press, whether these statements are unanimous or not.  I again say I make no imputation whatever on the honour of the Chair, but I differed from his judgment then and I differ from his judgment now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move an amendment to Senator Brown's motion that this Report be marked &ldquo;Read.&rdquo;  I listened, as I always do, with great interest and with great respect to Senator Brown, and I consider it would be impertinent for me to find fault in any way with anything he has said.  But I am going to refer to this Report from a very different angle to that from which it was referred to by Senator Brown.  The reason I am doing so has been drawn more or less from me by the remark made by Senator Milroy when he trotted out that old wheeze of impartiality. What do we find in this Report?  We find that the Cathaoirleach whose ruling was under consideration by the Committee, actually took the chair, took part in the proceedings and signed the Report dealing with the findings on his own action.  Secondly, we find in the <Col N="1670" /> Report that Senators on the Committee had signed the requisition by which, to my mind, they, to a certain extent, prejudged the issue on which they afterwards voted; and thirdly, we find Senator Douglas with his usual insight coming to the rescue and moving a motion of dispensation which was agreed to by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the greatest respect to the Committee, I say that they committed a definite error of judgment in passing that motion.  That is my opinion, because the question for consideration was one about which there should have been no bargaining whatever. I say bargaining because I find it stated in the Report that if the Cathaoirleach would do one thing, the other members of the Committee would do another.  I think that that was a clear case of bargaining.  It was a question above all for Senators to determine how they should act in accordance with their own interests, and according to their sense of public duty and public decency.  It should not have been necessary for Senator Douglas to come along and propose a motion directing them what to do. Speaking bluntly, I consider it was an insult to the Cathaoirleach, it was an insult to the Senators who signed the requisition, and above all, it was an insult to the intelligence of the Committee themselves that they should pass such a motion.  It would be of great interest to the House to have from Senator Brown, after his long and distinguished career at the Bar, a statement as to whether he ever read or whether he ever knew or ever heard of a case in which the defendant presided at his own, trial, took part in the proceedings and signed a verdict as foreman of the jury&mdash;a verdict giving the findings on his own action? On the other hand, I ask the Senator did he ever know of a case where there were three plaintiffs acting on the jury?  The whole thing appears to me a beautiful comedy.  I am sure Senator Brown will agree with me in that.  And might I compliment the Cathaoirleach on the attitude he took up at one stage?  The Report tells us&mdash;I think it is paragraph 4&mdash;that he was prepared to step down from the <Col N="1671" /> Chair, not to take part in the proceedings, give the reason for his ruling and then retire.  I compliment the Cathaoirleach on that action.  It was a dignified and proper action for him to take up in the first instance.  It is a great pity that the Cathaoirleach did not see the light on previous occasions, particularly in the case of the Blueshirts inquiry.  I am greatly afraid that our bump of humour is not very pronounced.  If we take this thing seriously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As one of those who took part in the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges, I should like to say a few words.  In that Committee I happened to be in a minority.  I have heard Senator Comyn give his reasons, and his reasons were my reasons at the time when the decision was come to by you, Sir, on this question.  I think it is hardly necessary for me to say that I do not agree with the ruling you gave on this matter.  I hope it is hardly necessary for me to say, with all deference and respect, that I am satisfied you are quite incapable of doing anything that was not honourable and just according to your own opinion.  But, having said that, I hope an opportunity will be extended to me of criticising that opinion and showing with all due deference, why I disagree with it.  One of the Senators who has spoken has appealed to Senator Brown as to his experience as a barrister&mdash;his experience in courts.  The Senator has told my friend Senator Comyn that he is anxious to reply.  I would like to hear from him when he is replying if he has ever in the course of his experience as a barrister heard of a judge adjourning the proceedings of a court because he read something in one or two or three newspapers that morning, without the matter having been brought to his notice by somebody who is interested as a litigant before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due deference, that would strike me to be more in point than the reference to some other matters which we have heard discussed.  That is a matter that struck me at the time of the original ruling by you, Sir, upon this question, declining to have the matter discussed on the 12th December when it was on the Order Paper.  It struck me as being unfortunate that the Chairman should have given as his reason, not that he got any official communication that steps were about to be taken, or that information was conveyed in the usual or appropriate channel, but that he read it in all the morning papers&mdash;I think that was his expression.  I thought at the time, and <Col N="1673" /> do still, that that was a very unfortunate matter and that it should have been the basis of your ruling.  I thought it very unfortunate and I ventured to differ, with all respect, from that ruling at the time.  I adhered to that opinion when I was on the Committee and I adhere to it still.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this ruling which strikes me as worthy of consideration.  It is stated that if that ruling were not made by you, Sir, it was quite possible that all the stages of the Bill would have been taken that day and that that would have been very unfortunate having regard to what we now know was going on with reference to the Committee of Privileges in the Dáil.  What occurs to me is that that matter could not have been gone through in the easy way it is suggested it might have gone through, that is, taking all the stages in the Seanad on that occasion, except the House was very anxious to dispose of it and to create difficulties in the way of the other House.  If any intimation came from the Chair after the Second Stage of the Bill was dealt with, or after Senator Robinson moved his motion of which he had given notice, or if the attention of the House was called to the situation, I am sure that the good sense of the House would deal with it as it commended itself to them.</P>
    <P>I suggest, with all due deference, that it is rather a reflection on the intelligence of the House to suggest that they would not have dealt with it in a way that would be worthy of the Chamber itself.  I thought so at the time; I think so still; and that is the reason why I was one of the dissenting members from this majority report of the Committee.  I thought it necessary, or proper at all events, to state that to the House and again repeat that I have always thought that you, Sir, might differ in opinion from people whom you considered to be holding opinions different from your own perfectly honestly and truly. These are the reasons why I am against this and was one of the dissenting members on this Committee, and I am of the same opinion still as I was then.</P>

      <P>As I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and other members have spoken as to why they did take a certain course, I think it is only fair that I should state very briefly why I took the course I did.  I say at once that as a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges I have never been asked and, if asked, I would have refused to accept Party direction or dictation in interpreting the Orders of this House.  I look upon myself as acting in a judicial capacity when acting as a member of that Committee and I only wish every member of that Committee acted in the same spirit.  I think that we should look upon ourselves as interpreting the Orders and establishing the rights of this House irrespective of the Party to which we belong.  For that reason, I did think it unfortunate that three members of that body should see fit to send a requisition challenging the ruling of the Chairman, seeing that they themselves would be three members of a jury of eight who were going to try the Cathaoirleach later.</P>

      <P>I only mention the matter because Senator O'Neill, in his humorous homily to the House, has commented on the fact that the Cathaoirleach was also Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. He was there not because of any action of his own, but because by the Standing Orders he was a member of that Committee.</P>

      <P>I quite agree.  I think Senator Comyn adopted the proper attitude in staying there and that the Cathaoirleach adopted the proper attitude.  I only say that it was rather unfortunate that the three members concerned should feel it was necessary for them to put themselves down definitely as challengers of a decision, seeing that they knew that they would be the jurors who would try the matter.  When we came to discuss this the whole point at issue was that the Cathaoirleach had made his ruling because of a statement which he had seen in the Press and not because of any official intimation which had reached him. Senator Lynch, an eminent member of the Bar, to-day asked Senator Brown if he ever heard of a judge taking notice of a newspaper report for the purpose of adjourning or otherwise influencing a case.  He makes the statement notwithstanding the fact that I drew his attention during the proceedings of this Committee to the fact that a judge of the High Court did actually take notice of a Press report in regard to an action arising out of the very Bill under discussion.  During the hearing of the Guarantee Fund case counsel for the Cork and Louth County Councils drew the attention of the judge to the fact that a particular statement had appeared that day to the effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickLynchKC" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Pardon me.  The Senator is in error.  What I said was, if Senator Brown could cite an instance where a judge did this on his own initiative and not at the instance of one of the parties.  According to himself, in the particular instance Senator O'Farrell is referring to, the attention of the Court was called to it by counsel for one of the parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFanning" hpid="Mr. Fanning Mr. Fanning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that Senator Lynch did not say on his own initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say on his own initiative.  In any case, it is a distinction without a difference.  I accept it that the Senator meant that.  The fact remains that counsel did, on the strength of a Press report, ask the judge to take a certain course which the judge did take.  The judge said that he was going to put the case on the list for this term as a result of the information which counsel for the plaintiff placed before him on the strength of a Press report.  If that was good enough for a judge of the High Court, it is good enough for the Cathaoirleach of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also pointed out at the Committee an instance that might arise.  Leinster House was on fire and the fire was approaching this Chamber; the Cathaoirleach knew of it, but the Captain of the Guard had not conveyed him official intimation of the fact, and, consequently, he was not to warn the members of the House and we were roasted up because he did not get official intimation.  Members of the Bar and lawyers of all kind balance on the points of pins and they juggle around with legal technicalities.  I approach these questions from the viewpoint of a man of average intelligence, of the average man in the street who uses what is known as commonsense, but which in fact is very uncommon amongst people who should have a reasonable amount of it.  The main fact that remained was that the members of the other House have certain rights and that unless the Cathaoirleach did what he did they were going to be deprived of these rights.  This House had the right, by a motion before it, to pass this Bill through all its stages within one hour and to send it back to the other House, and the petition of right to which the members of the other House are entitled would therefore be satisfied. I think it was the duty of the Cathaoirleach to this House, whether he had official information at his disposal or not, once he knew the information he had got, officially or otherwise, was correct, to preserve to the members of the other House the rights which the <Col N="1677" /> Constitution preserved to them. Somebody said that if one member stood up and objected the other stages of the Bill could not be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <P>I made no such statement at all.  I want to continue regardless of this interruption from the Bar.  It should not be made the personal responsibility of an individual member of this House to preserve to the members of the other House the rights which the Constitution confers on them.  If there is any responsibility placed on any one individual in that case, it should be placed on the Cathaoirleach.  Moreover, if, for Party expediency, the majority of the House decided, as I believe it could have decided, to deprive members of the other House of that right, it was the duty of the Cathaoirleach, in his capacity as Cathaoirleach, to step in and to see that that right was not taken away.</P>
      <P>We are told by the people who say that no notice should be taken of newspaper reports that after all the Cathaoirleach, after the Second Stage had been taken, might have mentioned the newspaper report and that if he did it would appeal to the good sense of the House and not Party considerations.</P>

      <P>I must have very defective hearing.  If I misinterpreted the Senator I apologise, but I understood him to say that if the Cathaoirleach had made a certain statement after the Second Reading was taken he believed the good sense of the House would prevail and would hold up the Bill.  How could he have made the statement except on the strength of a newspaper report?  What is the use of quibbling over matters of that kind?  I had no hesitation whatever, and I wanted no promptings from Senator Douglas or anybody else, as to the line I was prepared to take. I take the line I consider right in the interests of justice and equity and in the interests of the dignity of this House for the few weeks that may remain to it.  That is the line I have taken in the past and the line I shall take up to the very last hour of the existence of this Seanad.  I do think it deplorable that when matters of this kind come up and when a vote is taken, although they are matters purely of order and of judgment and of jurisdiction, you too often find that the vote is on Party lines and that you find members of special committees who are supposed to act in a juridical capacity selected on Party lines in the hope that they will arrive at certain decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not standing up to apologise for the decision I arrived at&mdash;it was, in my opinion, the only sane and intelligent decision&mdash;but merely to state for purposes of record the reasons why I arrived at it.  I have to say that at that Committee I heard no statement that would influence the simplest juryman in the world to arrive at a contrary decision, and I do not think that any speech made here to-day by either of the eminent counsel who have spoken would influence a single member of this House to come to any <Col N="1679" /> decision other than that which was arrived at by the overwhelming majority of the Committee.</P>

      <P>As one who had nothing whatever to do with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and is not in the least concerned as to whether or not a few new Standing Orders are inserted, I might perhaps point out what appears to me to border on the ridiculous in this item under the heading of Senator Brown's motion. Senator Milroy drew our attention to the fact that he was the leader of some Party on the other side of the House. He has been the leader of several Parties to my own knowledge, but, in any case, it is set out in the first paragraph that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Cathaoirleach has been informed in writing by the leader of any Group or Party in the Seanad that a requisition for a Committee of Privileges under Article 35 of the Constitution is in process of being signed by members of either House of the Oireachtas...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It appears to me that if this motion were to be carried anybody might stand up and say: &ldquo;I am the leader of a Party and therefore I demand this privilege.&rdquo;  Assuming this House were to continue as a Seanad for the next 25 years, which it does not look very like doing, surely we ought to take the necessary steps to prevent people accusing us after our death of doing something ridiculous in our declining days.  I suggest that if the House is to insist on inserting this new Standing Order, some figures should be given; that there should be a provision that the application should be signed by a certain number of members of the Oireachtas; and that any man, before he could call himself the leader of any Party, should be able to prove to the satisfaction of the House that he had somebody in addition to himself to call his Party.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of your judgment, I think you were guilty of an error.  I may say that the general consensus of opinion at that time amongst members of the House was that you were guilty of an error of judgment.  I am of opinion that the Standing Orders of this House, read in conjunction with Article 35 of the Constitution, laid down very definite binding rules and that within those rules it was possible for this Chamber to bring about what it did in fact bring about on that occasion.  There was a Money Bill listed on the Order Paper for discussion.  Your ruling decided that that Bill would not be discussed in view of anticipatory action, and the Committee of Procedure and Privileges have upheld your ruling.  I look upon that ruling as establishing a very dangerous precedent because the matter could have been dealt with very definitely under Standing Orders. Under Standing Orders power was given to members of the other House to take certain action.  The members of this House had also power under their Standing Orders to take certain action.  I put this point to you, that if, under Standing Orders dealing with this issue, you were not able to get two-fifths of the members of the Seanad to have this matter referred to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, what hope would you have of defeating the Bill or passing a recommendation to it or, if it were not a Money Bill, passing an amendment to it?  If that step were taken, on the other hand, you would secure exactly the same result you did secure through your unprecedented action as Cathaoirleach.  Even if you could not get two-fifths of the members of the <Col N="1682" /> House, at least you could have sought to obtain a majority of the members of the House, not less than 30 members being present, and as you were able to carry certain recommendations, you could have brought forward a motion to have the question whether the Bill was a Money Bill or not referred to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <P>Alternatively, some member could have formally moved that the matter be referred to a Committee of Privileges, and if there were not less than thirty members present, the majority vote might so dispose of it.  In my humble judgment, I think the matter could have been resolved that way.  If you had any hope at all of passing a recommendation, if it were a Money Bill, or passing an amendment, if it were not a Money Bill, surely you would have sufficient power, in commanding a majority of votes in this House, to have this method adopted rather than the unprecedented action taken by the Cathaoirleach in his ruling.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this discussion because the matter was discussed in Committee, and I agree with the Report of the Committee, but the last speaker has quite obviously missed entirely the purport and the object of the Report.  He seems to think that the Cathaoirleach should not give a ruling on the circumstances as they appear to him because a certain number of Senators could have taken <Col N="1684" /> action which would have made that ruling ineffective.  The position was this.  The night previously&mdash;I think somewhere about 9.30 or 10 o'clock&mdash; the Dáil passed the Bill.  I think most Senators had no knowledge that it had passed the Dáil until they saw their papers or saw it on the Order Paper.  Senator Fitzgerald apparently suggests that the Cathaoirleach should have conveyed to certain Senators that if they could get two-fifths of the members of this House to make a requisition to have the Bill referred to a Committee of Privileges, there would have been no necessity for his ruling.  I agree that if they had done so the Cathaoirleach would not have had to make a ruling, but the Cathaoirleach could have had no possible knowledge of that matter. Senator Milroy has stated that there was no communication with any member of his Party, and I want to say that there was no discussion with the group to which I belong.  I really believe no member of the House had any knowledge of the exact ruling the Cathaoirleach was going to make until he came here.  I think the remarks of Senator Fitzgerald are based on an entirely wrong conception. This Committee had not to consider what might have been done in certain circumstances.  They had to consider the ruling of the Cathaoirleach in given circumstances, and in circumstances where he had knowledge that action was being taken by a certain number in the Dáil, when he had no knowledge of any action by members of this House.  It was his duty to see that the privileges of members of the Oireachtas should be granted to Senators in any action that was taken.  He gave the best ruling he could in the circumstances, and I think it was pretty much the only thing he could have done.  There seems to be an assumption on the part of Senator Comyn, and to some extent on the part of Senator Lynch, that the only method by which the Chairman could have any knowledge whatever of what was happening in the Dáil or amongst members should be by means of communication from the Clerk of one House to the Clerk <Col N="1685" /> of the other.  I respectfully suggest that that was impossible under the circumstances, and that it would be highly undesirable and improper for the Clerk in case action was taken by one portion of either House to send a message that a certain section&mdash;it might be two-fifths&mdash;when it was clear he could have no knowledge of it. The Cathaoirleach would have to deal with a matter which could only properly be conveyed from one House to the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the fact that the duties of the Cathaoirleach are difficult and that often questions come before him without much notice.  He could not put forward that claim in this instance, because when he came to the House he read out his decision. That showed that he had given considerable consideration to the matter, and we felt when the ruling was being read out that it was at variance with what it should have been.  Senator Brown is a very able lawyer, but he made no case for the Cathaoirleach's ruling.  I do not believe anyone could make a case for that ruling.  I am sorry that Senator O'Farrell has left the House as we had a very impassioned advocacy of the Cathaoirleach's ruling from him.  I claim that the chief condemnation of the Cathaoirleach's ruling was Senator O'Farrell's advocacy of it.  The Senator based his arguments on the importance of newspaper reports and of rumours, but in the Committee's Report he supported the insertion of the new Standing Order which in its own way is a condemnation of the action of the Seanad on that occasion, while the Senator also said he should act differently in future.  Senator Milroy, who <Col N="1686" /> stated that he is the leader of a Party here&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator said that he was surprised when he heard the Cathaoirleach's ruling five minutes before the meeting.  That proved that Senator Milroy's Party did not agree with the ruling.  Instead of bettering the position of the Cathaoirleach I think the suggested Standing Order is a condemnation of the way he acted.  The Senator based his case largely on newspaper reports. Senator O'Farrell says that newspaper reports are all-important, but we would be anxious to hear from Senator Brown, when he is replying and making a case for the Cathaoirleach's ruling, how important they are as regards evidence.  We are anxious to hear that, because Senator Brown is a very able lawyer.  The attitude of the 15 members who signed the requisition to have this question brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is fully justified, seeing that there was no precedent for the action taken on that occasion in this or in any other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the merits of this case, but I would like to say that, in my opinion, the greater part of this trouble arose from the fact that a motion in the name of Senator Robinson appeared on the Order Paper to take all stages of the Bill on that day.  That seemed to me, at any rate, to be an indication that the Party supporting the Government had a desire to rush this business. How that motion appeared on the Order Paper I cannot say, inasmuch as it was late on the previous night that the Dáil passed the Bill.  It seems to me that the fault which initiated all this trouble <Col N="1687" /> was in putting either the Bill or the motion&mdash;and particularly the motion for closure&mdash;or whatever it is&mdash;to take all stages on the Order Paper for the next day's business.  I understand from Senator Robinson that he had no desire at all to have all the stages taken that day except to facilitate, as he thought, the desire of the House to dispose of the business.  It is for him to speak on that point, if he wishes.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Comyn, that the possible opposition of a Senator would have the effect of blocking discussion of the closure motion, you, Sir, ruled that that was a misreading of the rules of order.  If that is so I draw attention, so that Senator Brown can deal with it when replying, to paragraph 4 of the Committee's findings:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... This motion lacked the notice strictly required by the Standing Orders, and could only have been taken by general agreement and with the consent of the Cathaoirleach....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this conflicts with your ruling, and the findings of the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which, presumably, will be adopted by the House, would seem to be a direction for future rulings on your part.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell has saved me the trouble of replying to a number of objections that were raised, but there are one or two that I ought to say something about.  With reference to what Senator Johnson has just said, it is true that the Report suggests there must be general agreement and the consent of the Cathaoirleach to a motion such as was put down in the name of Senator Robinson. General consent means the opinion of the majority of the House.</P>

      <P>That is so, but there was the possibility of no member objecting and of the motion that had been put down by Senator Robinson being carried by the House that day.  It was a possibility.  There are only one or two matters that I wish to refer to.  The first is an objection that was made by Senator Comyn and afterwards by my <Col N="1689" /> friend Senator Lynch.  Senator Comyn objected to the Cathaoirleach acting on whispering gossip, and Senator Lynch objected on the ground that the Cathaoirleach ought not to have taken any notice of newspaper reports.  Now, with great respect, it does not matter how it got to the mind of the Cathaoirleach that there was a possibility of a petition by the other House or this House on the question of a Money Bill. It does not matter whether it was through a newspaper or how it occurred to his mind: if, without any prompting of any sort, there being no Standing Order of our own to call his attention to the matter, it occurred to him that this possibility might arise, no matter how it came to his mind, he was bound to give the ruling that he did.  It is not a question of whether it is based on newspaper rumour or gossip of any kind.  It does not matter. Once it came to his mind that this possibility might occur, the Cathaoirleach ought to have made the ruling he did make.</P>
      <P>I should just like to say a few words with reference to the attack&mdash;perhaps I should not call it an attack&mdash;that was made by my old friend, Senator O'Neill, on the Cathaoirleach.  Senator O'Neill accused the Cathaoirleach of taking the Chair and acting as judge in his own case, and all that kind of thing.  I would simply remind my friend the Senator that the Cathaoirleach took the Chair and signed the report in accordance with one of our own Standing Orders.  If he was present there under the circumstances &mdash;he was bound to take the Chair.  The Standing Order concerned is Standing Order 60, which says that, if the Chairman is present, he must be Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

Senator Douglas proposed the resolution, which was carried unanimously, and we were all there, with the will and approval of us all.  There is another matter I should like to refer to, and that is that the Cathaoirleach did not vote.  He gave no decision in his own favour.  He did not vote.  He signed the Report because he was bound to sign it, as Chairman, under the Standing Order.  Senators Lynch and Comyn both stated, very fairly and rightly, at the Committee, that the Cathaoirleach was not on his trial.  He certainly was not.  There was no accusation of any sort against the Cathaoirleach.  We were there simply to decide whether, under all the circumstances, the Cathaoirleach had given the proper ruling within our own Standing Orders, one of them being the one that refers it to him to do the best he can&mdash;to do what he thinks right&mdash;where there is no Standing Order.

It may be the right thing afterwards, perhaps, to go back to it; but, having regard to the criticism of some of the members as to the form of this, and as to the propriety of doing it so near our deathbed, I think that, if the House would allow me, I would ask the House to postpone it generally.</P>

      <P>Section 2.  After the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in line 38, to insert the words &ldquo;or to some other person nominated by such employer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section, &ldquo;out-worker&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a person who for salary or wages does industrial work in his own home or in some other place not under the control or management of his employer on articles given out by or provided at the expense of such employer for delivery to such employer after the doing of such industrial work.&rdquo;  I fear that, under that definition, some employers might take advantage of the drafting to escape their responsibilities as regards the treatment of outworkers.  The amendment covers the case in which delivery would be made to some other person nominated by the employer.  The object of the amendment is to prevent an employer giving out work to an out-worker and arranging that that work be returned to an agent.  I know of cases in which the out-worker is instructed to bring the work, when finished, to a shopkeeper.  Very often, <Col N="1693" /> the out-worker is put in the awkward position of having to give custom to that particular individual in order to obtain the work.  The main reason of the amendment is to prevent such an employer&mdash;I am glad to say that the number is very small&mdash;from defeating the purpose of the Bill in regard to out-workers by the appointment of an agent.</P>

    <P>This amendment and the amendment which follows are part and parcel of the same proposal.  Section 4 enables the Minister to exempt certain employers from the operations of this Bill.  This amendment seeks to provide that they shall not be exempted from the whole provisions of the Bill. As was pointed out on previous stages, the Bill repeals all the effective sections of the Factories Acts and, by exempting any employer from the operations of this Bill, he is exempted from all the restrictions imposed by the Factories Acts.  A particular instance would be a draper's shop which would have a room at the back in which girls would do dressmaking and work generally looked upon as factory work.  Normally, this work would come under the Factories Acts. As matters stand, if any of these girls have to work overtime, a report has to be made before 8 p.m. to the <Col N="1695" /> factory inspector and the various regulations have to be complied with. Under this provision, these girls could be worked indefinite overtime without any report to the factory inspector and without any compliance with the provisions of the Factories Acts.  The intention of these amendments is that where an employer obtains exemption on the ground that he has only a small number of his people engaged on any work that would come within the terms of this Bill, he shall not be exempted in respect of the various matters referred to in the next amendment, such as annual leave, minimum age for the employment of young persons, employment of out-workers, employment on Sundays and public holidays, registration of wages agreements and the provisions relating to penalties for offences.</P>

      <P>There are a few things left.  Since the Minister has thought it necessary to repeal what were considered to be the effective provisions of the Factories Acts which these people presumably had to comply with in the past, I do not see any reason why we should strip bare of rights the workers who will be affected, such as the workers I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>It will help to settle Senator O'Farrell's mind as to the possible consequences of this section if I tell him that the cases in which the power given in the section will be exercised will be very rare.  I certainly do not contemplate that any place where girls are employed in dressmaking or similar work will be affected by this section at all.  The only cases in which the power given under this section will be used will be where the work ordinarily done is commercial work and where it will be more convenient to control the conditions of employment in conjunction with the control exercised over the employment of commercial workers.  I have mentioned the circumstances in which the necessity for the section arose.  Senators will <Col N="1696" /> remember the Woolworth case to which I referred.  It is only in an extreme case of that kind that the power given under this section will be used.  In relation to such employees, who will be very few in number and who are ordinarily engaged in commercial work, I think it is better that conditions of employment should be controlled by another statute relating to commercial employees, which measure will, I hope, be introduced and may become law during the present year.  So that the need for this section is one of administrative convenience only.  It is only to permit a certain extreme case such as the experience of recent years shows might possibly arise to be dealt with.  Nevertheless we deal with that in an exclusion order but it is only in such cases that an exclusion order will be made.  The Minister will have to be satisfied that the amount of work is so small that it is not practical to apply this Act to deal with it and such cases will be very few indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has forgotten that this gives the Minister the power to decide whether an undertaking is so small and what is &ldquo;so small&rdquo;.  It is for the Minister to say, whether an establishment employs one or ten in the concern, that the industrial work is too small for the Act to apply.  It is not what the Minister is now thinking of that matters.  It is what a future departmental adviser may think.  The consideration may be that the Minister for Finance may want to curtail the inspection expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>But the new Dáil may refuse to pass that Act.  The Minister's contention in regard to this, I am afraid, is not covered even by inadvertence.  Taking Woolworth's, for instance, under this amendment it would be possible for Woolworth's to employ a child of ten, say, during school <Col N="1697" /> holidays, to do this class of industrial work done by one person.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says where the amount of any industrial work done is so small.  But the presumption is that it is industrial work. If it is industrial work carried on at Woolworth's, but which the Minister cannot bring the section to bear upon, are we not making it possible for that firm to employ a child under 14 to do that form of industrial work?  I think there is a serious fault in the Bill in that respect.  If it were sure that the Minister's present intention was always going to be carried out, in the administration of this Act, his reference to Woolworth's might work, and it would be a matter of small moment.  But we know that it is not going to be the case.  We know how permission given under an Act with a definite intention, as to how it should be used, can be extended because it is simply convenient to extend it.  I am afraid that unless this matter is tightened up it is going to be a very serious blot on the Act.</P>

      <P>It is very desirable that exemptions, under the Act, should be few and far between.  If the section is left as it is, it is certain that the exemptions will be few.  If the section is amended by the amendments proposed here the probability is that the number of exemptions will be great. I am not saying that the present Minister will be tempted to grant exemptions, so that the workers are protected, more or less.  I suggest to the members of the Labour Party that it is better to leave this matter to be dealt with by the measure which is to be introduced dealing with commercial employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>All this difficulty arises from the fact that our minds are thinking of different matters.  Senator Johnson obviously thinks an industrial concern of the small size is exempt because it is of a small size.  I do not contemplate anything of the kind.  I am thinking of a case that might arise where it may be held, against everybody's wishes, that a class of work done in an undertaking could be described as industrial work.  The concern may not require the services of one of the members of the firm for more than an hour in a week at that particular work.  But if the question is raised the provision dealing with industrial work could be raised.  We think that power should be given to treat the workers concerned in the same way as other exempted workers are treated.  Consequently, the whole purpose of taking this power is to enable any worker that may be excluded to be taken from the category of industrial worker and put into the category of commercial worker, and regulating matters according to the time this is in operation, until legislation dealing with commercial workers is enacted.  Therefore, it is better to leave this as it is rather than to take on the obligation in respect of the very workers who might be affected by exclusion, or to say that the provisions of this Act should apply, whereas we can do it very effectively in the manner I am proposing to do it here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a case such as the Minister has put up of one individual in each shop, so much.  We know from experience that in different commercial concerns, all over the country, carrying on purely commercial business, because of the requirements of that very business it is necessary to keep a certain number of industrial workers engaged in industrial work.  Take the drapery houses, for instance.  They generally employ a carpet layer, two or three milliners and two or three dressmakers. They may employ one or two men tailors.  It appears that these large commercial houses could not be brought within the provisions of the Act so far as this section is concerned. What we are anxious about is this, that between the coming into operation <Col N="1699" /> of this Bill and the bringing in of the other measure dealing with the commercial concerns something should be done to safeguard the position of these particular people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senators require, I take it, is that in so far as it is practicable, having regard to the different nature of the work done in commercial establishments and the work done in industrial establishments, the conditions of employment of commercial workers will correspond to the conditions secured by this Bill for industrial workers.  That is my aim also.  It is merely a matter of effective machinery to secure the realisation of that aim.  I think in dealing with these very rare border-line cases that the most effective way is to have power to take one category and put them into the other, and that this is the most convenient method of administering statutory control over their conditions of employment.  The cases in which that will be done by the power given under this section will be very few indeed, because obviously if the workers concerned feel that an injustice is being done to them, we are going to hear a whole lot about it if their conditions of employment are worsened by the making of an Order.  The only class of workers that I can see affected at all by this are workers who regard themselves as commercial workers and not as industrial workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not support the amendment because it goes too far. I think that a case has been made against the wording of the amendment partly by Senators and partly <Col N="1700" /> by the Minister himself, because he says that the idea is to move them from the one class to the other.  I think that is exactly what he wants to do, but I do not think that is what the section does.  What I want to see is that where there are tailors' or milliners' shops attached to a commercial firm and where a small amount of work is done by employees part of their time, it shall not be deemed to be industrial work.  It would be extremely inconvenient if it were deemed to be industrial work.  I want that kind of work to be deemed to be commercial work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the border-line cases that the Minister speaks of, or with the industrial workers employed in a commercial establishment.  I am concerned at the moment with the worker employed on industrial work by an industrial employer in a small way. There is no question there of commercial work.  The Minister is asking the Legislature to give power to a Minister, whoever that Minister may be, to exempt an employer on the score of his being inconveniently small.  That small employer may be employing three, five or ten industrial workers on industrial work.  There is no question but that they are engaged on industrial work.  Now, the Minister may, under this section, give a licence exempting from all the provisions of this Act any such employer. As regards these classes of workers, the Minister is removing all the protection they have at present. The Minister has told us what is in his mind about this.  He gave Woolworth's as an instance.  But he is taking power to do very much more than he intends.  He is asking the House, in his definition, to give power to a Minister to exempt a small employer, and to remove from the men, women and children in that employment all the protection that they have hitherto received.  That is the danger that I see in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that several times.  Let me take the <Col N="1701" /> definitions.  I find, for instance, in Section 4 that an employer is defined as a person who pays a salary to a worker in consideration of doing any industrial work as defined under Section 3.  If an employer carries on that kind of industrial work and the Minister gives an exemption, then the employer is exempted from the provisions of this measure as a whole. The Minister may grant such a person a licence to employ people and to engage in that form of industrial work while remaining exempt from the provisions of this measure.  I would remind the House that, in this measure, we are repealing Section 62 and Sections 68 to 72 of the Factories and Workshops Act, and the Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act, 1920, in so far as they relate to industrial work as defined here.  It seems to me that you are taking power to nullify that portion of the factory code which has given these people protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it not be possible to say that, where the proportion of any form of industrial work done in the carrying on of any undertaking was so small in relation to its total output it would meet the position?  With that provision you could not take the small industrial undertaking referred to by Senator Johnson.  I must say that I entirely agree with him.  I am sure the Minister has no intention of exempting there, but I think it could be done under this section.  I entirely agree with Senator Johnson that, from the point of view of industrial workers, it is highly undesirable that it should be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The objections which Labour Senators are making to the section, as it stands, would be quite justified if the section applied only where the proportion of industrial work in relation to the total output was not considerable.  Quite a large amount of industrial work might be done by some concerns and nevertheless be a small proportion of the total work done. We are taking the absolute size in this matter, and we say that where the total amount of industrial work is <Col N="1702" /> small that we can grant an exemption. We think that is desirable.</P>

These circumstances will arise very rarely.  I gave an illustration of a case that occurred to my knowledge.  Taking that case as an example, anyone trying to frame such a section could not do better than is done here, and say that where the amount of industrial work done in connection with the carrying on of a non-industrial undertaking is so small that it is not convenient to apply the provisions of this Act to it, then a permit can be given.</P>

Of course they can.</P>

The Bill sets out: &ldquo;Where the amount of any form of industrial work done... is so small that... the provisions of the Act cannot be conveniently applied&rdquo;&mdash;only in these cases can exemption be given.  It is alleged there are hundreds of these undertakings throughout the country, each of them employing a small number of people, but in the aggregate employing quite a number.  Surely it could be argued that under this section it is not convenient to apply the Act for administrative reasons.  The Minister has taken the most extreme case in the country, the case of Woolworths, where a girl is stamping names on cards or on dog collars.

An employer has the right, on a month's notice, to change from St. Stephen's Day to some other day.  In cases where that is done and Christmas Day falls on a Sunday, then the public holiday in respect of Christmas Day is on the 27th December, so that there is a blank day between the two days.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 all relate to the one matter, that is, to give effect to a suggestion made here on the Committee Stage by, I think, Senator Douglas.  Senators will recollect that objection was taken to giving employers power to substitute for any of the six public holidays any of the Church holidays named in the Bill on the ground that that power might be used for the purpose of preventing workers getting a holiday in the summer and giving them a holiday in the winter time instead.  The suggestion was made that, while the power of substitution might be kept, the requirement should be that the substituted holiday should be in the same season of the year.  Therefore, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, where an employer substitutes Easter Monday, Whit Monday and the first Monday in August, it must be for one or other of the following:&mdash;Ascension Thursday, Corpus Christi, 29th June, or 15th August. That limits his power of substitution and ensures that the three holidays will be given during the summer months rather than the winter months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 10.  After the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 38 to insert the words &ldquo;upon being so laid and no sooner shall become operative and shall have effect but&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are touching upon a subject towards which Senator Farren is not friendly.  This is the usual section dealing with laying regulations upon the Table of the Houses.  On the Committee Stage I drew attention to the practice that has recently arisen of delaying the laying of regulations on <Col N="1712" /> the Table in a number of cases, in fact, beyond the time covered by the regulation itself.  I was arguing then in favour of a definite time limit of seven days, within which the Minister would have to lay the regulations on the Table.  In this amendment I am seeking to secure that the regulation shall be laid on the Table but shall not become effective until it is laid.  The object of that form is to meet the problem that arose out of the remarks of Senator Douglas, that no disadvantage or penalty would follow from a failure by the Minister to lay the regulations upon the Table.  Consequently, I think that a very important question has been raised as to the relations of the Minister and the Oireachtas in respect to laws which may be amended by regulations, and, as is shown, even without the knowledge of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If it is permissible for the Minister to defer laying the regulations upon the Table, officially and formally the Oireachtas does not know of the existence of these regulations; consequently, the law may be amended by regulation and nobody made aware of it and yet legally the public would be responsible for carrying out that regulation as provided by the statute. The form of this amendment, therefore, is designed to secure that the regulations shall be laid on the Table as soon as may be, but, to ensure that the Minister shall lay them on the Table, they will not become effective until they are laid upon the Table. That is the intention and it seems to me that some such formula is necessary in view of the difficulty which Senator Douglas pointed out as to the non-effect of a failure by the Minister to lay the regulation upon the Table as required by the statute.  There is nothing at present to show that a regulation would be any less effective if the Minister never laid it on the Table and that seems to me to import a very serious defect.  This is an attempt to remedy that defect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Johnson.  I think this should have been the practice before, and, while I do not want to anticipate another debate, I think that possibly events in the near future make it more essential than ever <Col N="1713" /> that there should be some such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Delays have arisen in a few cases in laying regulations made under various statutes before the Oireachtas.  These delays were occasioned sometimes by exceptional circumstances.  In the majority of cases, so far as I have been able to discover by enquiries I have made, there have been no delays, but if there are delays, I think that grievance should be adjusted by administrative action and not by a limitation of the powers conferred by the measure which are necessary for its proper administration. It would be administratively very difficult if the amendment were inserted in this section and it might very well lead to a ridiculous position in which regulations would be in force merely for a day or two, from the day on which they were laid before the House to the day on which the House passed a resolution objecting to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much better, in my opinion, if that were considered a practicable scheme, to go the whole step and require positive approval by the House of this regulation before bringing it into operation.  That, however, would make the Act very largely a dead letter and any other similar enactment a dead letter.  Therefore, I should have to resist it.  In my opinion, Section 10, which is similar to sections appearing in other measures of this kind, is a practicable method of giving the Oireachtas control over regulations made by Ministers, where the Oireachtas decides that certain things are to be done by regulation rather than in the body of the statute.  Any difficulties that may arise in connection with the actions of particular Ministers in delaying the laying of regulations <Col N="1714" /> should be dealt with by another method.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Minister appreciates the importance of this.  He certainly has not made the point that there is a flaw in the particular formula of the section.  The Minister is empowered to make regulations which have the force of law and the Minister is required to lay those regulations on the Table &ldquo;as soon as may be after they are made.&rdquo;  When asked what the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; is, the Minister said, what most people would believe, that it meant &ldquo;forthwith.&rdquo;  In fact, that word used to appear in this formula, but for some reason or other there has been a change and the phrase is now &ldquo;as soon as may be.&rdquo;  What that means has never yet been defined, but supposing it were said to mean &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; or &ldquo;within seven days&rdquo; and supposing the Minister failed to lay the regulation upon the Table by inadvertence, the regulation is no less effective because of that fact.  In view of the great importance of this procedure of governing by regulation, it is of supreme importance that those regulations, which are in effect Acts of Parliament, shall be brought formally to the notice of the Legislature.  If they are not so brought to the notice of the Legislature and no consequence follows the omission, it seems to me that the powers to make laws by regulation are extended almost indefinitely, and the citizen would be subject to those regulations just as he would be to the statute, without knowledge.  I think it is of immense importance and unless there is an improvement on this formula in my amendment, I think this formula should be inserted.</P>

      <P>11.&mdash;The Minister shall as soon as possible after the expiration of each year prepare and present to each House of the Oireachtas a report of his proceedings under this Act during such year.</P>
      <P>The suggestion contained in the amendment is that a new section should be inserted imposing on the Minister an obligation to prepare and present a report of the proceedings under the Act.  There is a regulation under the Factory Acts whereby the Minister has to present the report of the inspectors to the Houses.  I am not quite sure whether that would still be required, but whether it is or not, it is desirable that the proceedings of the Department under this Act should be reported upon annually, not merely the statistical reports that factory inspectors would present, but general reports would seem to me to be requisite under this kind of legislation.  I am sure the Minister would not object to that.</P>

      <P>I do not question the desirability, from the point of view of a member of the Dáil or Seanad, having such reports furnished, but I am appalled by the size of the task that would be imposed on the Department if the amendment were passed. The proceedings under this Act in the earlier years are likely to be very considerable, and the task of preparing a report of the proceedings any time after the conclusion of the year which would make it of any value, would be so big that it could only be done at the expense of efficiency in other directions, or by a substantial increase in the staff. While I would be willing that the fullest possible report of the proceedings under the Act should be made available, I urge that a statutory obligation to send a report should not be imposed on the Department.  It would be a very big task, having regard to the nature of this legislation, to prepare such a report in a manner that would make it of any value.</P>

      <P>I do not want to impose an undue burden on the Department, but it would seem desirable if the Minister could suggest a form in which reports could be presented periodically; perhaps annually might be too often.  I will not press the matter now, but I suggest that it is desirable there should be some understanding that reports should be made regarding the operation of the Act.</P>

If the Seanad would leave it at that I would look into it.</P>

To add at the end of the sub-section the words: &ldquo;Provided that it shall not <Col N="1717" /> be obligatory on any employer to cease to employ a young person or young persons if the proportion fixed by such regulations is altered because of the temporary absence of any adult worker or workers in his employment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have gone into the matter and I am advised that the absence of a worker through illness, or other temporary cause, would not be deemed termination of employment and would not upset the proportion.  I have come to the conclusion that the amendment is not necessary.  If a worker was dismissed from employment then the provision of the section would operate, but if absence was due to causes which did not mean termination of employment the section, as it stands, means that he would be regarded as still employed for the purposes of calculating the proportion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 16.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 of this Act, no regulation made under this section shall have effect until one month after it is made and until such regulation has been approved by resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recollected that this was one of the most keenly criticised sections by certain Senators, and it is of sufficient importance to have a provision such as is suggested by the amendment inserted instead of the mere negative assent that there shall be definite approval.  Section 10, which would govern regulations made by the Minister in this section, if this amendment were not inserted, would follow the usual course with, of course, the addition of Senator Johnson's amendment, if the Government had accepted it.  Regulations made by the Minister might be laid before the Houses, and no particular public notice might be directed towards <Col N="1719" /> them, as generally happens to many of these things.  The amendment suggests that such regulations shall only become operative after one month, so that those concerned may be able to ascertain their effect and come to a matured decision as to whether they are for the public welfare or not.  At the end of the month they are not to become effective without express resolution of approval by each House.  That is fair and just, and the Minister should see no obstacle to accepting the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the regulation contemplated under Section 16 should be put in a different position to regulations under any other section of the Bill.  Whatever case could be made for exceptional treatment for such a regulation could be made equally forcibly in respect of any other section.  The general principle is to provide in the ordinary way that regulations shall be made and come into effect upon the date prescribed, and may be annulled by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas.  The particular regulation arising from this section should be treated in the same way.  I could not agree that there are any special circumstances affecting persons likely to be concerned in such a regulation that do not apply equally forcibly to persons concerned with other regulations.</P>

      <P>I consider that to vote for this amendment would be only stabilising this very regrettable section, by bringing what the Minister does into the House, and getting people here to say whether the quota is right or wrong.  Now, the whole thing is, to me, very bad from the beginning, and I do believe that the two Senators who have put their names to this amendment, and who are so very well known, of course, for their interest all the time in women and women's equality in general, were led to believe by their well known interest in such matters that they were doing something to benefit the female workers who would be put out of this <Col N="1720" /> quota.  I can assure the Senators concerned that most women do not want this amendment, because we do not want groups of men here and groups of men there to consider whether the quota is right or not.  It is bad enough as it is.  Leave it so. Leave it to the Minister and, for goodness' sake, do not pass such an amendment as this.  I am sorry the Senators did not consult the people they are in the habit of working with on matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>Well, Sir, the hidden effect of the suggestion is that I would probably be able to deduce the real meaning better than any other member of the House.  However, this is not a matter upon which one would require to be a specialised expert in trade unionism in order to understand what the implications are.  A new departure in the control and regulation of employment, discriminating between male and female labour, is being introduced into this Bill.  It is undoubtedly a new phase.  It is an experiment, and I say, whether one is specially interested in and can speak for a section of workers who are affected or not, one can state an intelligent view, and one can be aware that an experimental provision of this kind deserves very careful handling. A provision of the kind suggested enables people, who are concerned with the interests of such people and with employment generally, to consider well that the regulations which the Minister makes are such as would meet with the approval of the House. I certainly cannot find any substance of argument in the contention of Senator Mrs. Wyse Power that the insertion of this provision is any reflection on the people for whom she <Col N="1721" /> spoke so staunchly on the amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from Senator Mrs. Wyse Power that the people who are interested in this section, and who would oppose it in the event of an Order being made under it, would prefer a policy of hush-hush and would be opposed to the matter having to be debated in the Dáil, as, I presume, there will be only one House by that time?  If that is the case, I do not think the Senator is right; but certainly, judging by the visits I have received from many people in connection with this matter, they did not desire hush-hush, but, on the contrary, wanted all the publicity they could get on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that both the Senators, whose names are to the amendment, are misrepresenting in a sense what the amendment proposes. There is no suggestion in the Bill that any regulation made under it will not be given the fullest possible publicity; but if there is general agreement between the parties concerned that such a regulation should be made &mdash;and in the majority of cases, if not all, there will be general agreement between all the interested parties that a particular regulation should be made&mdash;is there any reason, nevertheless, why it should not come into effect until it is positively approved of here in this House or in the Dáil by a resolution which, in order to secure its passage, might have to be supported by, perhaps, a statement of considerable length giving the details of the circumstances in a particular industry?  Very often the considerations that will prompt the making of a regulation under that section will be technical considerations of a difficult kind where the average persons would not be competent to make a decision and where a decision will be arrived at after consultation with the representatives of the workers and the representatives of the employers concerned and with the agreement of both sides.  In such circumstances there is no need to have this requirement that the regulation cannot come into force until <Col N="1722" /> there has been a positive motion of approval by the Oireachtas.  Where there is disagreement, and where one or other of the parties concerned disapprove of the provisions of the regulation concerned, the machinery provided under the Bill can be operated, and no doubt will be operated, because in such a case representations will be made to individual Senators or to particular parties to come forward with a motion of disapproval.  In such circumstances, of course, there should be discussion and justification or otherwise of the regulation concerned. The Senators' amendment, however, is designed to secure that that motion must be carried even if all the parties concerned are in agreement with the regulation and want it brought into force as quickly as possible.</P>

In other sections of the Bill we require consultation with the representatives of employers and the representatives of workers before regulations are made. That is not provided for in relation to this section for two reasons: firstly, the practical difficulty of getting representatives of the out-workers to consult, and, secondly, the practical certainty that their views and the views of the employers in relation to this matter are going to coincide and that, consequently, nothing is to be gained by this consultation.  In practice, however, the Senator may be <Col N="1723" /> assured that consultation will take place with the employers before such a regulation is made.  I think it is undesirable, however, to have that a statutory obligation in the same form as a statutory obligation imposed by other sections, because it might create difficulties in the implementation of the section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was carried over from last stage, and its object is one of which I am still in favour.  I want the holidays at the end of the first year to be in the summer of 1936.  I <Col N="1725" /> am still afraid that there will be a number of holidays to be given early and, therefore, not at the time most suitable from that point of view.  I indicated before that I was not going to try to get a majority of the House to carry this amendment.  The Minister has got to administer the Act, and I merely want to warn him.  The holidays must be given within three months.  If the Minister succeeds in getting the Act into force at an early date, the holidays will have to be given within the three succeeding months.  In the case of trades where holidays have been given in the past, that will be a matter of very little importance.  It is only in the case where the holiday is an absolutely new thing that the matter will be of importance.  I really do think that it would be wise to have a definite date in the Bill in preference to the date of the coming into force of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give no definite indication at this stage as to when the Act can be brought into operation. That, in itself, is an argument against putting a definite date in the Bill in relation to a provision of this kind.  Delays which cannot be foreseen at the moment may arise and they might render inoperative any such provision.  In any event, the obligation to give holidays within three months arises only, in this connection, when the employment year of a particular worker expires within a month of the date of the coming into force of the Act.  In that case, the holiday must be given within the three months following.  Only a small minority of workers in any concern will be affected by that provision&mdash; workers whose employment year will expire during that period of one month.  In relation to other workers, there will be a twelve months period during which holidays can be given.</P>

      <P>The amendments relating to the printing and publishing of newspapers are designed to take that form of work out of the provisions of the Bill relating to hours.  The reason why an amendment to Section 31 is not necessary is because the printing and publishing of newspapers has been excluded from Section 38 and Section 31 has no meaning except in relation to Section 38.  It is Section 38 which imposes the obligation to cease work at 1 p.m. on the short day.  As the printing and publishing of newspapers is excluded from Section 38, this work is also excluded from Section 31.  I looked into the matter carefully.</P>

As a matter of symmetry, it does seem rather absurd that there is nothing in Section 31 to make clear that it does not apply to people exempted from Section 38.  As a matter of practice, I am disposed to agree with the Minister, but I suggest that there is that peculiar anomaly, that while you have not to give a holiday, you must, under Section 31, fix a date.</P>

    <P>This amendment is designed to make clear that the section does not apply to the printing and publishing of newspapers. The section makes shift work <Col N="1728" /> unlawful except in relation to a continuous process or under licence.  In the printing of daily newspapers, there are what are called &ldquo;shifts&rdquo; and some confusion might arise if this amendment were not inserted.

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 44.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  It shall be a good defence to any proceedings taken against any employer for a breach of the provisions of this section if such employer proves to the satisfaction of the court that reasonable care was taken by him or his agents to ascertain the facts and that he did not knowingly commit an offence under the section.</P>
      <P>This amendment, in a different form, came up on Report Stage.  I consulted a prominent legal member of the House, and he was of opinion that while in almost all certainty the penalty in this case would be extremely small, nevertheless, in such a case, there would be a breach of the section.  I am concerned in preventing prosecutions where there is no need for them.</P>

      <P>I also discussed this with the legal advisers of the Government, and it appears that if we inserted the word &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; by any device, in the section we would probably make it inoperative.  The decision I came to was that it was best to rely upon administrative discretion to see that no unreasonable action was taken, and, secondly, to rely upon the fact that the courts will accept what is a good defence put <Col N="1729" /> forward.  If a prosecution is brought the obligation to show that in any event the offence was not committed knowingly is undesirable.  In the circumstances, I feel it is better to leave the section as it is.</P>

      <P>I am personally not very interested, nor am I speaking on behalf of any firm in which I have an interest.  But there seems to be some uneasiness about this matter.  As far as I can see in most cases, except where the worker is of a doubtful character, the employer will be satisfied if he gets a statement from him. If he is a man that had made false statements before, then I do not think it would be exercising reasonable care to take him at his word. In practice, a man who works part of the week is not going to get any more work if the employer has to get practical proof as to the time he already worked.  It can only be worked at all if there is a certain amount of good faith.  There is going to be difficulty, and this section will not be easy to administer except on the basis I have indicated.  I may have failed to provide words that are satisfactory.  I am not much concerned about the word &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; and I appreciate what the Minister said.  I cannot press this case against what he said.  I recognise the section must be included in the Act, or otherwise there will be abuse; but I do not think the Minister has put it in a satisfactory form.  I think the amendment I put down would avoid the Minister's objection.  If he says he has taken legal opinion, of course I cannot dispute that.  I can only say that an employer who has given a man a job, in good faith, will be guilty of an offence if the section stands as it is , so I leave the matter to the House.</P>

      <P>What the Senator wishes to provide for is where the industrial workers are in more than one place.

      <P>(6)  Any employer who permits a worker to whom this Act applies to remain in a room in which any form of industrial work is carried on during any part of the time allowed for meals shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment only seeks to continue what already exists under the Factories Acts.  It was found useful, and necessary, and we believe it is desirable that it should be embodied in the present Bill.  It is not desirable that people should be taking their meals while industrial work is going on in the same room.  That has been embodied in the Factory Act, and we see no reason why it should not be embodied in this measure.</P>

      <P>The only answer I have to what the Senator has said is that such a provision does not belong to this Bill.  It belongs to the Factory and Workshops Act, and it is undesirable that any health provision should be inserted in this Conditions of Employment Bill when a Bill to codify and amend the Factory and Workshops Act will be introduced next <Col N="1732" /> month embodying whatever recommendations we think are necessary to alter the law in that respect.  The present law, of course, is being repealed.  The Senator's point is that the present law makes a similar provision in respect to women and young persons, but the amendment goes further than the present law.  Whatever gap may exist in the law will be of short duration, and I think it is undesirable that we should change the basis of the statutes merely in order to provide against the very slight possibility that the existing practice will be deliberately interrupted during a couple of months in this establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the possible effect of sub-section (5) which on an earlier stage he said he would look into.  It seems to me that under the meaning of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; if a factory provided a suitable meal room, which in a country place is highly desirable, the workers in that room would be deemed to have been on the premises during the period in the middle of the day because it is all the one premises. The Minister said that he would look into that.  It seems to me that it should be quite sufficient if, during the period for meals, the workers wished to make use of the facilities inside the general premises they <Col N="1733" /> should be allowed to do so.  I am afraid the effect of the sub-section will prevent them from doing that.</P>

      <P>Separate premises do not necessarily mean a separate group of buildings or a separate building. You could have two or three premises for the purposes of this measure inside the one building.

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 57.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister makes regulations or grants a licence or permit under this Act in respect of a particular form of industrial work, he may in such regulations, licence or permit (as the case may be) <Col N="1736" /> specify that such provisions of this Act as may to him appear proper shall continue to apply to work performed in connection with such form of industrial work or in any undertaking in which such form of industrial work is carried on and every such regulation, licence or permit (as the case may be) shall be construed and have effect subject to such conditions as may be so specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that Section 57 gives power to the Minister to specify the form of work which shall be exempt in the provisions of this measure as well as the classes of work performed. Under this Bill certain protections for women and children provided by the Factories Acts are being repealed.  As this particular section confines the Minister to limiting an individual doing a particular class of work in a factory under the provisions of this Bill, it seems to me the women and children have not the minimum of protection that they had under the Factories Acts.  My amendment will give power to the Minister to make such provision under this Act as may to him appear proper.  I believe it is necessary that the new sub-section should be added to Section 57, as otherwise the Minister will not have power to give the protection to the women and children in industry at present secured to them by the Factories Acts and which will be repealed on the passage of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as that is so it relates to hours of work, the hours during which such persons may be employed.  An earlier section, Section 52, provides that where the Minister makes regulations excluding any form of industrial work from any part of the Act dealing with hours of work, he can fix such conditions as seem to him necessary in order to protect the interests of the workers concerned. That is covered by Section 52 (1).  If we, by regulation, exclude any form of work from the provisions of this Act relating to hours of work, we can by further regulation prescribe hours of work which will have the same statutory effect in respect of any class of workers or any form of work named in <Col N="1737" /> that order.  That, I think, gets over the difficulty of the repeal of certain sections of the existing Act in relation to the class of workers affected by the exclusion regulations.</P>
      <P>That section also permits of reductions being made in the hours of work of industrial workers more than is effected by the general provisions of the measure and that will be, in fact, mainly operated in order to ensure that the 48-hour week will be the maximum week and by stages a shorter maximum week will be instituted.  I do not think the danger the Senator referred to in relation to exclusion regulations can arise.  The existing Factories and Workshops Code deals mainly with health and safety regulations.  They are not being affected and will not be until the new Factories and Workshops Act becomes law.  In so far as they relate to hours of work, Section 52 gives power to make special regulations in order to protect the interests of those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that under the Factories Act it is illegal to employ children under 12 years of age to work at night or to employ women in certain industries.  It seems to me that the Minister has not power to stipulate that women and children should not be employed in certain industries and at certain hours&mdash;he has not power in respect of children under 12 or women working on Sundays in certain industries.</P>

      <P>(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 of this Act no regulation made under this section shall have effect until one month after it is made and until such regulation has been approved by resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This and the next amendment are more or less the same and the arguments behind them are somewhat similar.  Under this section the Minister is given very wide powers to demand certain returns.  I think there is no limit to the returns he can demand.  He can ask for returns that might be futile to the business man but might be regarded as of great importance to the officials.  For instance, the Minister's Department might want the number of red-headed men or women in a particular firm&mdash; I merely use that statement to indicate that certain peculiar returns might be requested.  I think we should be given time to consider the subject-matter of the orders that will be made before they become operative and I suggest they should not become operative until there is a resolution of approval passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it to the Senator that what the Bill already provides in that respect is really more reasonable.  It comes before the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas is given power to annul any regulation if they think a mistake has been made, or that powers are being used excessively.  There is no reason why we should impose on the Oireachtas the obligation of discussing and passing a resolution if everybody is satisfied and no complaint has been made.  We are merely asking power to get certain statistical returns.  The utilisation of that power will be determined more largely by the efficiency and the size of the statistical machine of the Department.  The existing Statistics Branch is so fully occupied <Col N="1739" /> with the work it has now on hands that it could not undertake to do any more statistical work.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular matters covered by Section 63, the position has been that for years past most of the industrial firms in the country have been making voluntary returns dealing with the numbers employed, the wages paid and certain matters of that kind. That system of voluntary returns worked quite satisfactorily until recently, when there was an increase in the number of industrial concerns, and certain other factors resulted in growing delays in getting returns in time and very frequently in inability to get them from certain concerns.  If there are 12 firms engaged in an industry, and you want statistics in relation to that industry, ten firms may voluntarily give the information you require, but if the other two do not give the information, what you have got is of no value to you.  The statistics can only be of value when associated with the figures of all the concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are taking this power to require the making of returns which, in the past, the great majority of firms have made voluntarily.  It is to ensure that our periodic reports relating to employment and wages in particular industries will be more accurate than they have been.  For some time past we had to cease publishing these returns because they had become only estimates which were very frequently known to be incorrect, due to the fact that particular concerns had not undertaken the voluntary obligation of supplying the information.  It is desirable to have these powers and it is desirable, I think, that the Oireachtas should have the right to step in and stop their use if they think the powers have been abused and that unreasonable obligations are being imposed upon employers.  But that is as far as we should go.  I do not think it is necessary to provide that the powers cannot be used at all until a resolution has been adopted in the Dáil and Seanad.  Most of the orders made under this section will be of trivial importance and need not necessarily occupy the time of the Legislature <Col N="1740" /> unless some individual member has had representations made to him that some firms have suffered a grievance.</P>

      <P>There is a little difference between the previous amendment which Senator Milroy withdrew and this, because in reference to the matter of the previous amendment there is provision for agreement.  The Minister mentioned that in the other cases orders would be made only if there were agreement.  In this case there will be no consultation or agreement. The Minister will simply take action.  If the matter were confined to the voluntary returns it would be all right, but there is wide power in this requiring returns which might be very onerous on the employers if the order were made. The Minister would issue the order and then it might be extremely difficult for the Oireachtas to take any action.  As a matter of fact, it would be in the nature of a censure on the Department if action were then to be taken.  On the other hand one sees that if there were to be numerous orders it might be difficult to require each one to be separately approved of by the two Houses.  In the one case, when the Minister examined the matter he made one comprehensive order.  This might not have to be varied appreciably but once in a year or so&mdash;or say at very wide intervals. I think this is a matter that ought to be specifically approved of by the Dáil.  I think it would not require a great deal of discussion in the ordinary way.  It would be passed after a brief statement by the Minister. I do not know whether the Minister contemplates whether there would be a great mass of separate orders covering different matters or whether statistical requirements only would be met.  But if it could be possible to make a comprehensive order an order would be made which would stand for a considerable time.  On the whole everything is in favour of getting the order accepted specifically by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Up to the present we have been getting half-yearly returns, voluntarily, from protected industries. I would like to have these returns on <Col N="1741" /> a more secure basis.  What we contemplate is to require persons to make returns on the 1st September and the 1st April each year and it would be obviously unnecessary to come every half year to the Dáil with a resolution prescribing these returns, particularly as these returns are less onerous than the returns we are getting voluntarily at present.  We would be requiring these returns from a limited number of firms.  These returns are made at present under the Census of Production. These are, of course, confined to the larger firms who are in a much better position to supply the statistical returns than are the smaller firms.  But it is in relation to the smaller firms that we require the statutory power, because the absence of these returns makes it impossible for us to publish the information from the larger firms, or if we do publish that information it makes it of little value.  It would be only where a new departure in statistics would be embarked upon that the Dáil would be really concerned in the matter, but such a departure is not contemplated.</P>
