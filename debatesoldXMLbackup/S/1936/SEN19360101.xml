    <P>(1)  In order to remove doubts, it is hereby declared and enacted that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  every deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund arising (whether before or after the passing of this Act) by reason of the non-payment of purchase annuities is a charge on the Guarantee Fund and may lawfully be paid and made good out of that fund to the Purchase Annuities Fund at such time or times and in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall, either generally or in respect of any particular case, direct; and</P>
    <P>(b)  sub-section (4) of Section 6 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, as amended or extended by subsequent enactments, and all regulations made under that sub-section (as so amended or extended) for the time being in force apply and have effect in relation to every payment out of the Guarantee Fund to the Purchase Annuities Fund made for the purpose of making good any such deficiency as is mentioned in the next preceding paragraph of this section in like manner and in all respects as the said sub-section (as so amended or extended), and the said regulations apply to a payment made out of the Guarantee Fund to the Purchase Annuities Fund for the purpose of making good any such deficiency as is mentioned in sub-section (1) of the said Section 6.</P>
    <P>(2)  Such deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund as is mentioned <Col N="1594" /> in the foregoing sub-section of this section shall be deemed to have arisen whenever (whether before or after the passing of this Act) the amount received by the Irish Land Commission on or before any 31st day of January or 31st day of July in respect of instalments of purchase annuities payable into the Purchase Annuities Fund which accrued due in the half-year ending on such 31st day of January or 31st day of July (as the case may be) falls short of the full amount of all such instalments.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 18 the words and brackets &ldquo;whether before or after the passing of this Act)&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this recommendation, as of the others appearing on the Order Paper in my name, is to deprive the Bill of its retrospective character.  Perhaps these particular recommendations may not be the best way to achieve that purpose, but, if the Government is wise enough to reconsider the matter, it would be possible for them to devise some other method to do it which would be more effective.  I think the Government ought very seriously to consider the proposals put forward in these recommendations.  As was said yesterday, retrospective legislation may be necessary, from time to time, but it is something to be avoided.  I do not think we can take the Minister's point of view that this Bill is intended simply to make clear the intention of the Dáil. Take the phraseology used in the Bill about removing doubts.  That is only implied because the courts have not yet given a decision and so, from the Government point of view, legislation may not, in the end, prove to be necessary.  If they had waited the decision of the courts and it was adverse, the Bill would still be in the same form except in the opening words, and it could not be considered anything different from any other legislation going through the Oireachtas, and not something put there in a special way for the guidance of the court.  Therefore <Col N="1595" /> we have to ignore the opening words of the section in considering this matter and face the thing as a definite act of retrospective legislation. Nothing has been put forward by the Minister that would prove it to be necessary to legislate retrospectively in this matter, and especially to justify retrospective legislation in the peculiar circumstances of this case.</P>
    <P>Some of the retrospective legislation that has taken place in the past was in defence of our own courts.  That matter has been fully discussed.  The legislation dealing with the Privy Council, although retrospective in form, was for the purpose of preventing the Privy Council upsetting a decision of the Supreme Court here, and was quite different from any legislation that might be directed against our own courts.  This coming in in the middle of litigation has a peculiarly objectionable flavour.  It is much more objectionable than if the Government had waited until the courts had given their decision and then frankly reversed it on the basis of the various arguments the Minister has used.  I think when the case is at hearing in the courts, when the contest has begun. as it were, for the Minister to step in to alter the rules in his own favour is something that is going to have very many reactions, and is going to tend very seriously to undermine the respect in which the courts ought to be held, and is going to undermine the reputation of the State for fair play. Senator Johnson referred to that yesterday.  There is the question of defending and maintaining the credit of the State.  There is also the question of maintaining the character of the State for justice and scrupulous regard for the rights of individuals or a group of individuals who may comprise a particular corporation.  When the Government comes in in the somewhat brusque and brutal way in which it intervenes in this Bill, it is going to make litigants who might be advised that they have a claim against the State feel that it is not worth while promoting that claim.  It has already been said that the intention of the Oireachtas must be taken to be expressed in its Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> While it is quite right constitutionally, I should say, for the Government to come in at any point with proposals to make the meaning of the Oireachtas clearer, it is the duty of the Government to consider whether it is expedient, taking the long view, to do so, and whether the impression of governmental disregard for certain types of public decency created by action of this sort may not have serious reactions in future.  It is not as if the Government had to take this drastic and, I think, unprecedented action because, as I have already said, it differs from any other item of retrospective legislation which has been before the Oireachtas.  Nothing that has been put forward would justify it.  In fact, in the Minister's speech yesterday he seemed to me to prove that it is not necessary that the retrospective side of this Bill should be insisted upon.  He did declare that if this £716,000 were not kept back from the county councils it would have to be met out of general taxation and that a large portion of it would fall on people in counties where there was practically no deficiency, on people who were not concerned with agriculture and who had not in any way benefited from land purchase.  He said that they would have to bear a large share of it, but in another part of his speech the Minister told us that over £1,000,000 arrears had been collected in the eight months up to February and March last.  He said that of that sum he reckoned that £1,000,000 had been collected in cash, showing that those who owed the money were well able to pay.</P>
    <P>If the people who have defaulted are well able to pay then it only remains for the Government to use the machinery at their disposal and they will pay and, therefore, instead of this £716,000 falling largely on people who paid their annuities and who individually owe no debt to anybody, the whole of the amount will be collected off those by whom it is due. That seems to me to be a much better way of dealing with the matter than carrying through this retrospective legislation and non-suiting the councils who have brought the Government into the courts, or better than throwing <Col N="1597" /> the deficiency on general taxation.  If, on the other hand, as we contend, most of those who owe the money are not able to pay, it is just as well that the Minister should make an effort to get the money from them and that the position should be made clear beyond all doubt, because if they are not able to pay, then whether the burden falls on the general community or is dealt with in some other way, it is certainly unwise for the Minister to pass the debts of those who have failed to pay on to the shoulders of their neighbours who are almost in the same position. If the people cannot pay this burden should not be thrown on the rates. Rather than shake the confidence of litigants as to the way in which they will be treated by the Government, he should take all the steps he can take to recover the money.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that in all the circumstances it is undesirable to pass this section as it stands with retrospective effect and it is, furthermore, unnecessary.  It is unnecessary even in counties in which the deficiency from the point of view of preventing injustice to people is small, because if the Minister's contention is right, and if £1,000,000 arrears was collected in eight months, it will require less than that period with the machinery at the Minister's disposal to clear off the sum that is involved here.  If that is done, and the Minister's contention is right, there is neither hardship nor injustice done to anybody.  If the Minister's contention is not right, then the matter that has been in dispute and the subject of a good deal of discussion will be disposed of and the Government and the Dáil can face, in the light of full knowledge, the problems that are now arising in connection with the collection of land annuities.</P>

      <P>It is very interesting to me, a lawyer of some years' experience, to hear a gentleman, who is not a practising lawyer, at all events, express opinions on a subject of profound legal theory.  Senator Blythe said that this is retrospective legislation. I deny it is retrospective legislation.  In order to ground his argument he asks you to strike out <Col N="1598" /> from this Bill these first lines&mdash;&ldquo;In order to remove doubts, it is hereby declared and enacted.&rdquo;  Of course if you do that, and if you assume that under existing law the Guarantee Fund is not liable to make good defaults, if you assume everything he asks you to assume, then, of course, the little argument&mdash;I say that respectfully&mdash;which he founded on it is clear enough, but I make no such assumption.  I submit that under existing law the Guarantee Fund is liable and that this is nothing more or less than a Bill to remove doubts. They are very flimsy doubts, but doubts have arisen because certain organised gentlemen have brought a case in the courts, and it is not desirable that a matter affecting the general taxation of the country should be held up until a decision is taken in the courts.  The simple doubt is this, that certain adventurous gentlemen in County Cork have brought an action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of sea lawyers asking me questions.  There were some examples, some terrible examples of retrospective legislation in this country.  I remember on one occasion that, as a result of an application made by me to the courts, 7,000 men were declared illegally arrested and illegally detained.  I remember a Bill being brought into the Dáil, and rushed through the Dáil and the Seanad in one day, to keep these men in prison, 7,000 of them.  That was retrospective legislation.  The ex-Minister <Col N="1599" /> for Finance, Senator Blythe, knows something about retrospective legislation.  This is not retrospective legislation.  It is what it purports to be&mdash;a Bill to remove doubts.  I say there is no doubt.  Some gentlemen organised in County Cork say, or pretend, there is a doubt, but their opinion is contrary to mine.  There are many examples of this kind of legislation. I think, without going back too far, that I could find in the Statute Book, 20 or 30 Acts of Parliament which were obviously and absolutely intended to remove doubts.  What doubts?  Not doubts as to what was expressed in speeches in Parliament, but doubts as to the meaning of the legislation as expressed in the Acts of Parliament.  I am glad to see that Senator Brown agrees that that is the doubt&mdash;a doubt as to the meaning of the Act of Parliament, not a doubt as to what is the meaning intended by the Deputies or Senators who are sometimes saying exactly what they think and sometimes probably using arguments in which they do not exactly believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Act of Parliament and I am interrupted. I must be rubbing something very closely.  What is his recommendation? Senator Johnson is interrupting here.  Senator Johnson is also a sea-lawyer. I use that expression in a most respectful sense.  Here is the recommendation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  To delete the words and brackets &ldquo;(whether before or after the passing of this Act).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> Have sensible Senators considered what would be the effect of that deletion?  Suppose now that Senator Blythe is right.  Suppose that at the present moment there is no charge on the Guarantee Fund, what would be the result of the Dáil accepting Senator Blythe's recommendation?  The men who have paid their annuities have paid them and they can get nothing out of the recommendation.  If Senator Blythe's view of the law, as it at present exists, is correct, are the men who have not paid in the counties in which there is grave default going to get away with it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the suggestion. We suggest that the Minister should collect from the men who owe the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the men who have not paid their annuities to get away with what they owe?  Suppose there is confusion in the mind of such a clear thinking person as Senator Johnson himself&mdash;suppose there is default of £750,000 for a year.  That is not lost. These annuities will be collected sometime and they will come into the accounts again.  I cannot help thinking that all this marshalling of forces that has gone on, and all these debates that have taken place, are unreal.  I suggest, or I cannot help thinking, that it is playing at politics from beginning to end.  It was the intention of Parliament, as expressed in the statute in 1933, that the Guarantee Fund should be responsible for any default in the payment of the land annuities.  That I think is clear in the Act of Parliament itself.  I do not refer to any speeches that were made on any side of the House.  That was the intention of Parliament, and this is an Act of Parliament to place that intention so clearly before the mind and to put it so much beyond all doubt that even the organised opponents of the Government will not be able to raise a case upon it again or to bring an action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue the case from the legal point of view, but one statement of Senator Comyn's strikes me as being very wide of the mark.  The Senator said that if <Col N="1601" /> this recommendation is passed the people who have not paid their annuities will get away with it.  They will get away with nothing.  The money will still be owing, it will be collected and it will come into the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I say they have got a loan of this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to let this £750,000 stand until times get better, because the farmers are not able to pay at present. The Minister told us yesterday that the farmers in Cork and other counties are now paying in cash at their doors since the sheriff was put on&mdash;they are paying when the sheriff calls for it, and he said that the reason for that is that they were organised previously and that there was a conspiracy not to pay the annuities.  I deny that statement entirely.  The reason why the farmers are paying now is that the times have somewhat improved.  For the past six or seven months, owing to the coal-cattle pact, they are able to sell their cattle.  They are able to sell them because we are able to send so many extra cattle to the English market, thanks to the pact.  It is not because we are able to send them to Germany or Belgium or anywhere else.  England is taking more of them since the coal-cattle pact.  We on this side welcomed that pact, though a good many Fianna Fáil representatives denounced it.  However, the farmers of the country are glad that that pact was made, and we are thankful as representing the farmers that it was entered into.  That is the principal reason why the farmers throughout the country are able to pay the annuities now better than they were some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this recommendation, and I cannot understand how Senator Comyn or any Senator who claims to represent the farming community can vote against it.  Indeed I do not see how any Senator who has an interest in the farming community could vote against it.  What the recommendation simply means is that the Government will give a loan to the farmers of this £750,000 until better times come along. The principal argument used by the Minister is that some wealthier counties are not paying and that they <Col N="1602" /> should be made pay because, as he says, the poorer farmers in the poorer counties are paying.  His contention is that they are paying because they are honest farmers.  I respectfully submit that the Minister does not understand the situation which exists in the counties to which he refers.</P>
    <P>Senator Toal gave us some of the reasons why the farmers in the poorer counties, like Monaghan, were able to pay.  I think it is very invidious to be making comparisons between farmers in one county and another but, as the matter has been referred to, I should like to give a further illustration of why the farmers in the poorer counties are able to pay and why it is not so distressing for them to pay their annuities as it is for farmers in what he calls the wealthier counties of the Saorstát.  Since the present Government came into power thousands of pounds have been allotted to those counties for relief works.  The employment on those relief works was given mainly to farmers' sons in those counties.  In every farmer's house, or in the majority of them, at all events, in the West there are two and sometimes three and four people drawing the old age pension.  In addition to the farmers' sons working on the relief works and drawing good wages they were getting free beef.  It would not be a very great hardship on those people to put their old age pensions or the money they were getting from being employed on these relief works by for a week or two and that would pay the whole amount of their annuities for a year because, as Senator Toal pointed out, in the majority of these cases the whole amount of the annuity would be only £3 or £4. Together with that, as Senator Toal also pointed out, there is a great deal of smuggling in the Border counties. Consequently, there is a good deal of competition for the stock which they have to sell and they are able to sell them because they can be smuggled across the Border and no duty paid.</P>
    <P>The people in County Cork, at any rate, up to the time of the coal-cattle pact, could not get rid of their fat cattle without a licence and the licences were so restricted that the <Col N="1603" /> cattle had to be taken home from fair after fair as there was no buyer for them.  Consequently, they could not get any money to meet the demands for annuities, rates, or any other purpose. That is the reason why they were not able to pay.  I have pointed out that in the other counties the circumstances are very different, and I say that they are not more honest than the people who were not able to pay.  The fact is that the counties which were the more prosperous before the economic war have now become the less prosperous counties and the people are not able to pay.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister, no matter how he may be able to get this Bill to collect this £750,000 from the farmers, to leave it over until times get better, and if he will give the farmers time they will pay up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the House accepted the principle of this Bill, the purpose of which is to remove doubts. The acceptance of the recommendation now proposed I submit, would create doubts.  It would create doubts in the minds of the court as to whether the intention of the Oireachtas in 1933 was precisely the same as it is to-day.  If the court sees this statute confined in its application to a period subsequent to its passage what must the court conclude but that it has made some change in the existing condition of affairs.  As the purpose of the Bill is to make clear to the court that the intention of the Oireachtas was in 1933 and is to-day to make the Guarantee Fund liable for any deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund that is why I say the House would stultify itself if it accepts the recommendation which Senator Blythe proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we make it clear in precise terms that this Bill does not alter or <Col N="1604" /> change what the Oireachtas has thought the position always to be in regard to the Fund, what else can the court conclude but that some change has been made by the Oireachtas in the Guarantee Fund procedure and that that change has been made in consequence of a change of intention on the part of the Oireachtas? If the new statute will do no more than make it clear beyond doubt that the Guarantee Fund, only after the date of the enactment of this statute, is liable for any deficiency which may arise in the Purchase Annuities Fund, what can the court be impelled to conclude but that prior to the passage of this new law the intention of the Oireachtas was that the Guarantee Fund should not be so liable? Therefore, I say that the acceptance of this recommendation is not consistent with the principle of the Bill, because I believe it would create doubts in the minds of the court as to what the intention of the Oireachtas in regard to the Guarantee Fund is and always has been.</P>
    <P>We are asked to accept this because we must not shake the confidence of litigants by altering the rules&mdash;we must not shake the confidence of litigants as to the way in which they will be treated by the Government. There is an equally important public consideration involved also and that is that those who receive benefits from the Government shall honour the conditions upon which those benefits are given.  Who are these litigants when you analyse them?  Who are the people who have been responsible for initiating these proceedings?  They are themselves defaulting annuitants; they are men who have not paid; they are men for the most part who have persuaded other people not to pay. The vice-chairman of this Cork County Council&mdash;Mr. D.L. O'Gorman&mdash;is a leading figure in this agitation in County Cork.  He is not a person who has withheld the payment of his annuity because of his inability to pay.  He is a gentleman who, when the sheriff approached him, was found to be in the possession not merely of one but two motor cars, and who produced his cheque book and paid on the nail.</P>

      <P>Another member of this county council&mdash;one of the people who voted to initiate these proceedings, one of the people who is concerned now to break the bond under which the Cork County Council became entitled to £227,000 of Exchequer moneys as a grant in relief of rates in Cork County&mdash;is Mr. Brooke-Brasier, who served a term of imprisonment for the part which he took in this conspiracy to prevent the payment of land annuities.  A third is a member of the Dáil, a person who was in receipt of an allowance out of public funds.  These are the men whose votes and whose arguments and whose coercion have induced other members of the Cork County Council to agree with them that these proceedings should be launched.  They come before the Courts in a dual capacity&mdash;in a triple capacity.  They are, at once, defaulting annuitants, organisers of a campaign to prevent other people from paying their annuities, and the persons who will have to take the consequences next year of striking a higher rate in County Cork in order to make good the damage which they, and those associated with them, have done to the Cork County Council.  Where is the injustice in non-suiting these men? Where is the injustice in non-suiting such a man as Mr. D.L. O'Gorman? He has shown that he can pay, and he is the person who now asks that the public purse should indemnify him for the non-payment of his annuities. Could the Dáil&mdash;could the Seanad&mdash; could any Legislature or any Government in the world&mdash;tolerate the state of affairs we are asked to endure on account of those people by those who are opposing the enactment of this Bill, the purpose of which is to remove doubts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that the Guarantee Fund, as at present constituted, has some unsatisfactory features.  It is regrettable that the injustice which such men do to their honest fellow-citizens, by defaulting in their obligations to the State, should not be brought home to them and that the ratepayers and taxpayers of County <Col N="1606" /> Cork should have to make good their default.  After all, however, there is time to consider that.  What we are concerned about at the moment is to protect the general body of the community&mdash;of the honest taxpayers of this State&mdash;and when we have done that we will see whether or not the honest ratepayers of County Cork cannot be put in a position to recoup themselves at the expense of those who have been responsible for the non-payment of almost £227,000 of land annuities in County Cork.  There are many ways in which that can be done. We might, for instance, compel the Cork County Council to take proceedings themselves.  We might compel them to publish a list of the names of those who have not paid their annuities.  We might give to any ratepayer in Cork, who has been aggrieved or prejudiced by the action of these gentlemen in not paying their annuities, the right to institute proceedings&mdash; possibly in the Bankruptcy Court or elsewhere&mdash;to compel these gentlemen to make good his losses.  As has been said before, the resources of civilisation are not yet exhausted, and I can assure the Seanad that the matter of bringing home to these people the consequences of their action, and of making them amenable for the position in which they have placed the finances of the public bodies of this country which they control, is not being lost sight of.  I can assure the Seanad also that the possibility of giving relief, in a way which everybody here seems to desire that relief should be given, to those people who honestly endeavour to fulfil their obligations to the State, is being very seriously examined.  In the meantime, however, in order that the general body of the taxpayers of the State should not be called upon to pay&mdash;because that is what it amounts to&mdash;the expenses of this campaign, which was designed to disorganise and bankrupt the finances of the State, we are asking the Seanad to pass this Bill, and to declare now, in 1936, that the same intention obtains as in 1933: that the Guarantee Fund should be responsible for any deficiency in the collection of the reduced land annuities, and, having declared that, allow the courts then to interpret the law.</P>

      <P>I desire to bring the House back again to the consideration of the recommendation before the House, and that is, as to whether the retrospective clauses of this Bill ought to be struck out or not.  I agree with Senator Blythe that this is the most objectionable retrospective legislation that we have had, so far, in this country.  It is the first case in which the Government, by retrospective legislation, has made it, or intends to make it, practically impossible for a court to decide against the Government in a case in which the Government itself is the defendant.  Now, I admit that there are cases in which retrospective legislation is necessary, but I respectfully submit that this is not one of them.  If the cases in the courts had been allowed to go on, and if there was a decision against the Government in those actions, or in one of them, there would have been nothing against the Government introducing a Bill and passing an Act to prevent that judgment if the law were the same.  I hold that the retrospective clauses in this Bill are unnecessary and, therefore, I intend to confine anything I have got to say to the retrospective nature of the Bill and to a particular argument which the Minister used yesterday as against Senator Johnson's argument against the retrospective provisions of this Bill. The statement to which I refer was a statement regarding the relations between Parliament and the courts.  I hope that I am quoting the Minister correctly.  If I am not, I ask him kindly to correct me at once.  However, as I heard him yesterday, I understood him to say that when a doubt arose as to the construction of a statute, it was not only the right but the duty of Parliament to inform the courts and the country, by retrospective legislation&mdash; because that is the only way they can do it&mdash;of its intentions.</P>

      <P>Did I use the words &ldquo;by retrospective legislation&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister did not use that phrase.  I only put that phrase in because what I was saying could not be understood without it. Perhaps it would be better if I read out <Col N="1608" /> the Minister's own words as I understood them.  I understood him to say that it was the duty of Parliament, when doubts arose in regard to a statute, to make clear to the courts its intention in regard to that statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I am anxious to know whether that is a general principle, or whether it is only applicable to cases in which the Government themselves are involved.  So far as the mere right of Parliament to intervene to pass retrospective legislation goes, there is no question that the Oireachtas have an absolute right to legislate as long as they keep within the Constitution, and that is not a very tight barrier now. They have a perfect right, but, so far as their duty is concerned, I respectfully submit that no such duty exists. I respectfully submit that the duty is all the other way.  Parliament, when it passes a statute, speaks in the actual words which are in the Act, and here I agree with my friend, Senator Comyn, that the doubt which is mentioned in this Bill, and the only doubt that ought to be mentioned in a Bill of this kind, is a legal doubt as to the words which are in the statute itself.  Now, that being the only way in which Parliament can speak&mdash;in the actual printed words that are in the document that goes out to the public as an Act&mdash;it is for the courts to construe those words in accordance with rules which have been formed in cases extending back more than a century. How can the Minister say that it is necessary for the Oireachtas to interfere? How can he say that it is their duty to interfere, because that is the way he puts it; how far is it their duty to interfere?  Is it the duty only of the Parliament that passes an Act, or is it the duty of the Parliament which happens to be in existence to deal with Acts which were passed by its predecessors, and explain what they mean?  Are the courts of the country to be bound as to what was meant by a particular Act that has been passed?  Are they to be bound by something that was said by a member in the course of debate?  The idea is not only absurd, but it is dangerous. In practice, it would deprive the private litigant of his right which he has under the Constitution to appeal <Col N="1609" /> to independent courts.  If it applies to cases in which the Government themselves are involved <i>a fortiori</i> they ought not make themselves judges in their own case.  They can correct the law after it has been decided against them, as Senator Blythe has explained, but in any case, anything like recognising in Parliament a duty to inform the courts as to the intentions they had when passing an Act of Parliament, would deprive the people of the protection of the courts, and for that reason I am going to vote in favour of the recommendation.  I would not have intervened in the debate at all except for the statement which I regret greatly made by the Minister in his speech yesterday.</P>

      <P>To-day we have heard the first tappings of the Government S.O.S.  The ship is sinking.  Even the &ldquo;sea lawyers,&rdquo; whoever they may be, cannot man the pumps.  The water is coming in and the mine is flooded.  I am sure that even Senator Comyn will understand the mixed metaphor.  The mixture is rather, I think, in his favour. We cannot blame the mathematical and eloquent mind of the Minister for Finance.  He is only the victim of circumstances: the catspaw of two of his colleagues on the Executive Council, to whose brains&mdash;if such a term can be used in relation to those to whom we owe the preposterous policy of cutting off the country's income in order to make it independent.  President de Valera started out on this disastrous policy three years ago, when he said it would be a good thing if the country was fooled into losing its cattle trade. I challenged him when he made that statement and asked did he not intend to destroy the cattle trade of Ireland. That multiple Minister and coadjutor of his, Senator Connolly, said that if it took 100 years to build up the cattle trade of Ireland, thank God, it would not take that length to break it down.  The cause of all the hysterical alarm is due to this, that the cattle trade has been broken down and has been broken deliberately.  The tide is running out and the place-fish are beginning to flounder.  If the country can become solvent for a week or two, because of the one-sided coal-cattle pact that was made this time <Col N="1610" /> last year, that surely is an earnest of the prosperous condition in which the country would have been if its trade had been left alone.  Even the mathematically minded and eloquent Minister for Finance must have realised what a fat, rich and wholesome country he had to deal with: a country that has been able to stand three years of even Republican Government by people who are quite amenable to take over a Government in its Free State form. What the position would have been if we had the full fatuous republic I do not know.  We are now reaching the beginning of the end when the Executive finds it necessary to muscle in on the courts and to bend justice to bolster its own policy and futility in order to stave off bankruptcy by one or two honest men, not necessarily solvent men, paying their rates and annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The town of Newbridge is a hungry town, and there is hunger for the four miles surrounding it.  In Britain's day there was no starvation in Newbridge. What in the name of goodness will it be when the full republic is in full swing, when this happens with Republicans disguised as Free Staters? I do not blame the Minister for Finance in connection with this.  This Bill represents a part of his President's policy of making this country independent and self-contained.  There are only a few places on the earth to which that description can be applied.  One is the North Pole, the other the Sahara and the other the Wicklow Gold Mine of Deputy Briscoe and Senator Comyn.  They are self-contained, because they produce nothing. There are no annuities to be paid in those places.  There it is not necessary to interfere with justice or to dictate to the courts or to exempt oneself from judgment.  All is well in a desert where nothing is good or bad.  Because it would be disedifying for the Minister to appear at the Bar of the courts the Minister objects, and his colleagues appear now at the Bar of the country. As soon as this political devil-worship which this country has gone in for wears threadbare there will be no more execrated name than de Valera's in Ireland.  We are only at the beginning to-day.  Everything that <Col N="1611" /> was competent, critical and honest is being swept aside, including this House.  Let the country at least realise that the Seanad has saved them from many attempts to mulct their farmers and all.  And let it realise what it may expect from the one supine Chamber to which its destiny is henceforth to be entrusted.</P>

When the President conceived the idea of making this country prosperous by depriving it of its income and by shutting off trade, he made it deliberately helpless and insolvent.  That was the beginning of the whole sad history.  It did not begin with the <Col N="1612" /> Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance has not got any finance. That is the whole trouble.  The moment de Valera's grip was relaxed for a moment from the throat of the country, £1,000,000 was paid in at once.  Were those who paid defaulters? They were those who were deprived of a market according to plan.  But the defaulter was de Valera with his madcap schemes.</P>

    <P>Is it not a strange state of affairs to have Republican Ministers, temporarily Free State Ministers, threatening <Col N="1613" /> the people of Ireland and talking of dishonesty when it is not dishonesty but insolvency, deliberately produced by his senior colleague, the President of the Executive Council, which has caused the muddle?  Is it not a strange state of affairs when extreme Nationalists, or Republicans &mdash;whether disguised or not&mdash;are enjoying the fruits of office, have to turn on the rest of their countrymen and impound the people's cattle, and to send the bailiffs in as the representatives of their idea of republican freedom? This country has got into a condition under a so-called republican Government that it never was in under the administration of John Bull.  Even Cromwell did not cause such destruction, because the country's resources were not comparable and he could not do much damage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the retrospective aspects of the Bill, I suppose it is not to be presumed that the chairman of Cork County Council would have to pay for all the defaulters in Cork.  So that the House may realise the position, take an estate of 1,000 acres, 700 acres of which have been distributed amongst smallholders who have been provided with cottages by the last Government or by this Government. These smallholders have been also provided with agricultural implements and have entered into possession of cottages for which they have paid <Col N="1614" /> nothing for four years.  If we make a picture of the 1,000 acres, 700 of which have been distributed, these smallholders represent the condition of the Free State as those who got the 700 acres are in arrears for four years and these arrears are falling on the landlord with the big house.  That is the position.  Seven-tenths of Ireland is depending on three-tenths, and a couple of Cork county councillors have to bear the debts of the deliberately dishonest or helplessly honest but insolvent people.  The big house will soon be turned into flats; there will be a family in each room.  That will save building.  The picture is the same as that of Russia, covered only by a veneer of religion to fool Ireland temporarily.</P>

The Government has been characterised by the pound&mdash;not sterling&mdash;but the pound for impounding cattle, the bailiff, and the eviction agent.  If Balfour were President of the Executive Council, conditions could not be different.  We are only at the beginning of what is going to happen, because there is panic on board, but not one member of the Government will relinquish office until the country has gone down.

Now there is a sum of £700,000 involved, and that is far more important than the liberty of 7,000 people.

      <P>I wish to make a protest against the tirade we have had from the Minister to-day, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, as an excuse for this tyrannical and most dishonest piece of legislation.  He fixed on certain gentlemen in Cork who have sacrificed their time, their money and their liberty to defend the defenceless farmers of Ireland against this tyrannical Government, a Government far more tyrannical than the landlords of old ever were.  All they want now is the battering-ram, and I believe that is almost in preparation.  Why did the Minister not deal with the other 25 counties and give us the picture there? There are 25 other counties in the Free State.  Why did the Minister pick out Cork?  There are hundreds of farmers, to my knowledge, who have deprived themselves of the necessaries of life in order to make an effort to pay land annuities and rates.  I speak the truth and I know what I am speaking about. The Minister does not.  I have stood on the same platform with Senator Blythe on very many occasions, wearing a blue shirt, I am proud to say, and never, either when I was there or when I was not, did he or anyone on our platform advise anybody not to pay their rates or land annuities.  We did quite the opposite.  We told everyone who had the money to pay on every possible occasion when we got a chance to speak.  That is the truth, and it is not hypocrisy to say it.  We are tired of listening to this bunkum, this business of conspiracies and designs by politicians to prevent people from paying. There is only one reason why the farmers are not paying land annuities and rates now, as they always did before this Government came into power, and that is the Government's policy, which has made it impossible for them to pay by depriving them of their markets.  That is plain English and it is the truth, and no amount of denial or bluster, or the sound and fury which is characteristic of this Minister, is going to change it.</P>

      <P>From the way the debate has developed, it seems to me that it is to a great extent a waste of time because you people have made up your minds to vote for the recommendation and we on our side have made up our minds to vote against it, and it does not seem as if anything we have to say is going to change a vote one way or another.  However, in view of all that has been said, I feel that the whole question is one of honesty or dishonesty.  The man who is primarily responsible in County Cork for bringing legislation to the high courts in Dublin in order to find out whether the Minister has power to stop the grants or not is the very man who, as leader of the United Ireland Party in County Cork, refused to pay either rent or rates while chairman of the Cork County Council&mdash;Mr. O'Gorman.  He refused to pay until the sheriff and his assistants arrived on his farm to seize his motor car and all the rest of the luxuries he has got.  He then drew a cheque book and signed a cheque to cover the whole amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a part of the country which has a reputation for its honesty. We are not all one-sided down there. There are as many, or very nearly as many, supporters of the Opposition as of the Government there.  Those <Col N="1619" /> people are paying their way because they are honest.  The average valuation of County Mayo is only £7 and it is an extraordinary thing that a county of such low valuation pays its way, while one of the most highly-valued counties in Ireland, with the best land in Ireland, County Cork, will not pay until it is made to pay, until the sheriff arrives at the door and then they take out cheques and pay up the amount.  I submit that, in addition to dishonesty, it is hypocrisy.  It is a mean method of holding up local administration.  The people who are always hit by such methods are the poor.  Senator Counihan referred to the people of Mayo and said that because there are a couple of people in a house drawing old age pensions or relief grants it is easy for them to pay rates which only amount to £3 or £4.  It is well for the House to know that it is much harder for a man living on four or five acres of rock or bog in County Mayo to pay £1 rent than it is for Mr. O'Gorman, of Cork, to pay £150. That is the comparison and that is the position.  I was glad to hear Senator Counihan saying that, from a farmer's point of view, he supported this Bill, and every farmer should do the same.</P>

      <P>As a farmer, I support this Bill.  I have strong reason for doing so, in the interest of the community as a whole.  In my opinion, the provision of the necessary moneys to enable the Government to pursue their policy as regards the purchase of land in the interest of uneconomic holders will contribute to <Col N="1620" /> the peace of this country more than anything else.  Where you have large families on uneconomic holdings&mdash;and the poorer the family, the larger it is likely to be&mdash;there is discontent. If the payment of the land annuities breaks down, if the provision of money for land purchase fails and the distribution of land ceases, there will be a revolution in this country.  The cessation of the distribution of land will lead more to discontent and revolution than anything else is likely to do.  For that reason, I think that it is in the interests of the farmers and of the community as a whole that land holders should secure the tenure of their lands by paying their annuities. By doing their duty to the State, farmers will help to increase the activities of the Land Commission and maintain the continuity of land purchase.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the House to be sensible on this question.  As Senator Comyn pointed out, the Bill seeks merely to give effect to the intention of this House and of the other House. Senator Blythe knows very well that during the period in which he held high office in the State this was the system which was operated.  Since he carried out that system for ten years he should be consistent and carry it out now.  This Bill seeks to remove a doubt which is the subject of legal proceedings before the High Court.  I think it was O'Connell who said that you could drive a coach-and-four through any Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>The last speaker promised us heat.  I am very glad to say that he did not keep his promise, but endeavoured to argue the question. I should like to support the recommendation and to put the case very briefly, because I think that neither the Minister nor Senator Comyn nor, perhaps, some of the other Senators seem capable of understanding the reasons why some of us feel we must support this recommendation. Senator Comyn argued against a recommendation which I cannot find on the Order Paper.  He said the proposal was to take away the words in the Bill designed to remove doubts.  I cannot find that recommendation on the Order Paper before me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind what anybody said.  I am dealing with the recommendation before me, which proposes to change the words &ldquo;whether before or after the passing of the Act&rdquo; to &ldquo;after the passing of the Act&rdquo;.  The effect of that recommendation would be that what the Minister desires would be put beyond doubt after the passing of the Act&mdash; that if the court should decide that the county councils had, through an error in draftsmanship or on the part of the Oireachtas, certain rights, they would be entitled to those rights up to the passing of the Act and no longer.  It seems to me that there is a vital principle involved here.  Respect for the State and good faith are involved in this issue.  Few of us in business have not made mistakes with regard to agreements, even though there was no doubt as to our intentions. If we were honourable men, we accepted the position.  If there was a doubt, it went to the courts. To endeavour to get the State to <Col N="1622" /> interfere in our behalf in the case of a <i>bona-fide</i> mistake would be repugnant to every idea of justice.  That is so far as the individual is concerned. In this matter it seems to me that if a county council did, by any chance, through an error of the Oireachtas, find that it was entitled to more moneys than it actually obtained, then it should be entitled to find what the actual state of the law was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put the Senator a question?  What if the position is this: that it is entitled to these moneys by the grace of the Oireachtas, and then, having received them, or being about to receive them, turns around and endeavours, as we contend here, to void one part of the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the law is, the courts cannot decide what anybody is entitled to by grace of the Oireachtas.  They can only decide what they are entitled to decide under the law as it stands at the particular time.  The Oireachtas may change that afterwards if they consider it a wise and proper thing to do.  It is the principle in between that seems to us to lead to want of respect for the Government and the State.  As between the individual and the State, or as between the county council and the State, I believe the same principle should apply.  There is no certainty in this matter at all.  I think there must be more doubts than Senator Comyn thinks, or we would not have this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brown has given no opinion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, Senator Comyn would not be interested in my opinion on the matter, as I suppose I would be a sea lawyer, whatever on earth that is.  I am not giving any opinion; I am dealing with the principle that is involved here and that is the only matter I want to deal with. The Minister seems to think that if there are persons in a particular county council who have broken the law&mdash;I am not saying whether they have or not&mdash;that that should affect the case; if there are persons who have not <Col N="1623" /> paid, who happen to be on the county council and happen, perhaps, to be in a particular majority, that that should affect the principle.  It seems to me it has nothing to do with it at all.  If they break the law, they should be dealt with.  If individuals are publicly advocating persons not to carry out the law, they should be dealt with.  I have never taken up any other attitude than that the law should be obeyed.  If persons publicly advocate breaking the law&mdash;I do not care even if it is Senator Blythe&mdash;the Minister knows how to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The position is that if, by any chance, it should be that the people of a county which includes all parties &mdash;people who have paid as well as those who have not&mdash;were entitled to a larger proportion of the grant, according to the law, they were entitled quite properly to go to the courts and say, &ldquo;Is this the law?&rdquo; What the Oireachtas may do afterwards would be a matter of public policy, having regard to the merits of the case; but to interfere in the middle of a case of that kind will, I believe, lead to disrespect for the State.  It is because I believe that, that I am obliged to support the recommendation. As we are still here in the Seanad and we are asked to give an opinion on this matter, I think we ought to give an honest opinion, and my honest opinion is that this Bill should operate only from the date of its passing and any further action could be taken after the law has been declared, if it is considered wise and necessary.</P>

      <P>I regret very much having had to hear this debate, having regard to the manner in which it has been carried on.  I did not expect this type of discussion in this House. I expected that a matter of importance, as no doubt this is, a matter of some importance at all events, would be discussed in a calmer atmosphere, no matter what decision would be come to by the House. Senator Douglas has much more experience of this Assembly than I have.  He is right, I am sure, when he says that it does not matter very <Col N="1624" /> much what decision is come to in regard to this suggested recommendation: it would not affect the result of the intended legislation.  Therefore, I am sorry for the exhibition of temper and the unnecessary and excessive language that has been introduced. The discussion sometimes took the form of being a discussion on a question of law.  It was intended, I think, originally when this recommendation was moved that it should be treated as a question of law.  I very much regret that it has been dealt with in the manner in which it has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>Possibly Senator Douglas, whose judgment in a great many matters I have a great regard for, is accurate when he says that it is immaterial how we vote.  If the Senator is accurate in that, it occurs to me that in the future, whether this Assembly survives or not, when people will read what we have said in this discussion and possibly when Senators themselves will read what occurred in this, perhaps, important discussion, will they look back with pride, say, in six or 12 months' time, if Providence spares us all for that period, on the debate that has taken place in this Assembly? We heard a Senator yesterday pointing out the terrible catastrophe it will be if this Assembly is abolished.  We heard of the loss to the wisdom of the country; the loss that will be suffered through the absence of expressions of opinion in this House; the loss to the education of the country and the enlightenment of the people through expressions of opinion here disseminated through the Press&mdash;opinions expressed in judicial or semi-judicial language by venerable Senators who imagine that they are here, perhaps, on account of the respect that their opinions deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder have Senators ever reflected on what people will say when they read in the papers to-morrow what occurred here to-day?  Senator Douglas has said it is immaterial, of comparatively no importance, what the decision here is in regard to this matter; it will not affect the proposed legislation.  I will accept that.  Then what good is likely to flow from what we have heard <Col N="1625" /> to-day?  There is one matter about which I would like to remind my colleagues and which they seem to forget. It is utterly immaterial, I would respectfully suggest, as regards the destinies of this country in the future, what vote this House passes on anything to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickLynchKC" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble suggested by the mover of this recommendation is the objection he has to what he calls retrospective legislation.  I heard arguments advanced here as to the comparative harmlessness of legislation correcting a decision of the courts as compared with what is proposed in this Bill, that is passing legislation which might affect a pending issue.  A good deal of argument was addressed by the mover of the recommendation, and some of his supporters, to legislation introduced with the object of correcting the effect of a decision.  Their contention was that that would not be open to nearly so much criticism as would legislation that might have effect upon a pending decision.  We have heard the Minister upon that matter.  Having heard the Minister, and having ascertained his views, it is for the House to say whether they accept them as a justification for the introduction of this particular legislation.  Personally I do not see that it is open to the severe criticism addressed to it, or to the severe strictures of the Senator who moved the recommendation because it <Col N="1626" /> deals with pending legislation.  If those who have the conduct of the Bill in their hands, and have studied it, are satisfied that the language of the statute that regulates the course of these moneys is open to some doubts, then this legislation does little more than possibly remove doubts from the minds of the people generally.  If that is the sole object of this intended legislation I suggest that the evil which has been pointed out by the mover of this recommendation, as likely to result from the passing of this Bill, is not a real one at all and that consequently the Bill as it stands should meet with the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest and some curiosity to Senator Lynch, especially to the latter part of his speech as I hoped that I would get some light from him as a lawyer on the point raised by me yesterday when I quoted from the Attorney-General to the effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That this House has the undoubted right during any stage of litigation, either before an action is commenced, during the hearing of the proceedings, or after an action has been concluded to say what, in its view, the law was intended to be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Skilfully perhaps, but effectively, at any rate, the Senator evaded giving any expression of opinion on that particular point.  I am rather glad, however, that he did not express approval of that particular principle uttered by the Attorney-General.  The business before the House is that we should recommend to the Dáil the amendment of the Bill by deleting the words and brackets &ldquo;(whether before or after the passing of this Act)&rdquo; and substitute for them the words &ldquo;after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  We are, in fact, asked to recommend the Dáil to amend the Bill so that it would read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to remove doubts, it is hereby declared and enacted that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  every deficiency in the Purchase Annuities Fund arising &lsquo;after the passing of this Act&rsquo; by reason of the non-payment of purchase <Col N="1627" /> annuities is a charge on the Guarantee Fund....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since yesterday I examined this Bill to see if I could find a way to amend, or to recommend the Dáil to amend it so as to remove what I consider to be a serious fault, that is to say, that it is interfering between two parties to litigation at the instance of one of the parties to that litigation.  On reading the Bill very carefully, with that view, I came to the conclusion, that as the House accepted the Second Reading, it would be impossible to amend the Bill in that direction; and that having accepted the Second Reading it could not be amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If we did not accept the Second Reading it could not be amended either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but it was accepted by the House, and it was accepted by the House in order to remove doubts.  I think the Minister's criticism of this recommendation, from that point of view, is perfectly sound and valid and unanswerable.  Senator Blythe in moving this recommendation spoke belittlingly of the words &ldquo;in order to remove doubts&rdquo; and would like to have them considered as having no effect whatever.  In that case, as the Minister pointed out, it would mean that on the advice of this House we are recommending the Dáil to re-enact the Guarantee Fund system so far as future payments are concerned. But most of the discussion yesterday was against the principle of the Guarantee Fund.  Senators Wilson and Counihan particularly were very strong in their opposition to the Guarantee Fund as a system.  If we were to pass this recommendation it would, in effect, be asking the Dáil to re-enact for future matters the Guarantee Fund.  Therefore, I think the passing of this recommendation would not give expression to the desire of those who spoke yesterday on this matter.  With the words &ldquo;in order to remove doubts&rdquo; I think this recommendation would make, in effect, the main principle of the Bill to be such as to direct the court how it should decide on a matter in litigation before <Col N="1628" /> it.  To amend the Bill in the form here suggested would not remove my objections to the Bill and, therefore, I am not going to support the recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming, as I do, from a part of the country in which the people are mainly small farmers.  I desire to oppose this recommendation very strongly.  The acceptance of this recommendation would be a great injustice to them.  They are an industrious, hard-working class of people, who pay their way as well as any other section of the community.  If people in other parts of the country who are in a better position to meet their obligations fail to do so, it would be a great injustice to honest men if these people were allowed to go free. The proposal of some Senators, so far as I could understand it, was that the honest, industrious, provident man should by all means pay his way while the man who is not so industrious and who may, for ulterior reasons, refuse to meet his obligations should be treated in the Kathleen Mavourneen manner: &ldquo;It may be years and it may be for ever.&rdquo;  I suggest to the House that the classes of farmers who are not paying their annuities at present are classes which are best served by the Government of the day.  They have got every inducement and facility for growing root crops and grain crops of every description.  These facilities are not possessed by the poor farmers in the west of Ireland who are paying their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the poor farmers in the west are contributing towards the subsidies which are paid on the crops grown by the men on the richer land. The poor men in the west cannot grow wheat on their land nor are any of the beet factories situated in their areas. Yet, they have to bear the increased cost of living due to the subsidies paid to the farmers on the better land.  The farmers on the better lands are paid subsidies on their cereal crops and their dairy products.  It is the poor farmers and the working classes, the town dwellers, who are paying these subsidies.  They are the real sufferers to-day.  I see no reason in the world why any farmers living in the good <Col N="1629" /> parts of the country, and who are represented by Senators on the opposite side, should receive any more favourable consideration than the farmers of whom I speak.  In my opinion they should get much less consideration because they have the best means of making a living in this country.  They are really pampered by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recollect that Senator Brown addressed himself to a statement which I made in the course of my speech yesterday, <Col N="1630" /> that this House had not merely the right, but the duty, to give a clear direction to the courts in certain instances.  In that connection, I would remind the House that Senator Brown himself declared that the Oireachtas speaks only in the words of the Act.  I contend then, because that is generally accepted and acted upon by the courts, that all the more, when a doubt arises as to whether a statute does give full, complete and accurate effect to the intentions of the Oireachtas, it is the duty of the Oireachtas to amend that statute and remove those doubts so that the courts, when they come to construe it, will not act under any erroneous impression as to what the Legislature really intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that the Oireachtas in 1935 is capable of saying what the Oireachtas in 1933 meant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say, addressing myself to this particular case, that there is ample proof on the records of the House and in the reports of the debates of the Oireachtas, as to what the Oireachtas really intended in 1933 in regard to the Guarantee Fund.  That has been formally expressed by the votes of the Oireachtas in the manner in which this House does customarily express itself in regard to legislation. Senator Brown does not contend that the Oireachtas is not competent to amend a statute or to correct a statute, but he does say that they can only correct the law after a decision has been given against them by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what he said was that they should only do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I was placing a narrower interpretation on the Senator's words, but let us take it that what he said was that they should correct the law only after it had been decided against them by the courts. Let us carry that to its logical conclusion and see the position in which we are going to find ourselves.  The Legislature, it is admitted; has failed to express accurately and precisely what its intention is.  It is clear that there is an error in a certain statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>It may be clear to some people.  The majority of the Legislature may have doubts about it. It may appear to them that the phraseology of the statute is ambiguous; it may be even absolutely certain that it is ambiguous.  But then this error which has crept into the code of law of the State is to remain embedded in the Statute Book, a precious curio not to be touched by the unhallowed hands of the legislators, until with all the due formality of the law, the courts draw our attention to it.  Then, and only then, may we draw the attention of the Legislature to the existence of this error which many people, even the majority of the Legislature, have felt to be there.  Then, and only then, can we formally recognise the existence of this fly in the amber when the courts have given a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator O'Hanlon had been good enough to bear with me for a moment I would have acknowledged that, though I assume that the Cathaoirleach would not have acted contrary to the wishes of <Col N="1632" /> the Assembly.  We may feel that the phraseology in the statute is wrong, that it fails to express without ambiguity the intention to which the Oireachtas is to give effect when it passed the measure; we may know with all certitude that it is wrong when it does not express the opinion of the Oireachtas, but according to Senator Brown's thesis we cannot touch it until the courts have decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if the Minister reads Senator Brown's speech he will find that what the Senator stated was that when once a case had been initiated in the courts he should not start legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I say that the issues have not yet been joined in this matter.  So far there has been a preliminary skirmish.  We have held that the action was wrongly instituted in the first instance and at all events that it has been launched against the person against whom it does not lie.  The issues have not yet been joined and in these circumstances, for the guidance of the court which has to hear these issues, we are entitled once again, since we can only speak in the words of the Act, to make sure that the words of the Act will be without ambiguity and will be unmistakable.  What is the alternative to that?  The Senator has said that we may wait until after the courts have decided and then we are going to have this as his position, that we can then apparently reverse by legislation the decision of the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not merely new legislation to correct an error in the old statute but to reverse the decision of the court.  Is that a position which it is consonant with the dignity of the Oireachtas and of the courts to endeavour to maintain?  Is it not much better that in advance of the court's decision we should transcribe the law in such manner as will leave the intentions of the Oireachtas plain and clear to all to read?  Is it not better to proceed in that way rather than to allow the judges to come and solemnly decide and declare <Col N="1633" /> that the intention of the Oireachtas was other than all members of the Oireachtas know it to have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Senators who supported the Second Reading of this Bill, and the Deputies who supported it through all stages in the Dáil, can be congratulated upon their powerful advocacy.  When this measure first came before the House for consideration on Second Reading a number of Senators indicated that they were then, as they always have been, opposed to the principle of the Guarantee Fund.  I need only refer to my good friend Senator Wilson, who has never disguised his abhorrence of that procedure, which he told us yesterday had, in fact, been re-established in opposition to the votes of himself and other members of his Party, which I presume included, at that time, Senator Baxter.  Possibly the principle of the Guarantee Fund had not in 1923 such powerful advocates as it had recently, because we now find that what Senator Baxter's present leader failed to do in 1923 we, for some cause which is not patent to the House, have succeeded in doing in 1935.  It only goes to show how men acquire wisdom with the passage of years.</P>

      <P>What was not good enough for Senator Baxter and Senator Wilson in 1923 has been taken to <Col N="1639" /> their hearts this afternoon.  However, it is a good thing that the country should realise that the principle of the Guarantee Fund has now the almost unanimous acceptance of this House.  I am not sure whether in that connection I speak for Senator Miss Browne. There is, however, no person better qualified than she is to speak for herself, and if I should misinterpret her present attitude in regard to the Fund, I have no doubt that she will take an early opportunity to correct me.  I do think we may congratulate ourselves upon a very striking victory as a result of the debates which have taken place here.  It is now made clear to every element in the country that all parties in the Seanad, at any rate&mdash;I was going to be more comprehensive and say the Oireachtas, but apparently there is a difference of opinion between the Opposition in the Seanad and the Opposition in the Dáil as to the merits of the Guarantee Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We were told by Senator Counihan on the Second Reading of this Bill that that was something which was contrary to natural justice and that this was one of the reasons why he was prepared to oppose the Bill.  Apparently the Senator's objection on that ground has been overcome.  I think there was a Senator who challenged a division on the principle of the Bill on Second Reading.  If my recollection does not mislead me, Senator Fanning had the hardihood, when all his friends were silent, to call for a division on the Second Stage.  Now Senator Fanning is doing his best to expedite the passage of this Bill through the Seanad this evening.</P>

However, I do not wish to detain the House unduly. I think we may all congratulate ourselves and the country will witness, I have no doubt, possibly with a little wonderment, but I am sure with wholehearted appreciation and thanksgiving, the unanimity with which the Seanad has decided to impose on the hard-working sections of the community for whom Senator Counihan spoke on the earlier stages of the Bill, all the disabilities which we were told attended the operation of the Guarantee Fund as part of our land purchase code.</P>

      <P>I am now rather inclined to think that I was wrong and that he meant portion of his speech to be serious and I take it, therefore, that we would be justified in taking his speech as a serious one and that he is of the opinion that a Second Chamber which receives a Bill from the Lower House of which it disapproves should always immediately reject it.  I understood the objections to this House which have been urged by the Minister and by members of his Government were that we had rejected certain measures.  Admittedly, we did <Col N="1642" /> pass the majority of those that came from the Government although we did not altogether approve of them.  We did pass them with amendments.  Now we understand that if we had been honest and consistent and had done our duty properly as Senators we would have rejected every one of them, according to the standard set by the Minister's speech here to-day.  It may be that that is correct in regard to general legislation, but I have always felt that the Minister, together with certain other members of his Government, had never troubled to study the functions of the Seanad at all and that is borne out by the Minister's speech to-day, because he will find, if he looks at the Constitution, that Seanad Eireann has no legislative function with regard to a Money Bill.  Therefore, the Second and Final Stages in this House are of no importance at all and do not imply approval.</P>
      <P>The only function we have is on Committee and Report Stages of sending recommendations, and that is provided clearly in Article 35.  Therefore, it is simply because of the convenience of the Standing Orders we have that we have a Second Stage, but, whatever happens, it does not matter the tiniest bit so far as actual effect on a Bill is concerned.  The Committee Stage is the only Stage that matters and, therefore, all the Minister's joyous argument as to conversion and approval with regard to this Bill&mdash; none of which he believed, but which he thought was a good point on which to make a humorous speech&mdash;is not, I am afraid, even effective.  We certainly are entitled to assume that the criticism made of this House in that we rejected two or three measures since this Government came in was not meant by the Minister, who, if we disapproved of Bills, would have expected us to have rejected every one of which we disapproved.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to my attitude with regard to the Guarantee Fund.  I made my attitude quite plain&mdash;that originally it was a slur on the honest Irish farmer&mdash;and I do not wish to say any more about it.  I wish, however, to refer to another matter in the Minister's <Col N="1643" /> speech which, I think, is important, to be fair to everybody.  Almost the principal plank in his argument in endeavouring to get this Bill through has been the action of certain members of the Cork County Council.  Since I spoke last some Senators have referred to these persons by name.  They have referred particularly to Mr. O'Gorman. These persons have been referred to as having done something which was never done before by anybody of importance. The present chairman of the Wexford County Council was a member of the Dáil for a number of years. During those years he headed the list of defaulters both in rates and land annuities in Wexford County Council and he is not the only important member of a county council attached to the Fianna Fáil Party whom I could mention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the farmers are unable to pay their annuities, I am sure the Government will give them all the consideration it is possible to give.  A number of farmers have failed to pay their annuities.  Some people say that they are unable to pay and, as a result, the money in default will be contributed by the farmers who have paid.  It is said that, of every three farmers, two pay and one does not.  It is also said that if the default of that one has to be made up, it will amount to 4/- in the £ on the rates. That is a very serious matter.  I ask Senators on the other side: Have the farmers who have failed to pay their annuities in County Cork failed to pay their rates?  They have not.  They are not paying their annuities in that county and I think they are doing that as a result of a combination for that purpose and in order to embarrass the Government in the present crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain recommendations have been carried to this measure.  Let us examine them.  The first recommendation is that this Bill shall operate only as from the date of its passing. I ask the Seanad to consider the confusion that would arise if that was part of the law of this country.  Before the passing of this Act, a certain <Col N="1644" /> state of law would exist.  After the passing of this Act, another position would arise.  What about the people who have paid their annuities?  What about the annuities that are not in default?  If money has been paid under mistake of law, can it be recovered?  That is a question for consideration.  I hold&mdash;I do not think I have been contradicted by any lawyer of experience&mdash;that, according to the law at present, the Guarantee Fund is liable to make good the deficiency and that this is simply an explanatory measure for the purpose of making clear what the law is as expressed in the Act of 1933.  The courts of justice, when they come to determine the construction of an Act of Parliament, can have no regard whatever to debates which took place in either House.  But the Dáil and the Seanad can refer to these debates and, referring, as we have done, to the debates which took place on the Act of 1933, as we were entitled to do, we know the clear meaning of that Act.  The court would ultimately decide what that meaning was and I think it was desirable when a question was raised that it should be made clear.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of the first recommendation? Its effect is practically to tell the court by Act of Parliament that the true meaning of the Act of 1933 was not its real meaning and that the Guarantee Fund was not liable, but shall be liable after the passing of this Act.  That is prejudicing the court.  The second recommendation is of the same character. A further recommendation by Senator Blythe is of much wider scope.  It is a recommendation that Section 2 be deleted.  Have Senators, when marching around Níl and Tá, considered what Section 2 contained? (<i>Section quoted.</i>)  That section asks you to say that the financing and administration of the Land Purchase Acts, as they have been carried out since 1932, was done properly and regularly.</P>
    <P>Any sensible man ought to have agreed with that section once he had considered it, because it would be intolerable that all transactions since 1932 should be ripped up.  It is a very <Col N="1645" /> bad thing that the Seanad should give the idea that matters are unsettled and uncertain.  I am sure my friend Senator Fanning will agree with me in regard to that.  He has made no speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was sufficient of an optimist to think that the dove of peace had descended on the Seanad, but I am afraid I have been disillusioned at this stage.  There were various inaccuracies presented to the House.  The last Senator who stood up to contradict me would be wise to look up his geography.  If his historical remarks were as incorrect as his geographical remarks, I think I would be right in suggesting that the majority of the people inside or outside of this House should take as little notice of what he said as I do.  With regard to the Bill, I think there was no necessity for the heated discussion that we have had.  I entirely disagree with those who launched deliberate attacks on Senator Blythe.  On the contrary, I would feel more or less inclined to compliment Senator Blythe on being consistent, at least for once, because I can see in his recommendations a deliberate attempt to stand behind <Col N="1646" /> those people whom he certainly has, within the past year or two, led into the fog.</P>
      <P>Senator Blythe stated to-day that at no time did he advise the people not to pay their land annuities.  I cannot flatly contradict that statement, because I have not any documents from which I could quote to the contrary, but I do say that if he was not advising the people not to pay their land annuities then he was at least fooling the people, because the farmers in South Tipperary who followed his blue lantern around the country for about 12 months came together not very long ago and made up their minds that just as they would take the necessary precautions to prevent potato blight when it threatened, that they would take necessary precautions to prevent the disaster which would inevitably follow if they followed this &ldquo;Blythe&rdquo; any further, and they decided they would not take his advice not to pay the land annuities.  I believe his recommendations are a deliberate attempt to back up those people who were in default.  In his attempt to do this it must be obvious to Senator Blythe that he is backing up the minority of the farmers against the majority.  His recommendation is an attempt to throw the responsibility on the people with no property in the country, as was pointed out by the Minister.  It is an attempt to make them pay what was not forthcoming from those entitled to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people looking for a rising of Communism in this or any other country would naturally look for it in the slums or somewhere where the people were living under terrible conditions. Here we have an extraordinary development.  We have a state of Communism springing up amongst the people who would naturally be interpreted as being the best-off people in the country.  The big landholders, headed by Senator Blythe and other leaders of the Opposition, are now saying that they do not want to pay their land annuities and that they will not pay them.  I do not want to go back on the question of whether or not they were told not to pay.  We all know what the movement was and <Col N="1647" /> what the result would be if it was carried through.  They do not want to pay land annuities or the rates.  They want to throw the burden for the running of the whole country on the people who have to pay their taxes direct and indirect.  I believe if the Bill were to go through with these recommendations that anybody voting for the Bill would be a party to this attitude of Senator Blythe and, like the previous speaker, I do not propose to vote for the Bill with the recommendations tacked on to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some guidance on the matter of procedure. The motion you put from the Chair is: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;  Which Bill?  The Bill that came from the Dáil?  I take it that is in reality what we are asked to approve of, to pass from this House.  But to the Bill as received from the Dáil there are certain recommendations.  Are we to take it the Bill is passed subject to those recommendations being accepted, or are we to take it the Bill is only passed if these recommendations are embodied in it?  The motion before the House is, &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;  We have not amended the Bill.  We are not allowed to amend the Bill.  Therefore, we must take it that the Bill we are asked to pass is the Bill that came to the House from the Dáil.  I think, even with the recommendations, the Bill ought not to pass because&mdash;the Minister used the word stultification&mdash; I think it is a contradiction in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to send a Bill to the Dáil&mdash;that in order to remove doubts we do so and so.  It is really as to a matter on which there is no doubt whatever, because it deals only with the future; it makes a new law for the future.  If there had been amendments rather than recommendations, as amended it would have just the same defect as the Bill that came before the House, but on the contrary side.  In the one case, as it came from the Dáil it is an indication to the courts as to how the courts should decide the issue.  But now it is an indication to the courts that they should decide the issue in a definite but contrary direction. So it just contains the same evil <Col N="1648" /> if the recommendations were accepted by the Dáil as it contained when it came from that House.  Therefore I think in either case the Bill ought not to pass.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said, and Senator Blythe agreed in the course of the Second Reading debate, that this is an issue that ought to be argued out on its merits&mdash;the question of the Guarantee Fund.  It ought to be argued out on its merits, and it has not been argued out on its merits.  On that account, therefore, the Bill ought not to pass because, as containing the recommendations, it is a re-enactment of the Guarantee Fund procedure. But on the matter I am more concerned with, the indication to the courts when hearing the litigation&mdash;in either case it tells the courts what the courts ought to do.  As it came from the Dáil it tells the courts they ought to decide in a certain direction&mdash; amending the law while the case is before the courts.  As it is going with the recommendations it is telling the courts to decide in another direction entirely.  In either case it is an irresponsible Bill, a Bill which is a disgrace to both Houses.</P>

      <P>On the legal point raised by Senator Johnson as to what we are doing, I always held the view, and still hold the view, that we cannot do anything but pass or reject a Money Bill.  We treat them in the same way as other Bills in debate, but we have no legislative authority in regard to Money Bills.  If there is a recommendation made by the Seanad, of course, it must go back to the Dáil; but I do not really think it matters what we do on the Fifth Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain recommendations have been passed by the Seanad. I think they are perfectly good recommendations, in spite of what was said by various Senators since.  There is no suggestion in these recommendations that defaulters should be let off.  The only suggestion is that if there are wilful defaulters the Government should deal with them direct, and that their neighbours should not be asked to pay for them.  If they are not what one would call wilful defaulters, but people who are unable to pay, the Government should ascertain the facts, instead of passing this Bill, and consider what is actually before them.  As to what Senators Foran and Quirke said, I want to say that I never advocated the non-payment of rents.  I advocated, as I do to-day, that the Government should face up to the situation created by the economic war, and not collect annuities while the farmers are deprived of their markets; but I never made the suggestion that farmers, who could find the means, should not pay their land annuities.</P>

      <P>It is entirely with that in mind that I have risen.  I think Senators Johnson and Comyn have drawn the attention of the House to very important considerations. Both Senators have pointed out that the acceptance of the recommendation, to amend Section 1 of the Bill, would be to make confusion worse confounded, because it would undoubtedly place the courts, we believe, in a position of more uncertainty <Col N="1650" /> as to what the Legislature did intend by the Land Act of 1933 and the Land Purchase Annuities Fund Act of the same year.  Not only would there be a state of confusion as to what the law was, but there would be a state of administrative chaos, too, as Senator Comyn pointed out, created by the deletion from the Bill of Section 2.  Now I can speak on that section.  I did ask the Senator who was responsible for putting the recommendation in regard to it before the House to explain what he intended to do.  We did not hear any argument in support of that recommendation.  It was assumed, I think, that it was a purely consequential amendment&mdash; consequent upon the passage in the Seanad of the recommendations to insert certain amendments in Section 1.  But the practical effect of it would be to throw into a state of uncertainty at least, I think, the courts in regard to everything that has been done under the Land Act of 1933.  Looking at the words of the section I find it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This Act shall come into and be deemed for all purposes to have been in force as on and from the 1st day of April, 1932, and accordingly every payment or deduction made or other thing done, on or after the 1st day of April, 1932, and before the passing of this Act, in relation to or for the purposes of the Guarantee Fund shall be and be deemed always to have been as lawful and valid as such payment, deduction, or thing would have been if this Act had been passed before (as the case may be) such payment or deduction was made or such thing was done.</P>
      <P>Lawful and valid, including the collection of the land annuities, and the reduction of the land annuities because these are in general relation to the Guarantee Fund.  The position, therefore, to be created by the deletion of this section is that the whole of the land purchase procedure is to be thrown into a state of uncertainty and confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in relation to the Guarantee Fund&mdash;there is a relation between them and the Fund. The position is a reciprocal one.  That can be argued with great force in any court.  If the intention of the Seanad in making this recommendation to delete Section 2 is not to interfere with the Constitution or the existing law, or the rights of the people under the existing law, the Seanad is acting under a grave misapprehension.  Whatever else it might have done in regard to the recommendation to amend Section 1 it should not have deleted Section 2; and I say in view of the position which I hold it would create it would be impossible for the Dáil to accept the Bill with this recommendation, and I do not see that any use would be served by the House passing the Bill in that form.</P>

      <P>It would be a good thing for the supporters of the Government in the Seanad to declare that this is a bad Bill.  That would be going a long way on the road that we wish them to travel.  I hardly believe the Minister suggests that the deletion of Section 2 would mean that there would be no power to collect the annuities. The Minister is a man of many parts and of many moods.  He can address himself to subjects of a very varied character.  There was a sort of threat to us.  Now if there was the possibility that the collection of the annuities was going to be stayed I think we should have further information upon that before we could be satisfied that it is so.  It is not the intention of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of the majority of <Col N="1652" /> the House.  We are not prepared to accept the Minister's interpretation as to the legal position.  The principal arguments that are advanced as a justification for this measure are made by people who are so close to the wood that they cannot see the trees.  I think the case was to try and get at individuals. Goodness knows, there might have been a good deal of that in the past but we should try to get away from it.  I believe that this Bill is unjustifiable and that, considered from the aspect of social justice, it should not have been introduced at all.  I do not know very much about conditions in Cork or in other counties but I know the conditions in my own county. I know that our county topped the list or was second to Mayo this year in the payment of rates.  What is the position there this year?  A sum of £16,000, due for land annuities, is going to be deducted, through the operation of the Guarantee Fund, from the grants for our county.  Curiously enough, one of the first individuals to be seized upon was a very vigorous and violent supporter of the Government Party.  I regret that the names of some men have been mentioned in this House, men who are not here to defend themselves and with the facts of whose case some of us are not familiar.  But I can say of the man to whom I have referred that he was a poor man.  I believe myself he was unable to pay, mainly because of the policy he pursued and acted upon.  That is my conviction. When he found himself in difficulty he went to his Fine Gael neighbours, borrowed the money and paid up.  A number of payments have since fallen due and the money is not available.  The result will be that, in pursuance of this policy, we shall have to face an extra 1/4 in the £ on the rates in the county when they come to be struck next month.  That is because this £16,000 will be deducted from the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are these grants being stopped? I believe there is no suggestion that in any part of the county there is any agitation directed towards the withholding of the annuities.  No one has countenanced or suggested that policy. <Col N="1653" /> The fact is that conditions are such that people are unable to pay.  Now we are to be asked to pay an extra 1/4 in the £ this year.  If I have to pay 1/4 extra in the £ on a valuation of £45 what will happen?  What will every ratepayer in the county say? That if he is to be asked to pay in one way he will not pay in the other. While the Minister may talk about the administrative chaos that is going to ensue, from the Exchequer point of view, if this Bill is not passed in a particular form, I can urge with equal force that there is going to be administrative chaos in the various counties all over the country when they are called upon to strike a rate which they can never collect.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Party have talked a great deal about the will of the people.  I give my opinion for what it is worth, that this Bill of the Executive Council is not the will of the Fianna Fáil Party or the will of the people who voted for them.  I can go even further and point to a county that has, perhaps, been staunchest of all others in its support of the Government, the County Clare.  I can quote here the point of view of the local paper which has been a very vigorous supporter of the Government.  Here is what it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have repeatedly urged that the local rates should not be put in pawn because many tenant purchasers do not pay their land annuities. Grants, which would otherwise go to the relief of rates on agricultural land, are reduced to compensate the Central Fund for those defaults and the local rates have then to make up the difference. That is, the honest man who pays his own annuity has also to pay for the unlucky, lazy or improvident defaulter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an interesting point with regard to the will of the people:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A motion on the subject was submitted at the county council meeting (in Clare) but the majority took the view that it should be <Col N="1654" /> adjourned pending the outcome of certain cases in the High Courts. Clare ratepayers have suffered enormously owing to their presumed liability for land purchase arrears, and, whatever be the effect of legislation or of legal judgments, it is hard to see the equity of making Peter pay for Paul.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You have that coming from an organ that has been a most consistent and vigorous supporter of the President, and opinion in County Clare is fairly representative of opinion in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I submit with all respect to the points of view expressed by Senators on the right, that so far as the farming community are concerned&mdash;those who are struggling and making desperate efforts to pay land annuities and rates wherever they can&mdash;there never was a greater injustice done to these people than when the Central Fund withheld grants from the local councils because certain people in these counties are in default in the payment of annuities.  What is being handed over to the county councils? If the Minister and the Executive Council have not succeeded in collecting annuities in South Tipperary, Cork, or in other counties from certain individuals in these counties, will the rate collectors be able to do what the Executive Council, with all the forces of the State at their disposal, have not succeeded in doing?  The Minister is only passing on the baby again.  I think it would be much better for him if he faced his responsibility and did not think so much about those people in Cork whose names he mentioned but looked at the country as a whole and at the people generally who, despite the conditions, are making every effort to meet their liabilities. If he did that, he would ask himself what will be the consequences of this Bill on local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the constructive programmes which local authorities have marked out for themselves in the way of housing schemes, water supply schemes and sewage schemes are going to be imperilled if <Col N="1655" /> the rates are going to be made liable for a deficiency that is really a responsibility of the Central Fund's, and if the local councils are to be deprived of money that should be made available for them by way of grants.  You cannot have it both ways; make no mistake about it.  If these people are paying in South Tipperary and in Cork and elsewhere, through the pressure that is being put upon them, there will not be any default and the Central Fund will not be in arrear. Then these extra powers which the Minister wants to take, or the clarification of past legislation which he wants to make, will not be necessary at all.  From the point of view of public policy, from the point of view of social justice, even&mdash;if one might with some timidity urge it&mdash;from the point of view of good politics, the Minister would be much better served by the complete withdrawal of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, however he is going to do it, find the money in some other way.  I know he has urged that unless this Bill is passed there will have to be extra taxation of 9/- in the £ on every individual in the State. If that is the case, when you are going to distribute taxation over each individual to the same amount <i>per capita</i>, would it not mean much more on those very worthy citizens who have paid their own way and who are in no way responsible for the position in which some of their neighbours now find themselves? In my view, if this charge is to be met at all, it would be much more equitable to meet it by way of taxation on every citizen in the State, many of whom are responsible for the policy&mdash; to a much greater extent than the farmers themselves&mdash;that made it impossible for the farmers to pay their way.  There would be much more equity and justice in that, and if the Executive Council are prepared to withdraw this Bill we say: &ldquo;More power to them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The surprising thing about it is that it is only now that Senator Blythe and so many other Senators woke up to the fact that this method was an improper one.  I think Senator Baxter put his finger on the kernel of the problem when he said he did not know how the money was to be got.  The plain fact remains that he had to admit that the money must be got some way.  If the people do not pay their way the whole machinery will fall into chaos and the whole social fabric of the State will fall into chaos. This is the system that has been tried out and found satisfactory.  Nobody on the other side has made any suggestion as to a better form of machinery or suggested a better means by which more efficient machinery could be-substituted.  In view of that and failing the suggestion of an alternative policy by the Opposition, I think the Minister for Finance is perfectly justified in taking up the attitude he has taken up in connection with this matter.  Talking quite frankly, I must say that this whole system of giving agricultural grants should be codified and a simpler <Col N="1657" /> method got.  I do not know anything about it, but I am talking from the point of view of the ordinary man. One would imagine that some system could be got that might be more satisfactory. However, this is the system that has been tried and found by experience to be satisfactory.  The Seanad has made recommendations. They started this Bill in 1935 and they continued discussing it in 1936 and I do not think they have done any good to themselves or to the House.  I do not see why we should pass this Bill at all under existing circumstances.  I say that because this House has gone beyond anything it has hitherto done, as far as I know, in any Money Bill.  That being so, I do not see why we should now give the Bill any show at all at this Stage, for we might show our subserviency somewhere outside this House and by following up that subserviency and making easy for others what we have not done would bring on us responsibility for their actions.</P>
