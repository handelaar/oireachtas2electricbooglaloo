    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to one or two simple subjects.  On the Second Reading of the Bill reference was made to the Warble Fly Order and an impression was created by speakers on that occasion that the farmers were against the Order.  I want to say definitely that every man in this country, who knows anything about the subject, thoroughly approves of the Order, but I object to the way in which the Order is being carried out.  A number of inspectors are appointed in every county to see that the Order is enforced.  These inspectors go round to the farmers and they have not a <Col N="2338" /> single idea of how to give instruction. They are not furnished with leaflets. They just walk into a farmer's place and say: &ldquo;Have you dipped your cattle or have you dressed them?&rdquo; If the farmer has not dipped or dressed his cattle they say to him: &ldquo;You will have to dress them or we will prosecute you.&rdquo;  That is not the way to encourage the farmers to carry out the Order.  This is a very important Order, but it is going to be useless and hopeless unless better methods are adopted in seeing that the farmers carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also object to that portion of the Order which suggests that it will be sufficient if farmers bruise the grub out of the beast's back.  If it is to be enforced in that way, it will be impossible to know whether or not the farmer has complied with the Order. The farmer can always say that he has bruised out the grub.  In my opinion there should be only one way of carrying out the Order and that is by dressing the cattle with the approved wash. We have in every county in Ireland a very intelligent set of agricultural instructors.  Why should the agricultural instructors not call together those inspectors who have been appointed under the Warble Fly Order and give them a lecture on how to put the case to the farmers?  Why not furnish them with the Department's leaflet?  The cost of printing a few hundreds more of them would be very little.  If they do that, the farmers will be induced to carry out the Order when they know that it is in their own interests and in the interests of the country as a whole.  I should like to suggest to the Minister, as the provision of the money comes within his province, that every farmer or cattle-owner in the country with less, say, than ten cattle, should be supplied with an approved dip by the inspector.  It could be made up in 1 oz. or 2 oz. packets and given to the farmers.  At the same time the farmers could be instructed as to how to dress their cattle with the dip.  A number of people are going to a lot of expense and a lot of trouble to see that their cattle are dressed, but that will be all waste of time and money unless everybody is prepared to weigh in and do <Col N="2339" /> the business properly.  Unless the work is done properly, it will be useless.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer, though perhaps it does not come within the Minister's province, is the question of dogs worrying sheep. I know many cases all over the country where dogs have killed ten, 15 or 20 sheep in the flocks of farmers.  Anybody going out at night can see that the country is full of prowling mongrels and these do a lot of harm.  Instructions should be issued to the Civic Guard to shoot all dogs that are allowed out at night without being under control.  I do not think there is any other way of dealing with the trouble.  It is very important that the question should be taken up by somebody in authority, such as the Civic Guard.  The Minister for Justice could give instructions to the Civic Guard that all dogs found prowling at night should be shot.  There are a number of other matters to which I should like to refer, but perhaps it would be better to defer dealing with them until the Minister for Agriculture is present. Amongst them is the question of the provision for the slaughter of calves. I do not want to attack the Minister for Finance on this question.  I have been looking for the Order which is to be laid on the Table to provide money for the continuance of the scheme.  If that Order were laid on the Table, I would put a motion down to rescind it, as I think that would be the proper way of dealing with the matter.  When the Order is laid on the Table I shall probably take such steps.</P>

      <P>It was very pleasant to hear Senator Counihan, for once, at any rate, approving of Government policy.  For his information and for the information of the House, I should like to point out that as far as I am aware the warble-fly inspectors are being called together in the various counties.  They have been called together in County Tipperary at any rate.  I was in the county council office yesterday when they were called in and they were given instructions as to how they were to approach the farmers and to carry out the work.  As far as I am aware, the method of selection <Col N="2340" /> was such that men who were totally unsuitable, as Senator Counihan suggested, could not possibly have got these jobs.  As far as I am aware, the men are fully qualified to carry out their duties and fully instructed as to how they should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  I do not know whether it can properly be raised on this Bill, but as we have no opportunity of asking questions in this House, I can only avail of this opportunity to ask whether there has been a departure from policy with regard to doctors living in local dispensary districts.  I am not bringing forward this question altogether on my own. Representations have been made to me on the subject and I was asked to mention the matter so as to ascertain whether there has been any departure from policy with regard to it.  I am referring particularly to the district in which I live, where a doctor has been appointed for over a year or more.  He is now living ten or 15 miles away from the district in which he is supposed to reside.  I believe accommodation could have been provided for him in the district at the time he was appointed.  That accommodation has been otherwise taken up since.  Taking into account the fact that a commissioner has been in office in Kilkenny, everyone has been wondering whether there has been a departure from the policy hitherto in existence and whether the doctor is now allowed to reside ten or 12 miles outside his district.  This is a hilly district, in fact many people call it mountainous, and in many cases it is quite impossible to get in communication with the doctor, especially at night.  I think it is only reasonable taking into account all the money spent on social services that doctors should not be allowed to live away from their districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If money contributed locally by the county council and by the Central Fund is wholly expended on trunk roads, are the district roads to remain practically in a state of neglect?  I am referring particularly to a county where the district roads have become <Col N="2341" /> almost impassable, where it is difficult for the people to use them.  In those days of increased production from tillage, as well as the burdens being imposed on roads by modern transport, I think it is reasonable to expect that the district roads should be, at least, kept in the condition they were in prior to 1931-32, before the increased expenditure arose.  I intended to refer at length to the slaughter of calves, to the use of Kerry cattle, and the money that is being expended on these schemes.  I did so before without result as far as getting information from the appropriate Minister, but I wish to protest again on the ground that there is an enormous expenditure of public money in an absolutely uneconomic manner.  I repeat, that the market not alone for cattle but for young calves is growing.  It is a valuable market, and seeing that it is there, it seems to me to be an enormous waste of public money to use it to destroy calves.  There are two outlets for these calves.  There is an outlet for them as stores in England, where the use of stores for fattening has increased from 23 per cent. to over 50 per cent.  While there is an increased market there we are spending I think £47,000 on the slaughter of calves.  The other outlet is for cattle when they come to maturity. There is absolutely no competition for young cattle between two and two and a half years old or five cwt. dead, except the best Scotch and English. It may be said that there are supplies from the Argentine.  Supplies from that country have nothing whatever to say to supplies of fresh meat. There is an untold store of wealth in the live-stock trade but it is being wasted as canned meat.  While the Waterford canning factory is idle for eight or nine months of the year these untold resources could be providing other employment.  I suggest that there is more employment in the breeding and raising of young cattle, and in the fattening of even two or three beasts, than there would be given on an acre of tillage.  I am not saying that to protest in any way against tillage because the two must go <Col N="2342" /> together, but the present schemes seem to me to be an enormous waste of money and of the nation's resources, and for the third time I wish to protest against them in the hope that the Minister will take cognisance of my protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the steps taken to deal with the warble fly, it would be an advantage if instructions were given by the Minister for Agriculture to officials connected with the committees of agriculture in the different counties so that they would give all the assistance possible in that matter. As far as I know there is no rule compelling them to do so, but in Monaghan the secretary, the agricultural instructor and all the other officials connected with the county called all the inspectors together and gave them instructions.  That might not apply to other counties.  If instructions were issued by the Minister it would be a great help, seeing that there is only a short time, until the end of June, within which the work must be done.  It will be impossible to get it done unless there is co-operation by all parties.  Otherwise the scheme will be a failure.  I regard the distribution of leaflets by the inspectors as important.  We decided to have the necessary leaflets printed at the expense of the county, as it is useless for young men to go round to farmers unless they have instructions.  I was surprised to hear Senator Quirke saying that all these appointments were made on satisfactory lines.  It is news to me to learn that any political appointments by any Party could be <Col N="2343" /> made on satisfactory lines.  Perhaps Senator Quirke will take an example from a Northern county, where we decided not to monopolise the appointments, but to give every Party a share. We decided that Fianna Fáil was entitled to a percentage, that Fine Gael was entitled to a certain percentage, and that our friends on the left were entitled to a certain percentage.  We decided the matter on lines that should commend themselves to many other counties.  I am glad to say that that decision resulted in satisfactory appointments.  It is my experience that as long as appointments are made on political lines, either by one Party or the other, you will never have satisfactory appointments.  The sooner we get away from that practice the better, not only in the making of appointments but in many other things.</P>

      <P>I wonder was any arrangement made whereby the unfortunate farmers, after treating their cattle, will get any more for the perfect hides.  I think if that was done you would have farmers rushing in to have their cattle treated.  If farmers are not going to get any more for the hides, I think this is all manæuvring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion that opens up a very big question.  I do not agree with the statement of Senator Dillon.  My mind goes back to great wastes of land, some of which is occupied to-day by my friend Senator Counihan.  My mind travels over what I saw in areas of Roscommon and on the plains of Boyle.  It seems rather extraordinary to say that the rearing of one or two calves will give more employment than an acre of tillage, because I have in mind 500 or 600 acres of land in County Meath in charge of a man and a dog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Toal spoke about the manner in which appointments should be made, but some of us remember that when the commissioners were in charge of municipal affairs no man would be taken on except he was an ex-member of the National Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some matters that I intended to mention on the Second Stage if the Minister was present. When the Appropriation Bill was before us in August last I added my voice to certain representations which were made to the Government with a view to having some additional assistance given to the Gaelic Theatre in Galway. I should like to express my appreciation of the action that the Minister has since taken by giving additional assistance to that body. While the additional assistance is not as much as I would have liked, I think it is as much as I would have expected, and that good results will follow from it.  There is no doubt that the part that can be played at Galway in the national work of saving and restoring the Irish language is much greater than can be played at any other place. At any rate work can be done there which cannot well be done anywhere else.  In Galway we have the only substantial urban area in which a very large proportion of the inhabitants know and actually speak the Irish language.  An institution like the Gaelic Theatre can do work there that no similar institution, no matter how well financed, could well do elsewhere, because in Galway you can have a natural audience&mdash;not an audience of students of the language, but an audience of people who go to see an entertainment and judge it as such an entertainment would normally be judged.  Since the Gaelic Theatre was established.  I believe that something like 70 plays have been produced.  Quite an appreciable number of original plays <Col N="2345" /> have been written for the theatre and produced in the national language, and a great number of foreign plays have been translated and played there. I am not at all in favour of giving large sums of money to any such institution, because if too much public money is provided there may be a tendency to slack, and to rely on the help that comes from the State, instead of considering the audiences and the resources that can be tapped locally.  Ultimately I hope the Government will give some more money to the Galway Gaelic Theatre, so that there may be established there a permanent company of professional actors, whose efforts might be supplemented by amateurs and part-time actors.  I think really satisfactory work can only be done if the main part of the acting is done by professionals.  It is true that amateurs may play certain parts exceedingly well, but for repertory work it takes actors with about five years constant acting behind them to ensure that every performance will be well done.  If the Galway Gaelic Theatre is gradually allowed to grow into an institution with its own body of permanent professional actors, I believe the effect on the work of reviving and restoring the national language will be very great indeed.  It will not only have its effect locally on play-goers, but it will stimulate the production of literature.  It will provide an immediate outlet for the writer who has capabilities and gifts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, the existence of a permanent company will enable a dramatist to do better work than if he has to write without particular actors and actresses in mind.  He will get from the existence of a permanent company some of the advantages that an artist gets from working from a model.  And when a vigorous dramatic literature takes its rise there you will find that the growth of other branches of Irish literature will be stimulated.  So that, while I express my appreciation of the increase the Minister is giving and while, as I say, it was as much as I expected he would do, I hope that the Government will look at this institution with an appraising, benevolent eye, and that as development justifies <Col N="2346" /> it they will make some additional grant available so that there may be steady growth and steady progress, but, of course, always on such a scale and on such a basis that initiative and self-dependence will not be sapped.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that I think the Government and, in particular the Minister for Education, might consider whether in Dublin the moneys that are being expended for drama in Irish might not be expended in a somewhat different way.  I do not want to condemn the work that is being done, but I do think that the problem in Dublin is a different problem from that of Galway.  We must consider here chiefly the student audience, and very largely an audience of senior school children.  I do not know whether it would not be a good thing if the Government, and particularly the Department of Education, were to consider the establishment in Dublin of a Gaelic theatre for children.  A great deal is being done to encourage school drama.  What is being done is extremely good in certain respects.  It teaches the children who have been taught the language to use it in a natural way.  It stimulates interest; but, on the other hand, if you have one school company looking at a performance by another school company they are naturally looking at a performance that cannot be perfect.  They have no really good model that they may imitate themselves unconsciously: that they might go to see as part of their school attendance, just as they go to concerts conducted by the Army band.  I have seen whole bodies of school children accompanied, by their teachers, go into the Mansion House to hear performances of music by the Army band.  They went there as part of their school day.  I do not know whether it would not be possible and desirable to have in Dublin a theatre manned by professional actors and actresses specialising in Irish plays of interest to children which the children from all the senior classes might go to once a quarter or once in the half-year as part of their school instruction. The dramatic work in school plays would be greatly improved by that. It is not so much that the children <Col N="2347" /> would consciously appreciate the better technique, but that from observation they would incline to model themselves on better work. If you had competent professional players the children, from hearing Irish spoken naturally in all sorts of circumstances, would gain enormously. It would be an important auxiliary to the actual instruction given in the schools.  The actors engaged on that work might also do work for adults and so on in the evenings and in that way put the whole thing on a new basis.</P>
    <P>In any case, it seems to me that it would be a kind of supplement to the work that is being done by Coiste na bPaíste which sends children from Dublin for a holiday to the Gaeltacht. That work is very useful and valuable, and it is capable of extension.  But there are definite limits to the extension which is possible.  Not only are there limits because of the question of funds and because it is financially impossible to send all the children from Dublin to the Gaeltacht, but also because there is not sufficient Gaeltacht there to send them to.  If the work were extended, and if funds were found to extend it beyond certain limits, there is the danger that it might do a great deal of damage, because in time it might swamp out the Gaeltacht.  The work that is being done is valuable, but it can only affect a minority of children. All sorts of ways, it seems to me, will have to be thought out for giving corresponding benefits to other children if a great deal of the work that is being done for the language is not to go to waste.  Therefore, I would like that that aspect of the matter which I have mentioned should be considered.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to a matter that I previously dealt with.  That is the question of simple, cheap &ldquo;talkies&rdquo; in Irish for school exhibition. I think that also might be considered. These could be used in the rural areas where the children are taught by teachers who, it may be, learned Irish well but who are in isolated districts and do not use it&mdash;whose Irish tends <Col N="2348" /> to get somewhat rusty and cannot be kept quite fresh all the time.  In any case, it is not good enough for children to hear only one voice speaking the language.  I believe that at a very moderate rate simple little comedies, lasting say, a quarter of an hour, could be prepared as &ldquo;talkies&rdquo; and shown by a portable apparatus in country schools.  At any rate, I would like, as the Minister has been so good as to make a concession in one respect, that this other development should be considered.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that it is perfectly clear that one cannot get the work that requires to be done for the Irish language in the educational system carried out in the primary and secondary schools alone.  I think that there must be development in the Universities.  Certain steps have been adopted and certain developments have taken place, but I think the process needs to be continuous. In Galway there are certain lecturers who give their lectures in Irish.  They have their effect not only on the students who attend the lectures but on the general atmosphere of the place. Their work produces results that extend beyond the immediate bounds of the University or the University body.  Now in Dublin, for example, that development has not begun.  In Galway it ought not to be allowed to stop at the point that has been reached.  In University College, Dublin, if the Government could arrange it, I think that some start ought to be made in the use of Irish as a medium of instruction. Progress naturally must be slow.  It cannot be forced.  You have to recognise the existing position both as regards the staff and the student body, and apart altogether from that there is the question of finding the right personnel to undertake the new type of work.  I think that suitable personnel will only be found very slowly.  If any of the colleges of the National University felt that money was available, or would be made available by the Government when suitable personnel appeared, or could be discovered, then I think we would have development.  I should like <Col N="2349" /> to say this for the colleges of the National that they are not importunate, that they do not clamour at the door of the Department of Finance as some other institutions do, and, therefore, they would be quite liable to let opportunities of securing personnel and making development slip rather than approach the Government.</P>
    <P>Consequently I feel, that the Government has a responsibility in this matter for making it understood that they desire development, and that as soon as development can properly take place they are prepared to assist it.  There has been, in more colleges than one, an increase compared with the old days in the staff which is actually engaged in teaching the Irish language, apart from teaching through it.  People with old-fashioned ideas may think that quite enough has been done, but I fancy in view of the struggle that is taking place and the efforts that require to be made, we are far from having gone far enough, and that additional staff could be employed with great effect and great utility.  It may be said, of course, that the colleges are autonomous, but they are national bodies and are in touch with national feeling and national sentiment. I believe myself that if they understand that adequate help will be available from the Government they will move ahead.</P>
    <P>I think it is important that the Government should make it understood that they will give that help, because if the Universities do not advance with the schools then a great deal of the work that has actually been done in the schools is going to be partially destroyed.  It is not satisfactory that students should go through a secondary school, getting instruction through the medium of Irish, and having a certain spirit instilled into them, and that when they go to the University in Dublin none of them should receive instruction through Irish. I do not think that for a long time more than a minority can receive instruction through Irish, but at any rate the position ought not to be that none of them <Col N="2350" /> should receive it.  If we do not help the Universities and help to develop the work that is being done in the schools then, as I say, a great deal of that work will be wasted.  To some extent also development in the schools will be crippled because it is from the Universities the secondary schools get their teachers, and you will not get that even, all round development that might be secured if you have not the Universities advancing in the actual use of Irish.  I am not saying that by way of criticism at all.  I think that great progress has been made as compared with the old position.  I think that progress has to be continuous in this particular matter, and that there has to be continual alertness and continual adjustment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter that I would like to deal with. I just want to refer to the serious results that, I believe, are likely to occur if, as a result of Government policy, the bounty which has been removed on woollen exports is not restored.  I have no personal interest in this trade.  It is a trade which was built up in 60 or 70 years without any tariff.  It seems to me that it would be a disastrous thing if this trade in high-class woollen goods to Great Britain should suddenly be stopped because, following the tariff imposed in the economic war, the payment of the bounty to balance that were to cease at the end of this month.  I would be glad if the Minister would give me an assurance that the matter will be reconsidered.  I would also be glad to hear from him what the reasons are for the removal of the bounty.  There is another matter that I desire to bring to the Minister's notice.  Would the Minister say if it is true that the Government of Brazil have sent a notification that the most-favourednation treaty with the Free State is to end in six months' time?  I have been told that if that be true it will mean the loss of a very substantial trade to two or three firms here, certainly to one, and that very definitely it would be very unfortunate. I do not know whether the Minister can assure us, or whether he <Col N="2351" /> is in a position to state whether or not this is true.  I would be glad, at any rate, if he will look into the matter and see if steps can be taken as soon as possible.  It might only be a gesture to arrange a more satisfactory treaty, but the occasion should not be let slip in view of the shortage of time. If nothing is done until the end of the six months it means that orders cannot be accepted for Brazil.  Most of the stuff takes at least three months to make, and for all practical purposes it will mean that trade will cease in a month or six weeks unless some assurance is given in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to tell us the attitude of the Government towards the possible sale of licences issued under quota orders. It seems highly undesirable that a person should be placed in a position to sell a licence to any other person. I am not able to prove that that is done, but I have reason to believe that offers have been made to sell licences to others.  It would be a very good thing if the Government could give an assurance as to what steps they will take in the event of licences being sold in the way I have mentioned.  When a licence is issued under a quota order, if the person to whom it is issued cannot use it, he is not obliged to use it; but in the next period when licences are being issued such a person is liable to be refused a licence.  It seems there is something wrong in the way this is working, and if licences cannot be used there should be some method by which the Government can be satisfied so that the person concerned may again get a licence.  If persons are driven to adopt various means in order to retain their place on the register, that is, to my mind, a very unsatisfactory condition of things.</P>

      <P>On the question of bounties, it is close on two years since I first drew attention to the matter and I then referred to how the bounties applied to manufactured articles as compared with the cattle trade. Since the institution of this dispute with Britain, all the bounties on manufactured goods were discharged by the Government of the Saorstát&mdash;that is, a bounty equivalent to the tariff was paid.  But there was discriminate <Col N="2352" /> action taken in regard to the cattle trade.  The tariff was £6, and there was, up to recently, £1 given, but that has now been taken away.  There is no case for giving a bounty to manufactured goods and at the same time leaving the cattle subject to £4 5s. Od. without a bounty.  If Senator Douglas would agree that the £4 5s. 0d. should be discharged by the Treasury here in regard to cattle, I am quite satisfied that he should get his bounty on woollens and those other things.  We have been suffering all along&mdash;discriminated against&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of matters which have been raised here are matters with which I, naturally, because I have not Departmental responsibility for them, would not be able to deal.  I will accordingly draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to the remarks made here with regard to the enforcement of the Warble Fly Order, and the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the points raised by Senator Douglas in regard to the position of the trade treaty with Brazil and the possibility that may arise that persons who have received licences under quota orders may offer them for sale.</P>
      <P>With regard to the woollen bounty, I am able to speak with a little more authority, because I have gathered from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is satisfied that there is a market which the Irish woollen manufacturers here could supply if they set their minds to it and, until that part of the home market has been filled, there is no possibility that he will reconsider his attitude in regard to the bounties and, accordingly, that he will not ask me to reconsider mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dillon referred to the question of doctors living in local dispensary districts.  So far as I am aware, there has been no change in the policy <Col N="2353" /> which would normally require a dispensary doctor to live in the district to which he has been appointed.  There may, however, in one or two individual cases be circumstances which might make it difficult to enforce that Order for a reasonable period of time. However, I will draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to the instance with which Senator Dillon has dealt and I have no doubt it will receive his attention.</P>
    <P>On the question of the slaughter of calves, I would like to say that I think, apart altogether from the restrictions imposed on us with regard to the British market, there may be something to be said for it as an economic measure.  I am not going to stress that too greatly, but it has been represented to us that farmers and those engaged in the cattle industry are passing through a difficult period.  We may assume that if a farmer has to slaughter a certain number of his calves he is not going to select the best of them for the axe, and it may be that some farmers are getting not very much, but something, for an animal which, even in the best of times, they might have found it difficult to dispose of, even if they had been able to rear it.  I am not pushing that argument too far, but, mind you, Deputies engaged in the industry must know there is a little in it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the canning factory, I think Senator Dillon was under some misapprehension as to the type of cattle with which the canning factory is dealing.  We are dealing there, mainly, with the more mature and lean cattle coming from certain districts for which, normally, it was difficult to find a market, and for which it would be almost impossible to find a market now. I do not think the Senator would contend that the classes of cattle that are being utilised in the Waterford Canning Factory would, at any time, fetch a big price, particularly in Smithfield. Indeed, I do not think any of them ever found their way there at all.</P>
    <P>I have to thank Senator Blythe for the very appreciative terms in which he referred to the action, first of all, of the Minister for Education and, secondly, of myself in giving an <Col N="2354" /> increased grant to the Gaelic Theatre in Galway.  I may say that it is only in accordance with the policy of the present Government, as I think it was of our predecessors, to encourage, in every way possible, creative and artistic work through the medium of the Irish language.  When the Senator mentioned this matter and I had an opportunity of considering it in detail, I was very favourably impressed by what had been done in Galway, under circumstances of no little difficulty, to maintain a Gaelic theatre year after year in production. We gave them as much as, in the circumstances, I thought they could utilise properly.</P>
    <P>I think it is the idea of the Minister for Education, as it is of Senator Blythe and myself, that it would be desirable to have there, ultimately, a professional theatre, but the difficulty is that one can go a little too fast in this matter as in other matters in relation to the Irish language.  I do not mean to take up the view that we sometimes see expressed in the papers, that people ought not to try to do this or that, to teach this or that subject, or try to do this or that through the Irish language.  I believe people ought to try to do everything they possibly can through the Irish language.  It is only when they reach the stage that they think the Government ought to do everything and they themselves do nothing, that I am inclined to hold my hand and tighten the purse strings, and I think that is also the attitude of the Minister for Education.  If, as we have already indicated, in connection with the Galway Theatre and the Coiste na bPáiste, people show they are in earnest, if their efforts show they deserve more, I am perfectly certain the Government will be prepared to give them more.  That has been the main principle that has guided us in connection with these subsidies for the various matters relating to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I think the House can congratulate itself on the speech we have listened to from Senator Blythe in that connection to-day.  It is always a pleasure to hear him talking on this subject. <Col N="2355" /> I have found his speeches most stimulating.  I have found that one gets new and original ideas from them, ideas which can be given effect to without imposing too many demands on the public purse and upon the Government.  I have not the slightest doubt the suggestions he has made in his speech to-day are worthy of the most serious consideration. I will undertake to bring them to the notice of the Minister for Education and if he, on investigation, is satisfied that anything can be done on the lines which the Senator has suggested, I, at any rate, will not be found unhelpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask why is it considered fair to torture the Irish language with external and classical forms such as a theatre? Surely, we realise that a theatre is utterly alien to a Gaelic State?  The idea of the theatre is a classical one and it is derived from the Continent, descending through miracle plays of the Church.  A Gaelic theatre in Galway, or anywhere else, is a contradiction of the genius of the Irish language. To my mind it would be an effort to contort the Irish language and convert it into English or classical forms.  This is all part and parcel of the hybrid mentality which confuses two things which are quite different and tries to merge them in the name of Gaeldom.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to give us an idea of what it has cost this poor country to push synthetic Irish down the throats of the children for the last 14 years? Could not the money have been much better employed?  Just imagine how much more it could have done if it were devoted to cleaning up this slum-ridden City, or giving the people food instead of what I might describe as a Woolworth's Gaelic.  It could easily have been devoted to achieving something much more substantial and valuable than the learning of a synthetic Irish.  If it were utilised merely in looking after the school children's teeth, it would have been much better spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Irish language has not even as broad an appeal for the nations of the world as Volopuk or Esperanto. <Col N="2356" /> The people of this unfortunate country have never spoken it, even in its time of greatest energy.  There is nothing to be gained by a knowledge of the Irish language except a petty Civil Service job.  There is not even a word for &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; in the Irish language. Take the word &ldquo;Saorstát&rdquo; Why, it sounds like Sauer Kraut. There was never any constructive achievement derived from Gaelic speaking.  If the Irish people in America, who won our freedom for us by their great weight and influence and the potential threat which their disaffection represented to Great Britain, were dependent on the Irish language&mdash;if they were depending on their knowledge of Irish, where would they be?  Why, they would be like the Sicilians submerged in the slums of Chicago, people who do not know the common English of Great Britain or the United States.  This Gaelic theatre is, to my mind, the most ludicrous contortion I have ever heard of. It resembles something that would be more at home on a trapeze, something that would look better on a trapeze than in a theatre.  Just think of what we are calling the Gaelic language now &mdash;misspelt English words such as &ldquo;bosca na puist&rdquo; for post box, &ldquo;Bille Siúicre&rdquo; for Sugar Bill, &ldquo;bosca na telefon&rdquo; for telephone box and &ldquo;incoim&rdquo; is used in connection with income tax; but all the collections are in the English language.</P>
    <P>Let us at least be honest with ourselves. The Irish language is not the language of the nation at the present day.  Did our mothers speak it?  I am sorry the Government has accepted the heavy mantle of the last Government in wasting millions of money slowing up every Department and confusing the none too brilliant intelligence of the proletariat.  Only the other day I got a notice from the West of Ireland in Irish, and, when I wrote back for a translation, three weeks elapsed and they were probably trying to find out what it was they first sent me.  They are simply span-celling themselves and making a very unintelligent proletariat more confused. It is time for people to speak out honestly.  There have been many <Col N="2357" /> energetic strains in this country from the twelfth century onwards who never knew a word of Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Unemployment Assistance (Employment Periods) Order, 1936, laid on the Table of the Seanad on the 4th March, 1936, pursuant to Section 7 (3) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, shall be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an Order which fixes a period in accordance with that section of the Unemployment Assistance Act, and the effect of which is to rule out from the operations of the Act all those persons who occupy land of £4 valuation over.  It will be remembered that in the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933, it was explained by the Minister that the principle of the Act was that all able-bodied persons who are involuntarily unemployed, and who have either no means at all or insufficient means to maintain themselves and their dependants, should be given a statutory right to assistance.  It was <Col N="2358" /> explained by the Minister that a certain number of people in the country were partially employed for wages who had pieces of land of their own, and consequently it was deemed that those people who had these holdings employed themselves on these holdings for certain periods of the year, and provisions were inserted in the Act, the effect of which is that the Minister may by regulations prescribe, either generally or in respect of any particular class or classes of persons, or any particular district or districts, any period to be an employment period; and, accordingly no person of such class, or resident in such district, shall, during such employment period, be regarded as unemployed within the meaning of the Act.  It will be remembered that any person whose means were deemed to be £39 a year or over would be entirely disqualified from the operations of the Act, but persons within that category&mdash;that is to say, who had means of less than £39 a year &mdash; would, according to a scale, be entitled, if otherwise eligible, to assistance under the provisions of this Act.</P>
    <P>Now, last year, the Minister made two Employment Period Orders.  The first affected persons who held land, that is, occupiers of land, whose rateable value exceeded £4.  The second Order included such persons and also other persons who were agricultural labourers, to speak shortly; and in the second Period Order both occupiers of land and agricultural labourers would be deemed to be employed during the period of the Order.  Now the first Order&mdash;that is the Order which was applicable to occupiers of land whose rateable value exceeds £4&mdash;was identical in its terms with the Order that has now been issued and that we are discussing, but there was this difference: that last year the Order operated from the 17th day of April to the 21st day of May, a period of five weeks.  There was then a gap of eight weeks, and the second Order operated from the 17th July to the 1st October, a period of 11 weeks. The class of persons, however, who are affected by the present Order&mdash;<Col N="2359" /> that is occupiers of land&mdash;were disqualified last year from any assistance under the Act for a total period of 16 weeks: but the present Order, as affecting occupiers of land, disqualifies all such persons for a period from the 4th March to the end of October&mdash; a period of 34 weeks.  It is difficult for me, at any rate, to understand what has happened between 1935 and 1936 to add so much to the value of these holdings as to more than double their value as employment-giving and consequently money-earning property. It will be for the Minister to justify the extension from 16 weeks to 34 weeks in a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statements, in explaining the section in question, when the Act of 1933 was going through this House, the Minister stated the effect that he anticipated the provision would have.  He pointed out, for instance, that, at certain times of the year, these small landholders must be regarded as being employed on their own land and, therefore, not unemployed and available for work if offered.  I can quite see the case that was made, and I think it is justifiable that a man who has a few acres of land but is probably employed for wages will, at certain periods of the year, employ himself on that land and that, therefore, for the purposes of these insurance and assistance Acts, he should be deemed to be employed in the operations that that land requires. That is what was explained by the Minister when he said that, at certain times of the year, these small landholders could be regarded as being employed on their own land.  Again he said that it was not always easy to determine when a person who holds land of a small acreage, and who supplements his earnings by earnings from road work, or some other class of work, is employed on the land or not.  In order to get over that difficulty, he said, it was proposed to take power to make Orders providing that for certain periods of the year people of that class, or of other similar classes, would be regarded as being employed on their own holdings or on whatever holdings in which they might be engaged, and <Col N="2360" /> would not be entitled to unemployment assistance while these periods existed. That is merely another way of saying the same thing.  Then, again, by way of supplementing that view of the intention of this section, the Minister said that the intention of this, in regard to small farmers who would ordinarily be occupied on spring or harvesting work, was that, during these periods, they would not be entitled to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Now, it was in pursuance of those assurances given to this House that the Orders were made last year as applying to spring and harvesting work, that is to say the period from April to May&mdash;five weeks&mdash;and from July to October, as covering spring and harvest.  Now, however, without any explanation, we have this class of person disqualified from receiving unemployment assistance for eight months of the year.  I think that that is not a fulfilment of the assurances given to this House when the Minister spoke of certain periods of the year&mdash; spring or harvest&mdash;and it seems to me to be a stretching of the Minister's authority and that it contravenes the general intention of himself at the time of the passing of the Act and the intention of the Oireachtas in accepting his propositions in regard to this provision.  It remains to be asked: who does this affect&mdash;how many people does it affect?  We read in yesterday's paper that, since the operation of this Order, from the beginning of March to the last report&mdash;a period of three weeks&mdash;there has been a fall of about 10,000 in the number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance. That may or may not be attributable to the operation of this Order, but we have more positive evidence of the effect of last year's Order in the spring period.  It was an Order that affected 6,613 persons; that is to say, the number of persons who were disallowed unemployment assistance owing to the operation of the first Employment Period Order totalled 6,613.  Of course, the effect of this Order varies in its incidence according to the character of the country.  In a county like Donegal, the exchanges in that county accounted for 547 persons who were disallowed unemployment assistance by virtue of <Col N="2361" /> the operations of this Order last year. In the Mayo area&mdash;Ballina Exchange and branch offices&mdash;11,086 persons were affected last year.  Then you come down to areas like Dublin, Carlow, and so on, and you have about 70, 80 or 100 affected.</P>
    <P>The complaint that I make in regard to this Order is, first, that it covers a longer period without discrimination; second, that it makes no discrimination in respect of the size or quality of the holding or the amount of employment that might reasonably be deemed to be required to be given on that holding. We have a range of valuations. Let us take the valuation in the area of Meath&mdash;that is to say, the small holdings in the County Meath of valuations of from £4 to £7.  One might say then that a person in the County Meath with a holding of from £4 to £5 would be for a large part of his time occupied for wages outside his own holding, but that for part of the time he would be employed on his own holding. That would be the kind of person who would be occupying six or seven acres.  I am not going to pose as an authority on this, but I would be very much surprised to learn that in connection with the kind of farming that has operated generally&mdash;leaving out intensive culture&mdash;it is fair to deem a man with six or seven acres as being occupied for eight months in the year on that holding.  We go to the poor lands of the West and we take County Mayo, where the average valuation of that kind of landholder would be about 4/7 per acre.  We might assume that the holdings that would be affected by the operation of this Order would be in the nature of 20 acres to 25 acres&mdash; poor land, in the main.  Is there eight months' work on that kind of holding? Is there eight months' work for this small-holder, partially a farmer, partially a wage-earner&mdash;a half proletarian, as the Russians say&mdash;is there work for that man and his family in that period of the year?  The Minister may not be aware, but a week or two ago we had discussions here on a matter dealing with education and the Minister for Education explained how important it was that the children of these small-holders would be employed during the spring and autumn on their <Col N="2362" /> fathers' holdings.  It is necessary, therefore, to take into account the employment-giving capacity of these holdings, not merely for the man himself, but for his family.  I think it will hardly be contended that there is eight months' work on this type of holding, irrespective of the part of the country or the quality of the land, and if it is not the case that such a holding would give eight months' work, the Minister has no justification for the deprivation of assistance for eight months, except from the point of view, which he made on the Second Reading of the Bill, of easy administration and financial saving.</P>
    <P>I am not going to stress the suggestion, though I think it is not an unfair inference, that one of the factors that have affected the judgment of the Minister in making this 34-weeks' Period Order is the likelihood that considerable numbers of the people concerned may, if they wish, find employment in England.  I wonder whether it is part of the contention that it is hoped and expected that the migrants from the West will continue to go in large numbers to England and therefore, during that period of employment across the water as they would not be unemployed they would not be eligible for assistance.  I hope the Minister will disavow any such suggestion but, if that is disavowed, can he suggest that there is additional employment as compared with last year in this country, for this type of semi-farmer semi-labourer?  I think there is no evidence whatever to warrant any such suggestion.</P>
    <P>One effect of the operation of this Order is that during that middle period after the spring work is finished and before the harvest work has begun, the man continues to be disemployed but he is ineligible for employment at wage-earning occupations on public works. The effect of the Minister's policy in regard to employment on public works is that only those people who are on the register who are most eligible and most needy because they are longest on the register and with large families, are taken on public works.  Many of these 6,000 or 7,000 men have large families and are greatly in need, but no matter how they need public work <Col N="2363" /> they would not be able to obtain it because of the Minister's ruling in respect of public works.</P>
    <P>It is important to draw attention to the fact that from the time when the spring period begins at the 4th March until the end of October, let us say, the man in question has to find a living somehow.  He has been intermittently employed during the winter, and when not employed was able to obtain a few shillings a week unemployment assistance.  I might say that the average saving in respect of each of those disqualified last year was about 7/3 per week, per man.  During the periods of employment and intermittent employment they would not be able to save very much, yet they are expected to live for a period of eight months out of what they are going to get from the work on the land in the intervening period. That is to say, by some means or other they have to find food and fuel, and they have to get shopkeepers to give them credit to enable them to live while the spring work is coming to fruition and a time when it can be turned into cash.</P>
    <P>I think that, in view of the intentions of the Act and of the assurances that were given by the Minister as to the effect of this Employment Period Order, the intention of the Act and of the Minister at that time is being destroyed and made invalid by the Order that has been laid on the Table. The effect of the passing of this motion would, of course, mean that the Order would no longer operate.  It would mean that the Minister would have to introduce a new Order, an Order which I think would be necessary, but which would not cover a period longer than that for which it operated last year, or he would have to select his areas instead of making a single Order, without discrimination, that would cover the highly-rated Counties of Dublin and Meath and the lowly-rated Counties of Kerry, Donegal, Mayo, etc.  It seems to me that there has been no proper discrimination, discrimination which was quite necessary before making such an Order, and the Seanad ought to <Col N="2364" /> exercise its authority and power to annual this Order so as to oblige the Minister to make a new Order with more discrimination and more thought behind it, and which could be justified from the point of view of the employment-giving capacity of these small holdings of £4, £5 and £6 valuation.</P>
    <P>I am pretty sure that if the Minister had told this House in explaining the effect of Section 7, sub-section (3) of the Act of 1933, that the intention was to disqualify from unemployment assistance every holder of land of £4 valuation for a period of eight months the year, the House would not have agreed to it and I think, therefore, the House ought now to say that that was never the intention of the Oireachtas, certainly never the intention of this House, and the Minister must conform to what were the intentions of the House and the assurances which he gave when the Act was being passed in 1933.  I beg to move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  I think the Order which it seeks to annual is in conflict with the spirit of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The spirit underlying that Act was the relief of distress among classes such as those covered by the Order.  If the Minister felt that it was necessary to make an Order of that kind, excluding these small and economic farmers so called, why did he select what are the hungriest months of the year, as far as the farmers are concerned?  The months from May to August are the hardest months on any small farm. Last season's produce is running short and the coming season's produce is not yet available.  None of these small farmers would have got unemployment assistance were it not for the fact that it was ascertained that their total annual income was such as not to be able to maintain life under normal, elementary and Christian conditions. The period of the year during which they might be able to make themselves available for employment is really the winter season, when there is no work to be done on their little farms and when they would be more available for employment than in the spring, summer and harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2365" /> These small farmers as a rule live beside each other.  Everbody knows that you do not in the same county find very large and very small farms beside each other.  Mayo, Kerry, Donegal and portions of Roscommon have hardly a big farm of say 50 or 100 acres within 100 miles of each other so that there are no large farmers to absorb the small farmers. The only employment, consequently, that they can get outside their own farms is on the roads or on public works and the amount of that employment is extremely limited, but the position is met by the fact that during the time they are so employed they get no unemployment assistance.  Consequently, I see no reason or justification for the issue of an Order such as this.  The farmer that we are dealing with now is the type that does his work in the main with spade and shovel.  He has a very small patch of land or, if it is fairly large, it is a rocky type of soil and the work is done principally by the most primitive methods.  As a rule, he cannot command the services of ploughs and horses so that he has to do his work by laborious methods over a considerable portion of the year.  It is during the period covered by this Order that the compulsory School Attendance Act enables him to keep his children from school to help on the farm, and it is exceedingly hard luck that during that time the children will probably be short of the necessary food because of the operations of an Order like this.  It is during that period that the most assistance is required.  I know something of small farms and I know that the greatest want is felt in the summer months when the work is hardest.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to the fact that in order to get over this hungry season, they would have to get credit from the local shopkeepers. Anybody who knows conditions in country towns to-day will know that there is really no credit for the small farmer now.  There was a time when he could get credit but, be the causes what they may, he is not able to get that credit now to anything like the same extent as formerly.  It is a case <Col N="2366" /> therefore of going without it. Thousands of these people previously were able to carry on, on their small patches of land, with the assistance of their children or other relations in America.  Again, changed conditions have cut off that source of revenue and they have nowhere to look outside their small holdings beyond what they may get under the Act under which this Order has been made.  The total amount involved surely cannot be very much.  Senator Johnson stated here that the average last year was about 7/3 per week.  Well, for the number of people involved it is hardly worth while making an order that is going, for a comparatively small saving, to impose an enormous amount of hardship on people who at the best are just eking out an existence.</P>
    <P>Times are hard generally, but they are particularly hard on people of this type, cut away from the resources of emigration.  They are mainly people with large families and their children could emigrate at one time.  They have not been able to get employment within the country.  It is impossible to get employment for the increasing population, and the only source of assistance available is what can be supplied under this Act during the hard times.  Now, during the very hardest months of the year this Order says: &ldquo;You must do without that assistance and wait until such time as your own crops are available and then we will be able to give you some assistance.&rdquo;  It seems to be an absolute reversal of what should be the order.  Any person who has a little bit of land can exist much better, during the months from October to March, than during the period from March to October because the season's crops are available after October.  Food, at all events, if the man has been working at all, is fairly plentiful.  That is the season during which they will be available for working on the roads or in any other public works that may be started.  If they take work on the roads during the period covered by this Order then they do not till their land and they leave themselves for the winter period without any sustenance.  I would suggest that the whole principle of the giving <Col N="2367" /> and the withholding of relief has been reversed in this Order.  The theory that because they are actually working hard on their own land, they are getting something week by week by way of money or food from it, is, of course, an absurdity.  They are working harder, it is true.  They are fully employed, but they are getting nothing by way of income, and the period during which they might be getting something, is the period during which they must look for some assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Act.</P>

      <P>I regret to find myself in opposition to Senator Johnson because I am not usually in that position. The only excuse I can give for my attitude to-day is that probably I am more closely associated with rural life than Senator Johnson or Senator O'Farrell.  I must say that the general expression of opinion, as regards the new Order, in the country is that the Minister was extremely moderate. Many people thought that he would go much further and wipe out unemployment assistance altogether during the period from now until October.  The Order, as it stands, is, as I say, extremely moderate, and I cannot see that anybody will be the sufferer by it. On the other hand, men like myself who are in public life, are harassed almost daily by the farmers of the country, who ask us when the unemployment assistance is going to be cut off.  While it lasted they say they could not find men to work on their farms on any terms. They are very much harassed, and agricultural progress is considerably held up.  The people in my own county are generally a very hard-working and industrious community.  I am certain that there is work for every able-bodied man who is willing and anxious to work during the spring and summer months, but the trouble is that so long as some people can get a few shillings without working they will not seek work.  One sees them going from place to place on their bicycles.  Some people will tell you that they come in motorcars for this unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The giving of doles in that way <Col N="2368" /> creates a very improvident state of mind.  These people find that they are not compelled to fend for themselves, that there is somebody else to fend for them.  I think it is very demoralising. You have a lot of young men growing up in the country, approaching maturity, and I think it is very demoralising that they should not have to face out to find their food and labour or that they should feel that there is somebody else who will do it for them.  That may continue for a time, but anybody who finds himself capable of permanently accepting such a condition of life will never make a man in the world.  I want to go further and say that if this question had been put to the country, if a referendum could have been taken on it, you would get 85 per cent. of the people to vote for abolishing unemployment assistance in rural areas, at least for nine months of the year.  I quite appreciate, as Senator Johnson mentioned, that there are areas in the extreme West of Ireland, in Mayo and possibly in the western areas of Galway and most other western counties where there is chronic poverty.  There are certain mountainous areas where agriculture is more or less impossible, and where the land is not suitable for tillage.  Some unpleasantness may be caused in these areas by reason of this Order.  If any provision could be made for those areas I say that the rest of the country could get on very well indeed during the spring and summer without this unemployment assistance. I know agricultural conditions as well as Senator O'Farrell and I think they are somewhat different from what he says.  I think the only months of the year in which there is a real scarcity of food and work are December, January and February.  Anybody who is willing and anxious to work will find that there is plenty of work during the other nine months of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that a great deal can be said for both sides of this question.  I do not intend to enter into all the arguments put forward, but I agree with a good deal of what has been said by the proposer and seconder of the motion with regard <Col N="2369" /> to the farmer of £4 valuation.  I do not look upon such persons as farmers in the sense that they can get a living for themselves and their families out of a farm of £4 valuation.  It is well understood that they are not able to do anything of the kind, that they have to look to other employment to obtain sustenance.  Generally speaking, the man with the £4 valuation has to look for work for the greatest portion of the year altogether outside his own farm. If such men are regarded as ordinary wage-earning labourers, there is no reason why in times of stress they should not receive unemployment assistance.  As a matter of fact, the organisation to which I have given my adherence has declared that all these men are entitled to unemployment assistance in times of stress, or at any time that they cannot find sufficient employment to sustain themselves and their families.  I cannot agree with the last speaker in his statement that farmers are praying that unemployment assistance might be withdrawn. As far as I am concerned, I know that they are doing nothing of the kind. They try as best they can to give employment themselves and to pay the best wages they can, but they certainly do not pray that unemployment assistance should not be given if they are not able to afford employment.  I certainly dissociate myself altogether from that statement of the last speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do say is that, outside this obligation of the State to provide maintenance for the unemployed, the Government have a further obligation. I suggest they have an obligation to do what they can to find work for the people and to help those engaged in industry to provide work.  There is an obligation on them to keep the wheels of industry and of enterprise going, and I submit they have not done that. I think the whole question is one of whether the income or the wealth of the State is sufficient to provide employment for all of us that are in it.  We have to face up to the fact that there are at the moment between 140,000 and 150,000 people unemployed. I think there is a far greater problem involved in that question than seems <Col N="2370" /> to strike some people to-day.  I think we ought to do what we can to help to increase the income and the wealth of the State.  I suggest that we have lost, wilfully lost, a great portion of the income of the State.  I need only mention one item to illustrate the enormous weight of the problem.  Since the year 1931, there has been a loss of something like £7,000,000 in the cattle industry. I am not taking into account sheep, pigs, or any other branch of farming.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the mover and seconder of this motion, and especially to the Government, that they should face this problem honestly and see if we cannot provide a remedy for it.  I suggest also to the mover and the seconder of the motion that they might try to compare the income of a farmer of £4 valuation, or even of £20 valuation, with the income of a sheltered trade union employee.  Let them compare the income of such an employee with the income of the person who has no income at all.  If the matter is looked at in that way, I think we shall all try to alleviate the unemployment and distress that are at present rampant in the country.  Before I conclude, I want to say that I agree thoroughly that there should be no differentiation made between the agricultural labourer or the farmer with the £4 valuation, upon whom I also look as a labourer, and any other class.  If they are unemployed in the summer months and if they cannot find suitable work, I suggest that they are as likely to be as hungry during the summer as in the winter, and the State is obliged to come to their assistance, as it should be obliged to assist all of us when we are in distress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I must say that I am astounded at the speech that has just been made by Senator Honan.  According to Senator Honan we will soon be in the happy position that we will have to send away for the exiled Irish and bring them back to do some work here.  Senator Honan said that work was available for every able-bodied man who was able and willing to work.  That is an extraordinary statement to make, in view of the circumstances, that there are 140,000 registered in the labour <Col N="2371" /> exchanges looking for employment. There is something wrong somewhere. Either the labour exchanges are a fraud and a farce or the statement made by the Senator is not correct.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we will take the rural areas and the number of people registered in the labour exchanges in these areas.  Then we will know whether the Senator's statement is correct or not.  If Senator Honan's statement is correct there is something radically wrong somewhere, and we have been paying out in unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and home help, a considerable amount of money that we should not have been expending. I do not believe Senator Honan's statement is correct.  The statistics prove that it is not correct and I think it is unfair and unjust that he should have made such a statement here. If the Senator's statement has any truth, it means that people were given unemployment assistance and home help who were too lazy to work when there was work to be done.  That is exactly what the statement means. I do not accept that statement.  I do not agree that it is a fair statement of the case.  I do not think it should have been made.  I have not the same knowledge of conditions in rural Ireland as Senator Honan, but I have a fair knowledge of the position of farm labourers in all parts, and I would be astounded to learn that decent farm labourers, living in all parts of the country are too lazy to work, and are not anxious to get employment so as to keep themselves and their families in some kind of comfort and decency.  We know that there are some people in all classes of life <Col N="2372" /> who are too lazy to work.  They are not confined to rural labourers.  We have drones in every class of the community. It is slandering decent men when the statement is made that agricultural labourers would not work if work was available for them.  That is not my experience of these men. Senator Dillon who has as much knowledge of conditions in rural Ireland as Senator Honan, says that unemployment is rampant in the country.  I am afraid the two statements cannot be reconciled, yet both Senators are from rural areas.  Senator Dillon is a practical farmer.  He knows conditions in rural Ireland and he says that unemployment is rampant there. If unemployment is rampant that is the case for this motion.  If unemployment is rampant it is unfair of the Minister to bring in this Order making this exemption period for eight months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider what was meant when the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced.  Originally it was meant that the State should recognise that when men and women were unable to find employment it was the bounden duty of the State to come to their assistance and to enable them to sustain life.  I welcomed the Act.  I gloried in it because there was recognition of the fact that when men and women were willing to work, and through no fault of their own were unable to find it, the State recognised its duty and came to their assistance. Hence the Unemployment Assistance Act.  It is true that the Minister got included in the Act provisions enabling him to make such an Order as he has made, but nobody ever dreamt that the Order would extend over a period of eight months continuously.  I believe that it is unfair and unjust to do such a thing.  The only employment available generally to small holders with £4 valuations is work on roads or work of that nature.  There is not much employment on farms nowadays. Everyone knows that.  Senator Dillon would agree with that statement.  If small holders are willing to work as farm labourers there is very little work of that kind offering.  Small holders are occupied for a few weeks in the spring putting in their crops.  I am not conversant <Col N="2373" /> with rural conditions, but I laboured for many years amongst farm labourers, and I know that there are slack periods between the spring and the harvest during which many labourers are unemployed.  After putting in their crops these small holders have nothing to do for a considerable period and have no way of earning a living.  Still they suffer from a double hardship as I will explain to the House. If they apply at the labour exchanges for employment and if work offers, they do not get it, for this reason, that the exchanges when sending men to work on relief schemes or on road schemes send men who are drawing unemployment benefit or assistance.  These men suffer another hardship after working on the roads.  If they are lucky enough to get work for a few weeks or a few months on the roads they are compelled to pay contributions towards unemployment assistance, but by some extraordinary state of affairs when they leave, or are dismissed from that work, which is insurable employment, they are ineligible for unemployment benefit. That is an extraordinary statement to make, but it is true.  Because they are small holders they are not entitled to unemployment benefit although they contribute towards it while employed. It will thus be seen that the lot of these unfortunate men is not a happy one. They are not organised like workers in ordinary trade unions; they are nobody's child.</P>
    <P>I read a good deal in my time about what wonderful men the small holders were; that they were the backbone of Ireland.  I often read of their struggles and their sufferings, but it is very sad, having arrived at this stage, to have it suggested that these men are not willing to work; that they are too lazy.  I say that these men, who are the backbone of the country, are not too lazy to work in order to provide bread and butter for their wives and children.  I think that statement is the greatest slander ever uttered against a decent, hard-working section of the community. We think the case can be made for the Minister's Order to operate as it did last year, but that no case can be made for the operation of the Order over a continuous period of eight months.</P>

      <P>I think it desirable to make it quite clear that there is nothing arising out of this Order which could possibly call for the comments which have just been made by the last speaker, concerning either unemployment in the country or the position of agricultural labourers.  Whether or not there is more or less employment for agricultural labourers they are not affected by this Order.  In fact statistics that have been collected and published in the usual way show that there is increased employment in agriculture; that the number of persons employed in agriculture, whether as members of families working on their own land, or employed for wages, has increased in recent years, an increase which one would expect, having regard to the additional agricultural production, whatever about the value.  All that I submit has very little to do with the Order, nor is it necessary, in a discussion on it, to misrepresent Senator Honan, by putting into his mouth words which he did not use, such as the words that the persons who were affected by this Order were too lazy to work.  It appears to me that those advocating the motion for the repeal of the Order, in fact, have that in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The justification for the Order is that these persons are or should be at work on their own lands, whereas the implication behind the motion asking that the Order should be repealed is, that even though these persons are or should be at work upon their land, they should nevertheless be given unemployment assistance. When the Unemployment Assistance Act was introduced it was designed to provide a measure of assistance for persons who were involuntarily unemployed.  Certain remarks of Senator O'Farrell imply that he conceived the Unemployment Assistance Act as something different to that.  The Unemployment Assistance Act is not intended to provide relief where relief is required.  It is only intended to deal with the case of a person who is willing to work and who is genuinely seeking work, but, through no fault of his own, is unable <Col N="2375" /> to find work.  If a person's destitution is due to ill-health, or to any other cause except unemployment, then the Unemployment Assistance Act is designed to bring relief in his case.</P>
      <P>It is necessary, therefore, to keep clearly in mind that the essential condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance is that the person concerned is available for work, is genuinely seeking work and is unable to obtain it. If, for any reason, the applicant cannot show that he fulfils these conditions, then he is not entitled under the strict letter of the Unemployment Assistance Act to receive unemployment assistance.  When the Act was being framed, one of the difficult points that had to be resolved was the question of persons who are employed on their own account, whether as small landholders or as persons owning small shops or practising certain trades, such as cobblers or thatchers or certain classes of fishermen.  It was recognised that there would be considerable difficulty in dealing with these classes of persons under the unemployment assistance scheme.  Nevertheless, it was decided to include them and to make these persons eligible to receive unemployment assistance if they fulfilled the statutory conditions set out in the Act.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that the inclusion of small landholders was a novel feature of legislation dealing with unemployment.  It was, however, recognised that such persons, in particular small landholders, would not be available for employment at certain periods of the year, but that it was going to be very difficult to prove that in any particular case, and therefore the Act made provision for the making of Orders declaring certain periods to be employment periods for the classes named in the Orders: that is, periods during which the members of these classes would not be entitled to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan said that, in the part of the country he comes from, persons commented on the fact that in making this Order we were moderate, and the very quotation which Senator Johnson <Col N="2376" /> gave from the speech which I made when introducing the measure is an indication of our moderation.  Even if we take the class of small farmers&mdash;the persons who are the owners of land and are, nevertheless, entitled to receive, and are receiving, unemployment assistance&mdash;the number of such persons affected by this Order is a small minority.  All the small farmers whose valuations are less than £4&mdash;and there are quite a number of them&mdash;are not affected by this Order, even though they may be in precisely the same position as those who are affected by the Order.  That is, at particular periods of the year they are employed, or should be employed, upon their own holdings and are not available for work elsewhere.  We have taken this one class of farmers whose valuations exceed £4, and we have made an employment period in respect of them from March to October.  The actual selection of the period was made after consultation with the representatives of the Department of Agriculture and of persons in a position to give advice as to the period of the year in respect of which these persons could reasonably be expected to be employed on their own holdings.</P>
    <P>Now, let me deal first of all with the effect of this Order in respect of the number of persons who will be deprived of assistance under it and the position of such persons.  A similar Order affecting the same class of persons was made last year for a period at this time of the year, and for a further period later on in the year. The first Employment Period Order last year affected precisely the same class of persons as is affected by this Order and under it, as Senator Johnson has pointed out, 6,613 persons ceased to get assistance.  It is, perhaps, not very easy to say what precisely was the position of any one of these persons, but we can arrive at general conclusions from the facts that are known to us.  First of all, let me correct a misunderstanding which Senator Johnson is labouring under. Persons who cease to get unemployment assistance, because of the operation of an Employment Period Order, are not on that account debarred from getting <Col N="2377" /> work on relief schemes financed out of central funds.  On all such works financed out of central funds, persons receiving unemployment assistance are entitled to a preference, and these people will continue to get that preference as if they were, in fact, in receipt of unemployment assistance during the period covered by the Order.  There is, therefore, an obvious inducement to these persons to remain on the register if they are in fact in need of employment and available for employment.  That was also the position last year.</P>
    <P>The persons on the register may, for the purposes of the argument, be roughly divided into three classes: (1) those entitled to unemployment insurance benefit, (2) those entitled to unemployment assistance, and (3) those entitled to neither.  The persons affected by this Order come into the middle class, namely, those entitled to receive unemployment assistance, but, in consequence of the Order, they come into the third class, that is of persons on the register who are not entitled either to unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance. If last year those persons were, in fact, available for work and seeking work, one would have expected an immediate increase in the number of persons in the third class on the register equal to, or almost equal to the number of persons affected by the Order.  In fact, during the period the Order was in operation last year the number of persons in that category decreased.  The number of persons registered on the last date prior to the coming into operation of the Order last year was 5,568, and on the last date prior to the Order ceasing to operate the number was 5,135, so that instead of there being any evidence that these persons were, in fact, available for work, or were seeking employment during the period when the Order was in operation, the evidence is the reverse.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the operation of the Order was to cause such hardship that persons would be rendered destitute and have an urgent need of assistance, and so on, one would expect to see some indication of that fact in the statistics of the number of persons <Col N="2378" /> each week receiving home assistance as able-bodied persons.  Instead of finding such an increase in the number of able-bodied men receiving home assistance, we find that, over the period during which the Order was in operation, the number decreased quite considerably. It fell from 4,698 on the 30th of March, to 2,491 on the 25th of May.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the experience gained as a result of the operation of the Order last year would seem to show that the making of the Order was justified on the grounds that the persons affected by it were not available for work, and that they were occupied on their own land during that period.  If no power to make such an Order existed, these small landholders, whose means is calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act so as to qualify them to receive unemployment assistance, might conceivably continue to draw unemployment assistance indefinitely and without a break.  It was on that account also that this power to make Employment Period Orders was taken.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised, however, that we have made an Order for a longer period this year than last year.  Again I want Senators to keep in mind the fact that the persons affected by this Order are a minority of the land holders on the unemployment assistance register&mdash;those whose means are barely enough to qualify them to come within the Act at all. The average amount of unemployment assistance paid to all persons entitled to receive it is 7/- a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of those who were deprived of unemployment assistance the saving was £12,000. The reduction, according to the Minister's statement, was 6,613 persons for five weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the number of persons affected over the whole period.  The average amount of unemployment assistance paid to all persons receiving unemployment assistance is in or about 7/- a week, and these persons affected by this Order are, of course, in the class that are getting the least amount of assistance per head.  They are persons <Col N="2379" /> whose means are barely enough to qualify them for unemployment assistance and therefore, in fact, the financial saving that resulted from the making of the Order was practically negligible.  I do not say that in making Orders financial considerations are left entirely out of account, but even if there was no saving I think this Order would have been made, because the principle in the Unemployment Assistance Act&mdash;and it is necessary to stress this&mdash;is that it is as much the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce to see that every person under the Act who is entitled to unemployment assistance gets it as it is to see that those who are not entitled do not get it.  A person who is not available for employment, who is not genuinely seeking work, is not entitled to unemployment assistance. That is the intention of the Oireachtas as set out in the Act.</P>
      <P>This year we have made an Order for a continuous employment period. In the first place, the period starts earlier.  Since the beginning of February this year the live register, as it is called, has continued to fall, and it is noticeable that the fall has been much more pronounced in the case of persons with means than in the case of persons without means, although there has been a decline in the number of both classes.  That is an indication that those seasonal activities which are a feature of agricultural employment have commenced.  We allowed these seasonal activities to get well under way before making this Order affecting this class of farmer.  Senator Johnson also referred to our action as depriving a farmer and his family of getting unemployment assistance. Now, the only class of person who is deprived of the right of drawing unemployment assistance under this Order is the occupier of land.  The son of the occupier of the land, if he can prove his unemployment to be continuous, is entitled to receive unemployment assistance.</P>

We have made no such Order. Possibly in future years we will do so. At present we are feeling our way, noting for the purpose of future action the effects of the procedure which we are now adopting.

      <P>I propose to deal with that later.  It is not intended that any persons affected by this Order should find employment in England.  This Order is justified and justifiable only on the ground that these persons are employed in Ireland at the moment and that assumption, I submit, is reasonable.  I think it will be generally agreed by most persons who are familiar with conditions in rural areas, that the period of the year during which persons in the classes affected by the Order can be, and should be, employed upon their own land, are the months from March to October. Senator O'Farrell referred to the fact that they are available for employment during winter months.  During winter months, if they are available and unemployed, they will be entitled to <Col N="2381" /> receive unemployment assistance at the statutory rates.  It is quite correct, as Senator Dillon states, that the intention of the Act is to ensure that every person who is in a situation of difficulty and in need of assistance will get it, but we must have some recognised machinery by which these questions will be determined.</P>
      <P>Senator Farren referred to one matter which indicated that this question of the eligibility of small land-holders to benefit under these Acts has not arisen now for the first time.  For a long time past, for many years, in fact, members of the Labour Party have been making the statement that Senator Farren made recently, that small land-holders when employed on the roads have to pay contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Act, but are ineligible to get benefit when the work on the roads ceases. That statement is literally and actually not correct.  These persons are not ineligible for benefit except they are not unemployed.  If they are unemployed they are entitled to benefit just the same as any other person, but a number of them have from time to time been deprived of unemployment insurance benefit because the employment officer or the Court of Referees, to which the appeal was taken, decided that, the person being a small land holder, was not unemployed because he was working on his own land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that arises in regard to the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act is not dissimilar to that.  In so far as these land-holders were deemed to be employed at certain times of the year and therefore did not receive unemployment insurance benefit, we are entitled to assume they are employed for the purpose of the Unemployment Assistance Act also.  I submit this Order is reasonable.  It is necessary to make these Orders, and that that power should be used, if the unemployment assistance scheme is going to operate as it was intended it should operate.  It will, I think, result in the development of public opinion against the idea of unemployment assistance at all if persons are seen to be receiving unemployment assistance <Col N="2382" /> whom the public know are not, in fact, seeking work or are not available for work.  If the members of the Labour Party are anxious, as they say, that this unemployment assistance scheme should be a permanent feature of our social services, should continue and, perhaps, be extended, it is altogether in the interests of that idea that the administration of the Act should be so conducted that nobody can claim that there are abuses of the principle, and it would be a gross abuse of the principle of the Act if a landholder on a valuation in excess of £4 was, in fact, fully occupied on his own land and at the same time getting unemployment assistance.  It would be still more an abuse if the landholder was not occupied on his holding when he should have been, and was at the same time drawing unemployment assistance.  It is in order to prevent that type of abuse that we have made this Order.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, perhaps, more clearly than most people here, that in any general order of that kind you may be acting perfectly fairly in 95 per cent. of the cases and unfairly in relation to 5 per cent.  It is not possible to avoid it.  When you make a general order of this kind, affecting a particular class of persons, it is almost inevitable that here and there strict justice in a particular case would have suggested a different course; but you have to act along some general lines, to lay down rules which will affect wide classes of persons, and one is justified in doing that so long as he is satisfied the operation of the rules is on the whole fair to the people affected.  That is the case in relation to this Order, whatever the case for the other Order which is being made and which will affect single men without dependents.  Possibly we will have occasion to debate that Order too, when it is made.  The basis of the Order in this case is that which I have stated, that no person should be entitled to receive unemployment assistance unless that person is available for employment and unable to obtain it, and the persons within the category described in this Order do not answer that description.</P>

      <P>Senator Honan surprised me as well as surprising Senator Farren with his whole-hearted denunciation, by inference, of the principle of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  I think the best way to deal with him is to leave him to the Minister and the President, who represents his county too.  Whether the President represents the public opinion of County Clare in supporting the principle of the Unemployment Assistance Act, or whether Senator Honan does in opposing it, I am not going to pretend to judge, but I hope it is not Senator Honan.  He, perhaps, is not aware that last year in that county, in the Ennis Exchange area, there were 220 persons deprived of unemployment assistance by the operation of the Order of last year, which did not begin until 17th April, whereas this year's Order begins on the 4th March.  Let me now deal with the Minister's speech.  I have no fault to find with his general statement of the position, and the removal of certain misapprehensions that he thought would be given expression to; but he has replied to a speech which was not made and he has not satisfied me, and I do not think he satisfied the House, that any reason exists for extending the Order&mdash;what I shall call the order of deprivation&mdash;from 16 weeks, in 1935, to 34 weeks in 1936.  That is the gravamen of this complaint, that last year a period of 16 weeks was sufficient to meet the claims of justice and reason and equity in respect to the capacity for work provided on a holding of £5 valuation, whereas this year, according to the Minister's argument, it will require 34 weeks' deprivation of unemployment assistance to meet the ends of equity and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assert the Minister has not made any contribution towards solving that riddle.  I am glad that he has disavowed any suggestion that the object of the extended Order is to encourage people to migrate for wage-earning employment.  He has made his case that the holding of £4 and over valuation will provide paying employment for a period of 34 weeks whether it is a five, six or seven acre holding in <Col N="2384" /> Meath or Dublin, or a 20 to 30 acre holding in the west of Ireland.  I am not going to attempt to assert whether that value holding will provide so much employment for a man, but I am pretty confident that it is an entirely over-generous estimate unless you are going to put a man into gardening and not the ordinary cultivation that prevails.  We are not expected to assume that these people who are being deprived of the right to unemployment assistance are expected to seek work for wages.  I should like Senator Honan and those who have been impressed by his arguments to bear in mind that in Donegal, out of 27,000 occupiers of agricultural holdings, 21,000 are under £10 valuation and 20,000 are under a £7 valuation.  Now, 14,000 are under a £4 valuation and the Minister is perfectly right in pointing out that in Donegal there are only 5,800 between £4 and £7 valuation, which is the effective category affected by this Order.  These 14,000 people under the £4 valuation will provide ten times more men than are required for wage-earning employment. The Minister's expectation is, taking Donegal that 5,000 people with holdings between £4 and £7 valuation, can find employment for eight months in the year on that size of holding.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister can prove there is a reasonable argument in that, that a holding of 20 or 30 acres of Donegal quality land or seven or eight or nine acres in Dublin or Meath provides paying employment for 34 weeks in the year, then the Minister's justification falls.  He may have been justified in his five weeks in the spring of 1935 and his 11 weeks in the autumn of 1935 &mdash;that might pass for this category&mdash; but certainly there is not one word to be said to justify the extension from 16 weeks in 1935 to 34 weeks in 1936 and, until it can be proved there is a reasonable profit-making employment on a man's holding of that size for that period, then there is no justification for the assumption that all these people are employed for gain on their own holdings and that is the case the Minister makes but has not proved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 11, Sir, I made a point, tentatively, last week as to whether Section 11 introduced any new formula.  I happened not to remember the fact that this formula has been operating for quite a number of years, but I am still doubtful as to the validity of this term &ldquo;the Exchequer,&rdquo; as I do not think we provided, in our financial legislation, for an Exchequer. I do not think it is defined, but it has been used regularly and I take it that by that usage it has become well understood. Sub-section (2) of this section, however, appears to be an introduction of a new sub-section in reference to the collection and disposal of fees. I am not going to ask the Minister now to explain the effect of it but, in fact, so far as I can see by looking up previous Acts of this kind, there is no suggestion in any other Act that the Public Offices Fees Act of 1879 shall not apply, and it would be interesting to know at some point&mdash;although I shall not ask the Minister to put himself out very much in regard to it&mdash; why this sub-section is necessary under this Act when it has not been necessary under any previous Act where the Minister for Finance is given power to dispose of fees received in respect of one service or another.  I am not going to raise the general question seriously now, but I am interested to find that for quite a number of years we have been giving power to the Minister for Finance to direct how fees received shall be collected and how they shall be disposed of.  It is a considerable power to give, especially when the fees are very large, as they may become by this new category of legislation.  When fees were small, one could understand that power being given to the Minister, but when they may become large, by a cumulative process under this group of Acts it might be desirable that the Dáil should reconsider whether or not this power should be left to the Minister for Finance.</P>
