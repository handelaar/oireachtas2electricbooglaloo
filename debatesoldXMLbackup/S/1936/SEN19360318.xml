      <P>So far as I can see, the Government have made up their mind to abolish university representation <Col N="2230" /> before the next election, and apparently they have power to do so. Whether we insist on our amendments or not will not affect the issue, since there does not seem to be any prospect of an early election.  This being the case, no question of expediency arises; and if those who voted for the amendments were not to insist on them it would appear to the public that they had changed their opinion on the main question.  I, therefore, propose to vote against the motion &ldquo;that the Seanad do not insist on the amendments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My greatest objection to the abolition of university representation is that, taken with the abolition of the Seanad and the reduction of the size of a number of constituencies, it will deprive the Oireachtas of a certain minority representation which I believe to be of very great value to the State and to be especially so at this stage of our development.  In his speeches on the Second Stage and the Committe Stage of this Bill in this House the Minister dealt with this particular argument at some length.  He showed that he completely misunderstood the argument, at least so far as my remarks were concerned.  He assumed that the arguments used had reference to the religious minority in this country and he dealt only with that aspect of the subject.  I have since read his speeches and, as I thought was the case when I listened to him, I find I am in complete agreement with almost everything he said with reference to representation for the religious minority.</P>
      <P>I have been a nationalist all my life and I have always maintained that the religious minority had nothing to fear from the majority in this country. After 14 years in public life I have not changed that opinion one iota.  I believe that what the Minister stated was quite true and I have no fear whatever of any religious bigotry on the part of the leaders of any Party in the Saorstát.  I wish I could say the same of that part of Ireland which is politically separated from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minority to which I referred in my speech on this Bill is the minority which is unwilling to attach itself to any of the organised political Parties <Col N="2231" /> and which includes Catholics and non-Catholics. I received a letter a short time ago from a Catholic friend of mine in the South of Ireland which expresses the views of that minority much better than I could do, and I propose to read it to the House.  It is addressed to me and is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Senator Douglas&mdash;I suppose that, with the approaching abolition of the Seanad, your active participation in what are called public affairs will be coming to an end.  I cannot find it in my heart to commiserate with you on that.  As you know, I take no part in politics, but it does seem to me that there is little scope at present, and may be less in the future, for anyone who is unwilling to attach himself to either of the two principal political Parties.  There are men in both those Parties whose views I respect, although I may not agree with them, and others whose views I dislike.  But it is obvious that neither Party welcomes men of an independent turn of mind who think for themselves and who will not invariably be responsive to the Party Whip.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal difference between them is transitory, though it will take some time to pass away.  Its cause lies in the animosities arising out of the civil war; and, unhappily, I find that these animosities are to some extent inherited by the younger generation.  &lsquo;The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's teeth are set on edge.&rsquo; But on the question that transcends all others, namely, the type of civilisation which it is desirable for us to work for, the two Parties are at one.  They have in mind a Gaelic State, which I regard as a figment of the imagination and the pursuit of which as a chimera.  One Party calls itself the Tribe of Gaels and the other the Warriors of Fál, both forgetting that the complex and beautiful thing which is Irish life is compact of the descendants of Gaelic, Norman, Jacobite, Cromwellian, Williamite and post-Williamite invaders &mdash; descendants whose character and ideals have been moulded and <Col N="2232" /> brought to fruition in this land of Ireland and who in turn have given it their love.  It is as if a great political party in England or France were to adopt the title of Bowmen of Senlac or Knights of Charlemagne.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This insistence on the hegemony of the Gael has no relation to the facts of history.  It would have been abhorrent to Tone, to Davis, to Mitchel or to Parnell; and it is abhorrent to me.  I am a Gael by origin, but I regard the writings of Swift, Goldsmith, Sheridan, Berkeley, Burke, Carleton, Russell, Yeats and a host of others as part of my heritage; and I am not going to jettison them at the bidding of anybody.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Both Parties profess a desire for a united Ireland, but they imagine a vain thing if they suppose it can now be on the basis of a Gaelic civilisation.  We cannot, like Joshua, bid the sun to stand still.  If we are sincere in our desire for unity, we ought to take pride in the heroism of our people on whatever side they fought in our old wars &mdash; of the Prentice Boys of Derry no less than of the defenders of Limerick.  A knowledge of the history of one's country is a valuable thing, but when it imports into the discussion of the too insistent problems of the present day the dissensions of centuries ago it is no less than a menace.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a world in which religion is assailed from all sides, one of the greatest bulwarks of Christianity is to be found in the English-speaking men and women of our race who at present are free as British subjects to work in every part of that vineyard which is the Empire.  For that reason, and also because I regard it as an indispensable condition of a united Ireland, I am in favour of our continuance as a member-state of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope you will excuse these random reflections.  The views to which they give expression are held, I know, by numbers of educated Catholics, and I should not be surprised if they were the views of many non-Catholics as well.  But they are not those of either of our <Col N="2233" /> two principal Parties, and no man proclaiming them would have a chance of election to the Dáil.  Time teaches, however, as well as heals, and I am not altogether without hope for the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this House will agree that that is a remarkable letter, and that it puts forward a certain minority view with great clearness.  I do not read it as expressing my own views exactly, but as expressing the views which are sincerely held by a considerable number of citizens who are absolutely loyal Irishmen.  I believe persons who cannot subscribe to the programme of either Party, whether for the reasons given by my correspondent from the South or for other reasons, would have a better chance of election for a university constituency as an independent than for any other constituency. I do not agree with the Minister when he stated that an independent educationist would have very little chance of success in either university.  If he will refer to the last contested election for Dublin University he will see that the unofficial candidate was within a few votes of unseating one of the sitting members.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the point at this stage, but I wish to make it clear that my remarks on the Second Stage and in Committee on this Bill as to the effect which this Bill and the Bill for the abolition of this House may have on minority representation were not intended to refer to the religious minority as such, but to the political minority which does not accept any of the organised political Parties.</P>
    <P>I believe that the arguments used in relation to this Bill, particularly when taken in conjunction with the other Bills which I have mentioned, will make it much more difficult for that political minority to obtain representation in the Oireachtas&mdash;and that, in my opinion, will be bad for the country.</P>

      <P>I heard with great pleasure Senator Douglas reading this letter.  I would be very glad if the letter were printed and published all through the country, because, notwithstanding what the writer says, there are a large number of people in the Party to which I belong who <Col N="2234" /> would subscribe to the views of that writer.  I have myself expressed those views in print and on public platforms whenever I have been given a chance to do so, because these views are the only common-sense views.  I am sure patriotic people of every class and creed in the country would subscribe to the views of this admirable letter that Senator Douglas has read for us.</P>

      <P>Anyone listening to Senator Douglas would come to the conclusion that this Bill is aimed solely at the minority in this country. In my density I cannot feel what on earth the letter that Senator Douglas has read has got to do with the amendment before the House.  Realising the serious responsibility cast upon the public representative who flirts with the cause of education in the interests of any other cause whatever, I asked myself the question&mdash;has this privileged Parliamentary franchise for the universities justified its continuance even until the next general election? Do we not indeed know that it is only camouflaging education in the interests of party purposes?  I take it that this amendment means &mdash; at all events, the literal meaning of it is &mdash; that this Bill should be held up, in the words of Senator Counihan, to allow the professors and graduates to make their views heard.  The vast majority of the people of this country have long ago found out what this Parliamentary franchise for the university means. They have found it out in the past, and they are fools if they do not know to where it is leading in the future. They are not fools not to know that it is merely a stepping stone for promotion for those who render political services to the Government in power. An argument was used here that professors and graduates are against this Bill.  I had a conversation with a few professors and a few graduates, and I found that they were entirely in favour of the Bill.  They welcomed the Bill as a good Bill and as a help to education &mdash; and they gave their reasons for saying so.  These reasons I have jotted down.  I hope I will not be out of order, Sir, in reading for the House the opinions of some professors and graduates who are in favour of the <Col N="2235" /> Bill.  They stated that Parliamentary elections held within the universities turned them for the time being into a kind of political arena.  Discipline became completely disorganised on account of many professors and graduates taking different sides, each side endeavouring to return the candidate of their political faith.  Groups were formed and bitterness and friction created.  In the excitement of the election the interests of education did not prevail; they became neglected.  Professors and graduates, when they go out in the world, hope for advancement not so much because of their educational qualifications as because of the support and help they give at election times to the candidates of the Government in power which they were backing. We see that the argument which is used against this Bill affects none of these men.  I could give their names if it were so desired.  They say that Parliamentary elections held within the universities are the curse of education and merely retard it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to insist on the amendments made by the Seanad, but not for the reasons indicated in the letter read by Senator Douglas.  A great many things in the letter are, doubtless, true, but it seems to me, from its tone, to be based on a consciousness of superiority, whether well or ill-founded.  I do not know who wrote the letter but I do not think that representation of his type would be of great value.  I do not agree that university representation is good <Col N="2236" /> merely because it enables men to enter the Dáil who will not attach themselves to any existing Party, or who do not find any existing Party good enough for them.  The truth is that university representation, as we have seen it operate in practice, has given us men whose work in the Dáil has been of great value to the Assembly. Some of the best of them are good party men and their value to the Dáil has been none the less for their Party connection.  Some of them would not have entered politics if they had to engage in the ordinary constituency contest, though they might remain in politics having once entered.  There are others who could not enter the Dáil through election in an ordinary constituency, but I do not think that that is due to an attitude of unwillingness to trust or accept any existing Party or any party that may be formed.  I object to the Bill because it abolishes something that, in practice, has worked out well &mdash; whatever theoretical arguments may be used against it.  I object to it because it was introduced without having the seal the Government claims for all its other Constitutional measures &mdash; a mandate &mdash; and I object to it because it cannot be regarded as a vindication of any democratic principle.  It seems to me to be introduced, not for the purpose of vindicating a principle, but with a view to obtaining an immediate tactical advantage.  It is for these reasons that I object to the Bill and not because of a desire to have a minority who will not agree with any Party brought into the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Vice-President, who is not accustomed to run away from his statements, to give me one example to bear out his assertion of the other day&mdash; that people who were not university men had contributed just as much to Ireland as those who were.  From the days of Hugh O'Neill (who was at Oxford), down to Swift, Berkeley, Lucas, Molyneux (whose books were burned by a common hangman), Tone, Davis and Parnell, down to our own time, with the exception of certain letter writers of to-day, all the intelligent moulders of Irish thought, all our idealists and all our statesmen <Col N="2237" /> have, in some way or other, been associated with higher education or education of a type similar to that imparted by the universities of to-day. I am sorry the robust words of Senator O'Neill died away before he could have contradicted me.  Can the Vice-President give me as many names of persons who were not associated with the universities as I can give him of those who were who have helped this country or the ideal of human freedom?</P>

      <P>Except for the question put by Senator Gogarty, I do not think that there is anything for me to answer.  The Senator must have misread what I said. He was not here, I think, when I spoke.  I did not speak of university men having given service to Ireland. I spoke of university men who gave service in this legislative Assembly.  I assume that that is giving service to Ireland but I was not dealing with <Col N="2238" /> the matter in the historic sense which Dr. Gogarty has in mind.  I was thinking of men of university education and representatives of the universities and of others whose names will come to mind when one thinks of membership of the Dáil or of this House since it was established.  Although there are no direct representatives of the universities here, there are university men and university professors.  It was with that aspect of the question I was dealing and not with the part taken by university men or university representatives in the history of Ireland. I was dealing with these men as members of the legislative Assembly.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - National Health Insurance and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill, 1935&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four matters dealt with in this Bill, viz.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  an amendment of Section 17 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1923, so far as it refers to the insurability of seamen,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> (2)  the constitution of the Committee of Management of Cumann an Arachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte;</P>
    <P>(3)  the position of soldiers under both the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and</P>
    <P>(4)  the recovery from employers of contributory pensions lost owing to their default.</P>
    <P>This is the order in which they occur in the Bill and I will deal with them in that order.</P>
    <P>Amendment of Section 17 of the Act of 1923 enables reciprocal arrangements to be made with Great Britain to have the criterion for payment of health insurance contributions, in the case of seamen employed on a ship registered in one country but owned in the other, either the country of registration of the ship or the country in which the owner resides or has his principal place of business.  The existing law does not permit of the country of residence of the seaman being made the test.  In order to enable this to be done, if considered desirable, the proposed amendment of Section 17 of the Act of 1923 is being made.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain amending legislation to that effect has already been passed in the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act of 1935.  It will be understood that the legislation of itself will make no change in the existing position of seamen, but will merely place the Minister in a position to agree to the amendment of the reciprocal arrangements (subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance) if he is satisfied that it is in the best interests of seamen to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Constitution of the Committee of Management of the Unified Society.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Prior to the passing of the 1933 Act one of the conditions precedent to the approval of a society was that its constitution should provide for its affairs being subject to the absolute control of its members.  In framing the 1933 Act it was felt that it would not be unreasonable to give employers representation on the committee on the grounds that they contributed largely <Col N="2240" /> to the funds and that they had an interest in the administration of the benefits.  It was similarly considered desirable that the State which also contributed largely should be represented on the committee.  This was effected by giving the Minister power to appoint three trustees who become <i>ex officio</i> members of the committee. This course had the additional advantage of providing an effective safeguard for the custody of the funds.  It was, however, considered essential that the old principle of giving a controlling interest to the members themselves should be preserved, and the Act provided that there should be nine members representative of insured persons.  The proposed committee was, therefore, to consist of:</P>
    <P>Three trustees appointed by the Minister;</P>
    <P>Three representatives of employers also appointed by the Minister;</P>
    <P>Nine representatives of insured persons to be elected in the prescribed manner by members of the Unified Society.</P>
    <P>The provisional committee set up to bring the Unified Society into being are due to go out of office on or before the 13th July next, and it now becomes necessary to make regulations providing for the manner in which the representatives of insured persons are to be elected.</P>
    <P>This question of an election by the members of the Unified Society of nine persons to represent them on the committee of management presents many difficulties, the most serious of which is the nomination of candidates.  Even assuming that the difficulty of the nomination of suitable candidates could be overcome, an election by ballot would be both expensive and haphazard in view of the fact that the electorate of over 500,000 is widely scattered throughout the Saorstát and that the names of the candidates would convey nothing to the voters, the vast majority of whom would probably not vote at all.  The real difficulty, however, is the nomination of candidates.  It would not be possible to limit the number of candidates to <Col N="2241" /> be nominated.  It is probable that a disproportionate number of candidates would be nominated: the number could conceivably be 500,000. Furthermore, it would be impossible to secure that the candidates, if elected, would be suitable and competent to be entrusted with the control and management of the affairs of the Society.</P>
    <P>The Government have explored every avenue with a view to finding some practical solution of the problem without interfering with the principle that the management and control of national health insurance business should be in the hands of the insured persons themselves.  To leave the nomination of the members' representatives to Labour organisations might possibly have met the difficulty but for the fact that such organisations include in their membership only a small proportion of the working population.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is probable also that that membership is mainly concentrated in the urban areas, and that consequently in many cases Labour would have no claim to the nomination of representatives for the rural areas.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the Government believe the problem of the insured persons' representation on the committee can best be solved by giving to Labour the right to nominate three members and by adopting a delegate system of election for the remaining insured persons' representatives on the committee.  Under this system, delegates (who must be insured persons) will first be chosen for each county and county borough area, on the basis of one delegate for every 5,000 members.  These delegates will meet and elect from among themselves on a territorial basis five members to act on the committee of management.  The difficulty here is the selection of the delegates.  An attempt to elect them would be open to the same objections as apply to the direct election of members of the committee, and it is, therefore, provided that they shall be nominated by the county and county borough councils, these bodies being regarded as sufficiently democratic to be entrusted with the duty.  It is believed that by <Col N="2242" /> taking the county or county borough as the unit for the selection of delegates the widest possible representation can be given to the insured members. Each county under this arrangement will be entitled to nominate at least one delegate.  Moreover, the provision in the Bill for territorial elections ensures a fair representation to both rural and urban interests.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the Committee of Management is responsible for the direction and control of a scheme which is financed by contributions compulsorily collected from insured persons and their employers, and supported to a very appreciable extent at the cost of the taxpayer, the Government take the view that, in order to ensure a proper standard of administration, there should be an independent chairman, who would be appointed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    <P>The new committee of fifteen members provided by the Bill is therefore as follows: a chairman to be appointed by the Minister; the three trustees for the time being, appointed by the Minister; three members representative of employers of insured persons, to be appointed by the Minister; three members to be nominated by the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress; and five members to be elected territorially in a manner to be prescribed by delegates nominated by county and county borough councils.</P>
    <P>Of these five members, two will be elected by the Leinster delegates from among their own number, two by the Munster delegates from among their own number and one by the delegates from the remaining counties in Saorstát Eireann from among their own number.  This provision ensures that the insured persons in all the provinces will have direct representation on the Committee of Management of the Society.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that the insured persons will be in the majority on the committee, thereby preserving the principle that the insured shall have a controlling voice in the affairs of the Society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> The Bill also contemplates that the chairman, trustees, and employers' representatives, who are all to be appointed by the Minister, shall hold office for a prescribed period, and that the remaining eight members shall be appointed annually.  Provision is also made for the payment to the committee members of such allowance (if any) as the Minister may from time to time determine, and also for the payment of travelling expenses and allowances for maintenance and loss of wages to the delegates, who will be appointed for three years.</P>

      <i>The position of soldiers under the National Health Insurance Acts and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Some 1,200 or 1,300 serving soldiers failed or were not afforded an opportunity to exercise the option given them by the Act of 1923 of becoming insured during their army service. Under the existing law these men are not entitled to be insured in respect of their army service, as the option was not exercised within the statutory period of three months allowed for bringing them into insurance.  Power is sought in the Bill to bring these men into health insurance as from the 6th January, 1936.  It is also proposed in the Bill to make health insurance compulsory in future for all soldiers who enlist for long service, or who re-enter the armed forces for long service.  It is not proposed to insure as soldiers men enlisted for short periods of service unless they were already insured persons under the National Health Insurance Acts, in which case they will be insured as ordinary contributors at the full employed contributor rate (8d. a week).</P>
    <P>This opportunity is also taken, subject to the general principles just mentioned, to re-enact the main provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts in relation to the armed forces, with a view to clarifying the entire position.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill to qualify at once for widows' and orphans' pensions at the contributory <Col N="2244" /> rate all soldiers in the permanent force who had over 104 weeks of continuous army service on 6th January, 1936, and to ensure that those with less than 104 weeks' continuous service on that date shall become qualified for contributory pensions on the completion of 104 weeks' army service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recovery of lost benefit under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The last section of the Bill empowers the dependent of a deceased workman or the Minister on behalf of such dependent to recover from an employer the amount of any loss sustained under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act by reason of such employer's default in the payment of contributions. The employer's liability will extend over the period from the date of his employee's death up to four weeks after the date on which all the contributions in arrears are paid up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932 authorised the making of grants to the extent of £700,000 towards the erection or reconstruction of houses up to 1st April, 1935.  The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1934 increased the amount to £1,400,000 and at the same time extended the date of completion to the 31st March, 1937.  It has become necessary to introduce the present Bill because the moneys already made available have been exhausted and provision must be made to meet the grants to be made to private persons and public utility societies who erect or reconstruct houses before 1st April, 1937.  The Bill now before you is intended to implement the Acts of 1932 and 1934 by making available a further sum of £700,000 for the payment of these grants.  The Government's housing programme initiated by the Act of 1932, made provision for generous financial assistance to the three main house building agencies, local authorities, private persons and public utility societies.  The activities of local authorities to meet the needs of their respective districts continue apace and it is expected that these needs will be met within the allotted period.  The assistance given to private persons and public utility societies is intended as a help towards the solving of the general housing problem and as an offset to that of the local authorities who were faced with a very heavy housing programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill only deals with <Col N="2246" /> the provision of houses by private persons and public utility societies and I do not propose, therefore, to deal further with the activities of local authorities for which the parent Act of 1932 still provides financial aid.  It suffices to say that the progress made is well up to expectations.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House I shall detail the activities of private persons and public utility societies up to the 31st December, 1935.  At that date, a sum of £303,898 had been paid in grants in respect of 5,344 new houses completed in urban areas; £434,818 in respect of 6,786 new houses completed in rural areas; and £176,354 in respect of 4,538 houses reconstructed by small farmers and agricultural labourers. Thus, within a period of three and a half years the satisfactory position has been reached wherein 12,130 new houses are completed and 4,538 existing houses reconstructed.  In passing, I am happy to be able to record the erection of 16,308 houses by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The erection of new houses in rural areas has, up to the present, commanded the greater proportion of grants made to private persons and public utility societies.  This fact is not without significance.  An examination of the position reveals that the counties where housing conditions were worst are those which have made most progress in the erection of new houses.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (i) of sub-section (c) of Section 5 of the 1932 Act, provision was made for the granting of financial aid towards the erection of houses by public utility societies in urban areas for letting at rents approved by the Minister.  Public utility societies have been slow to avail themselves of these grants, and only four societies have in hands the erection of 160 houses, of which 36 have been completed.  However, should any further houses be provided in this way before the 1st April, 1937, the grants at the existing rates will be paid.  The provision of the parent Act enabling grants to be paid to local authorities and philanthropic societies for the renovation of existing tenements has not been made use of to the extent anticipated.  Difficulties have been experienced in securing suitable properties at reasonable expense. <Col N="2247" /> Any schemes which have been formulated up to the present can only be regarded as experimental.  The number of philanthropic societies which have undertaken such work is two, and the number of tenements renovated with State assistance 22.  Present indications go to show that undertakings of this nature will in the main have to be promoted by local authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>The remission of rates for a period of seven years granted by the 1932 Act continues.  This provision is not set aside by Section 2 of the Bill now before the House.  Section 2 of the present Bill is only inserted to meet the wishes of the Commissioner of Valuation. Section 10 (5) of the 1932 Act provided that the valuation of a hereditament or tenement of a house availing of the reconstruction provisions of the Act would not be increased for seven years after reconstruction. At the same time similar relief was, in practice, afforded under the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852 (Section 14) in respect of new farm buildings.  Cases have arisen in which the Commissioner of Valuation has been obliged to afford double relief as in the case of a farmer who completed the reconstruction at the close of the exemption period previously given under the Valuation Act. It is clear that the intention was not to afford such dual relief.</P>
    <P>Saorstát materials and appliances are being used increasingly in the erection and reconstruction of houses for which grants are being paid under the Acts.  The payment of grants is conditional on the use of Saorstát materials as far as possible, and the failure to comply with this condition leads to a substantial reduction or in some cases to forfeiture of the entire grant.  A list of Saorstát manufacturers of house-building materials and appliances has been compiled by the Department, and there is no longer any reasonable cause for failure on the part of builders to use Saorstát materials.  The percentage of Saorstát materials used in house-building in 1932 was, it was estimated. 30 per cent. of the whole.  This had increased in 1934 to 45 per cent., and to-day it is 53 per cent. approximately. When the further amount for <Col N="2248" /> private building to be provided by the present Bill is allocated, it is intended to review the question of making grants to private persons and public utility societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is indebted to the Minister for the interesting survey he has made with regard to housing conditions and the progress achieved.  We all welcome the Minister's proposal to make available another £700,000 to assist in dealing with the tremendous problem of housing we have to face in this country.  In the Minister's survey he drew comparisons with regard to the rate of progress that had been made in urban areas and rural areas for the different classes provided for in the 1932 Act.  I have taken, during all my life, an interest in this problem of housing.  I think I understand the problem at least as far as Dublin is concerned, and notwithstanding all we have been doing during the last few years, I am not satisfied with the rate of progress that has been made. We have, if I might say so, two problems to meet in Dublin.  The municipality is dealing with a tremendous problem, and I think it can be said that as far as the municipality in Dublin are concerned, they are doing everything humanly possible to cope with this tremendous problem.  It is an enormous problem and they are doing their level best to deal with it; but I am sorry to have to say that they have been considerably hampered in getting ahead with the work.  At the moment the municipality have numerous schemes on hand.  The principal scheme I might say is the building of a new town where there have been already laid seven miles of roads, and seven miles of sewers, and the municipality tackled that tremendous job in a business-like, and a statesman-like way.  They intend to provide accommodation for at least 10,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately when the municipality endeavoured to get sufficient money to get on with the work, and made an appeal to the public to subscribe to a loan, with the best security in the world behind it, for the <Col N="2249" /> sake of one-quarter per cent in the interest they failed to get the money required.  That handicapped the municipality in carrying on that tremendous work.  But I am happy to say that when the municipality attempted to float another loan it was entirely successful, and they are now getting on with the work.  I think it is only fair to say that as far as the Dublin Corporation and its officials are concerned, they are doing everything possible to cope with this problem.</P>
    <P>The municipality has to provide for people living under inhuman conditions in slum dwellings.  They are building a type of house situated in the most healthy part of the city and very good surroundings.  They are building three-roomed houses provided with baths for 7/6 a week; and they are building four-roomed houses with baths, hot and cold water, for 10/- a week.  They are building numerous flats in the centre of the city providing for families who cannot well live far away from their work. They are dealing with that part of this tremendous problem which must be dealt with first, that is with the most deserving people.  But there is another class.  There are artisans, and people of that type, whom for many years to come the Dublin municipality will not be able to cater for, because at the moment the Corporation are taking families of not less than ten in number and it will take years to get down to those of six in family.  The small families of the artisan class are without provision at present except through the efforts of the utility societies.  The money provided in this Bill is to meet that particular type of person; and for the purpose of enabling private speculators and public utility societies to provide houses for people not provided for by the local authorities.  There is something more required than the provision in this Bill of £700,000 to meet the big problem that exists in the city.</P>
    <P>In other parts of the country the local authorities are enabled to provide money, I think, under the Local Loans Act, for the purpose of making advances to enable people to purchase <Col N="2250" /> this particular type of house.  The difficulty in Dublin is that the Dublin Corporation are not entitled to make application for advances under the Local Loans Act, and that they have to provide the money that is to be lent to meet the demand for such advances, under the Small Dwellings Act.  The Minister referred to slowing down.  I think one of the principal reasons for slowing down, in the Dublin Metropolitan area, was very largely because of the fact that the Corporation had exhausted the money at its disposal for the purpose of advances under the Small Dwellings Act and, therefore, they had to slow down.  The particular types of persons I am speaking about are not in the position to raise money by any other means than advances under the Small Dwellings Act.</P>
    <P>I have some little association with a public utility society &mdash; the Dublin Building Operatives Building Society. We attempted to build a type of house suitable for the artisan class.  We took a piece of ground from the Corporation on which we erected 90 houses.  We built them in brick.  They were five-roomed houses with hot and cold water in bathroom and scullery.  The tenants paid a deposit of £40; we gave them the advantage of the £60 grant from the Government, and the Corporation advanced £400 on each of these houses. After meeting their demands &mdash; repayment of interest on capital, spread over a period of 35 years, payment of ground-rent and payment of one-third of the rates &mdash; these people are living in five-roomed houses built of brick for a total payment of 13/- per week for each house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>How much is the ground rent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>£5 a year, and that is covered in the repayment.  If a man or woman was getting married in Dublin and looking for house accommodation they have to go to a slum area and are asked for 10/- a week for a single room, showing the necessity there is for utility societies to cope with the problem to be faced.  Everyone in Dublin is continually pestered with applicants for houses.  Unfortunately we are not able to provide for them, although the <Col N="2251" /> public utility societies are doing a little to help in this tremendous problem with which we are faced. From our experience of the ordinary artisan type we know they have no other method or means of raising the amount necessary to purchase a house, because everyone knows that renting a house in Dublin is out of the question. No one rents a house now if they can possibly avoid it.  When a house becomes vacant it is immediately sold, and because of the dearth of accommodation people agree to pay prices far beyond their value.  Likewise, when renting flats, they are paying up to 30/- a week, and they are paying it, not because it is a just rent, but because they have no other alternative if they want housing accommodation.</P>
      <P>I mention this matter because, from my experience, I believe, and I think most people who understand this problem realise, that it is necessary that money should be available to enable tenants to find the balance of the purchase money required to enable work on the building of a house to proceed.  There was a considerable slackening down because money was not available to enable these tenant purchasers to purchase their little houses.  Thanks to the success of the last Corporation Loan there is a certain amount of money available, but it will not last long.  When that money runs out, there will have to be a slackening down again.  Some people are fortunate enough to be able to make arrangements through other channels, but the ordinary tradesman type is not in a position to do so.  If he goes to one of the insurance societies he has to take out a policy with very high premiums, and they are generally put to the pin of their collars to meet the requirements for their houses without having to pay high premiums on a policy of insurance. I agree that it is the first duty of the Corporation to find money and to make it available for the real poor in the slums.  They are the real problem which we have to deal with, but, side by side with that, there is another problem, and something must be done to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2252" /> I know from past experience that the Minister has always been very sympathetic in this matter.  I have discussed it with him more than once, and he is very sympathetic.  He knows what the problem is, and all I say is that when the Corporation does look for money to deal with this housing problem the people who have the money ought not to hesitate to give it. I have all my life been listening to people being full of sympathy towards the housing of the working classes. They are full of sympathy for the slum dwellers, but they will have to go a little further than merely being sympathetic. Sympathy is very good, but bricks and mortar are the things required to deal with this problem, and they cannot be bought and put together unless the necessary finances are forthcoming.  I think this problem is the most urgent we have to face in this country to-day, and I go so far as to say that, with the solution of this housing problem of ours, we shall have solved many of our other problems as well.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill.  I made the statement I have made with the deliberate object of finding out whether means can be found for making money available under the Small Dwellings Act in order to allow the second portion of the problem to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a good deal of State money has been spent in the promotion of housing within the last nine or ten years, but I think we have to admit that, notwithstanding that fact, we are very much behind the rate of progress at which we should proceed if we propose to solve this problem within a reasonable period.  I think we are inclined to boast a little too much about what we have done, and, consequently, tend to a slowing down of progress.  The President, in his broadcast to America, boasted about having built 33,000 houses since 1932. The City of Birmingham, in the same period, has built about 40,000.  Any one city across the Channel that has had a housing problem has built far more houses since the war than the whole of the Free State has built.  For instance, you have the case of the Leeds Corporation, which proposes to <Col N="2253" /> spend 14½ million pounds, in addition to what has already been done, in the next five years for slum clearance and house construction, so I think the less we publish to the world our figures, the more likely we are to impress them with the progress we are making.  The progress we have been making in the last four years or so is good only in comparison with the snail-like progress that preceded it, so that when we think we are doing marvellously well, it is only in comparison with things that were exceptionally bad, and we are still a long way behind what most progressive nations are doing in this respect.</P>
      <P>This money that is being spent is not always spent with the care and surveillance that is necessary.  To my own knowledge, grants have been given where they should not have been given because of the faulty type of construction of the houses concerned.  I have in mind a housing scheme not very many miles from Dublin where no provision whatever for ventilation under any of the floors was made, where the little bit of garden came right to the back door, and where not even a square yard of concrete yard was given. Even the path into the door had to be made by the tenant himself.  After a while the absence of any ventilation under the floors, the provision of which seems to me to be an elementary principle of construction, caused such dampness that the tenants who could afford to have a bit of linoleum or carpet had to pull them up because they got rotten.  The paper fell off the walls on account of that dampness.  All this matter was reported to the manager of the district in question. Numerous letters were written to him without the slightest effect.  The Minister's Department was written to about a year ago, but although persistent letters were written and demands put forward by the tenants who were purchasing these houses on the instalment principle for some amelioration of or some attention to this horrible system of house building, not a solitary thing has been done, and beyond a mere acknowledgment, no redress has been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, that money has been received under false pretences.  It is a <Col N="2254" /> wicked waste of public funds, and it is a scandal that either the manager in question, appointed by the Government, or the Department of State concerned, will give no redress to the tenants.  I saw another scheme out in the same district in respect of which, in my opinion, no grant whatever should have been made.  You opened the door of a house, and in one step you were into the living room.  There was no privacy, good, bad, or indifferent, and you almost put your foot on the first step of the stairs as you stepped into the living room.  The stairs were so narrow that no furniture, no matter how small, could be got up the stairs except it was taken in sections. Then there is this question of erecting three-roomed dwellings in the slums.  It is, in my opinion, a frightfully retrograde step at this stage of our development, and a sort of admission that we are progressing backwards. Did anyone ever hear of a one-roomed flat being constructed at public expense?  Yet we are constructing one and two-roomed flats in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about high ground rents, and the awful evil they are.  A case came to my notice within the last week where, in the case of a £700 house &mdash; or £715, to be exact &mdash; built on Dublin Corporation ground, the ground rent is £9 10s.  We have the Dublin Corporation going out on a profiteering scheme in regard to ground rents.  I inquired into the matter because I know the young man who is trying to purchase a house on the instalment system.  I asked how it was he was being asked such an abnormal figure for a small plot of ground, and the explanation he got, on inquiry, was that it belonged to the Dublin Corporation. Consequently, our benevolent City Manager had to mulct this young man, with a young family, to the extent of £9 10s. per annum, where the average rent would be £6, at the very most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not built by the Corporation.  It is built by a gentleman calling himself a public utility society, and that is the explanation of the high rent.  I have no more to say in regard to that except that when it comes to discussing ground rents I think the Corporation should set an example and when letting land for the purpose of building to private speculators they should set it at a ground rent that the tenant could afford to pay.</P>
      <P>I entirely approve of the public utility society, but I am afraid there is also a tendency in some directions for this to become just a private speculative business.  The case was mentioned to me quite recently of a society in which the members of the committee are drawing salaries that very few directors of private companies draw.  Here again I think a certain amount of surveillance should be exercised by the State.  I do not know to what extent the accounts of a public utility society are audited or examined in the making of a grant, but in view of some of the information at my disposal, I think it is desirable that the closest surveillance should be exercised in regard to the funds and the accounts of these societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that where grants are made it should be the business of somebody, acting on behalf of the State to see, for instance, that the woodwork put into the houses should not be of the despicable character you see installed in certain houses. It is fresh and badly worked out and it is generally not only an eyesore but a perfect nuisance to people afterwards when it begins to shrink and crack and after a year it has to be reconstructed by painting to try to put it into form again.  A lot of people are just speculating for the purpose of making big profits out of the housing requirements of the community, and to the extent that it can be prohibited it should be.  Some builders excuse their shortcomings on the ground that they have to use Irish material &mdash; that the doors and the windows are of Irish material and, consequently, they must be bad.  I cannot understand why that should <Col N="2256" /> be.  I do know that is the excuse advanced by a lot of contractors for scandalous work for which they have got a grant from the State.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, notwithstanding all that was said about the profits made out of rents, that the building of houses for the purpose of letting them is not an economic proposition at present.  If it were, surely there are people anxious to make a fortune who would build houses and let them. But it is not.  The anxiety on the part of the landlords to sell houses as they become vacant is another indication that there are no fortunes to be made out of house rents just now.  Consequently, it is well-nigh impossible for a person to get a house to rent, except in a rare case on exorbitant terms.  An attempt is being made to cater for the very poor by the corporations and public authorities, but the class mentioned by Senator Farren and others, such as clerks with small or fair salaries, and a lot of people in a very small way of business have nobody to help them except to the extent that they can, under the Local Loans Fund, secure a loan on long terms at a reasonable rate of interest to enable them to provide themselves and their families with a home.</P>
    <P>That is a direction in which the Government should be encouraged to lend or to enable local authorities to lend a fairly considerable amount of money.  It seems to me to be a perfectly good investment.  These tenants are all people who are able to put down a little money as an instalment and the house itself is a good security.  They pay back the money at a rate of interest which is higher than the local authority or the State gets it at, so that there is no loss to the ratepayers or to the taxpayers. It is by that means that you will succeed eventually in housing a very large section of the community in decent conditions &mdash; not in three-room slums, or one-room flats, or constructions of that kind, but in the type of house that any community might be proud to see its average, middle-class citizens housed in.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that there will be a tendency to make money available <Col N="2257" /> in that direction.  For one thing, it will encourage house building, not only on the part of public utility societies, but also by private speculators, and we must encourage the private speculator if we are going to solve the housing problem.  He will build if he can sell, and he can only sell if the money is available, and the money is not available in the case of a large number of people who would like to buy and who could buy if they could get the money on reasonable terms.  It can be provided under the Local Loans Fund, and I would earnestly urge on the Government the desirability of fostering this aspect of the problem, just as well as the other aspect of it which covers the very poor.</P>

      <P>My position is that I was not able to hear Senator Farren's and Senator O'Farrell's remarks, and in case I repeat anything they have said, you will understand the position. I have had a very considerable experience of house building schemes in urban areas, and it is with very great pleasure that I am able to say that they are progressing, in urban areas at least, very favourably.  In my town, where I am chairman of the local authority, great progress has been made.  We have completed a scheme of 81 houses without any hindrance or bother either from the local authority or the Local Government Department.  We are able to produce a five-roomed house, complete with roads, sewerage, water, railings, footpaths to the door, etc., which can be let at a rent of 4/- per week. These houses have been occupied for some considerable time now, and, unlike the experience of Senator O'Farrell, I am glad to say that we have not had a single complaint from any tenant so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell's remarks did not seem to be of a very cheery nature.  It struck me that he seemed to have got his experience in some kind of secondhand way &mdash; a woman told me that a woman told her.  That may or may not be.  I am very glad to see that more has been done in the last couple of years in the way of house building than was done in the 25 years before.  There are little snags here and there which are only natural, but I think housing <Col N="2258" /> is progressing very well indeed, in urban areas anyhow.</P>
    <P>The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act is a very useful Act.  Under that Act a person who gets a loan from the local authority can build his own house and the house becomes his own property as long as he pays his annuity. With every payment he is redeeming the price of the house, and after a certain number of years the house will be absolutely his own property.  If he wants to dispose of his house after a certain number of years, or if he is changed from one town to another, he has a selling interest in the house.  I had occasion to observe the other day that a man who was in one of these houses for five years sold his house. He got approximately the amount of the annuities he had paid for the time he was in it, so that he had the house rent free practically for about five years.  That is a scheme that should be encouraged.  The only little snag, which may be adjustable, is that under these schemes, whether a number of houses are built or an individual house, the local authority is bound to provide sewerage, water and the other amenities to the town.  They do not come into full range for seven years. That sum that provides water and sewerage for the amenities I have mentioned is not included in the loan.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the ratepayers have to raise a loan and put it on the rates in order to supply that sewerage and water.  The result is that this comes very heavy on the urban ratepayers. Of course the time will come when this will be good business for the ratepayers, but I think it would be a good idea if some portion of the cost of the sewerage and waterworks was included in the loan to the individuals, who have to pay some portion of it, and not to have their unfortunate brothers who built houses half a century ago paying rates in order to provide these sewerage and waterworks schemes. The Minister ought to try to give some relief in that direction.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, in the urban areas in my own part of the country and in the neighbouring towns, housing is progressing at a wonderful rate.  The Minister at one time threw out the <Col N="2259" /> challenge that the local authorities could not go too fast for him in the building of houses.  He afterwards found out that one of the local authorities exceeded him by a few paces.  They had actually built houses before they applied for the loan at all. However, that thing was adjusted, and now everything is going on well.  I want to say that the slums in the small towns were just as bad as in the city. It is wonderful to see them disappearing year by year and month by month. I hope that by the end of this year we will have houses for workingmen and every class of man that will be fit for human habitation, and I am hoping that in my own town there will very soon be no such thing as a house unfit for human habitation.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to say anything on this Bill until Senator O'Farrell made a statement with regard to yesterday's broadcast by the President.  The Senator may have thought that the way in which he put his arguments was the proper way in which to do so &mdash; to utter disparagements against the Government.  These disparagments thrown on the efforts of the Government towards dealing with housing revealed, to my mind, a rather extraordinary attitude on the part of Senator O'Farrell.  I remember that as far back as 1929 in this House I had a number of amendments to move to a Housing Bill, and my recollection is that at that time Senator O'Farrell voted against my amendments and against the members of his own Party.</P>

      <P>Now, having said all that, I want to say that I was glad to hear the Minister say that the rural areas had taken such great advantage of the facilities given by the Government in the way of housing.  Now that the Government have gone so far to help the poorer section of the community in the rural areas, the Minister ought to examine the position further with a view to stretching out his assistance on the other side of the line for the rural people.  The housing accommodation for the live stock is altogether inadequate, so much so that oftentimes when the sow litters or the cow calves farmers have to make use of the warmth of the kitchen to help the animals over their difficulties.  A good deal of that sort of thing still happens because of the fact that there is inadequate accommodation for the live stock.  I know that some provisions have been made to help people to build those out-houses.  But it has not been taken up in the spirit in which housing should be gone into. I feel that small farmers are as much entitled to assistance in providing warmth and comfortable out-offices for their live stock as the people in the towns are for their claims for sewerage and waterworks.  After all, it is on the cleanliness and the comfort of the out-offices that the success of the smaller farmer in the way of producing good live stock depends.  These matters should be looked after.  I suggest to the Minister to concentrate on that question and to tackle it as wholeheartedly as he has tackled the provision of houses for the urban dwellers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks of Senator Farren and Senator O'Farrell hardly applied strictly to the provisions of this Bill.  However, when we are faced with an expenditure of <Col N="2261" /> £2,100,000, any Senator who criticises the manner in which the money is being spent is, with the concurrence of the Cathaoirleach, within the rules of order.  Both these Senators spoke with weight, because they knew what they were talking about.  They know the people who inhabit these houses, and any information they give to the House as to the construction of these buildings or the people inhabiting them is extremely valuable.  What have these Senators in mind as to the manner in which the expenditure of this money can be improved?  I take it that that is what the remarks of the Senators were directed to.  The Minister will be able to tell us what amount of Government inspection there is in respect of a house which is to receive part of a State grant.  Is any specification made out by the Government, the standard of which the house must reach?  Who gives the certificate on which the grant is paid?  Is he an ordinary Government employee, or is he an architect who has special knowledge of the building of this class of house?  In the City of Belfast some big contracts were carried out and, when an inquiry was held subsequently as to the manner in which they had been carried out and as to the materials used, there was a very big public scandal.  I do not suggest that any such thing is going on here, but Senator O'Farrell described houses which seemed to be very bad value, having regard to the materials, the rotted floors and want of ventilation under the floors.  These are all things which any one of us in the habit of arranging for building would know to be essential and would know should be provided for in the specification. Under the Government there ought to be some authority without whose certificate that the houses are built in accordance with specification the money would not be paid.  The Minister will be able to tell us what Department takes care of that, and how they make sure that the houses are rightly built before the money is paid. Whoever pays the money should call the tune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these houses are built of bad materials, there is something wrong. <Col N="2262" /> There ought to be specifications in respect of the one-room, two-roomed and three-roomed flats of which Senator O'Farrell spoke, and the conditions of the specification should be complied with before the State pays the money.  The Minister will, I presume, give us an assurance as to the inspection and certification required before the State pays the grant.</P>
    <P>The opinion seems to be that builders are not at present inclined to push ahead with the building of houses.  It does not seem to be a paying speculation. We are brought back, therefore, to the questions we were discussing the other day on the duties imposed by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I referred to these as interfering with building and raising the cost of building.  We have heard remarks as to the quality of the materials which are being compulsorily used under these various Orders.  I do not want to make accusations against manufacturers in this country, but I do think that if you went around the builders and asked them what kind of materials are available for their work in Ireland, they would tell you that they are not comparable with what they would put into these houses if they had a free hand.  If one were  the building industry, were making contracts for houses and knew that there was a power sitting over one which, at any moment, might compel one to alter the whole terms of the contract and take materials one had never specified and did not think of using, one would not be inclined to rush ahead with business. One of the reasons why house building is not going on better in this country is because of these duties upon imports for which nobody can allow.  They are coming out by the bushel every week and no man can provide for them in any contract.  So long as that goes on, you will have the same trouble as regards the building of houses.  Good material will not be used, and high class builders will not go into the business.  The Government should seriously consider what they are doing, because we are all agreed that we require decent housing for the people. It is, therefore, desirable to secure that <Col N="2263" /> the houses which are being assisted by the State will be fit to live in.  All this is completely outside the Bill, and I do not know how we could make the Minister answer these questions, but if he would give us any information on the matters I have mentioned I should be extremely grateful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in the discussion on this Bill if it were not for the fact that Senator O'Farrell and Senator Jameson have attempted to make a case on it that is not there at all.  We all know that the gerry-builder is as old as the City of Dublin, and nobody believes that, with the tremendous push in house building that has gone on in this country &mdash; the huge development that we have had in that way &mdash; we were going to eliminate the gerry-builder altogether.  Senator O'Farrell and Senator Jameson complained that in the houses that are going up provision is not made for having them properly ventilated with the result, as they say, that the flooring soon becomes rotten.  In my opinion, their remarks were altogether wide of what actually exists.  The Dublin Corporation are putting up very good, suitable houses.  Their contractors are not faced with any great difficulty in the matter of using a large proportion of Irish materials.  I agree, of course, that so far as the Corporation houses are concerned, there is a good deal of supervision to ensure that the right quality of Irish material goes into the houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the people who require the houses, I must say that the slum dwellers &mdash; those to whom many politicians owe their positions &mdash; are fairly well catered for.  I want, however, to put this point to the Minister: that it is about time the old citizens of Dublin got fair treatment in the allocation of new houses.  It is not fair to old residents, born and reared in the slums, to see men coming up from the country and getting Corporation houses in preference to them.  Let me give particulars of a case.  This is a family that can count on over 50 years' residence in the city.  The number of children in the family entitled the <Col N="2264" /> parents to get a Corporation house. The mother was delicate.  The apartments they were living in had been condemned by Dr. Russell, the City Medical Officer of Health, as being unfit for human habitation.  As a matter of fact, they were living in a cellar in Mountjoy Square.  I did everything in my power to influence the Corporation to give one of their new houses to that family, but without success.  We can all see Civic Guards occupying these Corporation houses. They get them in preference to people living in the slums and to people with small wages.  As a result of the refusal of the Corporation to give that family a house, the mother has since died. The children are now motherless.  The Corporation refused a house to that family, but they do not hesitate to give their new houses to people who are comparatively well off.  This is a matter that ought to be attended to by the Corporation.  It is far more important than some of the matters that have been raised here.</P>
    <P>I venture to say that the trades union that I belong to has more money in housing loans than any other trades union in Ireland.  Yet, despite that I have succeeded to a lesser extent to get houses for slum dwellers than some other people who have not anything like the amount that we have in these housing loans. I can say that in the case of every loan that has been floated, either by the Government or by the local bodies for housing purposes, our union has invested large sums of money in all of them, no matter what the rate of interest offered was.  We never recommend any except deserving cases for these new houses, and yet we fail to get houses for them.  That is an aspect of the housing problem that should be seriously taken up with the local bodies.  It appears to me that the people who get houses are those who are not the most deserving applicants but rather those with the biggest political pull.</P>
    <P>I admit that the efforts of the Government have gone a long way to solve the housing problem.  In the carrying out of that policy certain abuses, which were inevitable, crept <Col N="2265" /> in.  One of them, in my opinion, is the utility society.  These societies no longer serve the purpose for which they were organised, at least, a number of them.  It is certainly true to say that a considerable number of them are now limited companies.  So far as this Bill is concerned, my only regret is that it does not empower the borrowing of a larger sum of money.  I suggest to the Government that the time is opportune to borrow big sums of money for housing at a low rate of interest.  The present low rate of interest may not continue indefinitely, and, therefore, the Government should avail of present conditions and take power to enable local authorities to borrow larger sums for housing.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may say that, in my opinion, we might help to solve the complex question of hospital accommodation if we dealt with the housing of the working classes in a more generous way than we have been doing. Huge sums of money are accumulating in the sweepstakes' fund.  There is great trouble about the allocation of this money, the class of hospital that we are to have and so on.  But is it not the slums that provide almost all the patients for the hospitals?</P>

      <P>Well, the poorhouse is always there for him.  At any rate, it is the slums whether in the cities or in country towns, that provide almost all the patients for the hospitals. They are, so to speak, the material upon which the medical staffs are trained.  If the money from the sweepstakes is to be wisely spent we should consider allocating a certain amount of it for the housing of the working classes.  I regret that the Bill does not give power for the borrowing of larger sums of money to cure the awful cancer, due largely to wretched housing conditions, that exists in the City of Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain matters of fact I might be able to deal with, as I am sure the Minister will deal with matters of policy.  Senator Jameson referred to the fact that this Bill deals with the provision of grants <Col N="2266" /> and he doubted whether a discussion as to the use of the grants was in order. It seems to me that is very proper when dealing with grants to private persons.  Some of the discussion followed the course taken in the other House, and dealt largely with schemes by local authorities which are not within the scope of the Bill.  I am not at all astonished at Senator O'Farrell making the suggestion about Government surveillance over the quality of the materials that go into houses for which Government grants are made, but I am astonished at Senator Jameson making that plea.  It is quite evident that if the Government, on the score of making a grant of £45, were to make the surveillance he seems to desire in regard to the quality of the materials going into the houses, it would mean the appointment of armies of clerks of works for every private builder building houses, and a surveillance and interference with private persons' businesses which the Senator himself would be the first to oppose.  Let us bear in mind that the grants, particularly those to which the Senator referred, are £45 for £1,000 houses. I wonder would the Senator desire that all the business of persons building houses should be under the supervision of Government inspectors.  He asked what amount of inspection was made.  Even the amount of inspection given in respect of grants of £45 is resented by some builders.  Inspection takes place when the house is approved for a grant; there is also inspection when the house is half built, and there is inspection before the grant is paid, after the house is completed, but that inspection does not pretend to be an examination of every detail of the building.  It could not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidently not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator seems to desire would make it necessary for a clerk of works to be on the spot all the time.  If you want a cheap house you will not get it that way.  If you want to encourage private enterprise you will not do it that way.  If you want to do what I imagine Senator O'Farrell would not be averse to, to <Col N="2267" /> build houses for the middle-class, or the artisan class, as well as for slum dwellers, and to have them all built by a public authority, that could be done.  But I think Senators will have to bear in mind that if you are going to have constant surveillance in respect to grants of £45, you are going to add a great deal to the cost of administration, and you are going to have a great deal of opposition from private industrialists engaged in private building.  As to the quality of the materials, a committee in connection with the Prices Commission made an examination of the cost of building materials, and from half-a-dozen different persons outside the Prices Commission, public inspectors and private builders, assurances were given that the quality of the timber going into houses to-day is better than ever it was.  There have been doubts cast upon that assertion.  I think it is probably true to say that two or three years ago there was a certain quantity of timber imported which was not first class.  That statement is probably sustainable.  Because of complaints, and after a close examination of them, assurances were given by builders, architects and timber providers that the quality of the timber coming to this country at present is as good as ever it was, while some suggest that it is better than ever.  I can assure the Senator that that is the statement of responsible people who have no reason whatever for misleading the Government and who have no interest in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator repeated to-day in much fewer words, and in less detail, what he said last week, in regard to the effect on prices of duties upon certain building materials.  I am not going to say anything about the general question of the effect of protective duties.  I have always acknowledged, and I think it is undeniable, that the effect of duties of a protective character is, at least, in the first instance, towards an upward movement of prices.  But that touches on the general question of protection. <Col N="2268" /> Whether Senator Jameson is convinced in principle against protection or protective duties, I do not know, but that is not a matter we need enter upon at this stage.  There is a great deal of misunderstanding as to the effect on prices of houses, of these duties.  The Senator dealt particularly with cement, slates, timber and iron goods.  There is no duty on timber. Let us take cement, slates and iron goods, such as rain-water pipes, ranges and grates.  The Senator might be astonished to know that on a small house costing £500 the total cost of the cement used, the slates on the roof and the rain-water goods is not more than 10 per cent. of the cost of the house.  If the whole amount of the duties went into the cost of these materials, it would mean a very small total in the cost of the house, so that there is a tendency to exaggerate the effect of these duties upon the particular goods to which the Senator referred.</P>
    <P>He made a mistake last week in mentioning Irish cement.  I am sure that was due to a misunderstanding of the position.  He appeared to think that Irish cement was on the market and was being used, and was not as good as British cement.  He was told that there was no Irish cement being made at present.  Therefore no Irish cement was going into the walls of these houses.  The fact is that by far the greatest quantity of the cement used in house building here in the last few years has been Belgian and Danish, and so far from being of the inferior quality which the Senator suggested, there is no question whatever about its quality.  There is nothing to warrant the assertion that the quality of the cement going into houses is any less fit for that job than any cement made in the world.  For a Senator of his standing in the public light to suggest that the quality of the cement going into the houses is bad, is, I think, wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, as the Senator is dealing with this matter, that I was under the impression, from information I had, that some Irish <Col N="2269" /> cement was being used and that it was not good.  The Senator then said that no Irish cement was being used and that settled the matter.  I do not know any more about it.  If the Senator says that the cement is of excellent quality I agree.  Was there any duty on the cement coming in?  The Senator might deal with the point I raised, the duty on the cement that was being used in these houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the Senator withdraws anything he said I am satisfied. As to the effect of the duty on cement in 1932, the price to builders for Belgian and Danish cement in Dublin was 41/6 a ton.  In 1935 it was 30/-, until the duty of 5/- per ton was put upon it, and then the price rose to 35/-.  Three weeks ago the price was 40/6, because of the fact that the Danish and the Belgian manufacturers have come to an agreement and have arranged by a system of quotas that Ireland shall be within the scope of their arrangement and that prices must go up.  The price has gone up undoubtedly, but to-day it is at the same level as it was in 1932.  On the wisdom or unwisdom of putting a duty of 5/- on to the 30/- which was the price a few months ago, I am not going to dwell.  It raised the price to 35/-, which was 6/- less than in 1932. Whether that is a protective duty or not, it is for somebody else to argue. I think it is merely a Revenue duty, and it was announced as a Revenue duty.  It appears to me to be a Revenue duty which is better justified than many other duties which have been imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of Irish slates has risen from that which obtained in 1931-32, <Col N="2270" /> but it was asserted that the figure which then prevailed was quite uneconomic for the proprietors of quarries, even when they were paying very low wages.  That is a matter upon which I am not going to express an opinion.  The price has been raised by about 15 or 20 per cent. since that time.  Most of the public think that the Welsh slate is of better quality, but again the whole question of the desirability of assisting by State grants, bounties or protective duties, the development of Irish industries is raised.  If one is against that system, one would oppose these schemes, but having accepted them, I think it must be agreed that the effect of these various duties on the price of building materials has been relatively small and should not affect the price of houses for private persons to any great degree.</P>
    <P>If one is concerned about the cheapness of these houses, there is one aspect of the question, which, if dealt with, would have a much more considerable effect.  If one could persuade those who are interested and who have an influence with the money lending fraternity to induce them to reduce the rate of interest they charge for loans for house building, it would have a much more formidable effect on the price of houses than anything that could be said in regard to duties. Taking a house that would cost £500 or £600, over the period allowed for repayment, a reduction of even 1 per cent. would enable the purchaser to save over £100.  Perhaps the Senator would devote his attention to that aspect of the question of cheapening houses.  The Senator referred also to plans and specifications.  Of course, in respect to a private person's house, the private person can build his house to his own specification and plan.  The Government has in fact prepared model specifications which are available for any person who wishes to spend 2d. or 3d. for the use of them.  The Government, before it makes a grant, does not require that the person shall build his house according to that specification or plan.  Private enterprise is allowed full fling in that respect.  The builder of a private house has, within a certain size and within certain limits of structure, very great freedom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> When we come to local authorities, the local authority which has been asked for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, may have something to say in regard to the kind of house that is to be built, the quality of the structure, and many other conditions.  The local authority before it makes a loan requires to be satisfied in regard to the quality and the condition of the work, so that in one way or another the amount of check on the quality of the structure is much greater than the Senator would suggest.  When, however, you come to the private person who is building a house and who does not apply for a grant, the Government does not intervene.  The local authority may, in respect to certain aspects, but so far as the Government is concerned, it does not interfere with the man who is prepared to forego his £45.  He can to a large extent evade these duties and restrictions so that there is a certain amount of misconception as to the effect of these restrictions which the Senator has spoken of.  I agree with Senator Farren in his statements in regard to Dublin municipality and the work that it has set its hand to, though I am not so generous in my estimate of its work even in slum clearance and its rehousing programme. I agree entirely with him in saying that the local authority would be well advised to do all that it is possible for it to do, in respect to assisting building by public utility societies or even by private builders, so that we may have provided a class of houses which the artisan can purchase. The local authority's duty is not merely to make provision for slum dwellers.  The local authority's duty is to provide for the housing of the working classes and amongst the working classes are those people, artisans and clerks, who are prepared to pay a higher rent than the slum dweller, and who are perhaps able to put down £50, £60 or £70 as a preliminary to the purchase of the house.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that it would be distinctly advantageous to the local authority and would ease its own burden if it were to enable these <Col N="2272" /> loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to be put at the disposal of such bodies to build these houses.  Senator O'Farrell referred to one scheme&mdash;I think I recognised it&mdash;which was begun and completed six or seven years ago, I think in 1929 or 1930.  I am not going into that because it is a local authority's scheme and really does not come within this Bill.  It is a local authority's scheme which was sold over to the persons concerned.  I think it will be found on examination that some of the charges at least in regard to it are not well-founded and others of them will perhaps bear some kind of a different interpretation from that which has been put upon them.  Senator MacEllin spoke of the grant to small farmers and was inclined to urge that there should be a higher grant.  I do not quarrel with that, but I would point out that the small farmer is now getting a higher grant under the Bill as compared to those who are not small farmers.  As against the £45 grant to some people, the small farmer is getting a £60, £70 and up to £80 grant if he works through a public utility society.  That fact it might be considered would meet the claim for the comparatively bigger grant which enables the local authorities to provide for sewerage, and so on.</P>
    <P>The question of small farmers and the rural authorities and their housing activities has been raised.  It is undoubtedly true that in some of the counties small farmers have risen to their opportunities in respect of these grants.  In other counties, they have risen by no means to the same extent as in Senator MacEllin's county of Mayo.  That again is a matter for the persons concerned, and I do not suppose that anyone would ask that the Minister should throw houses at farmers and compel them to live in them.  I think Senator Farren is well justified in saying that notwithstanding all that has been done there is really little to boast about.  I am quite sure the Minister would be the first to agree with that.  The frequent statements as to the number of houses built are justified, inasmuch as the public are curious to know what progress has been made, and is <Col N="2273" /> being made, towards a solution of the very serious problem that exists all over the country in towns, cities and villages and the constant demand for information as to what is being done here and there.  I have no doubt that the absence of the figures quoted would have been remarked very much more than the fact that they have been given.</P>
    <P>It is true, and it is worthy of note, that some of the large cities in Britain have done as much in the last ten or 15 years as this whole country has done in that period.  The circumstances, of course, are different.  There is a great difference in the availability of material, and labour of one kind or another.  It is hoped, at any rate, that the movement for house building here has not by any means reached its peak, and that there will be a continuous increase in the rate of progress.  The Minister has frequently asserted that he will not rest satisfied until he sees we are nearing the end of this problem as an acute problem. I have no doubt at all, that when the present acute problem is blunted, we will see a growing and greater need perhaps even to replace some of the houses now being built. But there is one thing certain; there is a problem that is very acute, and very serious, indeed, and in some towns particularly, it is a very long way from being solved. Notwithstanding the public interest and notwithstanding all the generous words spoken we do find here and there that local authorities are dissuaded from taking action, and moving in any way which would cause them to add another 2d., 3d. or 4d. to the rates.  That, of course, will have to be dealt with in one way or another.  Public interest is bound up with this matter and public conscience is affected and I have no doubt that in the course of time the problem will be solved, and not least, by the action of persons&mdash;farmers and others&mdash;making use of the public grants made, and which are being added to by the Bill under discussion.</P>

      <P>I do not think I need add very much to the discussion that has taken place upon this Housing Bill.  It is true, as Senator Jameson remarked, that a good deal of the discussion dealt with matters outside the actual scope of the Bill. You, Sir, were generous enough to allow Senators to discuss the matter from a broader and more liberal point of view, and for that I am more thankful than anything else.  Far from objecting to any discussion on housing, whether the discussion took the form of blame or praise, I like to hear housing discussed, at every opportunity, suitable or otherwise.  It is a subject that needs plenty of ventilation and thought.  Certainly, as Senator Johnson remarked, the public conscience has been quickened to a very considerable extent on the subject of the housing problem in recent years.  The public, by a little further education on housing, will see the size of the problem and the difficulties of it, and the necessity for greater advances being made in town and country to deal with what is still desired, and also the efforts made in recent and remote years to remedy what is a very difficult and urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farren, to my mind, was quite right in giving praise to the Dublin Municipal Council for the work it has done in the last few years. The council, and the City Manager, deserve praise for the number of houses they have built.  But what I said in the Dáil, and stated in public on a good many occasions I repeat here, that while praising the council and the manager for what they have done I am not happy, or satisfied, with the present rate of progress made in the City of Dublin.  They have been barely able to keep pace with the natural decay that has taken place.  At the present time we are hardly doing anything more than keeping pace with that.  We are, perhaps, making up leeway, to a certain extent, but not to any great extent, and at the present rate of <Col N="2275" /> 1,000 houses a year, or less, which is the rate in the last three or four years I cannot see the housing problem in Dublin ever being solved.  I agree, however, that the position has been very difficult but it must be got over and Dublin must build at least double that number if we are to see the housing problem, in its larger and wider aspect including houses for the working-classes, ended in our day.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran raised the question of the allocation of houses by the Dublin Municipal Council.  That is a matter that does not come directly under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  It is a matter into which I, as Minister, dislike entering because I like to leave to the local authority full power and full responsibility in the allocation of houses.  I have had complaints from time to time &mdash;not very many recently, although I did have a good many a couple of years ago&mdash;and where I had inquiries made last year into the wrongful allocation, as was alleged, of houses in Dublin City for the last 12 months, I can say that the cases put to me as being cases of wrongful allocation were not proved.  That is not so in relation to a period more remote.  I did have a number of complaints even from members of the Corporation, and, after inquiry, the inspector I sent down proved to my satisfaction that there were, perhaps, nine or ten cases in which individual members of the Corporation used their influence to get flats or houses for people who were not justly entitled to them.  Other people should have got the houses, but I think that has stopped, or, at least, no case has been proved to me over the last 12 months.  If the Senator will let me have particulars of any case he knows, I shall be happy to have inquiry made into it.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Johnson answered some questions which Senator Jameson asked as to inspection and matters of that kind.  All these houses are inspected.  Senator Johnson also dealt with the complaint made by Senator O'Farrell with regard to certain housing schemes.  The housing scheme which, I think, he has in mind is one <Col N="2276" /> which does not come under the 1932 Act and which would not come under this Bill.  It was a scheme which was under the patronage and help of a Minister with whom, I think, Senator O'Farrell will have much more sympathy than probably he has with me.  I do not know whether he offered his criticisms to that Minister when that scheme was put through.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I would be just as impartial in criticising his predecessor, and was, as I would be in criticising him.  But, as a matter of fact, the faults in regard to the scheme did not come out until after the present Ministry came into office.  What I suggest to the Minister is that he should insist on the local authority putting right these defects and doing what should have been done previously.  It is not the fault of the Minister really; it is the fault of the local authority.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in the suggestion made by the Senator is that the houses do not belong to the local authority any more.  They have been sold to the tenants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>But the individuals are the recognised owners of the houses, and legally the local authority would have no right to spend money on houses which they do not own. Senator O'Farrell is quite right in calling attention to the fact that in towns in England, and in England as a whole, houses are being built at a much more rapid rate than they are being built here&mdash;probably three, four and in some cases ten times as rapid as the rate of even the best of our local authorities&mdash;but when considering that and comparing our rate of progress with theirs it must be remembered that there are other factors which have to be taken into consideration.  They have more than ten times the population and their problem is probably a ten-fold problem in comparison with ours.  Far from objecting, however, I <Col N="2277" /> like to hear matters of that kind brought out here.  It helps to encourage our own people to quicken their pace, and the sooner they do that, the sooner the problem will be ended.  I have no objection in the world to having comparisons made, even to our disadvantage here, with other countries and the progress being made in housing in other countries; but we have our own problem.  It is not of the magnitude of that of England, and, therefore, does not demand the same capacity in dealing with it, but, taking a broad view of our own problem in town and country, we could certainly with advantage to the community from various points of view&mdash;especially from the public health and sanitary points of view&mdash; quicken our pace and, in some places, very considerably.</P>
      <P>The question of public utility societies and their advantages or disadvantages was raised by some Senators. I think Senator Foran was quite right in saying that some bear the name of public utility societies but are limited liability companies, practically speaking.  I do not mind what these societies call themselves, or whether they are limited liability companies or public utility societies, if they are building houses.  That is what I want, and even if they get a profit out of the building of their houses, I do not mind if their profit is legally and properly earned.  I am glad of the existence of anybody, whether he be private builder, public company, private company or public utility society or any other kind of society that builds houses, and the more houses they put up the better I shall be pleased.  If they earn profits, it is all to the good, but I should like to see some of these societies run on lines different from those on which one or two I have in mind are run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say one last word with regard to the provision of money.  It is suggested that this sum of £700,000 is a small sum to ask for.  If we are thinking in terms of housing finance in England, it may be, but, relatively speaking, it is a large sum of money. Whether it is large or small, I have this assurance from the Executive Council, that whatever money is necessary <Col N="2278" /> for housing under the terms of the Act of 1932, which gives very generous grants to local authorities, public utility societies and to private individuals, and I doubt if the State should be asked to do more, and whatever demands are made by local authorities or private persons for grants, the Government will come to the Oireachtas and ask for the money.  From what I have heard to-day, and from what I have heard on any occasion on which the question of housing has been discussed, I feel sure the Oireachtas will not hesitate to grant whatever money is necessary.  However the taxpayer may feel that he is being burdened, he feels that this money spent for housing is spent for a good and necessary cause, and the money, I think, will be readily forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  Probably the Senator knows that I have discussed that matter several times with the present City Manager.  The City Manager has always, when I raised the subject with him, answered me by saying that his belief was that the most urgent problem was the housing of the slum dwellers and the clearance of the slums, and that he would insist that nothing should be done in the way of raising money for houses that would in any way hamper him in dealing with that first problem.  I think the City Manager agrees, and the Municipal Council will also agree, I am sure, that excellent work is being done by some of these public utility societies; that it is necessary to keep the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in operation, and that the necessary funds should be made available.  That is my view also. But the City Manager is anxious, and I would be with him, that it should not hamper the operation of the clearance of the slums and the providing of houses for slum dwellers, which is the first duty and responsibility of local authorities.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Agricultural Seeds Bill, 1935&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the better regulation and control of the seed business, particularly in relation to the import of seed, in order that where seed is imported it will be properly invoiced so that the farmer who is buying seed may be in a position to know exactly what he is getting.  He is also safeguarded at a later stage as against the person from whom he purchases the seeds, if he has been in any way deceived or wronged.  The Bill also provides for the growing of seed.  Under Sections 11 and 12 regulations can be made to deal with the flowering or even the growing of plants in certain prescribed areas where an attempt has been made to produce certain agricultural seeds.  The Bill also deals with the cleaning of seeds, making the cleaning of seed a business. Under the Bill it will be necessary to have a permit to carry on the business of cleaning seeds.  That business, of course, is well defined in one section. The Bill codifies the legislation on seeds, previous legislation being repealed when the Bill comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should just like to deal with some of the sections in order to clear the minds of Senators on certain points that may arise.  Sections I and 2 will not give any trouble to anybody. Section 3 gives power to the Minister to prohibit the import of seeds, and then Section 4 gives the Minister power to give permits for the importation of seeds.  The necessity for these two sections is that I am afraid we cannot regulate this business properly unless we take power to prohibit the import of seeds, because there are many foolish people who are impressed by advertisements etc., of certain varieties of seeds, which have been <Col N="2280" /> already tried out in the various agricultural colleges here and by the county instructors, and found not to be suitable.  The only way we could deal with those seeds would be to prohibit the import of them entirely.  If, on the other hand, a farmer has a good case for the importation of any particular variety of seed, he can get a permit under Section 4, or the seed importers and wholesalers may import certain varieties under the same section.  Section 5 exempts seed in packets from this particular part of the Bill.  These are samples that come into the seed merchants or importers under 1 lb. in weight, and they will, of course, be exempt, so that the seed merchants may have freedom at least to get in samples of certain varieties without going to the trouble of getting a permit.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 deal with the business of cleaning seeds.  For the moment there is no intention to classify any business as a seed cleaning business except that of cleaning grass seeds and clovers.  It may be necessary later, although I do not see the possibility of it at the moment, to classify the business of cleaning other seeds besides grass seeds as a business under this section.  The business of cleaning grass seeds or clovers is a rather technical business, and it needs a certain amount of inspection and supervision to see that the farmer is safeguarded in getting the seeds for which he pays. Therefore, it would require the supervision provided for in this section.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is taken from the old Act dealing with what may be prescribed as injurious weeds or impurities in seeds, and does not require any explanation.  Section 9 is a section that has given a great deal of trouble. It is the only section, as a matter of fact, that came in for discussion in the Dáil.  That section deals with packet seeds.  It lays down certain regulations &mdash;that they must have on them, under certain circumstances, the name of the firm and the date on which they were packed, and certain other particulars that may be prescribed.  The section, as amended in the Dáil, is, I think, as satisfactory as we can hope to make it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with invoices and is <Col N="2281" /> necessary, as Senators who have had any experience of the import of seed wheat will admit.  A great deal of wheat was imported during the spring of 1934 and the spring of 1935.  Some wheat was imported as seed wheat and, when it was sown, it became obvious that some winter variety had been sold as spring seed.  It was doubtful, as the law stood, whether these particular farmers had any case in law unless they had got a written guarantee with the seed that they bought.  Luckily, however, I think they were in all cases compensated, but it is well to see in such cases in the future that the farmer will be perfectly safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 deal with the growing of seeds.  Some experiments have been carried out during the last few years here in the growing of root crop seeds such as beet and mangolds in particular.  So far as these experiments have gone it would appear that if we are to produce good seed for these crops, if the experiment will prove in the future years that they can be produced; if they are to be as successful as we expect them at the moment to be, and that we are getting down to the growing of these seeds in a commercial way, it will be necessary to have areas where cross-fertilisation can be eliminated.  For instance, if the grower tries to grow beet seeds and if in the adjoining field mangolds go to seed, his whole crop of beet seeds would be destroyed because, of course, there would be great danger of cross-fertilisation between the mangolds and the beet and we would get sugar mangolds instead of beet seed.  This would not be at all satisfactory for the manufacture of sugar.  We are, therefore, providing in this Bill that in prescribed areas we may make an order prohibiting the inflorescence of certain plants.</P>
    <P>If these mangolds do not come to the flowering stage there would be no danger.  In most cases that would be sufficient.  If it is not sufficient, then recourse would have to be had to the powers in Section 12&mdash;control of the growing of plants in certain cases, that is prohibiting the growth of certain plants in that area.  I am only giving that as an example of how this <Col N="2282" /> Section 12 may be operated.  It may be necessary also in the case of other seeds such as cabbages, brussels sprouts and so on that there should be some such powers in special areas.  Section 13 is not a departure from existing powers, the powers of inspection and taking samples, except that it gives somewhat wider powers in regard to taking samples at fairs and markets. Apart from that, the powers are quite the same as at present.  Sections 14 and 15 are the usual sections in a Bill of this kind, and Section 16, as I have already said, repeals the existing legislation and, in fact, makes this a codifying Bill of seed legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to enter into any discussion of the Bill because, on the whole, there is no objection to the general principle.  I want to raise a couple of points.  There may be nothing in them but I am raising them to get information.  Of course, it is right to say, no matter what the Minister thinks about this question of licensing, that as a principle it is very unacceptable.  It may be necessary but all this policy of restrictions, harassing and annoying is definitely putting certain people in the community under a disadvantage that they are not accepting very gently or quietly.  Under this Bill the farmer would not be able to be certain that the best seeds are sold to him unless certain regulations or restrictions are observed.  In Sections 2 and 3 there are powers about the restriction of the imports of certain seeds.  Section 4 indicates that these seeds may be imported under licence. The Minister informs us that a farmer or dealer in seeds will be able to obtain a licence.  I have not read the Official Report of the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, but we should have a definite assurance from the Minister that any legitimate trader with a reputation for having been straight and fair in his transactions with regard to the imports of seeds in the past will be entitled to get a licence, and that there will be no picking and choosing between one or two men in a town, a system of choosing in which one would be able to obtain a licence to import something that the other will not.  Section 6 indicates that &ldquo;no person shall <Col N="2283" /> carry on, otherwise than under and in accordance with a licence... the business of cleaning for commercial purposes agricultural seeds to which this section applies.&rdquo; I wonder to how many people is that section going to apply.  I wonder to how many businesses is it going to apply.</P>
      <P>At the end of the page in (5) (b) there is a point I should like to see cleared.  Under that sub-section there are certain people exempted. &ldquo;The following transactions shall not be deemed to be the carrying on of the business of cleaning agricultural seeds&rdquo; and then we have (b) &ldquo;The cleaning, by a farmer on his own premises, of seeds produced by him on land in his own occupation.&rdquo; I want to know does that mean that the farmer is exempt and that the section is not going to apply to a farmer and that he need not get a licence to clean seeds on his own premises?  Is the farmer free to sell these seeds produced by himself on land in his own occupation and cleaned by himself?  It is the custom in my part of the country for a great many small farmers to clean grass seeds and take them to the market or to the business men in the town.  They sell these to the seed merchant and he sells them to the public.  Is it the idea that the farmer can clean these seeds in his own premises and that they are cleaned for the purpose of sale?  I think that sub-section needs to be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Sections 11 and 12 I suppose if we are going to continue growing beet it is quite right that we should produce the seed in the country.  I think the Minister ought to take powers for that purpose.  But if the powers are going to be made available, it is in my opinion going very far when you have a situation like this: that a farmer may have grown say two acres of mangolds, and in that area there are a few men growing beet seeds.  It is very hard if you have to go to the man who is growing the mangolds and tell him &ldquo;Extra labour will have to be employed by you; there are mangolds in your farm going to seed and you <Col N="2284" /> have got to pull them.&rdquo; This is, very definitely, a harassing restriction and it seems to me an injustice. If that type of development is going to take place in an area, I presume the growing is going to be done under some sort of control by the beet factories and under some system of subsidising the grower.  I think it is rather unfair to the man next door that he is going to be asked to pay extra labour in order that a certain type of seed may be raised, seed which may be absolutely no use to him as being for a crop which he may not grow on his farm at all.  The man is to be restricted in the management of his farm. Somebody is to be in a position to go to him and say he is not to grow a certain crop at all.  I am not suggesting that is going to be done.  I think on the whole that the Minister and the officials of the Department are all sensible and reasonable human beings. They understand farming.  But it seems to me that it is going too far to put the farmer in the position that an official may come to him and order him in that way.  The Minister ought to reconsider the question as to whether or not it is essential to take such an extravagant power.  He should consider whether that provision might not be deleted because, I think, it should be possible to achieve the desired end without any power so drastic as that.  The Minister for Agriculture of to-day is not going to act so drastically but we do not know what the next Minister may be like. If he desires to act drastically, then we should place him under the obligation to introduce the necessary legislation.  I do not think that it is right to put such power in the hands of officials.</P>
    <P>On Section 15, I should like to inquire how the measure is to be made operative.  The Weeds and Seeds Act is generally enforced at present by the county instructor.  Are any additions to be made to the staff in order to give effect to this measure, or is the work to be done in the same way as samples of seed are taken and general supervision exercised in respect of the distribution <Col N="2285" /> of seed in the country?  I should like to have information on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>The only part of the Bill in which I am interested is that which refers to grass seed.  That is a very important crop in the county from which I come.  I am sure it is not the intention of the Minister or the Government to interfere with the cleaning of the seeds by the farmers for marketing purposes.  If it were so intended, it would be a very serious matter for the farmers.  As I understand, the intention of the Government is to safeguard the farmers in the buying of seed for spring sowing purposes and to see that it is machined properly.  I know that that is necessary.  A great variety of seed that is not suitable for sowing again gets into the grass seed and it is necessary that it should be removed from the grass seed.  That is essential, but a monopoly should not be given to cleaners in any particular district or county.  In County Monaghan, which produces an enormous quantity of grass seed, there is, so far as I know, only one cleaner.  I do not think it would be right that any monopoly should be given as regards cleaning. The Bill is, so far as grass seed is concerned, a step in the right direction so long as it does not interfere with the cleaning of the seeds by the farmers themselves for marketing purposes, which I am sure is not the intention.</P>

      <P>The remarks we have heard from our farmer Senators astonish me.  When I read this Bill, I asked myself if I were living in a democratic country or under what sort of order I was living.  We are going to give our Minister for Agriculture power to do whatever he pleases with the whole of our seed problem.  I wonder if farmer Senators have read the Bill.  This Bill provides, in the first place, that the classes of seed which shall be called &ldquo;agricultural seed&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill may be named from time to time by the Minister, and any seed whatever which is imported at present may, on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister, be regarded as &ldquo;agricultural seed&rdquo; and come within the provisions of the Bill.  I am interested to a small extent in <Col N="2286" /> growing garden seeds, and one carries on largely by importing seed.  That is the most interesting part of the work. Hereafter, if influence is brought to bear on the Minister by some section of gardeners he can prohibit the bringing in of any of this seed and stop the whole of our operations.  Already the conditions connected with the importation of plants have practically prevented any of us in the Free State from competing with our neighbours across Channel.  One cannot get these small plants through the Customs in time.  They are dead when they arrive, so that the whole arrangement of our horticulture is knocked out.  I do not think that any benefit is to be gained by this country by giving the Minister the powers outlined in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to agricultural seeds which are, I suppose, what farmers are interested in, it is a strange procedure to tell any farmer that he is not to buy foreign seed except he gets a licence, although he knows his land requires some particular seed.  He is to go with his hat in his hand to the Minister and beg a licence to buy seed which, he knows, is absolutely necessary for his land.  What are we coming to? I remember a time when there was not good malting barley in some areas. We, who were buying large quantities of malting barley, imported a lot of special seed and sold it to the farmers. We picked out those farmers and sold their seed for them next year if they were not able to sell it themselves. That led to a great improvement.  At the end of some years, it was necessary again to import seed because the home seed had gone down in quality and was not producing the high standard of barley which was required.  I do not know how farmers manage this matter now.  They must import seed somehow because the quality of Irish barley is very good.  To give the Minister power to say to a farmer who knows the kind of seed which ought to go into a barley field that he cannot import that seed without a licence is to go very far.  It is a terrible power to give to any Minister and I cannot understand why our farmers are allowing such a Bill to pass without comment.  I do not know what our Minister proposes to <Col N="2287" /> do.  He is getting power to regard any seed as agricultural seed.  He is getting power to prohibit the importation of that seed.  He is getting power to issue licences to people to import a certain class of seed which may be either for direct sowing or for selling purposes.  This is a wonderful country for honesty but if power were given to a Minister in some other countries to deal with all the people in a certain trade by means of licences, I know what would happen.  It would be a very remunerative job, but there can be no question that it would be a very bad principle to go on.  Our farmers surely know their own business, and therefore, I suggest, it would be a very bad thing indeed, so far as this seed question is concerned, to make them subject entirely, in the carrying on of their operations, to the will of a Minister: that they must have permission from him as to whether or not they can import the seed that they believe is most suitable for growing on their land.  If this Bill is passed, the farmers of the country are going to be put in that position. Under this Bill the whole tillage system of the country is being put into the hands of the Minister for Agriculture. I do not care what the Minister's knowledge is, I submit that what is proposed in this Bill is not only entirely undemocratic and wrong, but that it is putting bureaucracy into a position in which it can do an infinite amount of harm to agriculture, our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>I ask, how in the world is anyone to know what particular class of seeds best suits the land that I hold?  It is nonsense to suggest that anyone knows that better than I do.  Evidently there is not much use in my talking in this strain if the farmers in this assembly are going to let this Bill go through, and if a Minister for Agriculture is going to be allowed to do what he likes with the seed problem so far as it concerns our tillage farmers.  If the tillage farmers of the country are satisfied to be placed in the position that I have outlined, then I suppose there is nothing more to be said except to say that all this kind of legislation shows where the country is going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2288" /> I take it the idea behind this Bill is to get all the seed required produced by our own farmers, and to be in the position eventually of not requiring to import any seed.  People who have had experience of the growing of corn know quite well that if all foreign seed is to be kept out of the country, and that if none is to be imported to improve the breeds cultivated here, then the country is taking a path that is going to lead to disaster.  If the Minister knows anything about the growing of corn he ought to know that.  I do not see why we should take away from our farmers the management of their own business.  The Minister has not told us what gain this is going to be for the country.  He did tell us about the experiments that it is proposed to carry out, with the object of getting the wonderful new beet that he spoke of.  He said that in order to carry out these experiments it may be necessary to stop people growing other crops in the adjoining fields.  The Minister told us all that, but he did not tell us why he distrusts the farmers in the matter of importing the seeds that they think best to grow on their land.</P>
    <P>We all remember what happened some years ago in connection with the potato crop.  In order to save that crop in this country we had to import a special type of seed.  The result is that we now have good potato crops and good seed.  If the Minister does not wake up to the importance of this in time, it is not unlikely that we may be faced with a similar disaster in the case of other crops some time in the future.  That may be the outcome of the policy we find outlined in this Bill. I do not care how good a man may be in a matter of such importance as this, I should much prefer to trust to the commonsense of our farmers to select the seed that they think best for their land and to manage their farms in their own way rather than put that power into the hands of any Department or any individual.  I believe that our farmers are absolutely wrong in allowing a Bill of this kind to go through and in giving power to any Department or to any individual to interfere with them in the carrying on of their business.  I cannot understand why our farmers should not be allowed <Col N="2289" /> to buy any seed except the seed selected by the Department or what benefit the country is going to get out of a policy of that kind.  It is provided in the Bill that farmers who act contrary to what is laid down in it will render themselves liable to very heavy fines.  It is right, of course, that if regulations are made they should be observed.</P>
    <P>The Bill places a restriction on the business of cleaning agricultural seeds.  It is not easy to understand how that provision will be operated. As far as I can gather, the farmer who merely cleans seed on his own premises which is intended to be sown in his own land is going to be allowed to do that.  What is the restriction on the cleaning, by a farmer on his own premises, of seed produced by him on land in his occupation? It is this: that it will not be deemed to be the business of carrying on cleaning.  The section does not say what the farmer is to do with that seed.  The position is clear enough if he sows the seed on his own land, but it is not clear as to whether he can sell any of the seed that he does not require to a neighbour.</P>

      <P>In that case, would he not be deemed to be carrying on the business of cleaning agricultural seeds?  If he carries on that business, then he cannot sell without a licence. The wording of the section seems doubtful to me.  I think that even Senator Johnson would find it difficult to say what the section really means.</P>

      <P>Then there are Sections 11 and 12.  I listened to what the Minister had to say on these sections. I gathered from what he said that, in cases where experiments are being carried out for the improvement of some particular seeds, people in the neighbourhood who may be growing mangolds or other crops may be prohibited from doing so if the opinion is held that their doing so <Col N="2290" /> would interfere with the seed experiments. Yet, as far as I could gather from the Minister, the experiments undertaken by the Department have not quite reached a sufficiently advanced stage to enable it to say whether the particular seed that they are trying to get can be used with advantage.  In view of that, I do not think the Minister should take the general powers that he is taking in this Bill to prohibit the growing of other crops in areas where these seed experiments are to be carried out until he is positively certain that the cultivation of the seed that he has in mind is going to be a success.  The Minister is seeking power in this Bill the exercise of which is likely to cause annoyance to a great many people.  The Minister's excuse for that is that the experiments must be protected.  It strikes me that this is a most extraordinary Bill to be brought into the legislature of a country which claims to be a land of freedom.  I have never read anything like it.  It is exactly the sort of thing that one would expect a Russian Minister to bring in dictating to his farmers, but that the Minister for Agriculture in the Irish Free State should dictate to our farmers in the way that he is doing in this Bill and that they should stand for that passes my comprehension.</P>

      <P>There is a matter of some importance that I wish to draw attention to.  It concerns people who live in what was formerly part of the County Dublin.  It is now within the city boundary.  When their district was in the county they had the services of the horticultural instructors employed by the Dublin County Committee of Agriculture.  They are no longer able to get the services of those instructors.  The city authorities do not engage horticultural instructors or send them around to instruct the people.  Senators are aware that a great deal of damage is done to fruit trees of all kinds by the parasites which infect them.  Apple and pear trees can be very badly affected by these parasites.  Most people are not very well informed about the best methods <Col N="2291" /> of dealing with parasites.  I am sure if they knew what to do they would take the necessary steps to increase and improve their supply of apples.  As many sorts of trees are liable to parasitical attacks it is a great misfortune that they cannot be kept apart from others.  The matter really depends upon the city being induced to appoint horticultural instructors in the new districts within the city boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word or two about Senator Jameson's remarks, as to the lackadaisical attitude of farmers towards a Bill of this sort which gives power to the Minister to deal with seeds.  As a matter of fact the position is that the Minister has the power already.  This is legislation to deal with matters that have been already dealt with in the manner described.  For example, seed wheat cannot be imported without a licence. The Minister has that power under the Cereals Acts, so that this measure more or less codifies the various steps taken during the last few years to deal with seeds.  I had no difficulty whatever in getting British seed wheat.  I sow Essex seed every year.  The local price is comparatively high, but it can be got from Essex, cleaned and double cleaned, for the same price at which the ordinary supply is sold here.  There is no objection so far in getting it under licence.  The same thing applies to oats.  I believe it is now difficult to get Scotch oats.  I have very good oats and very good barley.  I do not know if the seed will deteriorate. I had no difficulty in getting seed barley, and I had a yield last year of 32 barrels to the Irish acre.  I never had such a yield, I also managed to get it sold at 16/- a barrel before the market price was fixed.  I am not interested in the growing of beet seed as that does not affect County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know several people engaged in the cabbage business who grow a certain class of seed, and who also supply their neighbours.  They are seed merchants of a small kind in their own way.  There are also specialists in cauliflowers and savoys.  I do not see why that class of people should not <Col N="2292" /> be helped.  They get £1 per lb. regularly for cabbage seed that is grown locally.  It is a remunerative business, and if it can be developed by any regulations that are brought in there is no harm in doing so.  The Minister is there as a guide for farmers, and in case of necessity he is not going to refuse to permit of the introduction of whatever farmers consider to be necessary to develop their business.  As far as my experience goes I have no complaint to make of interference.</P>

      <P>As to the point raised by Senator Colonel Moore, while it does not come under this Bill, it would come in under the Agricultural Act of 1931 as amended in 1933.  Under that Bill the city was empowered to provide horticulture instructors for residents in the city.  I am afraid if instructors are not being provided any complaints should be directed to the City Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am powerless so.  Senator Baxter wanted to know if licences were being issued for certain seeds would all traders be treated alike.  Certainly.  Senator Wilson told the House that the powers sought in this Bill have been in operation for the last two or three years. Supposing we decided to allow in Red Marvel wheat seed everyone would get a licence, irrespective of who the applicant might be.  On the other hand, if we decided not to allow in what is called imported Scotch seed oats&mdash;a high sounding name that brought a certain price&mdash;we would not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the sort of thing we want to deal with.  If some pure line pedigree seeds are allowed in then we say that every farmer is entitled to import them. We might allow 2 cwt. or a barrel but if we allow in any of these seeds every farmer gets the same privilege.  That is how this power has been used up to the present.  I was asked to how many businesses would the provision dealing with seed cleaning apply.  It <Col N="2293" /> applies only to two firms at present. I believe that in the grass seed cleaning business there will not be more than three or four firms at any time. It would be an advantage to have more than one because, as Senator Total pointed out, where you have only one buyer farmers are not likely to do as well as if there was competition.  We are anxious to have at least three or four seed cleaners so that there will be sufficient competition for what farmers produce.  A farmer is free to sell seeds cleaned by himself.  Senator Jameson held that that position was not clear. It is perfectly clear.  When we ask the Oireachtas to pass a Bill making certain restrictions with regard to the cleaning of seeds, and if certain people are to be exempt from the restrictions, it is perfectly clear that they are exempt altogether from that clause and can do what they like.  If farmers clean seed that they produce they are free to sell it, to sow it or to give it away for nothing.  They can do what they like with it.  A farmer who buys seed may clean it for use by himself. That is not called a seed cleaning business.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that we should be very conservative about compelling farmers to pull flowering seeds.  No doubt we will be.  There are two sections dealing with that question. The first section gives power to stop certain plants from flowering.  That is as far as it will be necessary to go. There is power also to stop farmers in an area from growing these plants at all.  There are, of course, certain people in the country with whom it is very hard to deal, and under certain of our Acts power is taken to compel them to do certain things.  They will not do them in certain cases, and then we have power to get the work done ourselves and charge them with the expense of doing it.  That, however, takes a long time as you have first to go into court and get the order.  If the same thing were to occur year after year it would involve us in a very tedious procedure.  We, therefore, take power to say to such a farmer: &ldquo;Well, we will not allow you to grow that plant at all in future because it is so very difficult to get you to comply with the regulations.&rdquo; That is a power <Col N="2294" /> that will only be used in the last resort.  I am only taking beet seed as an example.</P>
    <P>I am told that in places where they grow this beet seed in Germany and Holland, there are other beets grown side by side, but they are, of course, harvested before they come to the flowering stage.  In the same way mangolds can be grown beside those which are intended for seed if they are not allowed to come to the flowering stage.  Senator Baxter does not like giving those drastic powers, because he says another Minister might come along in the future, who might not be so reasonable as the present Minister. I agree with him to that extent, that you may get another Minister who may not be so reasonable, but if you do get an unreasonable Minister, who feels that he should have these powers, he will look for the powers, and the fact that they are not given now will not prevent his looking for them.  I have found it necessary on certain occasions to take rather drastic powers here, and I have found the Seanad always willing to give them to me.</P>
    <P>I am asked who will administer this Act.  The very same people.  We shall have three or four inspectors who are in charge of the Weeds and Seeds section and they will have the assistance of the county instructors.  I believe there will not be any necessity to increase the number of inspectors. If there is any increase of officials required, of course, it would be in the number of inspectors in the Department, but I do not think there will be any necessity.  It is quite true, as Senator Jameson suggested, that under this Act I might include any horticultural seeds.  I have not any intention of doing so at present, whatever way I might be influenced as time goes on. I do not think, as long as I am Minister, that any farmer will ever come to me hat in hand.  That has been done away with.  In fact, when they do come, they are more likely to come in a menacing attitude.  In any case, I should not like to see a farmer coming to me hat in hand.  As Senator Wilson pointed out, we have already these powers.  We have exercised these powers for the last three or four years. <Col N="2295" /> We have not allowed any seed barley in from other countries, apart from a number of samples for the agricultural colleges and for other experimental purposes to see if it was possible to improve the very good variety of barley we have in the country.  No farmer would think of importing seed barley because he knows that Sprat Archer which we have here is the best that we can get.  In fact, other countries think the same thing.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to potatoes. We may import perhaps a number of small samples of potatoes in order to try them out in the agricultural colleges to see if they are as good as the varieties we have already or if we can get a cross between one of those varieties and our own varieties.  We are getting a reputation in very many countries for our seed potatoes.  I think we are exporting seed potatoes now in a commercial way with very great success to a number of countries. That is a business that has been built up in recent years and it is a business that is increasing.  We are getting a great name all over the world&mdash;in at least three continents&mdash;as a country that is producing the best seed potatoes. There is, therefore, surely no necessity why any farmer should send out for a large consignment of seed potatoes.  Some agricultural colleges carry on the business of bringing in small quantities of different varieties of seeds which we want to try out here. That applies to oats, barley, potatoes and the other principal crops.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson says that this Bill shows where the country is going.  I think it really shows where the country has gone.  I would point out to Senator Jameson as regards the powers in the Bill, that we have all these powers already, and that this is really a codifying measure.  I admit that we are taking certain powers here that we had not before, but not in the direction that Senator Jameson thinks.  We already had power to prohibit the importation of certain seeds, and also power to let them in under licence.  We are merely seeking now to have this power incorporated in legislation relating to seeds instead of having it in <Col N="2296" /> Cereals Acts and Imports Acts.  Senator Jameson says that as we are only experimenting with the growing of beet seed, we should not take these powers under Sections 11 and 12, until we see whether these experiments are a success.  I only took beet seed as an example.  Senator Wilson has given the House examples of other seeds, such as brussels sprouts seed and cabbage seed.  Is it not perfectly obvious that these powers will not be used unless the growing of seeds on a commercial scale is going to be embarked upon?  We are not going to use these powers under Sections 11 and 12 without cause.  Surely no Minister, even a more unreasonable Minister than the present one, would use them without cause.  I do not think there need be any fear that these clauses will be used unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The only criticism of the Bill is that it appears to be somewhat drastic, but I find in the case of all legislation that when you analyse a Bill, it appears to be more drastic than it turns out to be. For instance, I do not know how we could deal with the question of seed wheat unless we first prohibited the import of it and then say that we will give permits.  It would be a very difficult matter to draw up a Bill in which you could deal with it in any other way.  I think this is the simplest way of doing it, because when we issue a permit for the importation of the seed we may attach conditions if we have a suspicion of a certain importer&mdash;I mean an importer not living in this country, but living outside the country.  If we have a suspicion of the exporter from the other country&mdash;an importer into this country&mdash;we may be somewhat more drastic in our conditions than we would be with a reputable firm.  It is really such a difficult matter to deal with that I think we have in certain cases to deal with these people on their reputation and to deal with each case on its merits.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, plead that the Seanad in the first place, is not giving more power to the Minister for Agriculture than he has at the present time; and in the second place, that such power is necessary, as we are <Col N="2297" /> dealing with a very difficult subject. This legislation is entirely framed to see that the farmer gets a fair deal in the seed that he is importing, and that he gets an invoice that will enable him always to take action against the seller of the seed if it does not turn out to be what it purported to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a few comments upon the speeches made upon the Second Reading of this Bill. On that occasion I said the farmers and the cattle trade welcomed this Bill.  Exception was taken to that statement by farmer Senators such as Senator Dillon and Senator Miss Browne.  At least that was the impression they gave me.  I maintain, however, that my interpretation of that Bill was correct, and that the statement I made meant that we welcomed the Bill in the same way as a person condemned to execution would welcome a reprieve, even though that reprieve meant penal servitude.  I maintain I was interpreting the feeling of the farmers more correctly in that than Senator Miss Browne and Senator Dillon in their speeches. Senator Honan said that the imposition of duties and the economic war made money for the farmers, and that they were gaining money by the economic war.  He said that we were paying £5,000,000 to England before the economic war which meant an imposition of £6 19s. 10d. per head on the cattle we exported, and consequently it was better to retain that £5,000,000; and that since that we are only paying on an average £3 the farmers were making £4 a head <Col N="2298" /> since the economic war.  Senator Honan forgot that the farmers to-day have lost over £7,000,000 in special duties.  Where did that come from? More than 95 per cent. of it was paid directly by the farmers.  Still Senator Honan, in his simplicity, stands up and tells the Seanad that the farmers are making £4 per head by the arrangements under the coal-cattle pact.  That statement was made at one time by more responsible persons than Senator Honan, but they have since finished with that sort of thing.  All that kind of talk has since been exploded; still we find Senator Honan using it.</P>
      <P>Senator Foran always delights to have a cheap jibe at the farmers.  He said that in the time of the late Government statements were made of the same sort, and that judging from the speeches of some people one would think that this country had been a sort of El Dorado for farmers.  We never claimed that this country, or any other country, was an El Dorado for farmers.  They have many burdens to carry that the Senator does not see.  He started a cheap jibe, on one occasion, when I was making a plea for some compensation for the exporters of live stock that were slaughtered at British ports.  He said we ought to have a flag day for the farmers.  He thought that a very good joke and worthy of being repeated. Senators ought to realise their responsibilities. It is a shame and a disgrace for responsible representatives in this House to indulge in these cheap jokes. These cheap jibes are levelled at farmers in the cattle trade at a time when they are in such desperate plight.</P>
      <P>Senator MacEllin said he honestly believed that all the penal duties are really paid by the British purchasers. Senator MacEllin forgets that all our exports are sold in the British market against world competition.  I remind him of what every common sense man knows&mdash;that supply and demand regulate the price.  Since the coal-cattle pact we get nothing more for our beef and that shows that the restriction of supplies has nothing to do with it and that the farmers of this country are paying every shilling of the duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> I was surprised at the speech made by the Minister for Lands who was in charge of this Bill on the last occasion.  We were hoping that he would give some indication that we were approaching some sort of a settlement, and that farmers would be relieved of these terrible tariffs that we have to pay.  The Minister said definitely that while the present Government was in power there was no hope of settling this on any but one consideration.  He said if the political end was brought in they would have to find another Government to settle it, and that that would leave the farmers in an impossible position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the Government realise the position it is a very blue look-out for the farmers.  I urged the Minister to try and keep the sheriff and the bailiffs from taking away the cattle of the farmers, and to institute an inquiry on the question of the payment of rates.  I tried to get the Minister to use his influence with the Executive Council to see that something should be done and that the farmers were in a desperate plight. Since then, in the Swords Petty Sessions district, 150 farmers were prosecuted for rates.  A big percentage of those are supporters of the present Government, a big percentage are constituents of the Minister, and a number of them voted to put him at the head of the poll in County Dublin.  Ninety-five decrees were given in that Petty Sessions Court on last Monday week. The farmers concerned swore they had no money to meet these demands, and the district justice gave them from three to six months to meet them, but what I want to know is, where in three or six months they are to get the money?  When that term is up are the sheriffs and the bailiffs to go down and seize whatever stuff they have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for political propaganda that I raise this point.  My main object is to do something for the farmers of County Dublin who are a decent, law-abiding people.  The <Col N="2300" /> Minister is the representative of County Dublin and, as a private member, he has a duty to look after some of their interests.  I would ask him to consider some method of instituting an inquiry, and when it is found that those farmers are not in a position to pay their rates, that they will not be deprived of their last cow or calf.  That is the plea I make, and I make it not for propaganda purposes, but in all seriousness in an effort to preserve these farmers from being thrown on the roadside.</P>
    <P>I said the farmers were in a bad way, but the agricultural labourers are worse off.  All over the country agricultural labourers are without the means of existence.  I see that in Cork the municipal workers who receive 25/- or 26/- a week are striking for 10/- a week increase.  The Government statement was that every citizen in this country should bear an equal share of the economic war, but nobody seems to bear any of the burden but the farmers and the agricultural labourers. The municipal workers are getting more than ever they got; civil servants and every class of officials are getting as much as, if not more than, ever they got; even the teachers are getting as much as they ever got; and the people employed in the new factories and in the building trade are getting more than ever they got; but the small farmer and his agricultural labourer is crushed, and he is without the means of providing for himself and his family. I was recently at a fair in County Limerick, and I inquired from an agricultural labourer what his wages were. He told me they were 14/- a week and two pints of milk and that he was living in a very moderate house.  I said that they were very small wages, and he said: &ldquo;They are small and they are a lot less than we had been getting, but they are more than the farmer can afford to pay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the spirit of the majority of the agricultural workers of this country. What is the spirit in Cork?  What is the spirit of the civil servants, of the people engaged in the building trade, and of the people engaged in the new factories?  They do not care who can afford it.  They must get all they <Col N="2301" /> demand, or else they will strike.  That is the condition of affairs.  The agricultural labourer and the farmer are the biggest consumers in the country. They have to pay all these high prices and the high wages paid for the production of goods in new factories.  I contend that the Government are not carrying out part of their guarantee when they said that every section of the community should bear an equal share of the economic war.  No section is bearing any portion of the economic war except the farmer.  That is hardly fair, and if this policy of sending sheriffs and bailiffs to distrain the stock of the farmer, the farmer and the agricultural labourer are going to waken up, and it is going to create a dangerous situation in the country.  It is for that reason that I appeal to the Minister to institute some inquiry before the sheriffs and bailiffs go to the homes of the farmers to break them up, to scatter the families, and to leave them without the means of providing the necessaries of life.</P>

      <P>It would be well for Senator Counihan, Senator Miss Browne and Senator Dillon to realise that they speak only for a small and dwindling section of Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>I think the fact that the number of farmers they speak for is gradually growing less and less has dragged them into the position that, at the eleventh, or the half past the eleventh hour, they have to stand up and say a word for the working farmer and the agricultural labourer.  It is a healthy thing to see them taking up that position.</P>

      <P>I know that a large number of working farmers are badly hit, and I hope the position into which Senator Counihan has been driven of having to speak for the working farmer and the agricultural labourer, will <Col N="2302" /> appeal to the Minister and that, at the earliest possible date, he will do what he can to relieve their position.</P>

      <P>I will delay the House only for a very short time indeed.  My attitude is the attitude of the ordinary farmer in the country&mdash;the producer more than the man who sells cattle. So far as my experience goes, and I have met a great many farmers, their attitude towards this Bill is one of regarding it with no enthusiasm at all. No person with one grain of self-respect in this country could regard this Bill as anything but most humiliating. We have a Government which refused to pay an honest debt, but which goes around by a back door, to facilitate the British in collecting from the farmers alone, and not from the general taxpayer, the land annuities and all the other debts due.  They not only have acquiesced, but they have acknowledged, from the President down, that they are paying the land annuities through the penal tariffs, and while they refused to do what was the honest thing, they are not ashamed to do this dirty back-door business.  That is our attitude towards it, and the benefits the farmers are getting from it are so small that they make a present of it to the Minister.  It is not right that the attitude of the farmers should be misrepresented here.  Nobody is anything but ashamed of this coal-cattle pact, and that is all I want to say about it.  It is the ordinary farmer and producer more than any other class of farmer whom Senator Dillon and I represented when we objected to any expression of pleasure or enthusiasm about this pact.</P>

      <P>When Senator Counihan talks about the Cork Council workers receiving more pay than they ever received, he is stating what is not a fact.  If all the statements of the Senator are to be judged by his lack of knowledge of the position, the least said about him the better.</P>
