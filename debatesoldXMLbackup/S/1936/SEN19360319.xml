      <P>The purpose of this Bill is two-fold and both aims are simple.  The first is to extend the final date for the lodgment of applications for repayment to the 30th June, 1936, and the second is to provide for the audit of the accounts of the repayment office by the Controller and Auditor-General and to ensure that the report of the Controller and Auditor-General will be laid before Dáil Eireann in due course.</P>
      <P>The House may be interested to learn the impression which the action of the Oireachtas in authorising the repayment of this loan has created abroad and, in that connection, I think I cannot do better than read for the House an editorial which appeared in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> of 9th November of last year. The <i>Saturday Evening Post</i>, as I am sure most Senators are aware, is a journal which enjoys a very wide circulation not only in the United States of America but in Great Britain and Ireland and English-speaking countries generally.  It is a responsible journal therefore and one which may be described as an organ of opinion in matters of this sort.  The editorial is headed: &ldquo;Irish Free State Pays Up,&rdquo; and is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At a time when so many attitudes and policies throughout the world are well calculated to arouse both fear and censure, it is gratifying to call attention to conduct which deserves only praise.  We refer to the action of the Irish Free <Col N="2304" /> State in voluntarily paying both principal and interest to bondholders in this country whose claim was moral and legal.  This action is contrary to that frequently followed under similar circumstances and larger powers have taken advantage of much smaller excuses to default in payment.  To appreciate the full meaning of the good faith displayed, it is necessary to recite even, in at least skeleton form, the background of circumstances.  At a general election in November, 1918, the Sinn Fein Party, which had previously held only a handful of seats, swept the country and pledged itself to establish a republic.  A constitution was drawn up, a Cabinet elected, and Eamon de Valera, the last surviving senior commander of the republican forces in the rebellion of 1916, was elected President.  However, many of the leaders, including de Valera, were actually in jail at the time.  The republican forces were supported only by the subscriptions of their adherents, since the public revenues were in the hands of the British.  Finally, de Valera escaped from jail and, disguised as a stoker, reached the United States in the late winter of 1919.  Here, and in Canada, Central America and South America he sold 6,000,000 dollars of bonds to descendants of Irish immigrants and to other sympathisers with his cause. These bonds were not issued by a Government which was recognised by other nations or which had any legal standing at the time.  To many, the struggle in Ireland was merely another of the long series of rebellions against British authority, all of which had been failures.  Rarely has an issue of bonds had less apparent investment security.  Within a couple of years, the Irish and the British drew up a treaty of peace, but the republican forces split.  Civil war followed, and it was not until a number of years later that the de Valera forces triumphed.  Meanwhile, the external loan sold in this country was not recognised, although, following litigation, an American court ordered the 2,500,000 dollars, which had been <Col N="2305" /> left on deposit in this country, distributed <i>pro rata</i> to the original subscribers, giving them 58 cents on the dollar.  A very large number of the original subscribers&mdash;in fact two-thirds of the total&mdash;failed to put in any claims for the 58 cents award.  However, the Government now in power in Ireland decided to open a repayment office in New York and to advertise in practically every State that it was prepared to offer those who had never put in any claims for the 58 cents a total of 1.25 dollars for each dollar subscribed, while to those who had received their 58 cents it stood ready to pay 67 cents more.  Now, it must be kept in mind that a great many of the subscribers regarded their subscriptions, not as an investment, but as a gift to old Ireland.  Only two persons subscribed for as much as 10,000 dollars and only four for 5,000 dollars.  But there were 28,000 who subscribed for 50 dollars each, and no less than 237,000 who gave ten dollars apiece. Though great numbers of subscribers never expected any return, it can be said truthfully that the repayments have been made at a time which was extremely convenient to most of the recipients.  That, however, is not the point.  What matters is that this small country has met its debt of honour and set an example which more than one great world power might well observe and meditate upon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me a full justification of everything that has been done with regard to the redemption of the Dáil Eireann External Loan.  It was mentioned in that quotation that there were 237,000 subscribers with amounts of ten dollars apiece.  Every effort has been made to get in contact with those subscribers, by newspaper advertisement and otherwise.  In each advertisement we definitely called the attention of those subscribers under whose notice it might come to the fact that the Oireachtas had fixed the 31st August, 1934, as the final date.  Notwithstanding this intimation we found after the date fixed by statute had closed that no less than 15,000 new applications for repayments were received.  That is <Col N="2306" /> to say, they have come in since the 31st August, 1934.  When this Bill becomes law it is our intention to repay those 15,000 claims and to readvertise once again in the States of the American Union that we are prepared to receive applications up to the 30th June of this year, and that applications which are received before that date and which on investigation prove to be well-founded and valid applications will be discharged in the same way as the applications which were received under the original Act.</P>
    <P>When we have done that we will feel that we have done everything that honour and honesty demand we should do to meet our obligations under these loans.  Consequently, I do not think it will be possible for any person to say that we have not taken every step which the circumstances warrant and which, as I have said already, honour would oblige to bring our offer to redeem the bonds under the notice of those who would be entitled to be recouped for the advances they made. I do not think, however, that it will be possible for any person to allege that we have done anything else than lived up to and fully merited the very high praise which has been bestowed upon us by this very responsible American journal.  I merely quoted that as one example of the remarks which have appeared in numerous newspapers in America commending us for the actions we have taken, and saying that we have set an honourable example to much more powerful and much more wealthy States than ours. It is our boast that we are honest people, that we honour the obligations which we feel have been rightly contracted in our name; we are taking no more than an honest means of stating what has been done in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's opening speech on this Bill has not, I think, been sufficiently explanatory, notwithstanding his quotation from the article in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> which I do not think correctly states the facts, especially in one particular where it states that no recognition was taken in America of these bonds until the advent of the de Valera Government.  I have no desire <Col N="2307" /> to exaggerate the seriousness of the step which was taken when the Government determined to redeem these bonds, whether in the hands of the original subscribers or of the assignees who offered merely shadowy consideration. But I think that the people of the country should be made aware of what is happening.  These bonds were issued by a republican Dáil.  They were to be redeemed at face value plus interest on the establishment of an Irish republic.  That was definitely and explicitly set out on the face of each bond.  Portion of the money accruing from the bond issue remained in America after the split.</P>
      <P>The Cosgrave Government endeavoured to obtain that money for the State, undertaking, at the same time, to repay the subscribers.  The action of the Cosgrave Government was resisted by the nominees of Mr. de Valera, as he was then.  The case made in the American courts was that the Cosgrave Government were not the successors of the Republican Dáil and that they were not entitled either to get control of the money or to redeem the bonds.  I ask Senators to remember that the Cosgrave Government were acting on behalf of the State and not in their own political interest.  The American court directed that the money should be distributed <i>pro rata</i> amongst the subscribers less the costs of the legal proceedings. These costs have cost this State £100,000, for though the judgment of the court was that the costs should be taken out of the amount subscribed, I understand that the bonds are now being honoured in full and that, there fore, the costs of the proceedings comes out of the pockets of the ordinary taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having opposed the attempt to obtain the moneys for this State Mr. de Valera procured assignments of a number of these bonds to himself for investment in the Party newspaper or by way of subscription to the weekly edition of the Party newspaper.  In securing these assignments a letter was circulated which represented that Professor Tierney was one of those in favour of the establishment of a Party <Col N="2308" /> newspaper&mdash;he being at the time a member of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  Having secured the assignments, Mr. de Valera on attaining to office proceeds to do precisely what he contended in the American courts his predecessors were not entitled to do&mdash; that is, to honour the bonds at their full face value.</P>
    <P>These moneys are payable only on the establishment of an Irish republic. But without taking the trouble to establish the republic, our republican Government proposed to pay over these State moneys to President de Valera for investment in the <i>Irish Press</i> newspaper.  The present Bill seeks to extend the date up to which applications for repayment may be made.  These are the facts so far as I am aware.  The Minister will correct me if I have been guilty of any error. I do not wish to dwell on the transaction, because it might impair public confidence in government.  But I do say, however, that for a Government to allow itself to be made even a conduit pipe for the transfer of State moneys to its own Party political enterprises is opposed to public policy and sets a highly dangerous and a highly objectionable precedent.  In this case the Minister for Finance will be issuing State moneys to the President of the Executive Council for transfer to the newspaper of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>If the Cosgrave Government had proposed to act similarly in respect of any of the other Dublin newspapers we know the howl which would have gone up from the present Minister and his associates about the misappropriation of public moneys.  If the Minister for Finance will undertake that the money to be paid under this Bill will go direct to the subscribers or their personal representatives, to be dealt with as they think fit, I shall vote for the Bill.  If he insists that public moneys be devoted to the sustenance of a Party newspaper I shall vote against the Bill, because I believe he will be doing his Party a monetary service not at the cost of his own supporters but at the cost of all the citizens of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that 15,000 claims had come in since the former closing date.  He did not give us any indication of the amount of money that these claims represented, or of the amount which it is estimated the claims to come in as a result of the passage of this Bill will come to. I have always recognised that these American subscribers had to be repaid. I need not go into the grounds for the delay.  That has already been referred to.  But for the litigation that took place payment would have been made a considerable time ago.  The Minister said that, in making repayment and giving this extra time, the Saorstát was doing all that honour and honesty could demand.  I do not think that that is an overstatement.  Nobody who subscribed for the bonds in America can have any ground for complaint. It has been pointed out that the actual statement on the face of the bond was such that the State, if it so chose, could say that the situation under which repayment was to be made had not yet arisen.  I do not think that that would have been right and I do not think it would have been fair to the subscribers or that, in the long run, it would have been of benefit to the State.  Although the country is divided, and various other factors could be pleaded as a reason for not paying, I think that when we have established a State with full control of its finances and full sovereignty at home and abroad, it is only right that those who subscribed and who helped as well as they could to bring about the establishment of that State should have repayment made to them. At the same time, as has been indicated, the claim of subscribers is, at best, a moral claim and it is not a moral claim of a completely irresistible character.  The payment that is being made is payment of a debt of honour and it is being made in a spirit of considerable generosity.  There is, in fact, an element of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment in this repayment of the Dáil Bonds. I do not think the State should make any attempt to escape payment, but because of the whole nature of the matter payment is a very definite personal recognition of the position <Col N="2310" /> and of the services of those who subscribed to the original loan in America. It is not purely a financial transaction by any means and it is not being carried out on the basis of strict finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to speak, so far as possible, in an impartial and non-party way and I do not want to generate any heat. But I do feel that we are not looking at this matter rightly if we ignore the personal element in it and if we try to treat it as an ordinary, financial transaction&mdash;the redemption of an ordinary, marketable stock.  Before any question arose as to the repayment of the American loan and when it was only a question of the repayment of the home loan, we thought it necessary to take an interest in the subscribers.  At one time, it came to my notice that certain people were offering to buy up the certificates of the home loan at a cheap rate.  It was brought to my notice, for instance, that one member of the Oireachtas&mdash;he was a supporter of the Party to which I belonged&mdash;was offering, or proposing, to buy up certificates at, I think 18/- or some such sum.  These certificates were later redeemed at 28/-.  I saw the member in question and spoke to him in the plainest possible terms.  I told him that, if this sort of thing went on, he would discover that he had lost the 18/- or whatever he was proposing to pay because we were certainly not prepared to allow the subscribers to become the victims of a money-making traffic, such as that on which he proposed to enter.  I made it clear to him and to others&mdash;I spoke in the plainest possible terms&mdash;that there was no use in their trying to play on the impatience or despair of the people, owing to the delays which were inevitable, and trying to get certificates at a small price which afterwards might be redeemed at 28/-.  I should like to say, in this connection, that while I was always in favour of the redemption of the American bonds, if I had had responsibility, I certainly would have adopted an attitude which would be logically in keeping with the attitude which I adopted in connection with the question to which I have just referred. As this was payment of a debt of honour, as it was a repayment into <Col N="2311" /> which the personal element entered, in which there was a recognition of service at a time of national need and national emergency, I should certainly have taken the line that payment should only be made to the actual subscribers or their families or personal representatives, or, possibly, to people who had bought at some approved price which would represent the full cash value of the bond at the time of purchase.  The Government has not adopted that course, and I think it is regrettable, if we take the long view, that they did not adopt it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pursue the matter but I think that, if the Government had adopted some such course, the sums invested in the <i>Irish Press</i> might not have been diminished by 10 per cent.  The losses to this paper, in which the Government is interested, would probably not have been very great and, if that course had been adopted, it would have removed a ground of criticism which, in spite of the heat which has been shown, is a real ground of criticism.  It is extremely regrettable that the Government did not adopt the course of having most careful regard to the interests of the persons who subscribed.  Paying out money by way of subscription is quite different from agreeing to the assignment of money which one has not got, either in cash or in the form of an ordinary, marketable security.  Some people would be prepared to assign a claim to something which they have not got but their attitude would be entirely different if they had the money in hand.  As the line of repayment was taken, it was due to these subscribers that they should be put under no form, even of moral coercion to assign money which was being repaid to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the arguments put forward by Senator Blythe and Senator MacLoughlin are based altogether on an imaginary case. They seemed to indicate that people in America are talking about victimisation. The Senators themselves do not know anything about that, and, therefore, I think it would be very interesting to know if any complaints have been received from people on the <Col N="2312" /> other side, complaints, say, that something irregular was being done, or that some suggestions had been made that were calculated to mislead people.  It seems to me that a man who is the holder of a bond has a perfect right to do what he thinks fit with it.  He surely has the right to sell it at any price he wishes.  Senator Blythe told us of some party who wanted to buy bonds at a deflated value.  If the holder wished to sell at that value he had a perfect right to do so.  That kind of thing is going on on the stock markets every day, and there is nothing wrong about it.  In the case of a man who has stocks and shares to sell, the price at which he will sell, is altogether a question for himself.  If stocks and shares are sometimes sold below their value, that is frequently due to the fact that the man who holds them is in such a position that he is obliged to sell.  That is the rule of the game in the commercial world.  If, however, there was a case, such as Senator Blythe has suggested, of the telling of an untruth to a particular individual or the spreading of wrong statements in order to get a hold of the bonds, then, of course, it would be another matter.  Even in a case like that it would, in my opinion, be the duty of bondholders to make themselves fully acquainted with the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of these bonds, the people who subscribed originally did not care, as has been admitted, whether they ever got back their money or not. Their subscriptions were to help the cause of Irish independence, and they were really not interested in what happened to the money.  On the realisation of the bonds afterwards, the subscribers were still fired with the same enthusiasm, and many of them directed that the money so realised should go to a newspaper that was giving publicity to the cause to which they had subscribed ten years previously. The subscribers gave their money to the cause freely in the first instance. As I have said, they never hoped to see it again.  When an appeal was made to them on a second occasion they expressed the wish that the money should go to the same purpose.  Eventually, <Col N="2313" /> some of that money may perhaps go to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  If it does, then those subscribers believe that it is going to the cause to which they subscribed originally.  They have perfect freedom of action as to what they will do with their money.</P>
    <P>Senators on the other side have suggested that because an assignment of some of this money has been made to Mr. de Valera there is something irregular about it.  I do not agree. Those people have a perfect right to assign to any individual they wish. Senators on the other side suggest that under the procedure in this Bill there has been a restriction put on the freedom of action, of the bondholders in America as if they were a lot of ignoramuses: that they were people who did not know what they were doing.  There is no foundation whatever for these suggestions, and I say that it is altogether wrong for Senators to assume anything of the kind.  The bondholders knew quite well what they were doing.  They were acting most intelligently, and it is my belief that the people interested in the <i>Irish Press</i> here are the most intelligent people of the lot.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say what exactly it will be, but up to the present we have been able to keep within the £400,000 mark. We have to readvertise, and naturally, <Col N="2314" /> I do not know how many applications that will bring forth, but there are 15,000 belated applications which have to be dealt with.  I think we may assume that these are of the order of the ten or 15 dollar bonds which will probably mean 30,000 or 40,000 pounds more.  I mention these figures with reserve, because there are still a considerable number of people who may lodge applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact, as the Minister has stated, that it will be necessary to readvertise, I am wondering whether the period set out in the Bill as the latest date for receiving applications is long enough. It is likely that a large number of subscribers may come forward.  If the period provided is found not to be long enough, the Government may not be willing to grant a further extension, and therefore I think it would be better to give subscribers more time under this Bill for the lodging of applications.</P>

      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister as to what is being put before the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 refers to the moneys received by the Minister for Finance</P>
      <P>&ldquo;from the Central Fund for the purpose of redeeming the amounts of the External Loans and the amounts of such moneys paid by him to subscribers to the said loans by way of redemption of the said loans.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, I think, summarises what Senator MacLoughlin and Senator Blythe have been trying to say: that as long as the payments were made in that way to the people who subscribed, or to their successors in title, the matter was all in order.  What we are debating at present seems to me to be payments that were not made to the original subscribers or to their successors in title.  What I am anxious to know is if the figures put before the Comptroller and Auditor-General will cover all the payments made in connection with the repayment of the loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you not think that some other wording should go in?  If we do not alter the wording it does not seem that any figures would have to be given except those dealing with repayments to actual subscribers.  If the Minister says that this covers the whole of the repayments we can discuss the matter later on.  I do not think the words in the Bill make it absolutely clear that the names of anybody who has been paid money by the State in connection with this loan, and the figures will go before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I have no <Col N="2316" /> doubt that the Minister will deal with that point later.  The reason I mention it is that Senator MacLoughlin wanted to know if we were perfectly certain the money was really going to be repaid definitely to &ldquo;the subscribers to the said loan and their legal successors.&rdquo; If the Minister said that the money is only going to be repaid to the subscribers or to their successors in title, then the Senator's objection would be met.  As far as the new money is concerned, if the Senator was satisfied that none of the money was going for outside payments to anybody but original subscribers and their successors, and if the Minister stated that that covers the repayments, it would seem to meet the Senator's wishes.</P>

      <P>This Bill seeks to amend the present Act, which gives power to the Government to pay certain moneys due by the State to the people who subscribed to Dáil Eireann External Loan.  The Bill does not provide any new money, but simply proposes to extend the date up to which applications for repayment can be made, and to have all accounts in connection with the repayment of the loan submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for his examination and report.  The original Bill gave power to pay all the money necessary to those who subscribed to the external loan.  I suggest that no useful purpose will be served by going over the ground that was covered when the original Bill was discussed. The right of assignment was then fully thrashed out in both Houses and it was decided, and everyone had an opportunity of speaking on the manner of the assignment and everything else.  It is pleasing and gratifying to know that at least one representative newspaper with a world-wide circulation thought fit to comment on the honesty and the honour of the <Col N="2317" /> people of this State in meeting their obligations in connection with this external loan.  Finding ourselves in the happy position that our action has been applauded by other people, especially at a time when we are too ready to decry one another, and to decry the achievements of our own people, seeing that we have arrived at the happy stage that this organ of world-wide repute has pointed out for the benefit of the English-speaking world that this State has met its obligations to the full towards people who subscribed when it was not fashionable or safe to do so, we should be satisfied. The people in America who subscribed this money did so when it was badly required here.  They had the courage to subscribe, and I venture to say that the bulk of those who subscribed to the Dáil bonds at home, and to the external loan in America never did so with the intention of getting interest or dividend, or the original capital back.  As a result of these subscriptions the fight was carried on here and it brought us to the position that we now find ourselves in.  Accordingly it is our duty to be satisfied and to have no more bickering about this question. The Bill simply asks to have the date for repayment extended to the 30th of June and to have the accounts audited, and it should be passed with good grace.</P>

      <P>We are all as gratified as Senator Farren about this question, and we are all agreed that the money should be repaid.  We are also highly gratified that a journal of the standing of the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> should recognise that the people of this country have done the honourable and the honest thing.  But if any of these 15,000 new claims that came in are made by people, some of whom under a misapprehension handed over or assigned their bonds to Mr. de Valera, believing, as many of them certainly did, that they were of no great value, Senator Blythe was perfectly justified in asking, if these people had known at the time that we were going to repay in full, would they have acted as they did, or did they act under a misapprehension? It would be much better to have this question discussed rather <Col N="2318" /> than to have remaining the feeling that something shady or tricky had been done.  Undoubtedly that is in the people's mind.  Could the Minister say how many of these are <i>Irish Press</i> claims?</P>

      <P>That clears up one point, at any rate.  I do not agree with Senator Farren that this matter, which caused a great deal of anxiety and a great deal of disgust in the minds of the people, should be covered up.  There is no reason why it should. It is much better to have all these things brought out in the open and laid bare.  It is no credit to the country and does not serve the interests of the country that people should think shady things are being done.  There is the question of the three names in which the appeal was made.  Two of these people repudiated this appeal, one, Professor Tierney, with great vehemence.  Another gentleman whose name was put to the appeal stated that his name was used without his authority.  I believe it did transpire that people did sign over their bonds on the strength of this appeal believing that Professor Tierney, who represented one side, and Mr. de Valera, who represented another, were in agreement.  There has been a lot of deception about all this that none of us like.  We are humiliated by it.  As far as we are concerned we regard it, as a great many people regard it, as pure trickery.  There is no use in mincing matters.  If the Minister can assure us that none of this State money was handed over to a Party enterprise, we shall be delighted to hear it.</P>

      <P>I would rather close this debate in the spirit of the appeal which Senator Farren addressed to the Seanad than deal with the points which have been raised.  I want to make it clear, so far as applications affected by this Bill are concerned, though I have not detailed or any intimate knowledge of the 15,000 applicants, none of them, so far as I know, has any interest in the <i>Irish Press</i>, good, bad or indifferent.  As to assignments which were previously made and to the allegation that they were made <Col N="2319" /> without due appreciation of the value of the bonds, I think that reference to earlier debates and to statements which were made then will show that there is not much, if any, foundation for that.  I do not want to go into the more controversial matters.  I think those people who subscribed to these bonds in the first instance were perfectly entitled to do what they liked with their property, and if they chose to transfer them to anybody else, I do not think this House would be justified in dishonouring its bond simply because some Senators do not like the person to whom the interest was transferred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for a new method of controlling the importation of the limited quantity of sugar that in future it may be necessary to import, in each year, to supplement the production at the factories of the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company.  At present the importation is regulated under the Control of Imports Act.  From time to time, for stated periods, a quota of sugar is declared, and licences are issued to all registered sugar importers, to import the quantities of sugar stated in these licences, to the aggregate of the quantity which is called the fixed quota.  That method of importation has proved unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the sugar importers, and it is necessary, we think, to change it.  One of the reasons why it is unsatisfactory is because it necessitates a periodic <Col N="2320" /> fixing of quotas of such amount that all registered sugar importers can participate in it.  But that may not always be necessary or desirable.  It is true that in this year over a limited period it will be necessary to import some 15,000 or 16,000 tons of sugar.  But for the greater part of the year, and in all future years, the quantity of sugar which will be imported will be very small, and will, in fact, consist, in the main, of a special class of sugar required by the manufacturers of certain products.  If, at the present time, during which the supplies of Irish produced sugar are available, it was considered necessary to allow a single manufacturer, or a couple of manufacturers of some product to import a limited quantity of a special class of sugar, it would be necessary to fix a quota order, so that each of the ordinary importers, possessing between them sugar import licences, should be able to import some of that sugar, so that the particular importer, whom it was desirable to facilitate, should get the quantity he desires.  That means that unnecessary importation would take place, upsetting, or delaying, the clearances of stocks of sugar held by the Irish Sugar Company and creating increased difficulty in the financing of these stocks.</P>
      <P>The situation became difficult also from the point of view of the sugar importers, and, in fact, it was the Sugar Importers' Association that put forward the proposal that in their interests the sole licence to import sugar should be given to Comhlúcht Siúicre na h-Eireann from which concern the wholesale sugar merchants would purchase their supplies both in a period when home-produced sugar was available and when imported sugar was available.  That will be a simpler method of administration and will ease the position of the Department of Industry and Commerce as well as meeting the difficulties of the sugar importers.  That is, in fact, the sole purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That purpose could perhaps have been achieved by a voluntary arrangement whereby sugar importers would not apply for licences and in that way get over the difficulty.  But as the law stands a licence to import sugar cannot be given to the sugar company <Col N="2321" /> and, consequently, legislation is necessary before that arrangement which is mutually desired could be effected.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill which caused some comment in the Dáil, but which, I think, was misunderstood.  It provides for the imposition of a fee in certain circumstances on licences issued to the sugar company.  That was considered necessary, because it may happen that when sugar has to be imported there will be a slight difference between the price of imported sugar plus duty, and the price at which sugar is sold by the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company.  It is considered desirable that the sugar company should not make any profit on the importation or merchandising of the sugar imported.  That slight difference in price which may exist from time to time will, therefore, be taken up by means of this fee for the benefit of the Exchequer.  That difference would be too slight to affect the price.  During last year, when licences were issued to sugar importers, when home sugar was not available, there was such a slight difference in price.  Sugar importers got in respect of that sugar a profit larger than was normal.  The price of imported sugar, which at present is in or around 7/- a cwt. free of duty, delivered in Dublin, would have to be reduced by 2/4 a cwt., which is very improbable, in any circumstances, before a farthing in the pound could be taken off the retail price.  The difference, in any event, is only a matter of pence.  It is not improbable, judging by recent events, that the price of imported sugar will go up, so that there will be no margin and the price of imported sugar may exceed the price of the Irish company's product, in which case no fee would be charged.  The fee is only to deal with the circumstances that will exist when the Irish output is higher in price than imported sugar.  That difference went last year to the sugar importers, and were it not for the device of imposing a fee upon the licence it would go in the circumstances of the future to the benefit of the sugar company.  We think it should go, if anywhere, to the benefit of the Exchequer, but the amount in future <Col N="2322" /> years will be very small indeed.  The deficiency in the production of sugar this year is larger than will exist in any future year and, in fact, it is contemplated that in future years the only quantities of sugar imported will be those small consignments of special classes of sugar required by individual manufacturers.  There are certain classes of products for which beet sugar is not the most suitable and for which cane sugar is imported instead. The other provisions in the Bill are similar to those set out in the Control of Imports Act.  They propose to confer on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the same powers as he has at present under the Control of Imports Act.  In fact, the sole purpose of the measure is to enable the Minister to issue licences to the sugar company only, instead of to those firms and persons whose names are on the register of sugar importers, in order to facilitate administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small point which the Minister's explanation did not deal with.  I gather that it is anticipated that normally in future there will be no necessity to import sugar from the point of view of quantity, that is to say, the production of the sugar company here will be equal to the total requirements of the country and, so far as quantity is concerned, it is only in the odd year when the yield of beet or sugar content may be exceptionally low and, consequently, the output may unexpectedly fall, that it would be necessary to import.  I can quite see that to deal with such a necessity there is a great deal to be said in favour of allowing the sugar company, which is normally the sole supplier, to import whatever the amount of the deficiency may be, and to distribute it on practically the same basis as home sugar; but I gather that there may sometimes be a necessity to import small quantities from the point of view of quality.  I take it&mdash;the Minister did not explicitly say it&mdash;that there are certain manufactures in which the sugar which must be used is cane sugar, and, in order to enable these manufactures to be carried on, it may be necessary to import some sugar, even though there <Col N="2323" /> might be a surplus on the hands of the sugar company here.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the sugar company undertakes, or is bound to undertake, to import the necessary requirements of those manufacturers, even though it has a sugar surplus on its hands.  I do not know, and the Minister has given no indication, of what the importance of these particular manufactures are which require cane sugar, but, if they are to be certain of being able to carry on, I think some precaution may well be necessary, because, after all, the interest of the sugar company is to sell its own sugar, and if it is the only source of supply a manufacturer has it may be disposed to say: &ldquo;Beet sugar would do perfectly well and we do not see that this is a case for importing at all.&rdquo;  I do not see what difficulties would exist for the Minister in giving the import licences to the manufacturers who require these special qualities of sugar.  It surely would not involve any difficulties in regard to quotas, and so forth, if he were issuing licences, not to importers or traders, but simply to manufacturers. It may be that the Minister is satisfied, and these manufacturers are satisfied, that there would be no difficulty in getting arrangements made for the import of special qualities of sugar where it may be required.</P>
      <P>The Minister has talked about the merchants being satisfied and wanting this Bill.  He did not indicate if these manufacturers, whether they are of great or small importance, have also been consulted, whether they are satisfied, and he is satisfied, that no unnecessary obstacles will be placed in their way and whether they will be allowed to import these small quantities of special sugar which they may require from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite desirable that a company which will have a monopoly of the sugar production in the country should be responsible for the importation of whatever sugar is necessary, subject to provision being made for meeting the point to which Senator Blythe has drawn attention; but it seems to me that where <Col N="2324" /> there is a public or semi-public corporation such as the sugar company, which has a monopoly of the manufacture and, in effect, the sale of sugar, with the power it has, we should have a great deal more information than we have been able to get up to now as to the workings and economic activities of that company.  There are laid on the Table accounts in some kind of skeleton form, according to the statute.  I take it that they do conform to the statute, but they are very uninformative, and, in view of the position which this company holds in regard to what is practically a necessary of life, I suggest that we ought to be able to get the kind of information which a transport organisation provides.</P>
      <P>We want to have some kind of analysis of the costs, prices, and so on, provided publicly instead of having to ferret out and make guesses.  One reads the guesses of various Deputies in the Dáil as to the economics of sugar production and sale in terms of finance, but they are obviously estimates, based perhaps on wrong information, and the general picture which one gets from that debate is one of the Government side on the one hand and the Opposition on the other throwing figures at each other without any clear idea being given to the public of what the economic state of the sugar industry is.  We are not, and henceforward shall not be, dealing with a private concern, with the purchase and sale of such sugar in the way of private trade; we are dealing with a national organisation of the sugar industry and the public is paying a high price for sugar. The public ought to be able to know authoritatively what proportion of the price they are paying goes to the Central Fund by way of ordinary revenue; what proportion goes to the company and, subdividing what the company gets, what proportion goes to the farmer, the manufacturer, labour, and so on.  There at least ought to be a statistics given authoritatively and not merely guessed at to enable the public to know exactly what is being provided out of their 3½d. a lb. or whatever the price may be at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that when we are dealing with a public corporation <Col N="2325" /> of this kind, we ought at least to be provided with the materials in the way of statistical returns which would give us as much information in regard to a food product as we get in regard to a transport service.  I thought when it was provided in the original Act that the report would be made and laid on the Table by the company that we were going to get all that kind of information freely.  There is no reason why the company should want to hide it. It is not a private company which is afraid of its competitors, and I do not think there should be any objection whatever to providing that information to the public.  I would plead with the Minister, if only as an example for any other industrial undertaking of this kind, that we should now follow the example set by, let us say, the Electricity Supply Board.  They do give information in detail now as to the economics of their undertaking, and we should have the same in regard to this company.</P>
    <P>As a matter of detail, I would ask the Minister to explain Section 11.  I am not sure whether this is a departure from the normal.  It is probably a copy of a section of a similar kind in a British Act.  I am not sure whether this term &ldquo;for the benefit of the Exchequer&rdquo; is common in our Acts and whether the Minister for Finance ought to have the power to direct what should be done with the fees.  It strikes me that that is a departure from the usual practice, and I would ask the Minister to explain if there is any departure and just exactly what is intended by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Johnson's plea that accurate information should be given to the public as to the true state of the sugar industry, which is a very large one now.  As far as we can find out, the public pay about £1,000,000 more for the privilege of manufacturing their own sugar than they would pay if they imported all the sugar that they required.  I am open to correction and I am anxious for information about this matter.  We also know that £812,000 went to the revenue from this sugar business; that £780,000 was the cost of the sugar imported; and that <Col N="2326" /> the company's share of the business is £1,372,000.  These are very large figures.  The farmers get a sum which is calculated at £770,185.  That is not a very great deal when distributed amongst all the farmers, considering the terrible hard and troublesome work this is.  Of course, a share of what the farmers get goes to the agricultural labourers.  That is a very small share now considering the uneconomic price per ton paid to the farmers.  The factory wages come to about £160,000. That is not a very great deal either, but, of course, the factory people have not anything like the difficult and, I might say, dangerous work of those who grow the beet.  I have known unfortunate men engaged in beet growing who died from pneumonia and hardship. Only those who grow beet know the hardship of it.</P>
      <P>I would also make a plea, as this large amount of money is going to the revenue out of the sugar business and as they are going to get a little windfall from the transfer of the licences to the sugar company, that the price of sugar to the people should be reduced.  Something should be done to reduce the price.  The poor people are paying 4d. per lb. at present for it.  I made inquiries in order to be accurate about that, and I found that 4/- per stone has been paid for sugar for a considerable time past and that it is sold by the lb. at 4d.  That is a very heavy tax on poor people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of the sugar imported.  To my own knowledge, a large number of beet growers at the end of the season found that the amount of beet they had on hands was more than the company's estimate for the acreage for which they had a contract to grow.  These people had no intention of growing more beet than the acreage allotted to them.  They sowed exactly the amount of seed they got from the company, as the company distributes the seed. Not having any means of measuring a statute acre accurately, they sowed this seed as far as it went, and it produced a good crop, according to the year.  At the end of the season, however, the company refused to take the amount of beet which was estimated to be over the proper amount <Col N="2327" /> that a statute acre should produce, and a large number of unfortunate people, some neighbours of my own, were left with quantities of beet on hands.</P>
    <P>That happened several times when the Carlow factory only was working and they always made arrangements to take this extra beet.  If they had taken it on this occasion, it would not have amounted to a great deal, and we would have had more sugar manufactured in the country and less imported.  That was a very severe hardship on the people. I hope the company, if that occurs in future, will make arrangements to take all the beet off the people's hands, even if, unintentionally, they may have more than they are entitled to have, according to the acreage allotted to them.  As I say, the old factory always accommodated them and never left any beet on their hands.  They may have given a smaller price, or made some special arrangement with them to take it, but they never left it on their hands. Senator MacEllin may smile at that. He is a director, of course, and does not consider the great hardship it is on these people, or he has not much sympathy with them, I take it.  It is no joke, however, for the unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister and tried to understand how the question of the sole importer was being arranged.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, of course we understand it.  Are they to give out the sugar to the persons who have been hitherto importing it? Is that a physical process?  Do they actually take possession of the sugar and redistribute the actual sugar to the merchants; or do they settle the question of who is to import sugar? Have they a right to give out licences or will the sugar go direct to the importer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask these questions, because if the sugar is all to be brought to one place at first and then shipped down the country to another place one can easily see how the cost to the public will mount up.  Perhaps that is not at all what the Minister means.  When replying, perhaps he will tell us how this is to be operated or whether it will tend to make the sugar cheaper or dearer so far as the charge on the sugar itself is concerned.  Apparently the sugar company is going to make no profit in the transaction.  Do I take it that the people who get these licences to import are to pay for the licences certain amounts which are not specified in the Bill?  When we come to the Committee Stage I hope the Minister will be able to give us details of all these things which it will be interesting to know.  It would be interesting to know how this principle of one single licensee is to work out. Has the company a right to transfer to other importers its licences?  I would like to know from the Minister how the sugar is to be handled, and how everything is done in the way of freight.  It is important that the House should know that so that no extra charges should be made on the public.  It is also important to know how these licensing fees are to be paid. I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="2329" /> will say that this is the time to deal with this matter or that it should be dealt with on the Committee Stage. Probably all that will emerge when we are in Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has so many powers in his hands that even at the present moment I have been caught up once or twice in course of this debate and told that the powers were already there and that I need not bother my head about it. But this Bill gives the Minister power to say where the sugar is to come from. I would ask Senators to look at Section 7.  In (2) (b) we read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;limiting such licence to sugar manufactured or produced in a specified country;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and in (d) we read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the manner in which and the route by which sugar imported under such licence shall be brought to Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section gives very large powers. There is there given to the Minister power by which he can say to anybody or to any country with which we are dealing: &ldquo;I will not have your sugar.&rdquo;  This makes the position absolutely different to what the position would be if importers were buying sugar as they like, where they like and settling the price.  The Minister will, I presume, say: &ldquo;I have got the powers already.&rdquo;  Probably he has, but if so I do not know why these powers are again specially put into this Bill.  They are not powers connected with the distribution of sugar in this country.  I would like the Minister to tell us why these things are put in the Bill and what he intends to do with these powers.  I have noticed what Senator Johnson has said about this Bill.  Everybody is interested in the matter of sugar. Some of us make jam at home and we know from our cooks that there is a certain sort of sugar required to make decent jam.  How are private people going to get the supplies needed to make their own jam in a private household?  Probably the Minister will deal with that matter in his reply. From what the Minister has told us I take it that the Bill is a necessary part of administration, and I suppose we can do nothing but pass it, but we <Col N="2330" /> ought to be given an explanation on the points I have raised either now or on the Committee Stage.</P>

Can they charge any price they like, declare any dividend they wish and give the farmers what they like to pay them?  I would like to know what regulations are there in order to keep the price at what it ought to be?  Is it only by investigating the accounts which are supposed to be placed on the Table of the House that the public will be in a position to see the profits the company is making?  In what way is the public to be safeguarded in the supply of sugar which is now being placed in the hands of one monopoly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Jameson, I think, misunderstands somewhat the purpose of the Bill.  At the present time, as Senator Wilson pointed out, the import of sugar is controlled by the Control of Imports Act under which licences for specified quantities are given to a number of importers.  I propose to change that system and to give one licence only to Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann Teoranta.  That company will be the importer of sugar. No doubt they will arrange to deliver the sugar to the stores of the merchant to whom they will sell it, and any fees to be charged will be paid by the company.  The company will sell that sugar to the wholesale merchants at the same price at which the home production is sold to them so that the price will be uniform throughout the year, something which manufacturers desire very much, for fluctuation in price is detrimental to the interests of the manufacturers.  Senator Miss Browne asked what are we paying for sugar at the present time over and above what we would have to pay if we used imported sugar only.  She has asked a question that cannot very well be answered.  First of all, a number of assumptions have to be made.  If we assume that there are no duties paid <Col N="2331" /> at all upon imported sugar or home-produced sugar&mdash;and both are subject to a duty&mdash;then it is correct to say that the difference would be considerable. As Senator Miss Browne stated, imported sugar is coming in here at the entirely uneconomic price of 7/- a cwt. delivered at the quay in Dublin. That is a price well below the cost of producing and delivering that sugar. That sugar has been heavily subsidised. I mentioned in the Dáil that in CzechoSlovakia, the place from which the sugar comes, the retail price of sugar to the public is 6d. per lb.  The consumer there has got to pay that very high price so as to enable the government there to subsidise the export of sugar.  Sugar has always been subject to a Customs duty, and, taking the Customs duty into account on the one side and the existing Excise duty that is charged here on the sugar, there is practically no difference between the price of the imported sugar and the home-produced sugar except a difference of a few pence to which I have already referred.  Ordinarily, the difference is not sufficient to enable any variation in the retail price to be effected.  If we used imported sugar only, the State would get a much larger revenue from sugar than it is getting.  In the past, the State got a larger revenue from sugar than it is at present getting and a considerable part of that revenue had to be sacrificed to enable the sugar manufacturing project to be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the importation of special qualities of sugar, there is, in fact, only one importer in that position &mdash;the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland, which is a Government concern. Only a proportion of the sugar used by that company has to be imported.  Apparently, a special class of sugar has to be used in the manufacture of condensed milk which is to be exported to tropical countries. That is the only class of sugar in that special category.  There is no difference between beet sugar and cane sugar in the manufacture of jams, in which Senator Jameson is interested. Various tests&mdash;scientific and practical &mdash;were carried out, and that fact was demonstrated.  Other classes of sugar <Col N="2332" /> which, in the past, had to be imported, such as cube sugar, castor sugar and Demerara sugar, were made at Carlow during the course of the present year.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that members of the Oireachtas should have full information as to the operations of the sugar company.  I cannot say from memory what are the provisions of the Act under which the sugar company is operating&mdash;whether the information to be tabled is specified in the Act, or whether it is prescribed by the Minister for Finance, but to the extent that it is possible I think it is desirable that information should be given.  I have, perhaps, a natural suspicion when that request for information is endorsed by people largely interested in the price which farmers get for their beet.  One would have to bear in mind the demands which might be made on the sugar company on the basis of information made available in that way but, generally speaking, it is desirable that the public should be informed of the purposes to which the money received by the company in return for the sugar sold is devoted. A large part of it goes for beet, a large part goes in wages and the balance goes in capital charges of one kind or another.  Any profits that may be derived, over and above the amount necessary to pay interest on the preference shares, the charges on the debentures and allocations to reserve, would go into the Exchequer, the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the State, owning all the ordinary shares of the Company.  That is, I think, also an answer to Senator Wilson. The State controls the company, and if the company were to act in an unreasonable manner, or in a manner detrimental to the public interest, the State would have to exercise that control. In fact, all these charges are discussed with the Ministers concerned &mdash;the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry&mdash;and agreed to beforehand.</P>

      <P>Who represents the buying public in these discussions? One can conceive the Minister for Agriculture desiring to enhance the price of beet to the farmer and the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2333" /> being anxious to improve generally the position of suppliers of industrial goods.  They, with the Minister for Finance, may agree as to the price at which sugar is to be sold to the public, but who represents the public?</P>

      <P>The problem of excess beet was raised.  The matter is not quite in order, but I should like to say that it would be a highly dangerous policy for the company to encourage the farmers to grow more than the stipulated acreage.  Farmers may grow more unintentionally and, I think, the great majority of them did not measure the acre or two acres sufficiently <Col N="2334" /> accurately.  It is worth noting that a lot of the statistics on which we have worked as to the yield of beet per acre have been invalidated by the discovery that they were very large acres on which the beet was grown.  This year the company could have taken excess beet and made it into sugar because the company's total production is less than our requirements of sugar, but that would, certainly, encourage the growing of excess beet next year, when it would be impossible for the company to take it.  The farmers would, therefore, have to suffer loss or the company would have to suffer substantial loss in so far as they might make sugar completely in excess of our requirements.  It is necessary for the company to make quite clear to the growers that only the stipulated acreage should be grown.</P>
      <P>Senator Jameson rightly anticipated my answer to his question concerning the powers proposed to be conferred on the Minister.  I have these powers already.  They are conferred by the Control of Imports Act, and the section in this Bill is a mere transposition of the corresponding section in the Control of Imports Act.  That power has not been used in relation to sugar in the past.  It was used in relation to the coal quota and the quota in respect of oranges, but I cannot remember any other occasion on which it was used. It has not been used in respect of sugar, and it is doubtful whether, in all the circumstances, it could be used in respect of sugar.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson raised a question as to the form of Section 11.  Section 11 is, I understand, in the form in which it appears in all measures providing for the collection of fees.  It is provided that such fees shall be paid in for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.  It is not intended that there should be anything unusual in the form of the section.  Senator Miss Browne referred to people who are paying 4d. per lb. for sugar.  That may be the position in certain isolated areas, but the proper price in any of the 30 centres at which sugar is sold free of transportation cost, or of any adjoining areas, should be 3½d.</P>

      <P>This motion in the name of Senator Johnson is one to which we attach a good deal of importance.

      <P>Having suffered, as Senator Johnson has, in connection with motions which I have had on the Order Paper from time to time, I would like to say that I do not think it is unreasonable to ask that the motion should be so placed on the Order Paper as to ensure that it will come on early for discussion. <Col N="2336" /> If a motion such as this appears at the end of the Order Paper it is not likely to be discussed for some considerable time.  The other business may occupy a great part of the day's sitting, and in the evening there may be only a sparse attendance of members. Although I have no particular interest in the motion, I think it is only reasonable that arrangements should be made so that it will come on early for discussion.  I remember that a motion of mine appeared on the Order Paper for weeks.  It was not possible to have a discussion on it until a definite order was made giving it an early place on the agenda.</P>
