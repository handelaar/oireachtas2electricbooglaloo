    <Title>Telephone Capital Bill, 1968    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, briefly, to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance moneys, up to a limit of £50 million, for continued development of the telephone service.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the telephone service falls under two main heads.  The cost of operation and maintenance is borne out of moneys provided annually by the Oireachtas under the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but extension and development of the system are covered by funds provided under Telephone Capital Acts.</P>
      <P>These Acts empower the Minister for Finance to issue out of the Central Fund sums for development of the telephone service and empower him also to borrow in order to meet or repay the issues from the Central Fund.  The Acts do not of themselves authorise expenditure, but merely ensure the continued availability of capital.  Expenditure is authorised and issues from the Central Fund are made on foot of annual estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The moneys required for repayment of the sums borrowed are provided annually under sub-head G of the Post Office Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> The Telephone Capital Act, 1963, passed in December 1963 authorised the Minister for Finance to issue a total of £30 million for telephone development in the following 5 years. There had been on hands at 1st April, 1963, a balance of £2,555,000 from previous legislation.  Expenditure during the five years ended 31st March, 1968, amounted to £28,897,000 leaving a balance of £3,658,000 which is now exhausted.</P>
    <P>During this period 76,000 new subscribers' lines were connected to the system, 209,000 miles of new trunk circuits were added and 479 kiosks were erected.  Over 190 important trunk schemes&mdash;underground or overhead cables or radio links&mdash;were completed. 220 manual telephone exchanges were converted to automatic working and the capacity of existing automatic exchanges was increased by 54,000 terminations.</P>
    <P>When my predecessor was introducing the last Telephone Capital Bill in 1963 he emphasised that the main effort would be concentrated on improving the quality of the service to existing users at the expense of delaying connection of new telephones and running up the waiting list.  This policy was followed, but from 1965-66 on when the trunk capacity of the system had been greatly enlarged it was possible to devote more engineering effort to providing service for new applicants and the waiting list was substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>The £50 million capital expenditure provided for under this Bill represents the estimate of the cost of the works programme which it is hoped to carry out in a 5 year period.  A net increase of about 115,000 subscribers' lines is provided for, representing a growth rate of 9.4 per cent in the 1963-1968 period.  Some 500 new kiosks will be erected.</P>
    <P>Four new automatic exchanges will be opened in the Dublin area and one in Limerick.  New trunk exchanges will be brought into service in Dublin and Cork.  A new international exchange will also be provided in Dublin to cater for our foreign traffic which, <Col N="572" /> except for that with the United States, has hitherto been handled by the London International Exchange.  It is hoped to convert some 300 exchanges to automatic working in the next 5 year period, including the larger exchanges at Wexford, Killarney, Clonmel, Castlebar, Ballina and Monaghan.  In addition the spare capacity of all existing automatic exchanges will be raised to a level adequate to provide for further expansion.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress at present on several major trunk circuiting schemes and many more are planned for the next few years in order to keep ahead of the growth of traffic which is estimated to rise at 15 per cent per annum. As the list is rather lengthy I shall mention only the principal schemes. Radio links, each with a capacity of 960 telephone circuits, are expected to be brought into service this year between Dublin and Great Britain and between Dublin and Portlaoise.  Similar links will be completed next year between Dublin and Cork and between Portlaoise and Athlone.  An underground co-axial trunk cable from Athlone through Roscommon, Castlerea, Claremorris and Castlebar to Ballina will be finished by the end of the year. Work will start in the near future on cables between Athlone and Galway, between Galway and Clifden and between Ballina and Belmullet.</P>
    <P>Substantial amounts of additional equipment will also be provided at various centres to switch dialled calls throughout the network.</P>
    <P>It is planned to introduce subscriber trunk dialling to London and Belfast in about 12 months time and to extend this facility later to other places in Britain and in Continental Europe.</P>
    <P>A new type of coinbox telephone from which trunk calls as well as local calls can be dialled by the users will be introduced in 1971 when the changeover to decimal currency occurs.</P>
    <P>The expenditure is estimated to be as follows: £22½ million on subscribers' exchange lines and apparatus, £14 million on trunk circuits, £11 million on equipment of new exchanges and extension of existing exchanges and £2½ million on buildings.</P>
    <P>Over the past five years the work <Col N="573" /> force of skilled and semi-skilled technicians required for large scale expansion has been built up and more are in training.  Moreover, industrial consultants have been employed for a period of 18 months from whose recommendations it is hoped to secure a substantial increase in productivity by use of more mechanical aids and better organisation.  Professional engineers have not become available in as large numbers as would be desired but there are grounds for hoping that this difficulty may be surmounted.</P>
    <P>Despite the valuable progress already made, the telephone service in Ireland is as yet in an early stage of development. A first-class telephone service is today essential to industrial and commercial progress.  Socially also its value is high.  I am convinced that with rising living standards and the growth of industry and business there are boundless opportunities for rapid expansion of the telephone service to the benefit of the whole community.</P>
    <P>Apart from direct contribution the service makes to economic and social progress it is a sound commercial proposition.  The return on capital in recent years has averaged 7 per cent. If the service were allowed to re-invest its surplus and depreciation provision it would be able to finance about 40 per cent of its capital requirements from its own resources.  In effect, therefore, the Exchequer will be called upon to provide only about £5.5 million net, per annum, and interest will, of course, be paid on all sums invested by the Exchequer in the service.</P>
    <P>The moneys to be provided under this Bill will enable the service to be continuously improved, to make a modest profit for the taxpayer and to give employment to some hundreds of extra skilled and semi-skilled men as well as to many engineering graduates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of recent achievements and the plans for the future which the Minister has given us must be encouraging when we bear in mind the problems we have had with the telephone service, even though many of these problems are still with us.  Since 1963, when we first took these problems seriously, a lot has <Col N="574" /> been done, but a lot remains to be done.  It is clear also that in the five years ahead it is intended to accelerate this progress.  There is one point, however, on which I am not quite clear and perhaps I missed it in the Minister's speech.  Is it the case that the extra £50 million is to be spent in the next five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a five-year programme but, as the Senator is probably aware, issues of the amounts are made on foot of annual estimates approved by the Minister for Finance. For that reason there is no guarantee that all the money can be spent, but I hope it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is planning for the telephone service for a five-year period and this raises the question of why we have four-year economic programmes and a five-year programme for the telephone service. It may be that a four-year period is too short for the development of the telephone service, a service which is so capitally intensive.  If a four-year period is too short for such a capitally intensive service perhaps a four-year period is also too short for an economic programme. We know that a seven-year period is too long, the scrapping of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion has proved that, but the point about the five-year programme for the telephone service does make one wonder whether our economic programmes might be for five years instead of four.</P>
      <P>The method of financing is also rather unusual and cumbersome.  It seems to combine our two systems, it is voted every year and then we have legislation authorising expenditure over a number of years.  For other purposes these two systems are used separately but here we find them com bined in a rather unwieldy and cumbersome manner.  This is a rather complex system which combines the two systems we have of controlling capital expenditure and I think it should be simplified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of whether the Post Office should become a State enterprise.  The Minister makes no reference to this matter in his <Col N="575" /> speech.  It is the policy of Fine Gael that the Post Office should be converted to a State enterprise.  The present system is too cumbersome and the fact that the moneys required have to be voted annually and the receipts from the service paid into the Exchequer is an unsatisfactory and archaic way of dealing with what is, in fact, a major commercial enterprise which involves social obligations that render them uneconomic.</P>
    <P>There are social obligations involved in providing telephone services in a country of low population density but nevertheless it is run as a commercial enterprise.  It earns return on the capital. It could, if financed in another way, provide for nearly half of its capital requirements out of the profits of its operation.  There seems to be more of a case for its conversion into a State enterprise than a number of businesses which are at present State enterprises. We can ask the Minister to comment on this and we can ask him am I right in saying that there has been a general announcement on this point and on how the Government intend to proceed.  The provisions for capital here seem to be unnecessarily cumbersome and could be abandoned if the services were converted into a State enterprise.</P>
    <P>The waiting list is still with us.  It may have been possible since 1965-66 to reduce the list of priorities.  I should be glad to know how the waiting list has changed since 1965-66. The existence of a waiting list is something which people find very puzzling. It is something which foreign firms coming in find extremely puzzling. Most services one looks for, like electricity, gas or transport, are available when firms start operating, and when the requirement is there for the service, it is made available at that time. When you have a firm starting or a new household they are not normally told, in urban areas, that they will have to wait weeks or even months before getting electricity.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we have come to accept this extraordinary position that one waits for telephones?  The whole thing is run in a manner which is uncommercial. <Col N="576" /> There are people who will say that is because it is a State enterprise and State enterprises have not got flexibility and are not able to act commercially and that therefore it is inevitable that the position should be like that.  This is not the case.  We have many examples of State enterprises run as efficiently as commercial enterprises which are just as flexible as private enterprise is.  We have still this example of a body run very much like a social welfare service.  Telephones are issued like the dole and you have to wait your turn and queue up for them.  This is not like a commercial enterprise at all.  You are told it is more efficient because it means that telephones can be installed in only one area at a time and then the installation people could move to another area. This is a principle not applied elsewhere. It is not applied in the installation of electricity or gas.  It is not applied in transport services or in any of the other services which individuals need.  It seems to be the remains of an old out-of-date mentality which should not exist in State services and which continues to give currency to the belief that State enterprise is incapable of acting commercially.</P>
    <P>I will not be satisfied until we reach a stage where there is not any waiting for telephones more than any other service we need.  It makes an appalling impression on businessmen coming to the country when they have to wait for telephones.  The most universal complaint, particularly with Americans, is the telephone service.  They cannot understand how services should not be offered to them.  They should not be held back and told they have to fill up forms and wait their turn as if it were some kind of privilege to have a telephone instead of some sort of profitable thing for the State to provide one.  Telephones should be provided wherever they are needed.  Indeed, the widespread American belief that State enterprise is incapable of being efficient is given a further lease of life by this situation.  I have found it difficult to persuade Americans, or those of them who have had experience of this difficulty in the telephone service, that this difficulty is not representative of State enterprise in general.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> I hope that the Minister will change the attitude and approach here and make the telephone service as commercial, go-ahead, and flexible as other State bodies.  They should be selling their telephone service to anybody they can persuade to get a telephone just as Aer Lingus are persuading people to travel by air to and from this country. There is no reason why this attitude should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I will have the Minister's sympathy, as he, too, is conscious of the problem of getting to this stage of an appalling backlog of investment built up since 1963 partly because of the failure of the Government to appreciate the development of the economy and the emergence of economic growth when it came after 1958.  There is a backlog which is expensive to catch up on.  We have hopes now, in view of the magnitude of the sum of £10 million per year which is to be spent from now on, that the Minister will be able to tell us that this whole waiting system will evaporate in the near future and that the telephone service will be selling telephones instead of holding them up.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that we are to have our own international exchange. It is one of the irritating features of the present situation that we are treated as if we were part of the British provinces. It is irritating to make a phone call abroad and to be handed over to the London exchange and from then on to be dealing with them as if one were in Bradford or Cardiff.  The idea that we would have no direct contact of our own is ludicrous.  I am delighted to hear that this situation is being looked at.</P>
    <P>I come now to subscriber trunk dialling outside this country.  I am glad we are reaching this point.  I understand there are technical problems but it seems that the volume of traffic between Ireland and Britain and Ireland and Northern Ireland is such as would have warranted installations for subscriber trunk dialling long ago.  The present situation as regards international calls is unsatisfactory.  When one is in Britain and sees how easy it is to make a call to any part of the country without going through the exchange it is frustrating, in ringing Dublin, to go through the exchange. <Col N="578" /> There must be a large volume of traffic between Dublin and London exceeding far that between many cities in Britain. It is irritating to go through the exchange to get on to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the introduction of decimal currency.  In the telephone system as elsewhere we shall find that the decimal currency decision will lead to a very unsatisfactory position.  I regret that the whole proposal for this decimal currency at the behest of the Irish banks and against the wishes of Irish industry was taken and was not more strongly opposed.  We are now in the position that the unit of currency is to be 2.4d in our current money terms.  I am wondering what the price of phone calls will be and how they are to be paid for in future.  At the moment we have a sixpenny call.  That would be 2½ of these new units.  Has the Minister given thought to the problems involved here? Are we in future to have calls paid for in units of new pence?  The units are of five new pence.  Are we to be in a position, when decimal currency is introduced, that there will not be 2½ of these new pence in a coin and that the cost of a telephone call will be raised to 7.2 existing pence instead of 6d at the moment because there is not any unit small enough to enable us to pay 6d for a call on the telephone service as it is now?  Are we to be in a position of being able to pay for a telephone call in units of new pence? Indeed, are we to be in a position to pay for telephone calls in units of new pence or are we to be told that the smallest unit will be as it is in Britain at the moment, which amounts to five new pence being the equivalent of a shilling?</P>
    <P>I should like to know the Minister's plan for the introduction of decimal currency.  The system is totally inflexible. The smallest unit is ten times bigger than it should be for the purpose of accurate pricing and this will have drastic inflationary effects.  It will make it impossible for any prices to be accurately converted, and further it will give monopoly profits to all people both in public and private sectors.  Unfortunately, we are now too near decimal day for the Minister to <Col N="579" /> do anything about changing the system, but he should tell us if we will be automatically faced with a 20 per cent increase in telephone charges, simply because there is no equivalent coin to the sixpence.  I hope that his answer will be to reduce it to 4.8 pence.  Nothing ever comes down in price and I fear that the introduction of decimalisation will be used to jack up telephone charges.  I should like the Minister's reassurance as to how he intends to work this totally inflexible currency which is of such an inflationary character.</P>
    <P>One point I meant to make earlier is that I particularly welcome the fast growth rate which is provided for in the telephone programme because it is a vote of confidence on the one hand in future economic expansion which is currently threatened.  The fact that we are planning a 9.4 per cent growth also offers the prospect, as I said earlier, of catching up with the backlog.  I am glad that the period during which the telephone service was skimped for capital to a degree which impeded the economic life of the country seems to be coming to an end, judging by the scale of activity on which the Minister is now embarking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start with a word of praise for the telephone service.  I do not use the trunk service very often, but when I have occasion to contact the operator I get good manners and first-class service.  I have some experience of the telephone service in Britain and France and I feel this is something that should not be taken for granted: the good manners, pleasant voices and personality of the operators are very refreshing and it would be lamentable if this were lost.  Praise should be given where praise is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not use the trunk service very frequently but quite recently I received a call from Calgary which was very clear and I think our telephone service deserves praise for general efficiency. I put through three successive calls to West Cork and, again, efficiency and courtesy were the keynotes.  I also had occasion last May to make a number of telephone calls to France&mdash;my wife <Col N="580" /> was there and was unable to return home due to the rail strike&mdash;and I was able to speak to Amiens with great clarity even at the height of the French industrial and political crises. Praise for the telephone service for their efficiency applies not only to our own service but to the intervening services in Britain and France.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the bad conditions in which they have to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is probably true.  One does not like to digress.  I shall rely on Senator McQuillan to deal with that matter. I am inclined to agree with him that in spite of certain conditions these operators remain polite, and let us hope they will be encouraged to remain polite.  I am sure Senator McQuillan presently will draw the Minister's attention to these matters.</P>
      <P>There is one point of inefficiency to which Senator FitzGerald referred and I should also like to advert to the question of installation.  When the service is functioning one gets efficiency but in order to get a telephone installed one has to wait a long time.  I should like to ask the Minister what is now the average time lapse between application for a phone and its installation?  I am prepared to be told that this will vary from place to place, but I should like to know what kind of time-lag is now considered inevitable between the moment of application for a phone and its installation.</P>
      <P>No doubt the Minister will remember that I had occasion last December to draw his attention to the fact that an applicant for a telephone in a Dublin suburb had applied last July and the telephone had not then been installed in the new house into which he wanted to move.  The application was accompanied by a statement from the hospital to the effect that this man, who was an electrician by trade, was consultant to the hospital on electrical matters and had to be on 24-hour call and therefore he had to have a telephone installed before he could move into his new house.  The clergy and doctors on the same road had already got temporary connections with the new installation but this had not been granted to the electrician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I brought the matter to the attention of the Minister in December and I was disappointed to receive a reply from him stating that the man would have to wait until the end of January before he could hope to get a phone. The Minister did not advert to the special circumstances of the case where the man was required to be on 24-hour call.  One point which dismayed me was that the Minister seemed to consider it quite natural that this man, who had applied in July for a phone, should be condemned to wait until the following January.  I pose the question, is a period of six months considered quite usual and normal?  I might add that despite the Minister's hope that the person in question would get the telephone by the end of January, it was, in fact, nearer the end of February before the phone was eventually installed.  This seems extraordinary to me and I share the view of Senator FitzGerald in relation to the question of speedy installation.  Senator FitzGerald also said he felt sure that the Minister is concerned about the delay in installation of phones.  I should like to feel he is even more actively concerned about this than he has appeared so far.</P>
    <P>There are two features of the telephone service which call for a word of praise.  The first is the efficiency of the actual operation of the service in general and, secondly, the good manners of the vast majority of the operators.  I mentioned what appears to me to be inefficiency at the level of installation and I wonder whether enough staff is employed in that sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to come to a Bill of this type and to say that it undoubtedly represents a record of progress.  We are provided again with an opportunity of reviewing progress, which we can do in giving this permissive consent to the expenditure of £50 million capital over the next five years.  I would like to endorse what the previous speakers have said about many of the characteristics of our telephone service.  Undoubtedly the courtesy is something that anyone can appreciate, and the genuine ring of friendliness is again something that is very much appreciated by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also refreshing to note that the <Col N="582" /> service is by and large a commercial success, in other words that it is able to remunerate the capital even though it is not able to provide all the capital for the big expansion ahead.  It is quite reasonable, then, that it is providing the usual return on investment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. That is all to the good.  Before getting to the main point, I want to say that perhaps the most persistent fault that seems to be occurring is that of line crossing.  It is not infrequent to get conversations crossing.  I know that there are technical difficulties, but this is something to which a greater effort should be applied to eradicate it.  If the telephone line cannot guarantee privacy it loses most of its value.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to say is that I have been dismayed on many occasions at seeing the vandalism and wrecking of public kiosks.  I would like to see a more positive effort or general appeals to the public to try to get rid of this vandalism and waste of our national resources.</P>
    <P>I should also come to the point raised by Senator Garret FitzGerald as to whether it should become a semi-State body or not.  I know the difficulties involved in disentangling it from the post office activities in which it has grown up, but it would be worthwhile to consider putting it on its own as a semi-State body.  I have many reasons for that, not on the telephone side alone.  Take the Minister's statement where he said that professional engineers are not coming in quite as fast as are needed.  This is a rather serious state for the country as a whole because the professional engineers concerned are amongst our most skilled engineers.  They are the electronic specialists and we live today in an age of electronics.  Unfortunately the telephone service, or the posts and telegraphs, have fallen down in this task and are not attracting the best of our young electrical engineers.  We see that foreign firms in England and elsewhere are continually beating the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for our good young men.  This is very sad, not so much for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a concern but for this country as a whole, because if we <Col N="583" /> take the electronics revolution seriously and the tremendous part it plays in modern life and in modern industrial development it is obvious that we should try to create here a pool of trained electronic specialists, the best of our people, and we should take the standpoint that no commercial firm in England, Switzerland or anywhere else is going to beat us for those people.</P>
    <P>That is why I put it to the Minister that there is in the telephone service the possibility of creating this central nucleus or body that would be the conservatory of our electronics specialists within the country, because when we face an expenditure of £10 million a year it is obvious that the spending of, say, five per cent of that, which after all is only £500,000 a year, classed as pure research and development in electronics, would not be a big sum to spend, yet it would provide the nucleus and the initiative to set up this electronics centre.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he would consider linking with this a national computer service, because we need that also and it has a natural affinity to the electronics of the posts and telegraphs.  Indeed it would not be hard for this firm to do a more business-like job than, for instance, CIE are doing, where they generally ask you for the colour of your eyes before they will rent computer time to you.</P>
    <P>I had an astounding experience last October when, having booked half an hour's computer time with CIE, paid for out of my own pocket at the rate of £45 an hour, I was told three hours beforehand by the Director that in his judgment the programme could not be in operation by then and could not proceed.  This runs contrary to the commercial practice anywhere that if you rent the computer it does not matter whether you turn up to use it or not provided you pay the bill&mdash;that is all that matters.  So I would suggest to the Minister that a national body which has no affinity at all with national transport any more than it has with any other large activity should have this as its number one electronics task.  This should also become a tremendous source of revenue, and I <Col N="584" /> would appeal to the Minister, knowing his imagination and his courage, to examine this.  I know that he will see the advantage in creating this school. I would like to see this school as the place where we could have our best brains trained in electronics so that industries throughout the country when they need that, as they will very often, could get consultant electronics from this.</P>

I am making this suggestion as one concerned with the education of engineers and who knows the difficulties that the Department is in in trying to recruit more of our young engineers.  I would like to see this centre so that not alone would specialist service be acquired from it on a consultant basis but men would be taken from it to man corresponding positions elsewhere in our industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that even if he is to retain the engineers he already has, he would require to implement speedily the recent award to engineers because there is a great deal of disquiet about this and the profession as a whole are not happy that it should be put aside for three months and that they are told it cannot be considered until such time as some other commission concerned with higher level salaries make a report.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his statement in which he has given us all the information we need.  I look forward to discussing with the Minister the setting up of a national centre of electronics in connection with our telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I agree with most of what Senator Quinlan has said, I still think he must be a very naïve man if he thinks that there is any possibility whatsoever that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would embark on, shall we say, a first-class programme such as the one described by Senator Quinlan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, the outlook of the Minister and his Department during the years has been a very conservative one.  In so far as this Bill is concerned, it must be accepted that the Minister's statement is correct when he says that a first-class telephone service is essential for industrial and commercial purposes as well as for its social value.  Of course, there is a fantasy about the Minister's opening statement when we realise that the real boss in control of our telephone capital development is the Minister for Finance.  We must realise, then, that Deputy Childers' statement saying that he is running a commercial enterprise is inaccurate. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is merely a puppet or an agent for the Minister for Finance and not one penny piece can be raised by him to expand the Post Office services or the telephone services without the sanction of the Minister for Finance. <Col N="586" /> How, then, can the Minister claim that he is dealing with and running a commercial concern, which he alleges gives reasonable profit to the taxpayer, when all the decisions with regard to the capital expenditure lie with the Minister for Finance and his Department? Whenever the Government found it necessary&mdash;because, shall we say, they were convinced of the right of State enterprise&mdash;to utilise State enterprise, they, in so far as was possible, gave public corporation status to the particular enterprise, and they immediately decided in each case to cut away the particular concern from the Department concerned and from the Department of Finance.  Therefore, if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are to run their telephone capital development on the lines on which the Department of Finance would run it, we would be in the same position in five years time as the country is in at present time.</P>
    <P>There are a number of inaccuracies in the Minister's statement and also in the statements made recently by him in the Dáil with regard to this matter. For instance, he says that there will be a profit for the taxpayer arising from this measure.  I should like him to elaborate on where the profit is for the taxpayer.  A sum of up to £50 million must be raised by the Minister for Finance and there are a number of methods available to the Minister to do this.  He may raise the money by floating a national loan which costs up to 7½ or 8 per cent and which will cost more from now on; or, as on other occasions, the Minister may borrow from the commercial banks; so if one looks at the return which the Minister says is on the telephone profit&mdash;6½ or 7 per cent&mdash;I do not know how the Minister can make that claim when one remembers that 7 per cent or more has already been paid for that money by the Exchequer.  Where, then, does the profit come in for the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>Fifty million pounds is a big sum in this country at any time and I believe that the cost of the telephone system in Ireland at the present time is higher than in any other country which can be compared with ours in so far as incomes are concerned.  An <Col N="587" /> example of this was illustrated in today's <i>Irish Times.</i>  This told the story of a man who made a telephone call from Belfast to London which only cost him a few pence but when he made a call from Dún Laoghaire to London, the cost was 4/-.  These are the practical aspects of what the people have to pay and while we are going on the methods used by the Minister, we will have a very dear service and, consequently, our economic and commercial interests will suffer.</P>
    <P>The telephone service plays a vital part today in costings and if we do not give that service at a reasonable cost to industrial and commercial life, the consumer will suffer in the long run. At the present time and for some years past, there has been a tremendous demand for telephones.  It would be wrong for any Government or any Department to look on this as a kind of bonanza and to take the attitude that because there is a tremendous demand we can have higher charges for installation and for rent.</P>
    <P>This is a wrong approach.  At one time, officers were appointed who would try to convince the public of the wonderful thing the telephone would be and to encourage them to have it installed.  There were a number of people in this House at the time who did not appreciate that the public would go in in such a big way for telephones.  My fear is that because the public are so anxious for various reasons to have a telephone service the Department's callous approach so far as costing is concerned will do damage in years to come.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative method of financing the telephone development programme.  I do not think it should be done overnight.  It was in 1963 that we had the last Telephone Capital Bill. From 1963 to 1968 was a fair period of time for the Department of Finance and others to check on and examine alternative ways of raising the necessary funds rather than to bring in here another drab copy of the 1963 Act in the form of this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> I mentioned a few minutes ago that in order to service this expenditure, to service the money raised, the commercial banks will reap their pound of flesh.  I do not want to develop this in any detail but is it not an extraordinary thing that in other countries, to which the Minister has referred on a number of occasions, they can pay for the expansion in their telephone system out of funds coming into the Post Office from other sources?  I refer now to Sweden and highly developed countries like that to which the Minister has referred from time to time.  In those countries money made available through other services in the Post Office provide large capital sums at low interest rates which in turn can be utilised for telephone development work.  One of the major matters to which I refer in that field is the bank giro system.  I have no intention of going into it in any detail at all except to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I am saying there are alternative ways of raising this £50 million and one of the ways would be to bring in the giro system.  I do not say it would make money available immediately but instead of spending the past five years running the Department on the old lines, we should have reached a stage when the giro system could be functioning and bringing in a certain amount of money, perhaps increasing annually and reducing the burden of the cost on the community as a whole in the long run.  I do not intend to deal with that in any detail.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the Post Office being a sound commercial proposition and said that the Post Office is a business concern.  If it is the great business concern he says it is why is it that when he produces classified advertisements in the telephone directory he hands that out to an outside firm?  When asked the reason why this so-called commercial Department which he heads do not print the classified ads, his answer in the Dáil was that we must make use of a commercial concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to stretch it.  I do not want to go outside the scope of the Bill.  With your permission, Sir, I should like now to deal with another matter which is contained in the Minister's opening statement. He referred to the employment of industrial consultants.  To me, industrial consultants can be industrial consultants in the sense of looking after industrial relations, personnel relations, methods by which you look after the welfare of your staff.  It is in relation to the last category that I propose to make some further comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> When we bring in automatic exchanges and make these highly desirable improvements, it is extraordinary how we forget the people who man those contraptions.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington, Senator Quinlan and others paid tribute to the staff who man the exchanges.  That tribute is deserved and more than deserved.  I have already intervened to say that the courtesy and patience shown by the staff has been traditional in the telephone exchanges in spite of the fact that the same staff, both male and female, work in atrocious conditions. This House should urge the Minister that, side by side with all the technical improvements which we all hope to see, we should have improvements in regard to staff relations and the conditions in which they work.</P>
    <P>The position in many of these exchanges at present, which the Minister now hopes to improve, is that in the summertime they are simply sweat boxes.  They are overcrowded with young girls working in extraordinarily harsh conditions and under a Victorian type of supervision.  In the wintertime these same rooms are ice boxes.  We had an example within the past few weeks of the conditions in an exchange in Dublin.  The telephonists had complained about the scandalous conditions, the icy cold temperature within the exchange.  No more heed was paid to them than would have been paid if they had been up in a satellite.  In desperation they were forced to leave their place of work and walk out.  It is very interesting to note that within a matter of hours&mdash;the genie in the bottle was only trotting after them and Aladdin's lamp would have taken second place&mdash;some senior officials of the Department rushed in to provide heat at all angles and to improve the conditions in that exchange for the girls.</P>
    <P>It was rather annoying at the time to find the Minister's officials stating that they appreciated the hardship the girls were undergoing and felt sorry about it.  The extraordinary thing is that there was no action to remedy the position until the patience of the girls was exhausted and they walked out. Perhaps the girls will begin to learn <Col N="591" /> and understand what their strength means.</P>
    <P>The Senators who spoke about the courtesy and patience of the male and female telephonists are quite right.  I wonder how many Members of the House realise that many of the men who are giving excellent service from 7 o'clock in the evening have been in a temporary capacity during the past 10, 12 or 15 years.  I wonder how many Members of the House are aware of the mentality displayed by the Minister's staff towards the recruitment of people to man the exchanges in a part-time capacity.  I do not want to weary the House but it would be no harm to put on record a few comments by the Minister's officials about the manner in which part-time telephonists should be recruited.  I want to quote now from an official document from the Minister's Department dealing with part-time night telephone assistants.  I will not say much about it except that it is an official statement issued by high officials of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The statement says:</P>
    <P>Night telephone assistants have no right to continuing employment or to employment for any fixed number of hours weekly.  They are to be employed only according as they are required and are available.  The nights on which they are available should ordinarily be ascertained on enquiry from them and attendances listed as far as possible.  It is envisaged that the Assistants will be employed mainly during the summer pressure season and that outside this season they will be listed only sufficiently often to maintain their efficiency.  It is important that nothing be said or done which would tend to give the impression that this employment is otherwise than on a purely casual basis, giving no right to continued employment for any fixed period or number of hours weekly.  Where an Assistant reports late for duty, he should not be asked for an explanation&mdash;if he gives one, well and good&mdash;he should be paid only for the actual time worked. Moreover, if he absents himself he should not be asked for an explanation <Col N="592" /> and there is no question of requiring him to produce medical evidence in support of absences but the fact that an Assistant absents himself without sufficient reason should be borne in mind when considering his suitability for retention on the list of Assistants.  Regular scheduling of duties for them for periods in advance is undesirable and attendances should, as far as possible, be arranged on the basis of suiting the convenience of the individuals.</P>
    <P>These are official documents issued by the Minister's Department for the recruitment of people to man exchanges on a part-time basis.  The idea is to give them no indication they will be on duty over any particular period. There is no provision for annual holidays, and so forth.  The reason I mention that is to give an idea of the mentality at work inside the Department. To me that statement is a window into the mind of the Department.  There are two things lacking if you read those statements, firstly, regard for the public and, secondly, regard and respect for the worker as an individual.</P>
    <P>If you are to bring in people on such a basis it does not matter whether they are late or not or whether they attend or not and in such a situation the Department show no regard for the public.  I want to make it clear here that it was due to the pressure exercised in this House and outside it, and an exposure here some months ago of the scandalous position in Dublin and provincial exchanges, that the Department, with the greatest speed, changed their decision on the recruitment of full-time permanent telephonists.  Overnight the decision was altered to get away from the part-time basis and to bring in full-time telephonists.  It is desirable, but it only came about because of the pressure brought to bear.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister or his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lalor, were aware of the position in the Department which was to get rid of full-time male telephonists and replace them with part-time telephonists. Neither of those two politicians was aware of that position in <Col N="593" /> the Department as a result of a vendetta in the Department on the telephonists for fighting for their rights three or four years ago.  Who suffered in all this?  The general public did.  Any Senator here who wanted to use a telephone during the months of June, July or August will have found that one could wait up to eight minutes to get a reply from the exchange.  Why? Because 50 per cent of these part-time workers did not turn up.  Why should they when one sees the terms of their appointment where it says that it does not matter whether they came in or not and that they were not to be asked where they were?  This is a commercial concern and a concern, according to the Minister, which has regard for its staff.  When I read through the debates recently in Dáil Éireann dealing with the telephones and the comments of the principal Opposition speaker and Deputy Childers, I thought I was down at the Kildare Street Club. It is a matter of &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jolly fine work on the part of the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank you very much, indeed, Deputy&rdquo; from the Minister. The old school tie affair was going full tilt.  There was to be no question of showing up the position inside the exchanges.</P>
    <P>Mr. Childers wanted to turn the debate into an admiration society.  We know that he does not like bad news. He wants good news, night, noon and morning on RTE.  If he does not get good news he corrects the television staff for their manners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody more prepared to co-operate with the Chair than me.  It is on that basis that I limit my remarks on the Minister to saying this: if we want to bring about the changes in the telephone system to give good telephone services to the community and if we want the public to pay the least possible price for them, then we will have to change the Minister. I do not think this Minister is the proper person to do the job in the way I suggest.  I say that not because he is like Goebbels, as he has been accused of being.  Goebbels had a twisted mind. He was a man of immense talent who misused it.  That would be a completely wrong description of this Minister but a description which I read on the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday, by Ken Adams, former director of the BBC, on the position of the Postmaster General in England might be appropriate:</P>
      <P>Postmaster-Generals tend to be a pain in the neck, either too old and too stupid to be put anywhere else or too young and ambitious to stay and find out what it is all about.</P>
      <P>If we substitute &ldquo;Minister for Posts and Telegraphs&rdquo; it might suit the position of this country.  Senators Quinlan and FitzGerald posed a query to the Minister as to why steps are not being taken to make the Post Office, or the telephone end of it, a public corporation. I am in a rather difficult position in this because I do not for a moment accept the idea that the telephone service should be hived off and made a public corporation.  I think the entire Department should be included in a body which would be a public corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a terrible tragedy for the people to see the shilly-shallying and the delay by the Government in making up their mind.  When the Minister was queried about it in the Dáil he said that there was immense competition and the difficulties were tremendous.  He suggested that the Devlin Commission might give him some guidance on this question, and I was under the impression that a decision in principle had <Col N="595" /> been taken to make the Post Office, including the telephone section, a public corporation.  However, it would appear that no decision has been taken in this regard.  All I can do now is to emphasise at every possible opportunity that above all the sections in the Government in which we should have independence, the Post Office should have top priority, and there should be no slicing off at the telephone end, leaving the remainder in the hands of the Civil Service so that the other services could wither away.</P>
    <P>I have been rather confined in the scope of this Bill&mdash;I know it is not the fault of the Chair: it is because the terms of the Bill are such&mdash;but in conclusion I ask the Minister to examine his own conscience on the whole question of industrial relations within the telephone exchanges.  To my mind the Minister is in a very serious position at the present time if he is not prepared to improve the industrial relations within the Post Office while improving the technical end of the business.</P>
    <P>The Minister is on record as saying everything is right so far as the staff in the telephone exchanges are concerned, and he is also on record within the last month as stating in the Dáil there were no complaints worth talking about and if there were the system of conciliation and arbitration which is available is the ideal one to look after the interests of the staff.  If I am wrong in this perhaps the Minister will correct me. However, the Minister for Labour, Dr. Hillery, who should be the personnel officer for the Government, stated publicly he is sick and tired of trying to persuade the unions, including those in the Post Office, to take advantage of the improved conciliation by making the Labour Court available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has deplored the fact that the alleged unions in the Post Office have failed to take advantage of the new thinking on his part, to take advantage of the fact that a grievance officer, or a union ombudsman, would be made available to them under the Labour Court. Surely, when the Minister for Labour was making that statement in the Dáil he was doing it as a member of a <Col N="596" /> Government which included Deputy Childers, and Deputy Childers must take government responsibility for agreeing with Deputy Hillery that the existing conciliation and arbitration was not up to scratch and that the Labour Court was the place for the Post Office unions to go.  What does Deputy Childers do?  He says that the system of arbitration and conciliation in the Post Office is the best and he tries to dismiss members of the union because they wanted to go to the Labour Court.  His colleague, the Minister for Labour, says that the Labour Court is the best place to go while Deputy Childers still insists it is not. Why should Deputy Hillery blame the unions in the civil service?  Why does he not turn round and ask Deputy Childers: &ldquo;Why do you try to sabotage the Trade Union Bill and any advances I am trying to make so far as relations in the Post Office are concerned?&rdquo;  It would appear to me there is a very definite split in the Government on this.</P>

      <P>I wish to repeat that the Minister for Labour has, both in his opening and concluding statements, suggested that the Civil Service Association should take advantage of the Labour Court, and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in his capacity as head of the Post Office, has disapproved of that.  He is on record over the last 12 months as disagreeing on this point with Deputy Hillery.  It is time those two men decided what was right and wrong because many of the telephone operators are very anxious at the present time to know where the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stands on this issue, and whether he will now change his mind and agree with the Minister for Labour.  I do not wish to go any further into this and I hope the Minister will give us his views on this particular issue and let us know how wide the gap is between himself and Deputy Hillery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most fair-minded <Col N="597" /> people will accept that a good telephone service is necessary and essential for the industrial progress of the country and this has been the thinking of the Government on this matter. Each year it leans over backwards with the resources available to try to provide a better service and to meet the demands made on it for more telephones <i>et cetera.</i>  In the last five years it is worth noting what has taken place: since 1964, 76,000 new subscribers have come in and 209,000 miles of trunk services have been added; 479 kiosks have been provided and 190 underground and overhead cables have been laid.  This is certainly something at which we cannot scoff. People have been clamouring to have telephones but the Post Office say there is no use installing phones until the necessary links and connections have been laid.  For that reason it was necessary for the Government to provide extra equipment which is essential for a modern service and they took the line that until this groundwork was adequately tackled it would be useless to install phones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been accomplished during the last five years is something that any country could be proud of.  There may be people disappointed because of the delay but when they understood that these delays were necessary and that the Government were serious about remedying them as quickly as possible they accepted that.  Over that period now we see what has been accomplished. It is true that when standards of living rise naturally people expect to have what have now become known as modern amenities, that under Government policy houses have been improved, roads vastly improved, and this naturally leads to the situation that people have got to have the telephone installed not alone for business purposes but very often to their private houses.  This expansion can now take place because it has been well planned and it has been done in a systematic, intelligent way by the Government.  In the five years ahead, as in the statement issued here by the Minister, he saw the projection for the future is tremendously bright and if we are able to spend £7 million per year for five years <Col N="598" /> we will have come a long way to solving this matter of the telephone service in this country.  Therefore, I congratulate the Minister and the Government on doing this, and I am sure that the people will realise that it is doing this very important national work which is highly appreciated by the business people and by the ordinary people of the country, and that they will recognise that and ensure that the Government will continue to bring this programme to a proper conclusion.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate, but we seem to have strayed into the debate on the Industrial Relations Bill which is not yet before us.  In that regard I would like to correct the position.  Might I first of all join with the other Senators in complimenting the staff in connection with the telephones?  We all have the experience of dealing with them and receiving every courtesy at all times even when some of us might be a little impatient trying to get calls through quickly.  We have always found them most courteous in dealing with the public.  In regard to the industrial relations part, and the industrial consultant, it might be no harm to make the point that the telephone section is part of the Post Office organisation as a whole, and the Post Office is organised by a trade union which represents about 80 per cent of the people employed and it is traditionally a well-organised and efficiently-operated trade union.  It is, I believe, the viewpoint of that union and of other unions in the public sector that they would prefer to continue the present scheme of conciliation and arbitration which exists between the respective Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I did not know that I was defending the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I was making the point that the unions concerned representing the workers employed have <Col N="600" /> decided on their own volition that they prefer to abide by the present machinery, and what is proposed by the Minister for Labour is not simply putting them in the same position as other unions in relation to the Labour Court but providing that the chairman will, instead of as at the moment being agreed between the associations and unions concerned and the Minister, be appointed by the Labour Court.  There would be in fact a link in that way between the existing conciliation and arbitration machinery and the Labour Court.  I do not want to enter into an argument as to which is the more desirable or better.  This is not material for this particular Bill, but I am saying that the suggestion that the Labour Court shall be put in place of the existing scheme of conciliation and arbitration is not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill but I would like to see the people of rural Ireland getting better value for the reasonably large amount of money which it is proposed to spend in this service.  I should like to know whether the Minister and the Department look on the telephone service primarily as a service that must pay for itself or whether there is any element of social service in it.</P>
      <P>Whatever the answer might be, we should have more kiosks in rural Ireland and especially in these places where a 24-hour exchange service is available.  It is unfair to the poorer sections of the community who, if they wish to make a telephone call, be it for a doctor or a vet or any other person, must inconvenience one of their neighbours and must be under some compliment to one of their neighbours in order to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The erection of these kiosks should not prove too costly.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to have a kiosk erected at least in every village, especially where there is a 24-hour exchange service.  On our major roads, too, I should like to see more kiosks.  There is an Automobile Association kiosk at distances of approximately 30 miles on our arterial roads and this provides a limited service for members of the AA but, unlike Northern Ireland or Great Britain where one finds kiosks at so many crossroads, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs here have done nothing in this respect.  This should be corrected now, especially since a reasonable amount of money is being made available to the Department. Even if the Department were to erect a kiosk convenient to each repeater station on the main trunk lines, the <Col N="602" /> maintenance of which should not present any great problem, it would be of great help to those in the rural community and to road users in general.</P>
    <P>I also find that there is great concern among the farming community, especially at creameries where large numbers of farmers congregate.  In places like these, there is great need for telephone kiosks.  Time and again the Department say there is no public demand for a telephone service at any particular place but I ask the Minister how he knows there is no demand if there is no way of proving that the demand is not there.  Surely it should be possible for an organisation with a monopoly in a service and, might I add, not a cheap service to the consumer, to make every effort to facilitate the public and particularly those in our community who cannot afford to pay the rather high costs of installation and rental charges for telephones in their own homes.  I welcome this Bill and I hope that the Minister will be able to spend a little more money for this service in rural areas than he has done heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points which I should like to mention in connection with this Bill. Reference has been made here by previous speakers to the delay and the long waiting list for telephone installations. This, in itself, is serious enough but there is also the situation whereby, after waiting perhaps many years for a telephone, the applicant is visited by an inspector and subsequently informed that, in order to have the telephone installed, he is required to pay about five years rent in advance&mdash;a sum of, perhaps, £80 or £90.  I know of two such cases in my own area and both of the people concerned reside within two miles of an exchange and the telephone lines pass their houses.  In one of these cases a householder who had had the telephone for many years decided to dispense with it and a neighbour, who lives a couple of hundred yards away, applied to have it installed. Now, having waited several months he has been informed that he will get the telephone on the condition that he pays five years rent in advance.  This he has <Col N="603" /> done but up to last Sunday week he had not got the telephone although the Post Office have received the cheque. I ask the Minister to look into this matter because this is a form of blackmail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the many Senators who paid tribute to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for their courtesy and who, in general terms, welcomed this Bill.  Senator Garret FitzGerald asked why we provided for a five-year programme.  This is done in a number of telephone administrations because in relation to designing new automatic exchanges the period required for delivery can vary from 18 months to two years and even with the most reputable manufacturers of exchanges, there can be delay of up to five years so, therefore, it is advisable to plan over a five-year period. This applies to the major schemes and it does not apply, for example, to the putting up of some open wire cable between two small areas.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald also raised the question of the finances of the telegraph service and the Post Office service. It is true that the service operates on a method of financial analysis but, on the other hand, each year in order to examine the economic viability of the telegraph and telephone service, we prepare commercial accounts to indicate the profit and loss in connection with these services and from that we can carry out the general policy which is that over a period of years, taking one year with another, the whole service should balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That system will have to continue until there is some general change in the organisation of the Department.  As I indicated in the Dáil, the question of a possible change in the organisation of the Department has been under examination. It is an immensely complicated business and anybody who will read of <Col N="604" /> the steps taken in Great Britain will see that great difficulties have been experienced there in connection with the decision to make the entire service a State corporation.  Therefore, we must examine this question at length.  Senator FitzGerald and others spoke also of the waiting list.  I suppose it is rather a feeble excuse to say that there is a waiting list for telephones in almost every country, even those with a very advanced telephone system such as Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if there is a waiting list in the United States of America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is in some parts but in other parts there is not. It would be very uneconomic to join every single potential customer for the telephone service to the network individually. We are now arranging for a clearance of the waiting subscriber applications by districts on a fairly regular basis.  There are some parts of the country where a telephone can be had virtually on demand.  It depends on the advance that has been made in providing sufficient outlets from the local exchange.  That is continuing.</P>
      <P>It is rather hard to give an average figure.  Senator FitzGerald knows averages are extremely dangerous in many cases.  They have to be broken down.  I would say that the average time taken to connect subscribers at the moment is about three months.  I wish it could be less but with the tremendous pressure put on us to improve the quality of the exchange service and to develop cables, trunks, the open wire system and automatic exchanges this is the best we can do.  We have reduced the number of waiting applications in relation to the total number for which service is provided each year.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that all pre-1968 applications in the remote rural areas will be given service this year.  At the moment there are 8,746 applications and of these nearly 3,000 are in course of installation.  A further 1,751 are being processed.  That means there are roughly between 5,000 and 6,000 waiting applications and that is a lower figure than it was at a previous period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course part of the reason for the delay in supplying telephones is the explosion in telephone development that has taken place in the 1960s.  There was a period when capital for the telephone service was restricted both here and in Great Britain.  In the light of events that have taken place since, this may or may not have been advisable.  In this country there is always competition for the <Col N="606" /> available capital for all the services&mdash; social services, housing, sewerage and water schemes, the telegraph service and rural electrification&mdash;and it would be very dishonest for me to promise that in the next five years I would always be able to get the full sum required for the maximum telephone development. This would depend on industrial development proceeding at a very satisfactory pace and it would also depend to some extent on how far we could avoid inflation, not only inflation within our country but inflation without it which increases the cost of equipment.</P>
      <P>Some Senators raised the question of the length of time taken and why we had not provided a certain type of subscriber trunk dialling system direct to Great Britain.  There again the telephone service in Great Britain has been under great pressure and we are cooperating successfully with them.  The time schedules of all these operations depend on joint consultation between ourselves and Britain.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald asked a question about the type of coins we hope to use in the coin boxes when decimal currency arrives.  I am afraid I cannot answer that question.  The Senator will appreciate that you can adjust the cost of telephoning under the decimal currency system by the coins used and the time you can take on the telephone.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that we will not be allowed to inflate costs artificially in the telephone service because of the change-over.  We have not made a final decision yet.  It is being examined very closely at present as to the coins that will be used and the relation of one coin to another and to the various apertures in the coin boxes.  It is highly technical and it would be impossible for me to go into that now.  I can assure the Senator that for us to inflate the cost of telephoning due to the change-over to decimal currency would not be advisable from the point of view of revenue for the telephone service and it is not the wish of the Government that the telephone service should set any example to the rest of the community in the direction of an inflationary trend.</P>

      <P>There is a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  In fact they have been determined in this way and very substantial improvements in pay have been awarded to the staff, and improvements in working hours, holidays and so on.  I hope that Members of the Seanad have received the statement I sent in regard to the financial position of the Post Office generally.  There is a graph showing the rate of increase in wages in telephone and postal services.  These improvements were well deserved because there was a period when in comparison with other sections of the community they were underpaid.  Telephone charges had not increased at as fast a rate as the consumer price index.  I am glad that worked out very satisfactorily.

      <P>Not so far as I know.  I was glad Senator Quinlan paid tribute to the telephone service.  I admit that faults are still excessive on the Dublin-Cork line but they are better than they were two or three years ago.  I hope that the service between Cork and Dublin will improve still <Col N="608" /> further.  Professor Quinlan should know that we have been in touch with universities with regard to attracting engineers to our service and that as a result of that and of other measures taken we have an increase of 18 in the number of our engineers since 1st January, 1968.  Our total number serving on the 1st January, 1969 was 161.  We have provided two scholarship schemes and a third scholarship scheme is being introduced this year.  There is no need to give details of this but it shows that we are trying to have close relationship with the universities, particularly attracting them by the right type of public relations to join the telephone service, and offering various facilities and better rewards at the beginning of their service.  Four scholarship holders are attending UCC.</P>

      <P>Professor Quinlan raised a question too big for me to deal with in regard to a computer electrical general centre.  I would say that the Department of Finance are interested in co-ordinating all use of computers in the public sector.  We are examining the question of introducing computers into the workings of the Department but we have not made any final decision in regard to it.  It would be for the Department of Finance to co-ordinate this whole matter.  I myself could not do it as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McQuillan raised verious matters in relation to industrial relations. I would say that the commercial accounts reveal a surplus in telephone operation of 7 per cent after paying interest and principal on loans.  It is a genuine return on capital.  Telephone charges have been mentioned by me already and have risen less than the general cost of living index up to a recent period.  Selling the telephone service depends on raising sufficient capital.  It would not be possible for us to advertise the telephone service at present because we have to develop the system.  We have not reached the positiona <Col N="609" /> tion of advertising the telephone service and there are many other countries in the same position.  I should mention that trunk call fees were not increased in 1969 in order to attract more custom in this direction.  There is no alternative method of raising capital under the present conditions of inflation.  It would be more satisfactory than the method by which capital is provided by the State. If there was less inflation it might be possible.  I cannot see it happening at the moment.  Even if the service was a State company or a private firm or whatever it was I think the company concerned would hire a firm of specialists for the telephone classified directory which is a very special kind of activity.</P>
    <P>I want to say in relation to staff relations within the Post Office that the Parliamentary Secretary is immediately in charge of these matters.  We discuss every problem together.  We have a new Staff Relations Section within the Post Office.  We are doing everything in our power to make the C and A system work as efficiently as possible and to the satisfaction of the staff concerned. We have been examining the grievance procedure to see, in the light of changes which have taken place in industrial relations generally, whether they require amending.  We have provided social welfare officers.  We have used personnel management courses wherever they are required by different types of staff.  We have made every effort to ensure that the C and A system relates to the modern world and modern concepts in regard to the way workers should be treated and their grievances examined.  We will continue to make progress in this.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuillan spoke about the electricity system in particular exchanges.  The system broke down and was repaired. So far as I am aware, heating is provided in all exchanges throughout the country.  If it was not provided, then this matter can be raised under the grievances procedure. I have no recollection of complaints of lack of heating at telephone exchanges with the exception of the breakdown that took place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of exchanges where the staff are crowded are being replaced as rapidly as possible.  Every effort is being made to improve staff working conditions.  They are by no means completely satisfactory but there is a marked improvement in the last five years.  He referred to the temporary telephone officers in the Post Office. This is purely temporary, seasonal employment. Having noticed the way these particular temporary officers did not come into their work, it was felt wise to be absolutely frank in their conditions of employment and the people themselves did not object to this.  We have to examine continuously the need for operators of various kinds. We have advertised for telephonists and permanent night male telephonists. That policy is being continued and there is no suggestion of some extraordinary plot to deprive people of permanent work in the telephone service.</P>
      <P>Senator McQuillan referred to the waiting time for trunk calls having been rather long in certain periods of last year.  It was long, due partly to the increase in cross-Channel calls in particular, which was greater than was expected even allowing for the increase of tourists travelling by motor car or otherwise, which took place in July, August and September.  We had a further difficulty because we had one of the eleven good summers since 1880 and people tended to crowd their calling into the six to ten p.m. period.  I do not think I could design a service to provide operators on the assumption that we were going to have such splendid summers.  We had only eleven of them since 1880.  I could not always be prepared for an unprecedented calling rate even between 10 p.m. and midnight in rural areas from tourists who are out in the sun all day when we did not have the little showers we are accustomed to in our weather in the ordinary course.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy answered the questions by Senator McQuillan in regard to me.  I am not allowed to get into this debate.  So far as I know, whatever great differences we may have in social and economic policy from either the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party, I do not believe the Labour Party approve of the fragmentation of worker representation. Moreover, I recall the late John Conroy about two years ago saying that he saw the inevitable development at some stage, however difficult the course might be, of industrial unions. Further to that, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;publicly disapproved of the fragmentation of the postal and telephone system of arbitration and conciliation.  There is a public service committee within the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to which the members of unions could make appeals and discuss problems if they choose to do so.  Senator Murphy has explained that there is no difference of opinion between me and the Minister for Labour.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour was trying to co-ordinate the use of the Labour Court for the general system of conciliation and arbitration.  He was not suggesting that if post office workers were discontented with that system of conciliation and arbitration they could say: &ldquo;We will not go through conciliation and arbitration. We will go straight to the conciliation officers and to the Labour <Col N="612" /> Court itself&rdquo;.  Senator Murphy was perfectly correct in saying that the Minister for Labour was saying that they would have two separate courses to adopt in discussing wages and salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, Senator McDonald asked me a question on the social service aspect of the telephone service.  The position is that the profit accruing from the denser areas subsidises a very considerable proportion of the rural telephone network operation. Far more profit is made from people who are constantly using the telephone in Dublin than from the person who may make one or two calls on business or social matters each day in some remote part of the country.  That is how the element of social service operates.</P>
      <P>We are increasing the number of kiosks.  Most population centres of 200 or more have one now, and the numbers are growing steadily in areas where we have no kiosks.  I have found since I was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for a second time, that there is not any area where a telephone of one kind or another is not available for emergencies.  Kiosks must pay their way and for that there must be certain minimum requirements.  In areas where a local authority consider there should be a kiosk they can enter into an arrangement with the Department to subsidise the kiosks and if the kiosks actually begin to pay then the rate of subsidy each year would be very small.  I think one local authority are taking advantage of this arrangement but I should say that we, in accordance with our general custom, are examining the whole kiosk position to see whether we should develop kiosks at a faster rate, whether we can afford to do so or not, and at the same time keep down the cost of telephones generally.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether it would be in order to raise a point that has concerned me about the polling districts in cities.  The present arrangement is that where a polling district in the city is of such a size that more than one table is required for voting purposes, the allocation of areas within it to tables is done, I understand, on an alphabetical basis <Col N="615" /> in regard to the names of the streets. This has the disadvantage that you sometimes get quite a big polling district in which the density of population is not very great and sometimes adjoining streets are far apart from each other.  If the streets were organised geographically it would be possible to have people coming from the same geographical area coming to the same table.</P>

      <P>These are amendments which must be taken together because the whole scheme is inter-related regarding this part of the country, East Leinster, and are designed to provide a solution to the problem of keeping within the Constitution by maintaining the county boundaries and in my opinion provide a tidier and neater solution to this problem than the Minister's one.  The scheme proposed by the Minister is one which involves considerable disturbance of county boundaries especially in North Leinster and into the Ulster counties of Monaghan and Cavan.  Indeed it is difficult to see why such a complicated system was devised unless there is, as I previously suggested, some ulterior motive.  A system which involves taking two separate bits of Louth plus a bit of Meath and giving them to Monaghan and giving separate bits to Meath which gets compensated by a bit of Kilkenny added to Meath seems to me a highly complicated round about way of solving what would appear to be a relatively simple problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say in opening the debate and a good deal of his reply to it.  Unfortunately I missed portion of his <Col N="617" /> reply but I have read it carefully since and I have tried to discover the basis of reasoning on which the Minister founds this extraordinary constituency distribution.  His line of argument seems to be as follows: First of all he lays down a series of propositions each of which would appear to be a justification for this particular distribution, but they are principles which are not themselves very well designed to meet every case.  One of the principles is &ldquo;no five-seater constituencies&rdquo;.  The justification for this is not very evident. The Minister has suggested that they are too large and cumbersome and that there has been a trend towards smaller constituencies.  This is perfectly true, but it is not a very satisfactory explanation for something to say &ldquo;We are going on doing what we have been doing before&rdquo; particularly when it is largely the same Government doing this previously.  We want to know the thinking behind this.  There is no doubt a reduction in the size of the constituencies which has gone on since early in the history of this State, and which makes the system less proportional than it would otherwise be. There are arguments for and against this.  The argument against is that it is less fair because it gives the largest Party an extra bonus in seats.  The argument for is that by so introducing this bias, which is not a very big bias, you do slightly enhance the chances of an overall majority which otherwise a country with three Parties might frequently not provide.  I can see the two sides to that argument, but the Minister has not developed it here.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that he has justified the case for no new five-seater constituencies at all.  One can see that there is a trend and a pattern in the Government's actions over decades in reducing the number of large constituencies and eliminating the very large ones.  There was a nine-seat constituency and there were certain seven-seaters and six-seaters, and the Government's policy has been to reduce these on the ground that this is both making the areas smaller and more convenient for the TD who represents it, but it is also making it less proportional.  The argument that the smaller constituencies are more convenient for the TD <Col N="618" /> is one which, not only because I am a Senator, I find unacceptable.  In that I am reinforced by the judgment of the High Court in which Mr. Justice Budd, in a memorable statement which ought to be engraved on the hearts of every Member of the other House and perhaps of this too, made it clear that it is no part of the function of legislators to concern themselves with administrative affairs and to spend their time representing their constituents. This was a ruling in a Constitutional case of very considerable importance, and the whole tenor of the discussion in 1959 and 1961 and when this matter came up again in the recent debate has been that this matter of convenience of the representative, of the TD, is the important thing.  I do not accept this as being the over-riding consideration.  As between two solutions one of which is more convenient than the other one would naturally choose the more convenient, but that this consideration should be the over-riding one is something which stands the democratic system on its head&mdash;that the system has to be designed to suit the legislators and not the legislators to serve the country.</P>
    <P>However, the principle of no new five-seater constituencies is one which introduces great rigidity into the system now proposed, and it seems to me that it is designed so to do.  Even if we were to accept the point of view that there should be smaller constituencies, which I do not accept because I do not accept the reasons for it, it does not seem to me necessary to apply it even if the consequences of the principle being applied on a great many occasions are many more county boundaries having to be crossed and many times the number of people put outside their own counties than would otherwise be necessary.  Even if one accepts the trend towards smaller constituencies there is no ground for accepting that as a rigid principle in all circumstances and totally regardless of the consequences to the electoral body there should, as a matter of principle, be no new five-seater constituencies whatever.</P>
    <P>The second principle is one which has suddenly emerged into the light of day into this discussion and which is in <Col N="619" /> notable opposition to the earlier one that we should not unnecessarily disturb existing counties, that constituencies should not be shifted.  The Minister, who had a great concern for county boundaries in the other debate, is giving them a very low priority now and is terribly concerned to keep existing constituencies as they are.  We have had for example Wexford and Carlow where 4,398 people are transferred from one constituency to the other.  The Minister, far from pressing for their return to their homeland of Wexford about which he was deeply concerned in the debate on the Constitution Amendment Bills, is now concerned that these poor people should not be disrupted again by being sent back to Wexford because they have since the other debate become so comfortable where they are that they do not want to return and it would be very sad to disturb them.  This sudden change needs more explanation.  Is the Minister suggesting that they are so happy where they are that they do not want to be sent home and would even resent being changed again? I rather doubt it. It is quite clear that here again a new principle was invented for the purpose of justifying a particular distribution designed to benefit a particular political Party in the next election.</P>
    <P>The third principle which the Minister introduced and one of even less rationality is that constituencies in Dublin City should be devised on a uniform basis.  It is quite clear what this means.  It transpires that the Dublin constituencies must be divided either into nine three-seaters or into one three-seater with six four-seaters. The uniformity between these two alternatives is not entirely clear.  They are not uniform as between each other. They are different principles, one insisting that the constituencies be the same and the other that they be different.</P>
    <P>I suggested on the Second Stage that there was another multiplication of four three-seaters that would provide a similar result.  However, the Minister in his reply very carefully ignored this and simply reiterated that his principle is to have either nine three-seaters <Col N="620" /> or six four-seaters and a three-seater. This requires more clarification. This is a blatant attempt to gerrymander the Dublin constituencies because, in Dublin, Fianna Fáil, with an optimism for which I can only give them credit, believe that they will procure something like 38 to 42 per cent of the votes.  Most detached observers say the Government might make the 38 to 42 per cent grade in some of the Dublin constituencies.  The dishonesty of the Government approach is evident.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a principle which it is necessary for me to consider in order to put forward this amendment.  This is the principle which was put forward by the Minister at the end of his remarks when he said that it is desirable to minimise county boundary disturbances. The Minister's concept of a minimising disturbance is a very interesting one.  From a mathematical point of view, it is quite extraordinary. I shall read the Minister's hand-onheart declaration which is reported at column 147 of No. 7 of the Seanad Debates, dated March 6, 1969 and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I have not changed my mind about the undesirability of taking parts of one county and putting it into another.  It is objectionable and undesirable...</P>
    <P>and further on at column 148:&mdash;</P>
    <P>County boundaries are being breached in this Bill because the Constitution requires it to be done and for no other reason.</P>
    <P>That is a simple statement saying that there is no alternative and that the Constitution requires this.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I that this is not true.  He knows that the three amendments which I am putting forward, all of which would fulfill the requirements of the Constitution, would, between them, avoid four-fifths of the disturbance of county boundaries which he is proposing.  I shall come now to this interesting concept of minimisation.  Bearing in mind the principles already referred to by the Minister and his desire to have the least possible disturbance in every constituency, the Minister says that when <Col N="621" /> people have to be transferred out of their own county, it is better to transfer a significant number rather than an insignificant one.  The principle of minimisation therefore becomes the principle of maximisation, causing a much greater breaching of county boundaries and involving 100,000 people.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not succeed in convincing me.  My sense of arithmetic is offended by his concept of the principle of minimisation.  The solution which I propose would create one new five-seat constituency replacing another five-seater right beside it.  In fact, one county&mdash;Carlow&mdash;is already in a five-seat constituency and my proposal involves the five-seater being in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Those of you who were here for the debate will recall the Minister's particular concern for Wexford but he now seems to have lost this concern.  My solution is to restore Wexford so that it is one county constituting a constituency with no disturbance.  I proposed that Carlow/Kildare be made a single constituency just as Carlow/Kilkenny now is, but the Minister has a vital opposition to this.  He tells us that it would be too straggling a constituency, not &ldquo;straggly&rdquo; but &ldquo;straggling&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;straggling&rdquo; is an interesting one.  It is a word that occurred in connection with one of the constituencies devised by the Minister, that of East Mayo.  It bears such a striking resemblance to one of the Derry City constituencies that one could call it gerrymandering. It bears a striking resemblance to one of the Derry City constituencies in shape.  No doubt it was designed for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Straggling is perhaps a neutral adjective to apply to it.  There are many others which straggle all over the map in a most extraordinary way.  There is one that goes from the middle of Leitrim through South-West Donegal with a long strip over almost to County Londonderry, as it is described on the map.  I should say that the maps I am using&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Allow me to complete what I am saying&mdash;to County <Col N="622" /> Londonderry, as it is described on the map.  I should like to explain that I purchased this map from the Ordnance Survey and Derry is described as Londonderry, Laois is described as Queen's County and Offaly is described as King's County. This is an interesting example of the Government's sense of economy because these maps were printed originally about 1910 or 1915.  There is no date on them.  Apparently they must have printed more than they needed at the time and they are continuing to sell them with a total disregard for any of the little changes in geographical nomenclature we have adopted in the short history of the State&mdash;only 50 years.</P>
      <P>When I said it was described as Londonderry I knew the Minister would jump on me immediately.  He considers I am some kind of true blue Tory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only quoting from the map which the Minister's Government sold to me.  It is he who sold it, not I.  I should say, because the Minister is so sensitive on this point, that in legislation which his Government introduced into the Dáil dealing with such places as Derry it was always described as Londonderry. In the Northern Ireland Act, 1958, introduced by Fianna Fáil, the Schedule refers to Derry as Londonderry. This is his word, not mine. I am more used to saying Derry.</P>
      <P>However, as we are not actually gerrymandering Derry but other parts of this island at the moment, I will not pursue that line any further.  The objection to Carlow/Kildare is that it is a straggling constituency.  It straggles for something like 66 miles as the crow flies.  The Minister's constituency of South-West Cork straggles for 66 miles, his South-West Donegal for 64 miles, his Sligo/Leitrim for 63 miles, his West Galway for 64 miles, his West Mayo for 64 miles, and his Cavan for only 58 miles, and East Mayo for 56 miles as the crow flies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to contradict me about mileage which in fact I had not measured very accurately.  He told me <Col N="623" /> that some constituencies from one end to the other were more than 100 miles. His crow does not fly the same way as mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to calculate mileage from one end of the county to the other by road, then let him do the same for both counties and let him say how far it is by road from the middle of Leitrim to the top of Donegal because that is his constituency.  I bet if you tried to do that by road you would not do it in much less than 120 miles.  So with comparable figures the fact remains that the constituency I propose for Carlow/ Kildare is no more straggling than the Minister's proposals for other counties. Those are the only grounds he gives. It would be too straggling and it would be a new five-seater.  Half of it would be new because the other half is in a five-seater already.  For these two vitally important reasons we must chop up the electoral map.</P>
      <P>Under my proposals, Wexford is reintegrated in the boundary which the Minister was so concerned with in the other debate.  Kildare becomes a three-seater. Carlow/Kildare becomes a straggling five-seater which is offensive to the Minister's sense of proportion. Cavan/Monaghan becomes a five-seater but the Minister said it is too big, not straggling but too big.  I have not get the mileages with me but when you measure it you find that Cavan/Monaghan in its length and breadth is similar to a large number of other constituencies the Minister has worked out and put before us.  It is no bigger in its length and breadth than some of the constituencies put forward by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only boundary crossing required <Col N="624" /> in the whole of Leinster in order to fulfil the requirements of the Constitution is that one piece of Meath be allocated to Louth or of Louth to Meath.  In order to minimise disturbance it is proposed that a small part of Meath, 6,644 people, be transferred to Louth making Louth a four-seater. You could do it the other way around and it involves transferring another few thousand people.  If the Labour Party wish to have it the other way around I will happily vote for their amendment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned only to show here, as Deputy Hogan showed in the Dáil, how this could be redistributed in such a way that only one county boundary in the whole of Leinster and south Ulster is crossed, and only 6,000 or 7,000 people disturbed.  The Minister knows as well as me that this is right and can be done.  He has invented faked reasons for not doing it: the straggling shape of Carlow/Kildare, the size of Cavan/Monaghan, and the principle of no new five-seaters.  These are the only grounds put forward for not adopting the simple, straightforward and obvious division of this area of Leinster and south Ulster, almost half the country in all, which could be dealt with as a single boundary crossing in Louth and Meath.  These are the only reasons he gives for not doing it.</P>
    <P>Instead he proposes that the present situation between Wexford and Carlow/Kilkenny should be maintained and that the 4,398 people, over whom he wept crocodile tears in the other debate, should now remain where they are, apparently, so comfortable in Carlow/Kilkenny that they cannot be banished back to their native county of Wexford for which they have apparently lost all loyalty since the last debate.  He proposes that a chunk of north Kildare be transferred to Meath, a transfer of 5,041 people.  On the one hand he gives to Meath a piece of Kildare and he takes it away with the other.  He takes away first of all one chunk of 3,829 people in Cavan but that is not enough.  He takes away another 1,827 people and still that is not sufficient punishment for having received 5,041 people.  He then <Col N="625" /> takes 3,956 people from another part of Meath and gives them to Monaghan. Meath has to either gain or lose in this distribution.  The fact that that has to be done is no excuse for taking three bits off it and giving them to Cavan and Monaghan and adding another bit on to it at the bottom involving a total disturbance of 12,500 people, twice as many as need to be disturbed and in four areas rather than in one.</P>
    <P>Monaghan receives from Louth two further chunks.  As well as 3,950 from Meath is gets 5,761 from one bit of Louth and 1,837 from another so that all the frontier changes involved between Meath and Louth on the one hand and Cavan and Monaghan on the other involve a total disturbance of about 17,000 people, all of it totally unnecessary.  In all there are seven pieces of territory transferred in the proposal, almost 27,000 people are banished outside their counties to support the vital principle that we should not have a straggling constituency like Carlow/Kildare, no five-seaters and not having a constituency as big as Cavan/Monaghan.</P>

Perhaps he has more valid reasons which he wanted to spring on us.  Perhaps I have walked into a trap. Perhaps reasons so compelling as to leave me glued to my seat will emerge from his lips and with that hope in mind I will sit down.</P>

      <P>In giving figures of population disrupted by these series of amendments, Senator FitzGerald ignores the fact that they involve the disruption of constituencies involving the total population of Counties Carlow and Monaghan.  Kildare and Cavan could also be included in that.  Senator FitzGerald's solution involves something he may consider of no importance but which I and the Government happen to consider is of importance. This is a question of opinion.  It involves the disappearance of three existing constituencies&mdash;Cavan, Monaghan and Kildare.  It involves another thing we consider objectionable but which Senator FitzGerald does not; it is a question of opinion.  It involves the creation of two new unwieldy straggling two-county, five-seater constituencies&mdash; Cavan/Monaghan and Carlow/Kildare. If it was Senator FitzGerald's function to do it he would see no objection to the creation of these two constituencies. We think that would be undesirable. The Bill before the House proposes the retention of all the existing constituencies in this area.  Only those that require to be disturbed in order to comply with the terms of the Constitution are, in fact, being disturbed.  The existing constituencies that comply with the Constitution are being left undisturbed&mdash;Wexford and Carlow/Kilkenny. We are retaining a constituency of Cavan, a constituency of Monaghan, of Louth, of Meath and a constituency of Kildare.  The adjustments that are necessary in order to comply with the Constitution in these constituencies are being made.  It is purely a question of approach.  What is proposed in the Bill involves the least combined disturbance of population and of the existing pattern of representation in the area.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald apparently sees something inconsistent in the fact that on the Second Stage of this Bill I reiterated my belief in the undesirability, as a general principle, of breaching county boundaries, of taking people from one county and requiring them to vote in another county.  My opinion on this matter has never changed and is still the same, and if necessary I will repeat it here for the benefit of Senators.  I consider it undesirable and it is not required by any democratic principle; it is merely required by the words that happen to have been used in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The proposal in the Bill is that there will be three-seat constituencies in Cavan, in Monaghan, in Louth, in Meath and in Kildare.  I think it would be much preferable if all these constituencies consisted of these counties only.  I cannot see there would be any breach of democratic principle by having three Cavan Deputies elected only by the people of Cavan, three Monaghan Deputies elected by the people of Monaghan, and so on, but because the Constitution requires this giving and taking from one county to another this has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator FitzGerald disclosed the whole difference in approach between the Government's solution and his solution when he discussed this on the basis of mathematics.  Apparently Senator FitzGerald considers this is simply a matter of mathematics and if you can show that the total percentage of people voting outside their own <Col N="630" /> county is small this is a matter of no importance according to the Senator. There is no appreciation of the fact that it is individual people who are concerned. We believe it is undesirable that people should be required to vote outside their own county, but when this has to be done then it is better that the people who are so disrupted from their own county should be of such number as to form a significant factor in the new constituency.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to go into this in great detail.  It is purely a matter of opinion.  We believe our solution, which retains all the existing constituencies in so far as it is possible to do so and which disrupts only those which are a breach of the Constitution, is the best one.  We believe that the two new suggested five-seat constituencies of Cavan/Monaghan and Carlow/Kildare are undesirable and while our solution retains the five-seat constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny it is not of such an objectionable nature as Carlow/Kildare.  There is only a small border between Carlow and Kildare and little communication between them whereas there is a substantial border between Carlow and Kilkenny and most parts of Carlow are within a reasonable distance of Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>This I consider a more desirable type of constituency than that of Carlow/ Kildare and it has the added advantage that during the years people have been accustomed to voting in the constituency of Carlow/Kilkenny.  I am satisfied that the solution proposed is a much more reasonable one and involves a much smaller total disruption, both of people from their own counties and of the existing pattern of representation.</P>

      <P>I listened with attention and interest to the Minister's reply to what I had to say on this amendment, and it seems to me that he places very great stress and importance on retaining existing constituencies. <Col N="631" /> This was the main theme of his address. He made other points about the size of the constituencies, but the main burden of his remarks was about the importance of retaining the existing constituencies.</P>
      <P>I find this interesting because while my memory can be at fault at times I have a quite clear memory of the recent referendum campaign both in the Dáil and the Seanad and in the country, and my recollection is that it was fought on the slogan as far as this area of argument goes of retaining our constituencies. Under our present distribution counties are chopped up in various ways, and there are six or seven cases where the county boundaries are crossed, but the great claim in that campaign was that if the electorate accepted the amendments to the Constitution it would be possible to restore the county boundaries in their integrity and avoid any breaching, or almost any breaching, of the boundaries.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a slight qualification that there might be some circumstances where one-sixth might make it possible in particular cases, but that in almost every case it would be possible to preserve the county boundaries and that the variation in our present population distribution would not involve changing the existing constituencies. The bit of Wexford, for instance, could be put back into Wexford and similar other changes could be made in the country where perhaps counties are at present in part allocated to other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's case in the referendum was &ldquo;let us not change the existing constituencies, which have the unhappy characteristic that in seven instances they have crossed county boundaries; let us preserve the county boundaries which King John and God have handed down to our people.  We are greatly attached to them and we must get back to them.&rdquo;  He made quite a good case though it did not seem to me that our democratic system should be turned upside down for the sake of it.  We could possibly have agreed that they should be preserved, and I in fact put forward a scheme of distribution under the existing system which <Col N="632" /> was not, indeed, as good as the scheme now put forward, which is the product of Deputy Hogan, designed to minimise the disturbance of the county boundaries.  This was the Minister's great concern&mdash;to keep the county boundaries and to get away from the present constituencies which cut across them.</P>
    <P>This evening, however, as I indicated I thought he would in my opening remarks, he has adopted a very different line.  We must preserve the existing constituencies even where they cross county boundaries.  These 4,398 people in Wexford, we were told, were deplorably cut off from their homeland under the present system and the Minister promised to restore them to their homeland after the referendum went through.  But now we are in the position where there is every opportunity to restore them but the Minister says &ldquo;No, they must stay where they are in the present constituency. What matters is to preserve the present constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would not require an opponent politically to detect certain inconsistencies in this approach.  Let us indeed accept the Minister's contention that for some reason unknown to us the vitally important thing now is to keep the constituencies in the counties but I would still like to be clear what he means by keeping to the counties.  In one instance, in the case of Monaghan, it means having a constituency called Monaghan but adding to it a number of people equal to almost half the population of Monaghan from two other nearby counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers that to be keeping the constituency.  I want to be quite clear that this is what he intends even though up to one-third of the total population comes from outside the county, that this does not involve this idea of keeping to the county boundaries. I take it that I am interpreting the Minister correctly and that this means that he feels that he is keeping Monaghan although it includes 11,500 people from Louth and Meath.  Keeping to the county does not mean keeping to the exact boundary but that it must be contained within the boundary subject to an adjustment of up to <Col N="633" /> one-third.  That seems to be the Minister's view as I interpret it.</P>
    <P>This is an interesting viewpoint, and I wonder whether we could make some progress on this basis.  I would be more than willing to accommodate the Minister, and I think we should try to meet him on it.  If the Minister glances at the next amendment before us&mdash;I do not want to dilate on it at this stage since we will be discussing it later, but I would point out to the Minister that he has chopped up Connacht, taking 40 per cent or 45 per cent from Clare and adding it into a large chunk of East Galway and calling it the new constituency of Clare/Galway, and he divides East Galway to make a new constituency of North-East Galway.</P>

      <P>It is true, as Senator FitzGerald says, that one of the two proposals at the referendum was on the subject of keeping the county boundaries intact.  What we were asking the people to do was to give us some small amount of scope in regard to the population per Deputy for the purpose of adhering to the administrative boundaries. It is a fact that we put this case as strongly as we could in this House, in the other House and to the people <Col N="634" /> of the country.  It is also a fact, and one to which the Senator did not refer, that the people rejected this and that the people decided not to give us any scope whatever, though we were only asking for a smaller amount of scope than is available in any known democracy. However, the people decided that this would not be available and the result of this decision is that county boundaries may not be adhered to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it compulsory to break them now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is compulsory to disregard them in case where the population per Deputy in adjoining counties is not closely related to the national average of population per Deputy.  Therefore, the approach to this matter could not be to adhere to county boundaries.  It would have been possible to approach this question in the manner in which Senator FitzGerald has approached it, but we think that the overall solution put forward by Senator FitzGerald is a more undesirable one than the one that is being put forward in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not, for one moment, suggest that the arrangements of constituencies put forward in the Bill are desirable from any point of view but I say that it is the least objectionable solution that has emerged so far and that Senator FitzGerald's solution either for this part of the country or for any other part is much more objectionable and would give a much less effective pattern of representation for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the result of the referenda was that it was not possible to adhere to county boundaries in this particular area that we are now discussing.  It was not possible to retain a Cavan constituency containing the county of Cavan only.  It was not permissible to do that with regard to Counties Monaghan, Louth, Meath or Kildare but, on the other hand, it was possible to retain the existing constituencies of Wexford and of Carlow/Kilkenny.  I am convinced that the solution we decided on is the least objectionable one.  It would have been possible for us to have eliminated certain constituencies that have existed since the foundation of the <Col N="635" /> State and created these two new five-seat, long, straggling constituencies about which Senator FitzGerald is so enamoured.</P>
    <P>We could have done this for the sole purpose of putting a comparatively small number of the Wexford constituency people back into their own county probably only temporarily.  The retention of the existing constituencies of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath and Kildare involved additions from other counties to Cavan and Monaghan.  These additions could only have come from the places from which they have come and they, in turn, involve the transfer of the excess population from Kildare to Meath.  That is all that has been done in so far as this is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the proposals in the Bill for this area involve also a small deviation from the national average of population per Deputy which is 20,028.  In the constituencies in the Bill, the population per Deputy is 19,485 in Monaghan which is 543 less than the national average; 20,642 in Louth which is 614 in excess of the national average.  The extent of the deviation would in fact have been less only for the fact that in the Dáil I accepted certain amendments from Deputies Sweetman and Farrelly which distorted the deviation from the national average to some extent.</P>
    <P>Under the amendments put forward here, the range would be from 19,041 in Louth which is 987 fewer than the national average and, in fact, is very near to the maximum deviation that appears to be permissible under the decision of the High Court.  In Wexford it would be 20,859 which is 831 in excess of the national average of population per Deputy so that another aspect of this solution is that it involves practically the maximum range of population per Deputy in the different constituencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the western area, on which Senator FitzGerald based so much of his case, I think it would be better if we deal with that area when we come to it.  I do not see any point in raising that particular smokescreen now.  In regard to the east of Ireland, <Col N="636" /> I will say that the solution put forward by Senator FitzGerald is a possible one but, in my opinion, it is much more objectionable than the solution which we propose and it involves a much greater departure from the existing situation.  Another undesirable aspect of it is the creation of these two unnatural five-seat constituencies of Carlow/Kildare and Cavan/Monaghan, neither of which has ever existed before.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald conveyed the impression that there was previously a constituency of Carlow/Kildare but, of course, that is not so.  On the other hand, the constituency of Carlow/ Kilkenny has been in existence since the foundation of the State, with the exception of a short period from 1935 to 1947.  I am quite satisfied that the proposals in the Bill, while they are not proposals that we like, are the best that have been put forward so far and that they are the best that can be done under the Constitutional provisions.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is much point in spending any more time on this because the Minister clearly is not going to bring the debate any further.  The Minister is riding two horses simultaneously and I do not think it is necessary to emphasise the hypocrisy of his approach.</P>
      <P>We are now in a position where the Minister in the referendum debate was concerned with the keeping of county boundaries; at least, this was the concern shown by him during the campaign.  I hope Senators will hold on and not go at this stage.  Listen to the third stage of the saga, when the Minister will say that in the West constituencies are of no importance and that the important thing is to have three-seat constituencies everywhere in the hope that Fianna Fáil will get two out of every three seats.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> The amendments which have been grouped together, are concerned essentially with the alternative disposition of constituencies in Connacht and neighbouring counties.  Once again there is a clear conflict between the proposals of the Minister as they stand in the Schedule and the proposals contained in the amendments which are now put forward.  At this stage of the debate, when we have had discussion on the Second Stage as well as a comprehensive debate on the disposition of seats in Leinster, the differences between the Minister's viewpoint and the viewpoint of those of us on the Opposition Benches have become clear.  It is, therefore, only necessary to underline, as it were, what our differences are in regard to the disposition of seats and constituencies in the western part of the country.  The Minister has admitted repeatedly and without equivocation that the proposals which have been made from these benches would result in less disturbance of people from one county to another than his proposals.</P>
    <P>It would be hard for the Minister to deny this, because while there might be argument in regard to what the exact figure was in the units place or the tens place, one would only have to look at the figures involved in hundreds, and sometimes in thousands, to see that there was a very distinct difference. Nearly all the cases with which we are concerned here, and the proposals made by the Minister, indicate five or six times as many people being moved from one county to vote in another county as those involved in the proposals which we put forward, and the Minister has not denied this.  He has made a positive virtue of the fact that very large numbers have been transferred in this way.  The issue is not therefore essentially one with regard to details of figures: the issue is one in regard to what should be the principle on which we should set about the job of reconstructing the constituency pattern of the country.</P>
    <P>When replying to the Second Stage of this debate the Minister was kind enough to quote the words I used in this House last year with regard to the fact that county boundaries are not <Col N="640" /> sacrosanct.  The Minister has told us that he has not changed his views on this point.  Neither have I changed my views.  My argument on amendment No. 3, and the amendments connected with it, are not derived from any preconception about the sanctity of county boundaries, but merely from the point of view that the disposition of seats in the West of Ireland included in these amendments is, in my opinion, one which will do a better job to facilitate the representation of the people than the disposition which the Minister is proposing here in this Schedule.  There is no doubt in my mind that counties as we know them today are not natural communities, but I think there is an onus on anyone who, in drawing up a constituency scheme, moves away from this out-dated pattern of what was once a pattern of real communities, to show that in moving away from this pattern he has moved to a system which is more akin to natural communities as we know them today than it was under the system which we have had heretofore.</P>
    <P>I would be quite prepared to examine the principle which the Minister has put forward.  I did examine the proposals which the Minister put forward on the basis that in certain instances these transfers of population might be transfers in the direction of more natural community groupings, but, I am afraid, one finds only too often that clearly these movements reflect political rather than demographic considerations.  If the Minister's new dispositions and distribution were something which showed a real understanding of the new communities and the new links that have grown up in this country this indeed would be worthy of attention.  In fact, if we examine them we find that the dispositions are distinctly worse.</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced a number of arguments in favour of his dispositions. He has produced as a principle that we should not disturb the existing constituencies.  He has introduced the principle that when we transfer any section of population into a neighbouring county we must transfer a very large number.  The Minister has introduced the principle that we must at all costs get rid of five-seat constituencies. <Col N="641" /> These principles, the basis on which the Minister has rationalised the proposals he makes to us, are ones which I do not think he has substantiated in argument here.  Let us look at them in turn.  Let us look at the first principle, that we should hold to the existing pattern of constituencies, that once we have made a change, once we have breached a county boundary, once we have decided that to keep within the constituency we must transfer a certain group out of the county into a neighbouring county, this can never be undone. In this way lies madness.  In this way lies a complete crazy patchwork quilt in regard to the constituencies in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced this Bill because he says it must be done, that we must constitutionally have a revision immediately following the census of population.  This means that in fact the Minister is saying that today and from now on we must have a revision of constituencies every five years.  If we are to call every five years on the principle of the sanctity of the existing constituencies we are going to find that not only will we reach the position very soon that there will not be a single county in Ireland whose boundaries are not breached, but there will not be a single county not breached on all four sides.  I think that the Minister is either misdirecting himself here or is grasping at a rationalisation which is a weak crutch.</P>
    <P>There is every reason, once we come to revise the constituencies, to look, at least at the first time of division, at the natural administrative units and to start from that point, not to start from the constituencies units which the exigencies of the last census forced upon us.  The instance has already been taken of the position in regard to County Wexford.  If it was wrong and undesirable to take people out of the County Wexford six or seven years ago&mdash;and there will apparently only be five years between revisions in the future&mdash;and surely it is right to put them back now.  Surely we should not start on the basis that what comes out from this Bill and the Bill in five or ten years time is the rigid starting point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> Surely we all admit that we may be forced by the exigencies of the constraints of this problem to do things that we would not like to do, but why must we say every time we make a change, that every time people are transferred, this must be for ever? There would be only one reason why we would do this, why a change must remain for ever, and that would be the reason that one election would be enough to give the people a loyalty to a new constituency above the county loyalties of which so much has been made in recent debates.  I do not think that is the argument that is in the Minister's mind.  Looking at this argument of the Minister that we must always start from the Bill as it left the House on the last occasion and only start from there, and that any constituency, whether a unified county, a split county or a mangled county, that emerged from the last revision of constituencies and that five years later was still constitutionally correct must stay. This is indeed a new constraint on our problems, that we cannot disturb such a situation.  This is not a rational way of approaching a problem.  It is not a realistic way.  It seems rather a way of rationalisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister invokes a certain principle, that if we are to disturb and take people from one area and put them into another then we must transfer a large number of people.  He certainly lives up to this principle, because he transfers people in their tens of thousands from one county to another.  This he does notably in instances such as the Clare-Galway situation which is covered by the particular amendment we are discussing now.  He certainly does this on a large scale, on the ground that if fewer people are moved these people will have a sense of isolation.  He says that we must transfer people in their tens of thousands, always in their thousands, so that we do not leave these people in the position that they can be ignored with impunity by their representatives.  I do not think that it is necessary to deal with groups of ten thousand people before a group is in a position that no Deputy can ignore it with impunity.  I do not think, <Col N="643" /> even if we look at it from the harsh view of pressure politics, that Deputies are inclined to ignore with impunity even small groups within their constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is of course some force in the argument that these people may not be able to elect a Deputy from within their own group, but if we add that we must transfer sufficient people, we must transfer ten thousand of a population, so that people can elect a Deputy from within their own group, then I do not think that we are going to get rid of any sense of isolation. We are in fact going to make these people an isolated group.  They are going to be separated from the county which they have left, and they are also going to feel no sense of kinship with the Deputies other than the one local Deputy the Minister has arranged to be elected from the transferred areas. They will not feel in any sense that the other Deputies in this area to which they have been transferred will have any responsibility for them.  I think again, that the principle on which the Minister is arguing here is a weak one.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister has come forward with the suggestion that we must at all costs avoid five-seat constituencies just as there are arguments for them. What I think is not acceptable is that when we come to do this job of dividing out the constituencies that we will have to do every five years according to what the Minister has told us in regard to the advice of the Attorney General, if we take this question of no five-seaters at all costs again we are putting ourselves into a vice.  We are putting ourselves into a straitjacket which will hamper our attempts to keep a reasonable and a rational form of constituency.</P>
    <P>The principles the Minister has brought forward on this in fact constitute the conflict between the two sides of the House.  It is not a conflict over figures.  It is a conflict over the way to go about this particular job.  The Minister has produced here principles and as he has gone on in the debate he has gone on repeating again and again.  These arguments as he repeats <Col N="644" /> them more and more seem to have less and less rationality about them and more and more of the mark of rationalisation. We feel it our duty to put forward these amendments to oppose what the Minister has proposed here in the Schedule.  We feel that the principle which he has brought forward is not as suitable as what we propose in order to do this job.</P>
    <P>It is a thankless task.  Last year, at least, when we were arguing in this House, as fruitlessly as we are arguing today because of the majority of the Government, against the proposals in the Constitution Amendment Bills, when we heard the Minister produce arguments of rationalisation, we knew that there was an appeal from the decision of this House.  When it became obvious that the Minister could produce no further argument as time went on we knew that indeed there was no case.  We were confident, despite the protestations of the Minister to the contrary, that when we went to the country, when all of us on all sides went to the country to argue the case before the people, the Minister's argument would not be accepted.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in the same position today in regard to the Minister's arguments.  We find ourselves rejecting his arguments in the same way as we rejected them then.  Unfortunately this time there is no appeal from the decision of the majority of this House, but we will at least place it on record here that we believe the principles which the Minister is operating here are bad principles.  The reason we suspect political motivation in regard to what the Minister has done here is that the arguments he has produced are so weak.</P>
    <P>The Minister produced arguments as to why Mayo should be divided the way it is being divided.  He produced rationalisations in regard to the proposed division of Mayo and he ended up with one of his colleagues in one constituency and another of his colleagues in the other.  Perhaps that is a coincidence.  The Minister produced arguments in regard to the Sligo-Leitrim-Donegal area but in the process he cut the throat of a Fine Gael Deputy.  Perhaps a coincidence.  The <Col N="645" /> Minister produced what Senator O'Sullivan referred to as a swastikashaped constituency of mid-Cork and we end up with two sitting Labour Deputies in one constituency.  Perhaps a coincidence.  I am prepared to believe that in regard to matters of this type, when a job like this is being done, lots of things can happen.  I am prepared to believe that we can have one coincidence. I am prepared to believe we can have two coincidences but when we get an absolute coincidence of coincidences and a concatenation of coincidences of coincidences we begin to believe that the job was done on another basis.  The arguments we heard then appear as an attempt to rationalise the result.</P>
    <P>I believe the proposals in amendment No. 3 and the connected amendments would lead to better representation for the people in the West of Ireland.  They would lead to less breaking of links, such as they are, if they were adopted and in fact they would do a better job of setting out a basis for representation of the people.  There is only one thing that gives me heart in regard to all this.  This is not the first time when constituencies were redrawn with political ideas in mind.  It was done in the past and I am glad to say that in many instances in the past it failed.  Since it is quite obvious that the Minister is not prepared to accept these amendments may I just wish him the maximum of rebounds from his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking at the map here it is obvious that the Minister deliberately embarked on a bare-faced gerrymandering exercise and particularly when you examine the Clare-Galway constituency where a large number of the population of Clare was moved into South Galway.  This was done of course as punishment for the fact that in a by-election some years ago Fianna Fáil were defeated when Deputy John Donnellan was elected. Apparently South Galway is to have its teeth drawn and Clare, which is a predominantly Fianna Fáil consituency, is to determine what the representation of South Galway is to be.  It is to be whatever North Clare decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On examining the western part of the map and all the changes that have <Col N="646" /> taken place it is obvious that the Minister set out first of all to prevent a third political Party from gaining ground there.  It was aimed principally at the Labour Party who were gaining so much ground from Fianna Fáil after the Dublin Corporation elections.  Does anyone want to speak to me?</P>

      <P>Apparently not.  I heard a squawk.  A very peculiar line was drawn also in Mayo, obviously to facilitate two Ministers sitting in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet at present.  It was divided in a manner which would ensure that there would be one Minister standing in each constituency instead of both Ministers standing in one constituency.  The same happened, of course, in the Clontarf area and if I may make the remark the Minister ran away from Deputy Burke.  He created a new constituency in the South County where he has declared that he will be a candidate.  It is a three-seat constitutuency although all the other constituencies in Dublin were four-seaters.  He created a three-seat constituency for himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not have been so peevish when he was drawing up this map.  He certainly weakened the position of a number of Opposition Deputies by the manner in which he transferred populations from one area to another.  It would appear that he concentrated particularly on carrying out the switch in the localities where the Opposition Deputies were residing or where they had a strong vote.  If this is not gerrymandering, I should like to know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, he wiped Leitrim off the map except in so far as using the name of Leitrim in three different constituencies.  The Minister, when carrying out this operation, took the population and used it in a manner favourable to his own Party by using 1,000 persons&mdash;leaving the constituency with minus 1,000 persons&mdash;in <Col N="647" /> order to get the greatest advantage from it.  When we say that those places are minus 1,000 persons in respect of a census which was carried out some years ago, we realise that already the Minister has broken the law because if the population were counted now, there would be a greater difference than 1,000 persons in those constituencies.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in the Leitrim area the Minister put the 1,000 people on the other side of the line because they were predominantly against Fianna Fáil.  The Minister should realise that the Fianna Fáil constitution requires the representation to be altered in accordance with each census and that the period, of course, must not exceed 12 years.  In the past, the census was disregarded and the 12 years limit was used instead but now it is the census which actually determines the representation for the people and, consequently, an adjustment should be made from one census to another.  This means that there will be changes no matter what Government is in power after the next census or the one following it and with the drift of people from the West in particular and considering the emigration from there, it is obvious that those are the very areas which will need to be altered again.</P>
    <P>However, on the east coast, which has an increasing population, it is obvious that changes will be necessary again and that is why the Minister should have kept fairly to the national average as between the West and the East instead of putting the minus 1,000 on the western side and the plus 1,000 on the eastern side when he was planning the representation that the people would have in each particular constituency.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of an independent commission particularly when a person like the Minister gets the chance of gerrymandering the constituencies as he has done on this occasion. It is obvious that he has carried out this gerrymander so that Fianna Fáil, who have been losing support in recent times, would hold on to their representations in so far as is possible by the creation of three-seat constituencies, particularly in the West.  This is <Col N="648" /> designed to prevent any major change taking place and, having regard to the previous election figures and to the creation of four-seat constituencies in the areas which were not favourable to Fianna Fáil, this shows that Fianna Fáil were prepared to organise the constituencies in every way possible so as to prevent people from making a change of Government if they so wished.</P>
    <P>It would now be more difficult for the people to make a change of Government in the next election than it would have been if the constituencies had remained unchanged or if the constituencies had been fairly created in every area.  The Minister has disregarded the slogan of &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo;, by reducing the value of the vote in the four-seat constituencies, that is the value of the anti-Fianna Fáil vote in the four-seat constituencies as compared with the pro-Fianna Fáil vote in the three-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>It is obvious then that in future years it will be necessary to alter the constituencies again and when that time comes that the people who are involved and those are the people who determine who their representatives will be should ensure that no Minister be associated with any kind of political trickery such as the movement of population backwards and forwards across boundaries as has been done here.</P>
    <P>During the campaign, the Minister talked all the time about the possibility of having to breach county boundaries if the proposals were not accepted although, he said, at the same time, that he was not in favour of county boundaries being broken but now, when he gets an opportunity to create constituencies and draw up a map, he conveniently forgets all the statements he made and the case he made in favour of avoiding breaches in county boundaries.  Of course, he did warn the people that if Fianna Fáil were defeated in the referendum, constituencies would be butchered.  Certainly, they have been butchered but in the process the Minister made sure that those who were opposed to Fianna Fáil were the people who will be victimised by this new exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should <Col N="649" /> like to refer to a statement made by Senator Dooge to the effect that the proposals in the Bill involved the transfer of five or six times more people from one county to another than the Fine Gael proposals.  This, in fact, is a gross distortion of the facts.  The number being transferred is approximately 102,000 compared with approximately 49,000 by the Fine Gael proposals so that even on that basis it is little more than twice the number and not five or six times more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the number which will be attached to other counties and this does not even take into account the fact that whole counties like Monaghan will be attached to Cavan and that Carlow will be attached to Kildare for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>You were including the union of counties in this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not include that.  Within these figures it is a fact that in the proposals in the Bill all transfers of population are of significant numbers of people who will form an important element in the new constituency with the single exception of a part of the County of Roscommon included in the Clare-South Galway constituency, but this part forms the natural hinterland of Ballinasloe.  In each case under the proposals put forward by the Opposition the transfers are of numbers of people who will be inconsequential in the new constituencies into which they are being transferred. Apart from that altogether in respect of this group of amendments, and in so far as the previous group is concerned, I am satisfied that the proposals contained in the amendments would not produce as reasonable a scheme of constituencies as that set out in the Bill.  If we take the Western area consisting of the Province of Connacht, County of Clare and County of Donegal the proposals in these amendments are for three four-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> Because there is no change in regard to Mayo, we can say six three-seat constituencies. The proposals in the Bill are for ten three-seat constituencies. The total number of Deputies which is available for this area of the Province of Connacht and the two large counties of Clare and Donegal is 30 Deputies. Even three-seat constituencies in that area, which is the smallest constituency we can have, will obviously be very extensive constituencies to cover.  Taking into account the small number of Deputies available for the comparatively large area of this western region, we came to the decision that we should have three-seat constituencies, the smallest possible average size, and even on that basis the average area of the constituencies would be 970 square miles.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the amendments create three even larger constituencies. They create three four-seat constituencies in this area.  This was one of the things we decided against originally.  The three-seat areas are comparatively compact. They are not compact by any means because of the sparseness of population and because of the topography of the area.  These things having being taken into account, we decided on 3-seat constituencies rather than on constituencies returning four or five members. As well as that there is the fact that three-seat constituencies also facilitate a more decisive result in an election.  In fact they have been advocated for this reason by a prominent Fine Gael Front Bench Member of the Dáil, Deputy O'Donnell.  I believe, with Senator Rooney, that in the circumstances where it is reasonably feasible for the people to give decisive election results they are likely to return a Fianna Fáil Government.  I find it just as inconceivable as Senator Rooney does that they will ever decide to return a Fine Gael Government.  I find it surprising that a member of a Party that put themselves forward as an alternative Government should adopt this defeatist attitude and should state, as Senator Rooney states, that the creation of three-seat constituencies almost ensures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the return of the Fianna Fáil Government.  However, the fact is that the greater the number of three-seat constituencies the more likely it is that there will be a decisive result in a general election, and if Fine Gael members interpret that as meaning it is more likely that there will be a Fianna Fáil Government I shall not argue with them on that.  Apart from that, here in this area again the proposals in the Bill achieve a higher degree of equality of population per Member.  It is something which is laid down in the Constitution should be aimed at.  In this area the population of the constituencies in the Bill range from 19,171 in North-East Galway, 857 below the national average, to 20,859 in Sligo-Leitrim, which is 561 above the national average.  The amendments put forward by Fine Gael involve a wider deviation as well as involving a much less workable scheme of constituencies. They also involve wider deviation of population per Member, ranging from 19,060 in Roscommon, which is 968 below the national average, to 20,868 in West Galway which is 840 more than the national average.  Under the Bill the range is of 1,418 in population per Member as between the highest and the lowest, and in the amendments put forward by Fine Gael the number is 1,808.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also suggest to the Senators opposite that they might look at the boundary they propose between Sligo-Leitrim constituency and the South-Donegal constituency and see just how incongruous a boundary it is.  On the previous group of amendments I agree that one of the principles that I said we were trying to have regard to was the existing pattern of constituencies.  It is not true that I said this was an unalterable thing and that we must at all costs hold on to the existing pattern of constituencies. I said this was a desirable thing to do, where it was feasible.  In that part of the country it was feasible. It was feasible to retain the constituencies of Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Meath, Kildare, Carlow-Kilkenny and of Wexford.  This could be done.  It was not a question of the sanctity of existing constituencies but this was one of the desirable principles and it was <Col N="652" /> one which was feasible in that area but one which is not feasible in this western area which must lose a minimum of three seats.  The maximum number of Deputies there is 30 and that involves, even on the amendments put forward by the Fine Gael Party, quite a considerable disturbance of the existing constituencies.  Their suggestions, for instance, involve the constituency of County Clare with part of County Galway, Roscommon with part of County Galway, Sligo with Leitrim, and South Donegal with part of Leitrim.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear there had to be a major disruption of constituencies in any case.  This being so, and in view of the large areas involved and the small number of Deputies, we decided to divide it into ten three-seat constituencies and we are satisfied it has been done in the least objectionable way possible.  By doing this, the populations required to vote outside their own counties are in every case a significant number so that the sense of frustration and almost of defranchisement will not be present in cases of transfers of population.</P>

      <P>In each case put forward by the Opposition the transfers of population were so small as to be completely insignificant in their new constituency. It seems to me to be largely a question of disagreement on the overall approach and I appreciate that the Opposition had to find some grounds on which to oppose this Bill. Their original decision was to make it appear to be an unnecessary gerrymander and, therefore, they had to adopt a completely different approach to the approach in the Bill.  I have shown quite clearly the Government's view and this has now boiled down to a disagreement on approach.  Our opinion is the same as that of Deputy O'Donnell, that there should be a general move towards three-seat constituencies so as to make it more feasible to have decisive election results.  The Opposition's approach shows inconsistencies.  Where it suits them they would create new two-county five-seat constituencies where there has not been any tradition of <Col N="653" /> association between the two counties concerned and they would have three-and four-seat constituencies where it suits them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the difference of opinion on the approach to be adopted when population has to be transferred &mdash; whether the number should be significant or be so small that it will be submerged in the new constituency to which it is being transferred. There is a difference of approach as to whether we should have reasonable regard to existing and traditional constituencies or whether these should be completely ignored and we should start from scratch and draw up a scheme of constituencies.  We believe there should be reasonable regard to the traditional pattern of representation and this approach has been adopted where it was feasible to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Rooney returned to this question of the arrangement which has been decided on in the Clare and Galway areas.  It is quite clear that our proposals under the Bill will enable the population of Clare that will be attached to the Clare-South Galway constituency to elect their own Deputy and, in fact, the likely result will be that Clare will have the four seats to which it will be entitled on the basis of the number of voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the number of voters per Deputy, Clare would be fully entitled to four seats.  It is clear that it can, in fact, get four seats under this arrangement.  Therefore, under our proposals the transfer of population in this case will not have the same sense of defranchisement and of isolation in a strange county as would be the case under the Fine Gael proposals where an insignificant number of Galway people would be submerged in the large county of Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made, both in this group of amendments <Col N="654" /> and in the previous amendment, to the proposed division of Mayo into two three-seat constituencies instead of the existing three-and four-seat constituencies with a bit of Roscommon attached.  Though the proposed arrangement was criticised, I note that neither here nor in the Dáil was there any amendment put down in an attempt to do what it is claimed it is possible to do, namely, to retain North and South Mayo constituencies.  Probably this exercise was attempted and it was found that the dividing line between those constituencies would, in fact, have to turn downwards at each end round the town of Castlebar and the resulting constituency would look ridiculous. It is obvious how the dividing line proposed under this Bill was decided upon.  It was a question of leaving associated with the two major towns of Ballina and Castlebar as much as possible of their natural hinterlands, and the line which originally ran almost directly north and south had to be changed in order to have a reasonable area associated with the two towns.</P>
      <P>The most amazing suggestion was made by Senator Rooney, naturally, when he accused me of breaking the law by basing this revision of constituencies on the last available census of population, but this is exactly what the Constitution requires me to do.  It must be based on the population per Member in accordance with the last preceding census of population.  Senator Rooney, in spite of the fact that we have a court decision on this matter, wants me to estimate the population, to estimate what he calls the declining population in the West of Ireland and the increased population in the Dublin area, and to allot to the Dublin area an unspecified number of extra seats based on some estimate of the increased population in Dublin.  I am precluded from doing this and must act on the last available figures in the census of population carried out in 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out, if not here certainly in the Dáil, it is quite clear even in the Dublin area itself that the constituencies I must now draw up in accordance with the Constitution on the accurate basis of equality of population per Member, will be completely out of line <Col N="655" /> with the Constitution when the next census is carried out in 1971.  So far as the whole Ballymun scheme is concerned, no account has been taken in the census of 1966 of the population there, but we know there are more than 10,000 people living there now.  The same situation applies in other areas that have become built up in the last few years.  In Clondalkin, Tallaght, Lucan, Howth, Kilbarrack, Baldoyle there have been significant changes in population.  I pointed out that one of the results of the manner in which the Opposition misrepresented the proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to the people will obviously be that there must be another revision of the constituencies within a few years because of the fact that we should not have been allowed to take account of changes in population which we know have taken place since 1966.</P>
    <P>However, I am interested in the fact that at this stage of the Bill again, as on the Second Stage, Senator Rooney put forward this claim that the allocation of seats to the Dublin area at 38 to the City and County of Dublin is not sufficient and that the allocation of 30 to the western area, the province of Connacht and counties Clare and Donegal, is too large.  He did not say how many extra seats should be put into the Dublin area or how many he judges should come from the western area or where they should come from. I wonder whether this is official Fine Gael policy or not, because the same proposition was put forward in the Dáil by the two Deputies Belton and I think also by Deputy Maurice Dockrell, and it certainly was put forward very strongly by Senator Rooney's erstwhile colleague from the Labour Party, Deputy Seán Dunne, the only spokesman for the Labour Party on the subject, so I can assume that it is official Labour Party policy that we should not have these 30 seats in the western area but should have less there and more in the Dublin area. I do not know what is the official Fine Gael policy on it.  Apparently on this matter as on many other matters they can have as many voices as there are Deputies in the Party.  Certainly the <Col N="656" /> amendments they have put down to this Bill appear to accept the distribution that is proposed in the Bill, that is of 38 seats in the Dublin area and 30 in this western area.</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is much need to go into the rest of Senator Rooney's contribution.  His theory that Fianna Fáil have been losing ground can of course be shown to be completely controverted by the remarkable record of Fianna Fáil winning six by-elections out of seven, something which was never achieved before.  Never before in the history of this country was it known for an existing Government, particularly in circumstances where its majority was not in danger, to actually win six by-elections out of seven and increase its strength in the way it has.  I think that Senator Rooney knows that since then there has been if anything an accretion of support to Fianna Fáil, and this arises largely out of the evidence provided by the two Opposition Parties of the fact that any future change of Government is certainly going to lead to the same type of irresponsible handling of the country's affairs as it did in the past. The unrealistic nature of the policies they have put forward, and the obvious disarray of the two parties, definitely shows that Fianna Fáil can expect increased support.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Rooney that under the proposed scheme of constituencies the increase in the number of three-seat constituencies does appear to make it more feasible for the people to give a decisive result in this election and that this is likely to result in the return of Fianna Fáil again.  I am not going to argue with them if he says that this is so, in fact I think that that was the only realistic statement the Senator made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that what I said in relation to the gerrymandering of constituencies in the west was that it was to prevent people from making a change.  That is why the Minister organises the constituencies in that way so that the people would not have a fair chance of making a change.  I am in favour of the one man one vote arrangement but I have pointed out to the Minister that he did <Col N="657" /> not do that as far as Dublin city and county is concerned when it is compared with the manner in which he reorganised the constituencies in the west of Ireland.  The Minister is talking about these by-election victories, but in every one except one the Fianna Fáil Party lost heavily in votes and Fine Gael gained votes in every constituency except Cork.  Fianna Fáil lost 3,000 in Cork in the by-election and Fine Gael lost 1,000.</P>

      <P>Our percentage of the vote went up in every constituency and we are satisfied that when the opportunity comes it will go much higher. When we hear the Minister talking as he does about the six by-elections out of seven it seems he has forgotten that Fianna Fáil were beaten by a quarter of a million votes last October.  They try to forget that, but it is on that basis that we calculate that Fianna Fáil will be removed from office and the change will be made, but the Minister has done as much as possible to prevent people making the positive change in the matter of the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's long reply to the points put forward on this particular group of amendments I begin to realise the reason behind the Minister replying at length on such occasions, because I gradually realised the great disparity between the argument which the Minister was using at the beginning of his reply and the argument he was using at the end of it.  At the beginning of his reply the Minister was putting forward the point that the degree of distribution in the proposals we were putting forward was of the same order of magnitude as those in the Bill, in fact the number of people disturbed by his proposals was not more than twice the number, and so the Minister talked on and on, but when it came to the end of the Minister's discourse he was lauding his own proposals on the ground that he was transferring enough people <Col N="658" /> in each case to elect a Deputy of their own compared with the completely insignificant numbers proposed to be transferred under our amendment.  Even in the course of a long reply like that the Minister cannot have it both ways. The Minister should pick his ground and fight on that and not be moving from the argument that the changes we propose are virtually as large as his but at the other end the proposals we suggest must be ruled out because they are insignificantly small compared with the substantial changes that he has made.</P>
      <P>The Minister was specific in repeating a remark of mine about what I thought from a quick look at the figures involved in regard to the amendments we were talking about&mdash;and in spite of some of the things we have heard in the last ten minutes we were talking about the West of Ireland.  The Minister said that in fact my statement was wrong.  I said at the beginning of my contribution to these amendments that there was little point in arguing about the details of figures, but when I look at the figures here&mdash;and I have not worked them out in detail so I am open to correction on them&mdash;my reckoning is that when you compare the Minister's proposals and our proposals in regard to the exchange between Leitrim and Donegal, under our proposals you have an exchange of 5,600 people and the Minister's proposal is based on an exchange of population of 30,600&mdash;a ratio of five to one.  Our proposals would be something in the order of 2,800 while the Minister's would be in the order of 14,800 which would be about five to one.  In regard to exchanges between Galway and Roscommon our proposals, in so far as I can make out, would be less than 1,000 while the Minister's are more than 14,000 which is more than 14 to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to these amendments which we are discussing, the statement I made was a fair one.  The Minister has made many half replies to some of the points put forward in my original contribution to the discussions on these amendments.  I see little hope for any of these amendments being passed by the House and, equally, I see little hope of convincing the Minister <Col N="659" /> in this regard.  It would be fruitless, therefore, to merely reliterate those arguments.  However, one thing intrigued me and that is the Minister's proposal to do justice to the people of Clare and to get the people of Clare the four seats to which he thinks they are entitled on the basis of the voters.  The Minister goes about this in a rather strange way.  He transfers a large number of people into Galway in the hope that it will be possible to elect a fourth Clare Deputy under the guise of a Galway Deputy and this is the argument that the Minister uses against the proposals of amendment No. 3 to which I would direct your attention.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 proposes that the Clare constituency be made up by adding a few thousand people from County Galway to give the constituency of Galway four seats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>There is one point with which I should like to deal and that is this contention of Senator Rooney that there is some injustice being done to the people of Dublin in allocating only 38 seats to that region. If we take the area of Dublin City and County, the overall divergence for the national average of population per Deputy in that area is 894 above the national average of population per Deputy but if we take the number of voters per Deputy we find that the number per Deputy in the Dublin City and County area will be 280 below the national average of voters per Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the rest of Leinster, excluding Dublin City and County, plus the two counties of Cavan and Monaghan, the divergence in the national average of population per Deputy is 53 less than the national average while the number of voters per Deputy in that area is only eight over the national average. In the Province of Munster, excluding Clare which is included in the western area, the average population per Deputy will be 385 below the national average whereas the number of voters is only 61 below the national average and in the area west of the Shannon, that is the Province of Connacht and Counties Donegal and Clare, the divergence from the average of population <Col N="660" /> per Deputy is 558 below the national average so that it will in fact take 426 more voters to elect a Deputy in that area, the number of voters per Deputy being 426 above the national average.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that in allocating these 30 seats which is the maximum that can be allocated to this area under discussion, we have not done any injustice whatever to any other part of the country and it will, in fact, take substantially more votes to elect a Deputy in this western area than in the area of the City and County of Dublin.  In fact, it will take 706 more votes per Deputy in the western area.</P>

      <P>The outstanding thing about the question of the arrangements in regard to Dublin in comparison with the rest of the country is the change of rhythm.  In regard to Dublin the Minister has stuck to a <Col N="664" /> straight one, two, three, four rhythm whereas he appears to prefer the old time waltz beat of one, two, three in the remainder of the country.  To my mind the Minister is being disingenuous in regard to his arguments about Dublin. Even if we accept that there should be no five-seater in Dublin, the Minister says that there are only two ways of doing it.  We must either divide it by making it all fours or all threes but there is another way even allowing for the Minister's assumption that you cannot have a five-seat constituency in Dublin.  There was no hesitation in previous years about breaking the city boundaries and combining the city and county for electoral purposes.  The emergence of four-seat constituencies in Dublin and three-seaters in the rest of the country is capable of many explanations of which the most obvious is a political explanation.</P>

He is giving himself a fighting chance, a running chance, whereas in the West he has organised it so that he will have whatever little advantage there is from three-seat constituencies in the West.</P>

      <P>It is true as Senator Dooge says that in the Dublin area we have not got as many three-seat constituencies as there are in the rest of the country.  I am sure he will see that the problem here was that we had to have 38 seats within the confines of the boundary of Dublin County.  If you decide as we decided to adhere to the city boundary so far as possible this meant 11 seats in the county area and 27 seats in the city area.  Even under the Bill as we proposed it we have ten constituencies within this small area. We have two four seaters and one three seater in the county which, if you accept the principle that we should not create any new five-seat constituency is in fact the only way in which that area could be dealt with.  I say, &ldquo;If you accept the principle of creating no five-seat constituency&rdquo; in the city area.  I said there were only two ways to make the division that if you decided to go for the maximum number either of three-seat or four-seat constituencies.  I agree that if you do not have regard to any definite principle like that there are numerous ways in which it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of constituencies we have brought in involves six four-seaters <Col N="666" /> in the city and one three-seat constituency which is a total of seven, or a total of ten for the Dublin area.  If we had decided to go for the maximum number of three-seat constituencies, we would have nine three-seat constituencies within the city area and a total of 12 constituencies in the Dublin area altogether.  The situation in Dublin city is confusing enough as it is where we have six constituences.  We will have seven now, due to having to squeeze in these extra seats.  If we had three-seaters here we would have nine constituencies. If these were to be named in the traditional, by cardinal and subcardinal points, there would be confusion with south-south-west and north-north-east and so on.  Senator Rooney says we have all four-seaters. In fact there are two three-seat constituencies, one in the city and one in the county.  Personally I am very confident that the three-seat constituency in the county will be the one that will ensure a Fianna Fáil majority there, and it will ensure the retention of the majority which we have at present, as Senator Rooney knows so well.  I am sure he has vivid memories of the last general election when Fianna Fáil won the first two seats on the first count, being the only two Deputies elected on that count, the Labour Party got the third and Fianna Fáil the fourth and Senator Rooney had the distinction of unsuccessfully contesting the last seat with his colleague, Deputy Clinton.  I am certain the result of the three-seat constituency in the County Dublin area will be the same, as Senator Rooney agrees it is likely to be, in other parts of the country and that the people will decide to give Fianna Fáil the majority there.  It so happens that because of the location within the existing constituency of County Dublin of myself and my two colleagues, Deputies Burke and Foley, that they will be contesting North County Dublin constituency and I will be in South County Dublin.</P>

I am quite sure I will not have the assistance of Deputies Burke or Foley on this occasion but I can assure Senator Rooney that there are plenty of very strong, potential candidates in that area and the result of the election will be that I will have an effective colleague in that constituency.</P>

      <P>In regard to Longford-Westmeath, the Minister has produced a number of what I referred to as coincidences by having decided to operate along certain principles.  Having decided to operate these principles he ended up with a situation favourable to his party and colleague.  In regard to Longford-Westmeath the position is that Athlone has been removed from Longford-Westmeath and put into the county of Roscommon.  I might be inclined to say here the operation of the principle has led to a <Col N="670" /> coincidence of political benefit to one of the Minister's colleagues except that I fail to see even a &ldquo;principle&rdquo; of the type which the Minister has been producing. It is not necessary within the arithmetical operation which is in process to put this part of Athlone into Roscommon and take it out of Longford-Westmeath. There is not even a shadow of a principle to justify this particular violation of county boundaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another example obviously of stinking gerrymandering. Athlone was brought in deliberately because the Minister, Mr. Lenihan, is located near Athlone.  I think he is actually resident in Athlone. It was taken in there for the benefit of that Minister.  You have the example of the Mayo constituency being split for two Ministers and the Minister providing a constituency for himself in South County Dublin.  There are indications of political gerrymandering all over the map when it is examined.</P>

      <P>With regard to Longford-Westmeath, I commend the Minister for having undone something which should never have happened in 1961, when quite an amount of Westmeath was put in with Kildare.  When part of a county is put in with another county it should border it at some point, but Westmeath did not border Kildare at any single point.  We were in the ridiculous position of being tied up with a county with which we had no interest.  In Longford and Westmeath, the population is exactly as laid down in the Constitution entitling Longford-Westmeath to four seats.  In fact I would go so far as to say that it was common knowledge that Longford-Westmeath was one unit until two days before the Bill came out.  Something then happened: a certain person went to hospital and the slicing up took place in order to bolster up a Minister and make sure that he was in a safe position.  However, damage had to be done to the Minister's <Col N="671" /> father who held that seat in the Athlone area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, completely incorrect to say that the town of Athlone has been removed from the constituency of Longford-Westmeath and transferred into Roscommon. That is not proposed in the Bill.  What is proposed is that the Athlone West Urban Area should be included in the Roscommon constituency.  Athlone, as the Senators know, consists of Athlone West Urban and Athlone East Urban; Athlone West Urban Area lies physically to the west of the Shannon in the County of Roscommon, and is, in fact, a Roscommon town.  It is the market town for a large part of South Roscommon and all around the Carrigallen area, these people are naturally associated with the town of Athlone West Urban.  They do their business there and they rarely, if ever, cross the Shannon; in fact, there are two separate parishes in this area, one west and one east of the Shannon.  The association of Athlone West Urban with Roscommon is completely natural.</P>
      <P>The remaining part of the town of Athlone, which is east of the Shannon, remains in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath. The principle adopted here was what was required by the Constitution&mdash;to aim in so far as it is feasible, and within the very narrow limits that were specified by the High Court Judgment, at near equality of population per Deputy.  This rationalisation in the area of Athlone and this adherence to the physical boundary of the Shannon should have pleased Senator Rooney who was so perturbed about the comparative lowness of the average population per Deputy in the western area, because this helps to redress the balance.  It was an obvious thing to be done, particularly, as I say, since this part of Athlone is much more closely associated with Roscommon than with Westmeath.</P>

      <P>The last time I visited Athlone the bridge was still standing.  I wonder whether some latter <Col N="672" /> Sergeant Custume has removed part of the span.  The Minister's argument, based on the community interest as between Roscommon and West Athlone, that West Athlone should form part of Roscommon seems to me a relatively weak argument.  Indeed I understated the case and I propose to move an amendment to that effect on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my question as to whether the complete Athlone area should have been left in Longford-Westmeath.  For years and years there was a division between the people of Athlone.  The division was there at the river.  You had the Gael on one side and the Gall on the other side and that barrier was broken through by the Urban Council. I am afraid that the Minister has divided the town again and that the old undesirable atmosphere that was in Athlone years ago will return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it was feasible to leave this part of Athlone which is west of the Shannon with this constituency which is east of the Shannon, but Senator McAuliffe has only to consider Longford-Westmeath. I have to consider the whole of the country and the requirements of the Constitution as to equality of population per Deputy as far as it is feasible within the very narrow limits.  The rationalisation of the situation by adhering to the physical boundary of the Shannon here did, in fact, result in in an overall raising of the population per Deputy in the Western area, bringing it nearer to the national average. It therefore appeared to me to be something that was in line with the requirements of the Constitution. Senator McAuliffe has remarked that this division, which was originally between the Gael and the Gall is something that has been there down through the years.  In fact Athlone West Urban Area is, as he knows, referred to by the people of Roscommon who do their business there and from whom that part of the town derives its livelihood, as Irishtown down to this day. The parts of Roscommon that have been taken into the area down through the years are extensions of the urban boundary that have been ceded with <Col N="673" /> reluctance by Roscommon and there is certainly nothing unnatural in Athlone West Urban Area being associated for electoral purposes with a county whose population carries out its business in that area.</P>
