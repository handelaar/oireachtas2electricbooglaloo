      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 5, 3 and 4.  It is proposed to take the Electricity (Special Provisions) (Repeal) Bill, which has come to us from the Dáil, with No. 2.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I should like to clear two points.  The first is that though ordinarily this side of the House would object to taking a Bill at such extreme short notice as it is now proposed to do in regard to the Electricity (Special Provisions) (Repeal) Bill, because this is so completely cognate with the Industrial Relations Bill which we propose to discuss anyway, we do not object on this occasion.  However, we should not like this to be regarded as a precedent for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I raise is that because tomorrow is a holyday of obligation and since we have anticipated that the House would not sit late on the eve of a holyday of obligation as it is not the custom to do so, I should like to ask the Leader of the House whether there will be any serious objection from his point of view if the Seanad were to adjourn at 6 p.m. <Col N="942" /> this evening and reassemble next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the proposal but I should like, if at all possible, either to complete the Second Stage of the Industrial Relations Bill or get a lot of it done within a time that will enable us to deal with the Shipping Bill which is a question of providing urgently needed money, before we adjourn.  Therefore, I suggest that possibly 6 p.m. might be a little early.  Perhaps we could adjourn at 6.30 p.m. if that is all right with the Senator.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise two points on the Order of Business. The first is in connection with a motion that the Leader of the House referred to on 26th March last regarding the dismissal of a trade union official.  The question was raised by Members, and rightly so, as to whether evidence was available of victimisation. Since then I have made this evidence available and it is in the Library.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to raise is that I should like to know if the Leader of the House is in a position to let me know, in view of the importance of motion No. 10, which deals with civil rights for civil servants and others, namely, the right to be first-class citizens just like anybody else, if it will be taken considering that a general election is impending either before the Recess or, I presume, within six months of the rising of the House.  Can the Leader of the House say if this motion will be taken shortly?</P>

      <P>In moving the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil, I moved at the same time the Second Reading of another Bill&mdash;the Trade Union Bill, 1966&mdash;and both Bills, were debated together.  While there is a definite link between the two Bills, inasmuch as both are designed to improve the processes of pay determination, the Bill before the House can stand on its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the field of industrial relations the State's concern is to provide machinery so that disputes can be resolved before <Col N="944" /> developing into great tests of strength. This implies that the employer and worker would do their level best to find a solution before turning for outside help and that, if they invoke outside help in the form of the procedures and machinery provided by the State, they would use it for the genuine purpose of reaching a peaceful solution.  The House will realise, however, that, if a party to a dispute decides from the beginning to have a test of strength, whatever the machinery, he cannot be prevented from doing so.  That is one of the features of a free country. Equally well if people set their expectations too high, and if the machinery does not give them what they want, they may reject the referee and then decide to go on to a test of strength. Again our freedom allows that to happen.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, I would say that, in the case of rights in which disciplinary matters may be involved, I believe that a quick examination by an independent person would prevent escalation and help to avoid some of the sudden stoppages to which such disputes may lead.  Strikes due to rights disputes are quite numerous in this country, but most of them are of short duration, with the result that only about 20 per cent of the man days lost in industrial disputes are lost because of such disputes.  The vast bulk of the man-days lost arose from disputes about wages and hours of employment, so that our main trouble stems from conflicts about pay. Senators will be aware of the suggestion made from time to time that the removal of incomes decisions from the area of dispute would be a solution.  As I understand it, this would mean having a tight-knit system in which all incomes, wages, dividends, rents, professional fees, profits and so on, would be determined by authority, as distinct from the present free system where wages and salaries are fixed by negotiation.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, while the setting up of such a body is being strongly canvassed, there is but a very small body of opinion in favour of giving it powers to enforce decisions or exact sanctions on defaulters.  How compliance with the decisions or recommendations of <Col N="945" /> such a body could be brought about has still to be worked out, but it is clear that a degree of commitment not so far achieved in this country will be required.  We already have experience of recommendations of the Labour Court being rejected.  In the case of non-acceptance of recommendations, whether of the Labour Court or of some other body, the freedom to strike would remain.</P>
    <P>However discouraging the record of the past may be in the case of nonacceptance of Labour Court recommendations, I believe that we should do our best to work out procedures which would permit of a policy on incomes, on the lines envisaged in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development to be formulated and operated.</P>
    <P>I think it timely at this point to invite the attention of Senators to the effect created in the minds of our people by the high proportion of Labour Court recommendations rejected by workers.  I have been disturbed by this trend which has now developed to the stage at which more than half the workers involved in Labour Court hearing last year rejected the court's recommendations and then instructed their unions to proceed, sometimes through strike action, for better terms than had been recommended by the court.  In addition, there have been cases where groups of workers have refused to allow their case to go before the Labour Court, even when the court, apprehending trouble, offered its services.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in these circumstances the court is, in the words of the Third Programme, being debased. With the rejection by a majority of workers of its recommendations, I invite Senators to consider whether the status of the court is not now reaching the point where its retention must be seriously questioned.  To continue to retain an institution when it is being treated in this way by those for whose benefit it was set up is, in the opinion of some who have commented on recent trends, to risk undermining the confidence of our citizens in the apparatus of Government generally.</P>
    <P>Whatever the reasons for the lack of respect for the court, the whole <Col N="946" /> situation must be regarded as unsatisfactory and I want to tell the House that the Government will not insist on holding on to the court in the face of attitudes of the kind which have been developing recently.</P>
    <P>This Bill has, however, been drafted on the assumption that the court is to be continued and on the assumption too that those who want it continued will take meaningful steps to see that its services are used for the national purpose for which the court exists, namely, to help promote harmonious industrial relations and to prevent and settle industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>I propose in this Bill to introduce a new type of machinery for the settlement of certain kinds of disputes which should be of considerable benefit to workers.  Quite a number of disputes develop about such things as discipline and dismissals and often these find their way to the Labour Court.  In such cases something is needed to give a quick and authoritative opinion.  It is proposed to take power, therefore, to appoint one or more rights commissioners.</P>
    <P>A commissioner will investigate privately and quickly a dispute which arises out of a right which a worker claims to have, stemming from an agreement, a custom or a practice.  The commissioner can make this investigation at the request of either party to the dispute unless the other party objects.  If the other party does object, then the dispute would have to be dealt with in the way such disputes would be dealt with today.  The parties to a dispute before the rights commissioner will be free to accept or reject the recommendation made by the commissioner. Either party may appeal the commissioner's recommendation to the Labour Court but only on the basis that the court's decision on the appeal will be binding on the parties.  The rights commissioner will not hear a case which has been before the Labour Court and the court will not hear a case which had been before a comsissioner save, of course, by way of appeal.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the proposal in section 6 of the Bill which envisages an extension of the scope of the duties of the Conciliation <Col N="947" /> Officers, who will in future be known as Industrial Relations Officers.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the part played by these officers in preventing and settling disputes.  The Conciliation Service was set up under the 1946 Act for the purpose of mediating in disputes.  The officers of the Service have succeeded in averting many stoppages of work; they have also succeeded, in certain cases, in getting the parties to negotiate better working arrangements and to establish longterm negotiating machinery through the operation of such bodies as Joint Industrial Councils.</P>
    <P>The Services had to be expanded considerably over the past few years and conferences are now being organised at the rate of nearly 1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>In the course of their work the officers of the Service amass much valuable information.  They see where good relations operate; and conversely they see the defects in procedures and practices which cause tensions and breakdowns in communications and which sometimes lead to stoppages of work.</P>
    <P>I believe that the fund of experience accumulated by these officers, and the confidence and goodwill they enjoy among employers, managers, personnel officers and trade unions, should be used more extensively for the improvement of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I have already asked the Labour Court to examine means by which the members of the Service might make their knowledge and advice available to managements and trade unions in the interest of bringing about improved procedures in industries and services. It is on management that the main responsibility for establishing and maintaining satisfactory procedures rests and I would like to encourage managements to take advantage of this knowledge and advice, particularly in cases where defects are known to exist.</P>
    <P>In the proposals for this legislation which I first published in 1966, it had been suggested that, in relation to the various Conciliation and Arbitration Schemes which exist at present for the employees in the Civil Service, the <Col N="948" /> Local Government service <i>et cetera,</i> instead of having a number of different arbitrators for the different bodies, claims which could not be resolved by conciliation process should be referred for determination by the Labour Court, the court, for that purpose, to be augmented by individuals drawn from a panel of persons with economic, social or other appropriate qualifications. This was proposed because of the multiplicity of arbitrators involved, who by applying different considerations to the cases brought before them, were handing down decisions which were producing discontent among different groups in the public service and generating an undesirable amount of leapfrogging as well.  I felt that the Labour Court, with its full-time and continuing responsibility in the field of industrial relations, could bring to bear upon these issues its much broader knowledge of the whole scene; and, while not necessarily aiming at uniformity in pay and conditions, I had hoped that, under such an arrangement, they could bring about a better relationship between the different groups in the public sector and between public and private employment.</P>
    <P>The unions and staff associations in the public sector objected to this proposal. They complained that they had no say in the selection of the Chairman of the Labour Court, whereas, under the terms of their agreements, they had a say in the nomination of the chairman of their arbitration body.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed in not getting broad acceptance of my original proposal and in place of that proposal I am providing that two members of the Labour Court, one a workers' member and one an employers' member, will become members of each of the various arbitration bodies, and thereby let the body have the benefit of their experience from the Labour Court point of view.  I put this forward as a second best and only because of the refusal of the staff associations concerned to accept the original proposal.</P>
    <P>I am providing in section 21 of the Bill for the dissolution of the Electricity Supply Board manual workers and general employees tribunals.  Being statutory, these have introduced an <Col N="949" /> element of rigidity which is not suitable to conditions today, and by abolishing them I will be leaving the way open for the ESB to negotiate with its employees for whatever system of industrial relations procedures suits their conditions.  They are already in close negotiation on this matter.  I would hope that the system which evolves will make it necessary for the parties to have real deep negotiations before bringing any problems forward for formal investigation by the Labour Court.  Senators will be aware that the abolition of the tribunals has also been recommended by the Committee on Industrial Relations in the ESB.</P>
    <P>A 1966 proposal was that the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 should be amended whereby the Labour Court would not investigate a trade dispute unless both or all parties asked it to act and undertook to accept the Court's decision, the penalties recommended for refusal to accept to be, in the case of workers, withdrawal of the protection of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, for three months, and, in the case of an employer, an appropriate fine.</P>
    <P>The concept behind this proposal was to encourage the settlement of disputes as early on in the line of procedure as possible, and to enhance the status of the Labour Court by making it more remote and by exacting a &ldquo;price&rdquo; for its services.  If the parties to a dispute knew that the ultimate piece of machinery would be available to them only on the condition that they would undertake to accept the findings, it was hoped that the parties would make greater efforts to resolve the dispute between themselves or, failing that, by invoking the court's conciliation service.  If, however, as foreshadowed by the ICTU reaction to the proposals, parties to industrial disputes simply refused to use the Labour Court, the situation would then be that the State had provided a court which would rarely, if ever, be &ldquo;in session&rdquo; and the members of which could do no more than stand by while public representatives and other prominent citizens tried to settle disputes which were unresolved at conciliation level.</P>
    <P>Experience suggests that State-sponsored procedures aimed at promoting <Col N="950" /> harmony in industrial relations cannot be successfully operated if they have built into them the opposition of the parties concerned in disputes, and no good would be achieved by giving the parties machinery which they do not want and would not use. It is not proposed, therefore, to make any fundamental change in the role of the court, but rather to make such changes as it is hoped will make the court a more effective instrument in promoting industrial peace.  Power is being taken to appoint, if necessary, extra members to the Labour Court so that it can operate in three divisions instead of two as at present, and to have available a full-time as well as a part-time Deputy Chairman Pensions will be provided for members of the Labour Court.  I feel, however, that although I now propose to leave the court as it is there should be some moral commitment on the parties who want a hearing and I propose that normally the court will not investigate a dispute unless, following failure to settle at conciliation level, there is a request for an investigation from the parties. Too frequently unions at present let the employer ask for the hearing (or let the court itself take the initiative) and then, if complaint is made later about rejection of the court's award, say, in defence, that they did not ask for a hearing but were &ldquo;brought&rdquo; or &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; before the court.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1946 provides that when the Labour Court investigates a dispute, it shall make a recommendation as to how it thinks the dispute should be settled.  From time to time the court finds itself in the position where it considers that the parties should continue or resume discussions among themselves and it does not make a formal recommendation as to how the disputes should be settled. While it may be argued that such a step by the court could be considered as the making of a statutory recommendation that the dispute could best be settled by further talks, I consider that the matter should be removed from the realm of doubt.  Accordingly, I propose that the 1946 Act should be amended to provide that the court may make a recommendation instead <Col N="951" /> of that it shall do so.  It will be provided, however, that (a) if workers or a trade union ask the court to investigate a dispute and agree beforehand (as a moral commitment) to accept the recommendation or (b) if the parties to a conciliation conference agree upon a limited issue on which they wish to have the court's recommendation, and agree in advance to accept the court's ruling, there will be an obligation on the court to investigate in private session on a priority basis, and make an early recommendation.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, provides that the Labour Court may hold any sitting or part of a sitting in private.  I had proposed in 1966 that in future the proceedings of the court would normally be in private unless the court was of opinion that, in the public interest, a particular case should be heard in public.  Arguments can be advanced for and against both public and private hearings.  In the case of public hearings there is a tendency for the parties to start afresh and cover ground already covered at conciliation. There is also a temptation for spokesmen at public hearings to strike &ldquo;party line&rdquo; attitudes for publicity purposes.  Against private hearings, it can be argued, however, that the public should know what is going on and that industrial disputes which affect the public should not be resolved behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the parties themselves a say in this matter and I now propose that the investigation of trade disputes by the court will be in private but that the court shall, if a party to the dispute so requests, hold a hearing in public.  Even in that case the court may hold any part of a sitting in private in order to meet the situation in which information was being submitted which the court considered was confidential to the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 68 (1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, imposes on the Labour Court when making a recommendation, the obligation to take into account a number of considerations which can contradict one another.  I propose, therefore, that that section should be amended to read as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> The court, having investigated a trade dispute, may make a recommendation setting forth its opinion on the terms on which it should be settled.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court will be given a new function in relation to rules of fair employment.  It is intended that the Labour Court should encourage representative groups of workers and employers in various industries to work out and agree upon the basic conditions of good employment for workers covering such things as notice, discipline, dismissals, and so on.  Where these are agreed upon, they would be converted into statutory rules by the Labour Court and could then be legally enforced.  It is hoped by this method to afford to workers some better certainty and clarity as to their rights in this area, that is those facets of employment not immediately concerned with the direct wage element.</P>
    <P>There are some tidying up features such as making it clear that the Labour Court can give an interpretation of an employment agreement if asked to do so by the parties to the agreement; giving employers the right to complain to the court about non-compliance with the terms of a registered employment agreement; giving the Minister's inspectors power to check on compliance with registered agreements in the same way as they check on employment regulation orders and reducing from 30 to 21 days the period for making representations about the terms of proposed employment regulation orders.</P>
    <P>At present workers employed by or under the State have not access to the Labour Court.  Many of the persons in this category are, of course, included in the various public service arbitration boards, but there are some, like forestry workers, who have neither the arbitration boards nor access to the Labour Court.  It is proposed to correct this by giving State employees access to the Labour Court if they are not covered by a conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>The review of the law on trade unions and on industrial relations has been going on for a long time and a great variety of ideas and propositions <Col N="953" /> have been examined.  There is an extraordinary sensitiveness and suspicion about Government action in these areas.  Nearly everybody will say that our system of industrial relations is not good and will urge the Government &ldquo;to do something about it.&rdquo;  The Government does want to do something about it but does not want to transfer to itself all the responsibilities and anxieties for good industrial relations which must rest primarily with employers and workers.</P>
    <P>The search has been, therefore, to identify what is wrong at present and to see if agreement can be reached on the remedies.  Some union spokesmen will say as they have often said before: &ldquo;We know what is wrong with industrial relations.  We know where the trouble lies, we are in the best position to know what to do.  Leave it to us and we will cure it in our own way.&rdquo;  I would be very happy to leave it to them to find a cure if I thought that by their own unaided efforts they could produce results but recent happenings do not encourage one to believe that the results which not only the trade union movement but the community as a whole desire can come about without the aid of legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that legislation alone can produce an answer.  The answer must come from the disposition of those concerned in industrial relations to improve them but I do think that legislation has a part to play here.  I believe that the majority of trade unionists, while wanting to retain their basic freedoms, want as well to live in a stable society where they have for their support a strong trade union movement which will assure them of orderly progression.  There are, however, a small minority who are living in the past and who are relying upon trade union ideas and attitudes which may have been appropriate for an age which is now past.  They are fearful of change and see in every suggestion which is put to them &ldquo;the thin end of the wedge&rdquo; by which the Government will gradually take over control of the unions or take away their authority.</P>
    <P>I do not know how they can be reassured that this is not the intention. Maybe they can be reassured by their <Col N="954" /> more forward thinking brethren and encouraged to give a fair trial to the ideas being advanced at this time. It is because of these fears that I suggest, and suggested to the Dáil, we should hasten slowly but I do not think that we should wait another twenty years before suggesting further changes. I think we should contemplate making changes as they occur to us and according as they can be agreed and accepted as good ideas.</P>
    <P>I have outlined my proposals for improving the situation in this complex field of industrial relations.  I think it is clear to all Senators that in this area real and lasting improvements cannot be effected by legislation alone.  Rather is the purpose of legislation to facilitate those directly concerned to work the system that has been evolved here in the smoothest way practicable.</P>
    <P>However, I would ask the House to endorse my view that, unless the freedom given to employers and trade unions is matched with a sense of responsibility, that freedom is in danger of being abused&mdash;as indeed it has been in the past&mdash;with damaging, and sometimes cruel, consequences for many of the people and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Much thought, time and effort has gone into the building up of institutions and procedures and these have been made freely available to those people wishing to use them.  Though there could never be a legal compulsion on any party to use any or all of these procedures, I feel strongly that there ought to be a very strong moral obligation to use the disputesettling machinery before thought is given to ordering strikes, lockouts or pickets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any serious objection in principle to the Industrial Relations Bill which the Minister is introducing today.  Nevertheless, it is a matter of some difficulty to decide how one might approach the discussion of this Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As it stands, this is a Bill which is largely concerned with improving the operation of the Labour Court.  A great many of the provisions in it are <Col N="955" /> details in regard to the operation of the Labour Court.  One could discuss these improvements and the effects they make; one could also discuss the whole function of the Labour Court, and the Minister has done this to some extent in opening the debate.  However, as the Minister has also indicated, this is part of a much wider picture.  It is only one section of what is a problem of quite large scope and great importance in the economy at the present time.</P>
    <P>Accordingly a debate of this type brings in the whole question of industrial relations at every level and on every aspect.  It brings also into question the whole nature of the organisation of Irish industry.  We cannot help but think, as we consider the operation of the Labour Court, what its operation might be in the future, and we cannot help but think not only of the disputes that arise but of what are or might be the deep-seated reasons underlying those disputes.</P>
    <P>Neither can we exclude from our minds the consequences with regard to productivity and economic development of a failure to keep the machinery of conciliation and arbitration and of the settlement of industrial disputes continually up to meeting the changing circumstances in the country generally and in industry in particular.  So there is a certain uncertainty as to which of these things is the most important, which of these aspects should be stressed, in a debate of this type.</P>
    <P>In a way this is almost a reflection of the Bill itself because, having read through this Bill, I certainly got the impression that the Bill itself seems uncertain as to its true role.  I think that the Bill reflects in its present form the rather chequered history which it has had as draft legislation.  We have here a Bill which now, I think, bears the traces of having started out as an attempt to do much more than is in the Bill as it comes to us finally.  So we have here a Bill which might be described as being a little uncertain of its own true role.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it comes to us, is essentially a modification of the Labour Court, its membership and its procedures, but it has a number of other extensions&mdash;welcome <Col N="956" /> but perhaps, as I say, survivors from what might have been a more thoroughgoing piece of legislation.  I do not say this in any sense that it was wrong that the Minister should have modified his original proposals or that the Bill as it reaches us now is necessarily defective.  I agree with what the Minister has said in his opening speech on this Stage of the Bill, that this is certainly in an area in which while we must move we must move slowly, an area in which precipitate action might, indeed, lead to positive disimprovement rather than improvement of the present situation.</P>
    <P>The measures such as the setting up of Rights Commissioners and the provisions in regard to the Arbitration Board are important changes not related to the actual Labour Court itself, but, as I have said already, the Bill has very wide connotations.  It is indeed related to the trade union legislation which is still in the Dáil.  It is related further to the whole question of incomes and prices policy which is a continual matter of discussion but so far not of any very determined action. Admitting these doubts as to how one might tackle the problem, I propose to deal rather briefly with a few of these aspects.  We can, I think, leave to the Committee Stage the details of the modifications of the Labour Court procedure and while merely noting them at this Stage talk a little about the wider context.  This may be held to unduly broaden the debate, not, I may say, Sir, with respect, beyond what is relevant, but beyond what concerns the immediate provisions of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Our problem is that unless we consider this Bill in the wider context we will not be able to judge its effectiveness. The Bill is a difficult one to read.  The order of the sections, the topics which are dealt with, reflect the fact that this is essentially a Bill to amend the Industrial Relations Act of 1946.  I propose in commenting at this stage on its provisions to ignore the order of the sections in the Bill and to group the provisions together in order that we can appreciate what is being done.  There are a number of provisions in the Bill which are largely concerned with the members of the Labour <Col N="957" /> Court and with the Labour Court as such.  There is provision in the Bill to increase the number of ordinary members from four to six and to increase the number of Deputy Chairmen from one to two, and accordingly to enable the Labour Court to increase the number of independent divisions of the Labour Court from two divisions, which is allowable under present legislation, to three divisions.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a welcome provision. The volume of the work and the necessity that the work of the Labour Court should always be handled with the utmost expedition indeed indicates that this is certainly a move in the right direction.  It is an attempt to update after 23 years the original provisions in regard to the Labour Court, but I wonder does it go far enough?  I wonder are three divisions of the Labour Court based in Dublin enough for what will have to be done in future years?  The Minister has indicated&mdash;and I have already said that I agree with him&mdash;that this legislation can only be part of a pattern, only one contribution towards the solution, but it is easy to look at other countries whose history of industrial relations is somewhat better than ours and to look at a single difference between those countries and ours as being the key difference.</P>
    <P>Thus I am sure the Minister and Members of the House have heard it said that a great deal of the success of German industry can be attributed to the fact of the relatively small number of German unions compared with the multiplicity of unions here. We have heard this preached in this country in the context of trade union reform, but I should like to turn to another aspect of the difference between trade union and industrial relations legislation in Germany and this legislation here, not to say that what I am going to point to is the key factor but to point to the fact that it is one of the key factors which, perhaps, have given German industry and the German economy a happier history than our own in the past 20 years. With due allowance for the fact that Germany is a much larger country than this, with a much larger manufacturing industry, nevertheless, this difference <Col N="958" /> of scale does not, I think, fully account for the fact that in Germany there are over 100 local labour courts. In Germany the work of what corresponds to our Labour Court is decentralised, and very thoroughly decentralised, and it is down towards the local community that the first effort of the operation of a labour court or something very close to it exists.  Above this, there are something like ten or 12&mdash;I am not sure but it is of that order&mdash;regional labour courts, one for each of the <i>landes</i> of the Federal Government and, of course, above this a Federal Court of appeal.</P>
    <P>Though the Minister has said that he does not think it right to wait for another 20 years to come back with legislation for further development, I wonder if in view of the volume of work which is being done by the Labour Court, the necessity to have the Labour Court hearings and decisions dealt with at times with very great speed, even at the risk of speeding up work to such an extent that there would be gaps, the Minister should not have gone further in this direction in this devolution from the Labour Court idea of one single Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I wonder, too, if in the operation of the three divisions, the Minister might think in terms of the decentralisation of the Labour Court.  We hope that in the years to come with this Bill governing industrial relations we shall see a very great resurgence or indeed a great increase in industry outside Dublin and the rest of Leinster.  We hope to see the development of our industrial estates in many centres and hope that the move towards industry in smaller centres will not completely die away.</P>
    <P>I wonder if from the point of view of the development of expertise in dealing with the delicate problem of industrial relations that, in fact, experience in dealing with industrial relations problems relating to the Dublin area would really be so valuable in regard to the problems that will arise in other areas, in areas where all the difficulties of the transformation of rural workers to industrial workers will be at their most intense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" /> In this particular provision in regard to the number of members of the court, the Minister has adjusted what was clearly wrong and what clearly showed a weakness in the operation of the court in the past and in the very recent past with regard to the job that it is currently doing.  I wonder if the provision looks sufficiently ahead into what will be the task in the next five or ten years in this respect.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in regard to membership of the court.  There is the very welcome pension scheme for members of the court.  One merely asks why this has been done after 23 years. Surely it should have been dealt with before now, but we are thankful that it has been dealt with.  Luckily, many of those who have given long service to the court are still members and in respect of them this pension scheme is in time.</P>
    <P>There is a change in Section 15 in so far as the annual report of the court no longer goes to the Government but goes, quite appropriately, to the Minister for Labour now that this Department has been established.  This prompts me to say that if one looks at the report of the Labour Court one will see that it is a rather skimpy affair. It may be that the court, as a tribunal, fails and that it can do little more than to give a hard, factual and cold statistical account of what its work has been.</P>
    <P>I wonder, too, about the idea reflected in this legislation that conciliation officers are now to be general industrial relations officers.  The Minister has mentioned that they can amass a great deal of expertise and information. I do not know if this determination not to deal with the necessary and the urgent but to help in the prevention as well as the cure of industrial disputes might not be reflected in the provision requiring that the Labour Court will report to the Minister.  There may well be matters which come to the notice of the Labour Court with regard to practice in other countries and these might not be part of their report.</P>
    <P>It might be as well that the Labour Court should merely bring these matters <Col N="960" /> to the notice of the Minister and that these might as well as included in the report of the Minister's own Department. When I look at the Annual Report of the Court, the only adjective which comes to my mind is &ldquo;skimpy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in regard to membership of the Labour Court and that is that we still have the composition of the Labour Court as purely a representational one&mdash;representations from what are called, tritely, the two sides of industry with a chairman and the deputy chairman appointed by the Minister.  We do not seem yet to have any reflection of the devices which are sometimes used in other countries with regard to appointing expertise assessors of various kinds to assist the court in their deliberation.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed at an early stage in regard to industrial relations legislation.  The court can certainly call on experts for advice on particular points but I wonder if there is not something to be said for the appointment of persons who would act as technical assessors to the Labour Court much in the same way as a judge sitting in an Admiralty case would have a technical assessor to guide him on certain facts.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate to us any views that he may have on this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from provisions dealing with the membership of the Labour Court, there are quite a number of provisions in this Bill concerned with the operation of the Labour Court.  One of these is the renaming of the conciliation officers as industrial relations officers. This represents a coming of age of the work of Labour Court officers.  It represents a degree of maturity and a recognition that there are now conditions for voluntary negotiation and that the Labour Court and its officers are no longer something in the nature of a fire brigade but that they can exercise more valuable functions at an earlier stage.  This provision is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that there are conflicting arguments as to whether it is more appropriate that the Labour Court should investigate in private or in public.  In regard to <Col N="961" /> this I can only say that the drafting of section 8 in this regard is somewhat puzzling.  However, this is a matter that can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Also, in regard to the operation of the court, sections 18, 19 and 20 make certain changes which again we can discuss on the Committee Stage.  Again, one can just at this stage welcome the provisions in section 18 that in fact the court will only investigate after a report by an industrial relations officer and after being requested to do so by the parties is, I think, a welcome provision.  It does not, of course, quite sensibly, leave power to the Labour Court to act in exceptional circumstances and to disregard this particular provision. Section 19 again is, the effect that the Labour Court are not bound to make a recommendation and that it can prudently refrain from making a recommendation it if does not think it is in the interests of good industrial relations to do so and is a very sensible amendment as also is the proposal under section 20 where there is an undertaking by the parties to abide by the decision that the case can be considered as one of high priority.</P>
    <P>The next group of sections which I would like to comment on are those concerned with employment agreements. I think employment agreements are one of the hopes for industrial peace and a gradual movement towards better industrial relations in this country and here we welcome the developments in the Bill in facilitating the operations of the Labour Court in this regard.  The Labour Court has power under the 1946 Act but those are being amended under sections 7, 10, 11 and 12.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise one point, however, in regard to employment agreements.  I would suggest to the Minister that the Labour Court might exercise some function in regard to what might be considered as nonregistered employment agreements. Under the legislation as it exists the position is if an agreement is of a certain type it can be registered and will be enforceable in certain ways.  I wonder if there is not something to be said for a requirement that where there <Col N="962" /> is an employment agreement which is either in the form which is appropriate that it be registered in the Labour Court or that either of the Parties do not wish to have this agreement registered nevertheless this agreement is part of our industrial relations scene. Indeed it is a very definite part of the custom and practice of the particular industry in which the agreement is being made.  I wonder if it would not be advisable that the Labour Court should always be aware of those nonregistered and non-enforceable agreements which are in existence.  If there is not some cases that perhaps there be a requirement that agreements shall we say of a certain degree of formularity that there might not be a requirement here that such agreements, without being registered in the Labour Court, might well be notified to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other changes in regard to the scope of the Labour Court.  In section 17 there is statutory provision in regard to the classes of workers which as far as I can make out is really a re-enactment of the 1955 Act and these give a slight amount of conciliation by wiping out that particular Act.  More important are the provisions in regard to arbitration boards in section 51 and in regard to the ESB Tribunals in section 21.  Here we have an important step.  In regard to the question of arbitration boards the Minister in his speech indicated he hoped that in fact those boards would virtually disappear and that there would be an agreement rather than having those arbitration boards, that the parties who obviously appeared before them might all come before the Labour Court.  He indicated one of the serious objections on behalf of the associations representing employees in this regard was that they would have no say whatsoever even indirectly in the choice of the chairman.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the Minister in the case of certain bodies of employees, notably professional employees, the situation is even more serious than this.  With the structure of our industrial relations machinery professional employees will in fact not only have no say in the choice of <Col N="963" /> the Chairman of the Labour Court but even under what the Minister now proposes will have no say whatsoever, as I see it, in the selection of the worker representatives since a large number of those professional bodies are not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions being affiliated to the Federation of Professional Associations. I think, indeed, Senator Crowley might care to say whether there will be some bodies affiliated to the Irish Congress of Professional Civil Servants Association who are not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and in fact here there is lack of representation.</P>
    <P>It might not be possible in bringing in global legislation to provide for matters of this sort but I think it is something which should not be completely forgotten.  I should like to say here, talking for a moment about my own professional association, the Engineers' Association having worked honestly and fairly with the arbitration machinery which was given to them, unfortunately have got little thanks for it.  The position is that the local authority engineers, having made a claim in February, 1967, to the City and County Managers' Association, a claim which in response to the urgings of the Minister and his colleagues, was based completely on productivity, a claim made on the basis that local authority engineers were entitled to an increase not for status not for differential but that part of the tremendous productivity improvements they had been responsible for should be given to them.  So it was by an arbitrator in July 1968 and approved of by the local authorities, and having gone and made their case in the way in which they were asked to make it, they then find themselves in January, 1969, just after the close of what the Minister for Finance has now indicated was a great bumper year, those persons who had operated their arbitration machinery, were told that the award could not be honoured, that the whole thing must go to a new review board, the whole matter must be considered.  So, they find themselves with promises that the review board would take no more than two months, still without an answer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> I do not want, on the occasion of this Bill, to indulge in any special pleading on behalf of a group to which I belong myself but I want to say amid the larger problems I should not like to think that the Minister would forget there are smaller groups who are important not only in their own eyes but I think objectively so and in any full scheme of industrial relations those groups must not be left to be tagged on at the end.  They must not be left so that somehow they are squeezed into the iron maiden of the legislation that suits the larger industrial scene.  All I can say in this regard is that my own profession at the moment are seriously disturbed over the fact that having acted responsibly in a matter of a dispute of this type, acted with a high degree of restraint they have indeed had little thanks and therefore little incentive for behaving in a similar fashion in the future.  Care should be taken in any disturbance of machinery. The various groups who have been given arbitration and conciliation machinery do not think that it is perfect.  They have indicated to the Minister that they have learned how this machinery works and why, on occasions, they would like to see it operating differently, certainly more speedily, but nevertheless they feel that the Minister should be slow to interfere with this particular method which has evolved.</P>
    <P>In section 21, the Minister is proposing to us the abolition of the ESB Tribunal.  He has indicated that this tribunal is unduly rigid and that it must now be replaced by a better system of negotiation within the ESB. On this point, and on the question of the repeal of the ESB Act, which the Minister is also proposing because he feels there is a substantial hope for better negotiating machinery and better industrial relations in the ESB, it would be in accordance with the Minister's own approach here today to realise that though the Fogarty Report on the ESB recommended the abolition of the ESB Tribunal, it recommended a great deal more.  The Fogarty Report also recommended that there should be a rationalisation in the ESB, not only on the side of the unions but also on the side of management and their personnel <Col N="965" /> department.  The report also recommended the establishment of works committees in the ESB and also direct worker representation on the management of the ESB.  We hope the works committees will be established quickly. The Fogarty Report recommended representation of actual ESB workers on the board of management and not merely trade union representation at board level.</P>
    <P>In regard to matters in the Bill here today, there is one other important provision to which I should like to refer.  I refer to the establishment under sections 13 and 14 of rights commissioners. The Minister has done something good here.  An attempt is being made to separate the largescale dispute concerned with pay and general conditions from the dispute concerned with an individual, or perhaps a few people, with regard to rights which may well be custom and practice at a local level.  This is definitely something to be recommended. As I indicated in my opening remarks on this Bill, it cannot be regarded merely as an amendment to the 1946 Bill.  It must be considered in a wider context.  It is one aspect only of a general problem.</P>
    <P>If we asked ourselves how could we judge whether the Labour Court was successful or not, it would be foolish to do this from any narrow viewpoint. Do we say the Labour Court is successful when they deal with a large number of cases?  Do we say when the Labour Court has a high number of rejections of its awards that such rejections indicate failure?  This is not necessarily so.  It may be that the Labour Court is operating most successfully when dealing with a small number of cases, if in fact such cases are the really difficult ones which could not be level.  It is difficult to find a criterion for judging whether the Labour Court is doing a good job or not.  We must remember that in all industrial relations two systems operate&mdash;the formal legal systems and the informal system, which is often the more effective one. In our industrial relations policy we must have regard for both of these systems.  By legislation we can erect the formal system of industrial relations <Col N="966" /> but account must be taken of the informal relations which exist in industry. If these informal relations are ignored the legislation will become useless. Such legislation can never replace such informal relations.  They must work in close harmony.</P>
    <P>The role of the Labour Court in regard to the incomes policy will be a matter of some difficulty.  The Labour Court, operating in accordance with this Act, certainly has an influence on the incomes policy.  There must be some control of prices and incomes, and there is a real problem in reconciling the true independence of the Labour Court with the necessity to harmonise the work of the Labour Court and the work of any prices and incomes committee.  This Bill is an advance in industrial relations but it is only a small advance on a rather narrow front.</P>
    <P>One finds it hard to avoid clichés in discussing problems of industrial relations.  We can replace the outworn clichés by forming some new phrases. We can look at the work, not only of the Labour Court but also of the Minister's Department, and see that they are demonstrating quite clearly that no longer can we discuss the two sides of industrial problems.  We can replace that cliché by talking about three sides of any industry&mdash;the employees and workers, the managers and owners, and also society and the public which must be protected by the independent members of the Labour Court and by the Minister's Department.  In times of rapid economic growth we often find the traditional enemies of managers and workers in collusion together in certain instances at the expense of society in general.  This must be reflected in the work, not only of the Labour Court, but of the Minister's own Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>We talk of industrial war and industrial peace.  We must remember when we speak in this metaphor that it is possible for war to break out by accident, it is possible that an accident can start a war in an unstable situation, but peace can never be achieved by accident, whether it be peace in world affairs or peace in the family. Peace in our industrial relations is something that can be achieved and <Col N="967" /> maintained only by hard work and by a very determined effort.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister has improved the operation of the Labour Court, and in introducing it he has taken the right line that this is one instrument, one part of the problem, one corner of a large canvas.  I have indicated that perhaps he might have gone a little further a little quicker, but he knows the scene better than I and his judgment may be right.  I hope he will continue to watch this particular problem and not hesitate to come back to us.</P>
    <P>I wish this Bill well.  I congratulate the Labour Court on its tremendous contribution to the economy over the past 23 years and I hope this will be a prelude to still greater services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that every thinking person, certainly all the Parties represented in this House, will welcome this Bill inasmuch as it represents an outline of the Minister's approach, if not to a solution, at least to an improvement in the very complex area of industrial relations.  It is important at the present time to emphasise, even at the risk of repetition, the significance of the far-reaching, vital importance of industrial relations to the future well-being of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal feeling is that this Bill does not go far enough and I can go a long part of the way with Professor Dooge.  At the same time I realise there are impediments and obstacles, some of which appear at the moment to be insuperable, and in this I sympathise with the Minister.  Clearly the Bill is a product of the very uncertain times in which we live.  The Bill has a note of uncertainty in many of its clauses and this is a reflection of the uncertainty of the present day.  The stresses and tensions of modern living, the fierce competition in practically every section of industry, including competition for trained and experienced personnel, all these and other factors, contribute to the restlessness and anxiety which is felt by thousands of people in industry.  This feeling of insecurity and unrest is very clearly and loudly expressed in the hesitancy of so many of our organisations even to approach the Labour Court and it <Col N="968" /> is certainly reflected in the very high percentage of cases in which the recommendations of the court have been rejected.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech, the Minister said that more than half the total number of workers affected by the recommendations of the court are in fact represented by the actual number of rejections by the court.  Of course that it is a very serious position. Despite this fact, speaking as one who has had the experience of using the machinery of the court at every level, I wish to place on record that I do not think that this is a reflection on the efficacy or usefulness of the court. It is attributable to something more remote, something that perhaps we cannot identify, but I do not think it is any indication of failure of the fundamental purpose for which the court was established in the first instance and which has done a remarkably good job over a long period of years.  I consider that the 1946 Act and the establishment of the Labour Court and its existence ever since has been more than justified by the results it has produced.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Labour Court was a unique experiment.  During that period I attended at various conferences in England and elsewhere where the establishment of the court was referred to as a bold experiment on the part of the Irish people.  Its work during the years has been closely watched and studied by many people in other countries which still lack this type of social machinery.  I do not think for a moment that even with the high percentage of cases in which the court's recommendations are still rejected that this is an indictment of the court itself or any reflection on its usefulness.</P>
    <P>I remember the late Tom Johnson, one of the original members, describe the court's functions as a court of expediency and I doubt if that interpretation could be improved.  It must remain and continue to be a court of expediency.  It must deal with the many issues and problems of today and it cannot obviously lay down in advance guidelines and principles on which all cases can be decided.  The court is one of the most useful institutions established <Col N="969" /> by this State and I am anxious to ensure that nothing is said, either in this House or elsewhere, and certainly nothing should be done, that would in any way endanger the fabric of the court or cast any doubt or reflection on its service and usefulness to the community.</P>
    <P>Indeed I welcome this Bill because I can see that it will improve the efficacy and usefulness of the court as it stands.  I welcome it also because I believe that it is time the present machinery of the court and its <i>modus operandi</i> should be reviewed after some 22 or 23 years in practice and that we should take advantage of the defects which may have become apparent during that time and try to write into this Bill some type of wellthought-out idea or plan that will correct those deficiencies where they appear, and try to ensure that they do not occur in future.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the court that I have always felt is very important was and still is that the court, this court in particular, should be seen to be absolutely independent.  It is equally important, of course, that it must be seen to be an impartial body, and above all else that it is completely free from even the remotest possibility of any form of influence either from the Government or the Minister for Labour or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Since the court moved over to its new headquarters, I have been in that building a number of times and one impression I have got&mdash;and this is purely an impression which I mention because it may perhaps help&mdash; from speaking to a number of people like myself using the court's machinery was that there may be a possible danger of the Labour Court itself becoming too closely identified with the Department of Labour, which is a comparatively new Department.  Though I do not see an immediate solution to it, and I know perfectly well that the functions of the court are obviously of the deepest concern to the Department, it might be better if the court were housed independently in some other building other than that of the Department. I say that genuinely by way of a suggestion, and nothing else.  I for <Col N="970" /> one am perfectly satisfied that the court has never been influenced, and I have never seen even the slightest evidence that it has been influenced, but it is important that we should take care to make sure that no finger would ever be pointed at the court.  I throw out this suggestion, for what it is worth, for that reason.</P>
    <P>The Bill will commend itself to all sides of this House, and I do not propose to dwell any longer on the principles on which it rests, but merely to select a couple of things in connection with a few sections of it.  Under section 2, the Minister is making provision for the expansion of the court, and, like Senator Dooge, my only question on this is whether he has gone far enough. I can also fully appreciate that as of this moment the Minister feels that he has gone quite far enough, and I could probably agree with him on that point, but I also feel that on this section he could well leave himself a little more room for even further expansion at some later date, because I believe that the new court, when it comes into being and starts to work along the lines on which it is being guided by this Bill, may well find that even the three sections provided for now will prove to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>We have had experience in the past, as I am sure the Minister will agree, of disputes, some very urgent and important, where they have had to stand in the queue and wait for the court. We have had that more than once. Similarly we have also had, not frequently but on a number of occasions, the court criticised because of its failure or inability to issue recommendations within a reasonable time.  Consequently if the court is now being expanded to cater for a lot more people than it has catered for in the past it would seem only fair and reasonable that we should take the opportunity here within the section to enable the Minister to expand the court further in the future.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I should like to see more decentralisation.  I think that there is an unanswerable case for one of the sections at least of the court to be based somewhere in the provinces, for instance, in Cork or Limerick, where it could deal with local disputes more <Col N="971" /> promptly than it is in a position to do at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that some provision is being made, even after a quarter of a century, for superannuation for the existing members of the court.  I certainly will not criticise that section of the Bill or offer any further comment on it except to make one small point: I am not quite clear whether I am on sure ground here, but one of the original members of the court, a colleague of mine to whom I have already referred, the late Tom Johnston, gave a great deal of thought and a lot of service to this country in many capacities, and without decrying his efforts on the national scene I venture to say that his most valuable contribution to the country was in accepting membership of the original Labour Court when it was established in 1946, and the long years of service he gave to it subsequently.  I believe I am right in saying that when Tom Johnson died there was no provision for superannuation, and we have to live with the unpleasant fact that this is so and that his widow is still alive.  I strongly appeal to the Minister that, unless some provision is already somewhere in this Bill, which I cannot perceive, Mrs. Johnson should benefit and should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>Skimming roughly through the sections of the Bill, I should like to refer to section 8 which states that an investigation of a trade dispute by the court shall be conducted in private.  May I say that the use of this word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; ought to be dropped.  I should prefer to see it as &ldquo;shall normally&rdquo; or &ldquo;may normally be conducted in private.&rdquo; I think that this is putting undue emphasis on the ability or the function of the court to hear most if not all cases in private, and I would suggest that the wording of the section might be looked at before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge has dealt with the major aspect of section 9 but there is one aspect which I do not think he referred to and it is this: now that the Civil Service organisations are not being brought directly under the court itself but provision is being made in <Col N="972" /> this Bill for members of the court to become involved in the examination and remuneration problems and all the rest of it in Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration schemes, this is a rather important point.</P>
    <P>The point is that at the present time the Civil Service organisations of workers have a say in the selection of the chairman and they also have a right to nominate their own two representatives to reach Arbitration Board So far so good.  Now, this Bill provides that in addition to the two representatives of the staff unions on the arbitration board, the arbitration board will be expanded to include both workers' and employers' representatives for the Labour Court.  As far as I am aware, up to now the position has been that where agreement was not found possible on a particular case before the Civil Service Arbitration Board, the chairman had the right in fact to arrive at a decision and that decision became automatically binding on all parties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is unlikely but it is conceivable and is a distinct possibility. We could well have a situation in which the two representatives of the Labour Court, employer and union, together with the management side representatives on the arbitration board, could outvote the remaining two union representatives.  That would be fatal.  That possibility could be completely ruled out by this Bill and I suggest that when amendments are being drawn up to the agreed arbitration scheme that some provision should be contained in those amendments to ensure that all decisions of the arbitration board should only be binding when the members are unanimous and if they are not unanimous that the ruling should still be left to the chairman of the court rather than to a vote of the members of the board.</P>
    <P>This provision could be vital to the future of industrial relations and is something which the Minister should have a look at, not necessarily before this Bill is passed but in any amended regulations that may be made at civil service level for agreed arbitration or conciliation machinery.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of this Bill deals with <Col N="973" /> the appointment of a rights commissioner, as he is termed, by the Minister in the Bill.  Personally, I welcome this innovation.  I always regarded it as an extension of the present conciliation services provided by the court and I consider it to be very necessary.  As a trade union offical I found myself on one occasion in a position in which my executive was willing and anxious to submit a certain question to arbitration. Our difficulty was that we could not get an arbitrator and I remember asking that the question of arbitration be solved by asking the Labour Court to appoint an arbitrator. However, when I went to the Labour Court, I discovered that no official of the court would be permitted to act as an arbitrator.  Therefore, I consider the appointment of a rights commissioner as a very good idea and one way in which the difficulty I have pointed out can be limited in the future.</P>
    <P>Most people do not realise the tremendous contribution made by the Labour Court through its conciliation service to the maintenance of industrial peace in this country during a long number of years.  They have no conception of the amount of work done by the court every day of the year.  Thousands of people go to the conciliation officers about whom we hear nothing and from my own experience and from the experience of practically every other trade unionist in the country, I consider the work done at conciliation to be even more useful than that which is done even by the court itself in full session.</P>
    <P>During a period of 23 or 24 years I have had experience of various conciliation officers of the court.  All of them are very good men and I am glad to have this opportunity of paying a tribute to them.  I am glad, also, to have the opportunity of saying that the present man who up to recently was known as the chief conciliation officer has played an outstanding part in the industrial life of this country for a long number of years.  If men of that calibre can be attracted to the service of the court then I can say without any hesitation that there is great hope for the solution of the <Col N="974" /> problem of industrial relations in this country.  I am glad the Minister has made provisions in the Bill for the employment of industrial relations officers.  This is a profession for which very few people are suited.  In assessing ability for this profession it is not book learning that counts but rather it is the ability to understand people and to understand their problems.</P>
    <P>In so far as I can judge, this Bill does not make any provision for anything in the nature of a research unit. This is one type of machinery that is sadly lacking in this country.  Some provision should have been made in the Bill for the setting up of this type of service.  To my mind that should be a normal part of the function of the Labour Court and, in particular, of the Labour Court of the future. Perhaps if the Minister cannot do something about this in this Bill he may be able to make provision for it elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In common with Professor Dooge, it is my opinion that far too much time has been allowed to elapse since the last Industrial Relations Act was passed.  We should have amended legislation of this type at far more frequent intervals in the future particularly because of developments in industry and, indeed, outside it.  We shall have to face up to the necessity for frequent revision of the conditions in which the Labour Court itself is expected to work.  The court should not be looked upon by the employers, as it has been in the past, as a sort of smoke screen and something to hide behind which enables them to refuse to enter into meaningful discussions until the two parties have been through a painful process of elimination.  I am glad that in future the court will be a much more authoritative body.</P>
    <P>I regard the Bill, therefore, as a commendable effort to deal with at least an aspect of this vast, complex problem of industrial relations which is probably the most important of all the problems facing this country at the present time.  Anything we can do in this House, or outside it for that matter, to eradicate some of the errors of the past or, for that matter, some of the weakness in this Bill, will be <Col N="975" /> a real service both for the country and for every section of its citizens. I hope every section of the Bill will be thoroughly examined on its passage through this House and that it will be criticised constructively where necessary and amended where desirable.  On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister's patient but intelligent approach to at least an improvement of the problems the Bill proposes to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand we are taking the Second Reading of the Repeal of the ESB Act in conjunction with the Second Reading of the Industrial Relations Bill.  I welcome the fact the ESB Bill is now being erased from the list of statutes of the Oireachtas.  I think it is appropriate that that legislation should go by the board in conjunction with the introduction of the Industrial Relations Bill in the Seanad. I do not propose to go into the history of it in detail but I should like to recall that the individual who is no longer in a very key position, responsible originally for the introduction of this penal legislation, left a legacy which has caused tremendous disruption in industry generally throughout the country.  This individual in the Dáil was advised on numerous occasions that repressive legislation would not work and could not be effective in present day conditions.  In spite of that, against the advice of the majority of Members of the other House and against the advice of Congress and others outside, that legislation was enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find?  As a result of it, the efficiency of reasonably good trade unions was damaged because of the inhibiting effect of this type of penal legislation.  It made trade union officials, who are cautious people generally, still more cautions and gave the impression to the worker, the man who was there to represent them, that the trade union official was now being tied up by this legal Act of the Dáil with the result that the worker, the rank and file, went elsewhere to get his leadership.  He went outside the trade union and formed what is now described as an unofficial group.  Those <Col N="976" /> unofficial groups were responsible for bringing an air of sanity into the field of industrial relations because no matter what this House or the other House thought of the legislation going through, and how efficient its enactment could be, when the temper of the worker is aroused the legislation can go to hell because he will have his rights.</P>
    <P>We have the pathetic sight of a Minister of State applying reprehensive legislation against workers one day and the next day his colleagues sending up taxis to Mountjoy, bringing them cups of tea and bringing them home at 12 o'clock at night&mdash;all unofficial. I have heard a Senator in this House, who is a responsible man in the trade union, saying the courts' expediency is what counts.  If that is the type of expediency which runs through industrial relations, I am afraid we are building on a very wrong platform, on a very bad foundation.</P>
    <P>It has been said here and in the other House that there are people who want to legislate for many years ahead on a clear cut issue: &ldquo;Let us get the workers into seven or eight unions like we had in Nazi Germany.  let us have eight or ten unions.  It is very efficient over there&rdquo;.  We do not go to look at Yugolavia at all.  We can look at the neighbouring country.  We are told by the Minister for Labour that he does not think the Irish people would accept what takes place in Yugoslavia as a blueprint, but he feels we will accept what takes place in what is still Nazi Germany, to a great extent.  I do not think so.  I think there is a rapid change in the mentality of the people.  The one thing we can be sure of today is that change is the dominant factor in our society.</P>

      <P>To get back now to the interpretation which has been placed on the Minister's idea of what is good in industrial relations at the present time, I should like to say at this stage, with regard to the setting up of the straitjacket which would be imposed on the community for a period of years, that I believe it would only lead to trouble and possibly to disaster between the worker and employer The uncertainty which has been referred to by other speakers here is something which will be with us for years.  There is no longer any certainty in this life or in its systems, ideas or existing structures.  There is a search and an inquiry going on all the time.  There is a change.  Any attempt at legislation to hold the position as it is now would, in my opinion, be the height of foolishness.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that there is suspicion on the part of workers at the Government's attempt to improve the situation in regard to industrial relations. It would appear that the Minister is surprised and hurt that more confidence is not shown in the Government Such an attitude on the part of the Minister displays a lack of reality.  The Government should not believe that the worker should have confidence at the present time in its approach to the welfare of the worker.  I am talking about Governments as I have known them for years past.  The biggest employer in this State today is the Government.  When we consider their approach to industrial relations and the approach of their appointees, is it any wonder that we have trouble with regard to general enterprise and industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three or four major concerns such as CIE, the ESB and the Post Office which between them employ vast numbers of workers.  It cannot be <Col N="981" /> denied that the standard of industrial relations in these State sectors is worse than those in any other industrial sector of the community.  I noted some of the Minister's comments on the workers.  He referred to the ESB and spoke of &ldquo;the ESB and its employees.&rdquo; The Minister's statement opens a window to his mind because it would appear that he looks on the ESB as some kind of industrial concern run on the lines of, perhaps, Clerys or Waterford Glass Limited.  The ESB belongs to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It belongs to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB are run by employees of the people through the Government.  They are no more employers than a workers' co-operative should be, because the people who man the administrative end of the ESB should be looked on as workers in that capacity and as administrators, but not as bosses.  It is very hard to get this point across to the people who have spent many years looking at the picture from the other side.  We must get it into the heads of people who are put on these State boards that they are workers and not just industrialists taken in from outside and given a special safe position where they can act in an arrogant way with their fellow employees at the bottom of the scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is industrial relations in its simplest form.  The system of communication and of getting to know and understand fellow workers does not exist in the higher echelons of these semi-State concerns.  There is more concern now among private enterprise in the industrial world in looking after their workers.  They are paternalistic towards them.  They are aware of the need of looking after the workers and of this trend of regarding a worker as a human being.  In outside industry a boss might perhaps go along to the &ldquo;local&rdquo; for a drink with the boys and feel that he is giving the employees a feeling of sharing in the welfare of the factory.  That feeling is there in the private sector for the good reason that profits are involved and the future of the firm is at stake.  Because of the changed viewpoint of the worker in <Col N="982" /> private industry, the employer has been forced to modernise his attitude and to become more civilised in his approach towards the employee.  There is no such incentive on the part of those who are in the upper echelons of State or semi-State concerns.</P>
    <P>The private motive does not arise there in the sense that the firm is going to be out the door if the worker does not play ball.  Consequently, those in charge in the ESB, CIE and elsewhere are quite ready, at the drop of a hat, to impose sanctions to achieve their will and that is what we have had all along the line.  No private employer would dare to take the action that was taken by Deputy Childers in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and in his capacity as Minister for Transport and Power because his concern would go to rack and ruin. These people who are put in as nominees of a particular Minister have no conception of what true staff relations are like.  They proceed in the out-dated style to which they were used before they are brought in and given these major jobs in State and semi-State concerns.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt that the workers' suspicions of Government interference in regard to their pay packets or their conditions of work are justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I understand it, has now set up two bodies to examine the pay packets of the lower paid workers and the lower paid civil servants.  In this field I presume he expects to have the confidence of the lower paid clerical workers in the membership of these particular committees which he has established.  The membership of these committees are pets of the Government; their concern is the status quo.  It is an extraordinary situation that you have this plea: Let's do something about the lower paid worker; it is wrong.  It is agreed he has not got a fair deal but why should this appeal be made in the form of charity.  I see nothing wrong with a down to earth fight, if necessary, to improve the conditions of the lower paid worker instead of this type of behind the scenes negotiation and this pretence that there <Col N="983" /> is an investigation into his work going on.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley put his finger on the major item missing in this proposed legislation: the facilities for research and examination of the work content performed by people who are now described as lower paid workers.  I could give one example here of what is described as a lower paid worker and how he will be treated under this new examination which is to be carried out.  I refer to the postmaster in the public service who is responsible for 24 post offices, a big exchange and the dispersement of thousands of pounds per week in social welfare benefits.  In any provincial town you will find that the postmaster has a smaller pay than an unpromoted bank clerk in the same town, who has no responsibility except to buy his set of golf clubs, get time off and hope for plenty of sunshine so that he can go out and play.  Twenty-five years ago the post office clerk, never mind the postmaster, and the bank clerk had the same pay, but now the post office clerk has less than half of what comparable outside groups are earning.  The Minister is setting up a committee to investigate increased salaries without carrying out any research into the actual work content.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to avoid major troubles before it is too late he should bring over the Pay Research Unit, which was employed by the Quinn Tribunal to examine the work content of the ESB clerical groups, to examine the work content of one public service, namely, the post office.  It is no good talking to a man and saying: The State cannot afford to give you this if the work he is doing compares in skill and standard to other groups which are earning one and a half to two times his salary.  I do not want to use this Bill as a vehicle in bringing to light particular injustices in the situation and I will limit myself as much as possible.</P>

      <P>The Bill has been described as a limited step forward. Perhaps it is.  There are certainly many good provisions in the Bill, but again I, personally, am suspicious of attempts at legislation&mdash;just like the majority of workers outside are&mdash;which are slanted all the time in favour of the employer. It is all very fine to say that if there is an agreement reached it is binding and that the employer who breaks the agreement, the same as the trade union, can be penalised.  On the face of it that looks as if justice has been exercised and that the employer will be penalised just the same as the worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing we all forget is that if the worker does not carry out his agreement he is going to suffer.  He will be penalised through the provisions of the Bill itself, but if the employer fails to carry out the provisions how is he going to suffer?  It may be said that the fine imposed on him is going to be a penalty.  My belief as far as the employer is concerned is that he would be wise to accept whatever recommendation is made by the Labour Court and abide by it because within twenty-four hours of implementing an agreement which specifically affects wages or conditions he can up the price of his commodity and he wins, the worker loses and society, in the person of the consumer, loses also, so that though there may be an advance on the one <Col N="985" /> front in this, you are civilising the present position, until the prices at the other end are controlled.  I do not think that this will have any great impact as far as the community is concerned.</P>
    <P>All down the years&mdash;and I am sure that experienced trade union people will agree with me in this&mdash;when they have succeeded after a costly fight in obtaining a just increase for their members within a particular industry, within a week the cost of the article made by the particular factory shoots up so that the industrialist is not at the losing end of the stick&mdash;it is the worker and the community in general.  In the private enterprise jungle we live in, unless there is a restriction placed on that employer after an agreement on wages is made as far as a price increase in the commodity is concerned this legislation is ineffective.  That is why apart altogether from the research unit which has been referred to as missing you must also have the question of price brought in under this legislation.  The employer is going to use the existing machinery but it entails an increase in prices of commodities if he is beaten in the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>My experience, and I am sure that many other people are in the same boat, is that in the last few years there has been a fantastic increase in everything from a thimble to an anchor. The Minister and the Government may say that there has only been a certain increase in items which go to make up the cost of living and we could have many discussions on what should compose the list of articles making up the cost of living but even within the last month I saw a good example of an item as far as a man is concerned&mdash;to get your suit sponged and pressed overnight the cost went up from 9d to 1s. As far as these manufacturers, industrialists and wholesalers are concerned every opportunity they get in the chaos or the confusion that follows a pay rise they have slipped up their price tags on every possible item they can get away with.  I am told that there is supposed to be some group working in the Department of Industry and Commerce to keep an eye on prices.  It may be that they watch the price of flour or the loaf or something else but they are <Col N="986" /> not in a position under present circumstances to put a halt to the activity of these people when they raise the cost of living so much after a just pay increase has been given to the workers.  It is one use of the big stick.  Indeed now we hear prominent speakers going around the country and saying that this idea of giving an increase in wages will mean a further increase in the price of the goods.  Why should it?  Does the employer, the manufacturer, want complete freedom from investigation into his prices?  He wants at this stage a restriction on the worker, and discipline as far as wage demands are concerned, but the same employer does not want restriction at all when it comes to putting another penny or twopence on an article at the wholesale or construction stage of his commodity.</P>

      <P>Does the Senator think that wages should keep going up and up and nothing happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that prices should keep going up.  It is a matter of one chasing the other.  Wages must go up and the demand must be there from the worker for the money to pay for the commodities.  If the cost of the commodity is going to be allowed to go up indiscriminately then the worker must follow it by increases in wages.  I think that it is logical that a halt must be called to increases in prices.  The argument put at this stage is that you are restricting private enterprise and you are going to stop the drive and the energy displayed by our young boards of directors but I do not think so.  I do not think they should have that outlook at all.  Further, I believe myself that while I believe the Minister personally to be sincere in his intentions as far as this Bill is concerned, the key to a lot of the trouble lies in the lack of control exercised on the finished item or on the price of the goods which the manufacturer sells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Bill deals with industrial relations outside of wages there is a lot to be said for its provisions. In that regard I would like to comment on the Minister's new machinery to which he refers in his statement for the settlement of certain kinds of disputes.  They are disputes which <Col N="987" /> refer to discipline and dismissals.  The Minister said that many of these find their way to the Labour Court.  I can assure the Minister that many of these do not find their way to the Labour Court or any other form of court, but if it means now that the provisions of this Bill will help to improve the conditions as far as the worker is concerned in all categories&mdash;not alone in the industrial field but in state and semi-State bodies and the Government service&mdash;then good work has been done by the Minister.  I refer, of course, to the appointment of rights commissioners who may be a form of industrial ombudsman whose job would be to deal fearlessly with injustices where-ever they are found.  Unless this Bill embraces all workers, I think the Minister is losing out very much on this appointment.  It is restricting the basis far too much if he is going to say that because there is an objection at this stage by certain people to utilise the Labour Court, that because they do not utilise the court the workers in the State body or in the Civil Service should therefore be deprived of the right of access to an industrial ombudsman. I wonder would the Minister comment on that when he is replying? Does it mean that workers who at the present time are part of C and A will still be deprived of access to a grievance officer or an ombudsman on the lines suggested by the Minister in this Bill?</P>
    <P>I know that he is hoping to get agreement from Civil Service groups who have C and A machinery at their disposal to come in and take part in the Labour Court.  I may say too that in the limited experience I have of the trade union movement from inside a minority group that the feeling of many people with whom I have contact is that the Labour Court is the proper place for all and I think that the view expressed in the other House by speakers for the Opposition was that the Labour Court should be open to everybody in this State.  The more bodies we have, the more arbitrators we have, the more confusion we shall have.  There is no question that because you have a big number of arbitrators looking after different groups you have <Col N="988" /> a pause and a delay in the implementation of recommendations and that, in turn, leads to further dissatisfaction.  By the time that one group has got through with the goodwill of the arbitrator the next group that got through earlier is looking for a further round.  I see nothing wrong at all about access to the Labour Court for the Civil Service associations.  The Minister has stated, and I hope he will not say again that I am misquoting him, that a small minority are living in the past and that they rely on trade union ideas and attitudes which may have been appropriate for an age that is now past.</P>
    <P>When referring to that group does the Minister mean that they are the group who wish to hang on to an outmoded scheme?  Perhaps that is the group he is referring to when he says they are in the minority.  There is something wrong somewhere because if they are in the minority they are representative of a huge percentage of the lower paid workers in the State and semi-State concerns.  They have refused point blank to accept the Minister's suggestion to participate in the Labour Court.  They would appear to be that group whom the Minister refers to as living in the past.  The Minister should understand that many of the spokesman for existing Civil Service associations, excellent men though they may be, they are those most anxious to hold on to the system that they know best.  That is human nature.  The rank and file in this public service are not aware of the changes which the Minister proposes to bring in and of the advantages that would accrue to them in the event of such changes being accepted.</P>

    <Title>Shipping Investment Grants Bill, 1968    (Certified Money Bill) :   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a statutory basis for the scheme of investment grants for ships which was announced some time ago.  The Bill will enable grants to be <Col N="989" /> paid to Irish shipowners in respect of approved capital expenditure incurred on either the provision of new ships or the conversion of existing ships.  The level of grants will be up to 25 per cent of the expenditure eligible for grant purposes.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to help Irish shipowners in the present highly-competitive conditions in the shipping industry. Their main foreign competitors enjoy State aid either by way of outright grants or favourable financing terms for capital investment.  For example, Irish shipowners are in direct competition with British shipowners, both on the cross-Channel and deep sea trades and here the lack of State assistance for Irish shipowners assumed more immediate importance with the operation from January, 1966 of a British scheme of investment grants which provides grants for new ships or the conversion of existing ships. Accordingly Irish shipowners sought the introduction of a corresponding scheme of State assistance.  The present measure provides for assistance to Irish shipowners on a similar scale to that available to British shipowners.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers Irish-owned ships above a certain size operating in the coastal, cross-Channel and foreign trades in competition with foreign ships and engaged on normal shipping operations.  Fishing vessels, for which special grants and other financing facilities are available through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and tugs, dredgers and other vessels not employed in normal shipping operations, are excluded from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an island nation we are almost totally dependent on sea transport both for imports and exports and the importance to the general economy of an up-to-date and expanding Irish-owned merchant fleet is obvious.  Our economic well-being depends in large measure on the shipping facilities available to us and the national interest demands that as much as possible of the trade to and from this country should be carried in Irish-owned vessels. If some action were not taken now to put Irish shipowners in a comparable position as regards State aid <Col N="990" /> to that of their main competitors, the inevitable result would be that the Irish fleet would contract.</P>
    <P>At the very time when tremendous technological advances in the design and construction of vessels are taking place there would be no encouragement to Irish shipowners to take advantage of these various developments which are geared to achieve lower operating costs.  The shipping industry also provides an essential service in its own right.  While earning considerable amounts of foreign exchange it preserves within the economy a very large part of our shipping transport costs Again, a healthy, thriving shipping industry has a high strategic value in the event of an interruption of international shipping in periods of world crisis.</P>
    <P>Sea transport in all its aspects is undergoing a revolution directed at modernising and rationalising the shipping industry and thereby reducing costs.  This whole process of modernisation, aimed as it is at reducing unit costs, will, of course, help our export industries and enhance their competitiveness. Modernisation inevitably demands increased investment in new and more efficient ships and equipment. The low level of profitability experienced by shipping companies here and throughout the world for some years past has reduced the resources available for re-investment.  Because of the absence of adequate profits, replacement of ageing vessels has had to be deferred.  Unfortunately, this deferment undermined the competitive position of the companies concerned because the more modern replacement vessels are much more economic in operation.</P>
    <P>The need for modernisation is exemplified by the case of the B &amp; I Company which is replacing its uneconomic passenger vessels by new car-ferry vessels and converting its conventional cargo services to unit load operation.  The increasing trend towards bulk carriers and container ships in the deep-sea trade has obliged Irish Shipping Ltd. to consider the reorganisation of its fleet.  The company is disposing of a number of its older and less economic vessels and they recently <Col N="991" /> brought into service a 34,000-ton deadweight bulk carrier.  In addition, they have on order two 29,000-ton deadweight bulk carriers one of which will be built at Verolme Cork Dockyard.</P>
    <P>The technological and other developments referred to are pressing even more heavily on the resources of the smaller companies.  It is most important that these smaller companies should be in a position to modernise their fleets and compete more effectively in an industry so largely regulated by the economies of scale.  I feel sure that the assistance provided for in this Bill will be particularly advantageous to the smaller Irish shipping companies as a supplement to their investment resources.  Because of their inability to finance new tonnage some Irish owners in recent years have sold ships without buying replacements and have been forced to charter foreign vessels.  The availability of a grant of 25 per cent of the capital cost should be a very real incentive to replace worn-out vessels and to modernise and re-equip existing vessels where this is practicable.</P>
    <P>Depreciation is a heavy item in the operating cost of a vessel and the payment of a grant would reduce the annual depreciation charge by one quarter.  Technological advances in ship construction are such that it is now necessary to provide for the full writeoff of the capital cost of a vessel over a much shorter period than heretofore and the relief afforded by a grant should go a long way towards offsetting the shorter economic life of a new vessel.  At present the only concession enjoyed by shipowners which might assist them in financing fleet investment is the Shipping Investment Allowance of 40 per cent of the capital costs of a new ship which is available under the income tax code.  This allowance is available for offset against profits and is in addition to the normal wear and tear allowance so that over the full life of a ship allowances of 140 per cent of the ship's cost can be offset against profits.  In practice, however, this concession has been of little practical value to shipowners because the pretax profits earned by them have been <Col N="992" /> too low.  With the introduction of the scheme of investment grants for ships it is proposed to discontinue the special Shipping Investment Allowance of 40 per cent in a case where a grant is paid.  This change involves legislative action which will be taken by the Minister for Finance at the next suitable opportunity.  Payment of a grant will provide a direct financial benefit for the shipowner and in planning the purchase of a new vessel or the conversion of an existing one he will be able to take account of the grant and to access precisely the effect of the grant in reducing the operating costs of the vessel and in improving the return on his own investment.  Up to this Irish shipowners, unlike their counterparts in other sectors of industry, have not had available to them any direct State assistance.  This has been a severe handicap in such a capital-intensive industry.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that grants will not be payable in respect of the acquisition of second-hand ships.  The object of the scheme is to achieve modernisation of the fleet and this can be done only by the introduction of new ships incorporating the latest methods and equipment. The whole object would be defeated by the purchase of second-hand out-dated vessels.  I should mention that with the technological developments now taking place in ship construction existing vessels are becoming obsolete more rapidly than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill are largely self-explanatory and call for little comment by way of explanation.  The main provision is that a grant of up to 25 per cent of the capital expenditure involved may, under certain conditions, be paid in respect of the acquisition of a new ship or the conversion of an existing ship.  Conversion might take the form of, for example, adaptation for carrying containers or change-over from dry cargo to tanker.  Significant additions of a capital nature will also be eligible for a grant, for example, replacement of the main propelling machinery or main boilers.  Capital expenditure on containers will also, subject to certain conditions, be eligible for grant payment, provided that the <Col N="993" /> containers are related to the purchase or conversion of a ship in respect of which a grant has been approved.  In accordance with Section 5 the scheme will be retrospective to 1st April, 1967. This retrospection is designed to offset to some degree the disadvantageous position of Irish shipowners <i>vis-à-vis</i> their British competitors who have benefited from a similar scheme since January, 1966.  There is also provision for appropriate penalties for offences under the Bill.  These provisions are normal in a Bill of this type.  Section 12 (2) provides for the making of an Order to bring the Bill into operation. This provision is necessary because some time will be required following the enactment of this Bill to enable arrangements for the administration of the scheme of grants to be settled.</P>
    <P>The cost of the scheme will depend on the response received from the shipowners and in the current year a sum of £2.464m. has been provided in the Vote for my Department.  This sum provides for sums which will become due for payment under the retrospective provisions of the Bill.  It is not possible to forecast the level of expenditure in future years but it is unlikely to be as high as that for the current year.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not confine the payment of grant to cases where the vessel is built or the work is done in this country.  Such a restriction would be impracticable because, by reason of the delivery dates required or inability to handle the work, it might not be possible for Irish shipyards to undertake a particular contract.  However, I am most anxious that the scheme should benefit the shipbuilding industry here and before approval for the payment of a grant for a ship to be built abroad is given I will require to be satisfied that there are good and sufficient reasons why the work cannot be done here.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the scheme will result in an increase in the total tonnage on the Irish Register, and will provide a valuable incentive to Irish shipowners to expand and modernise their fleets.  Inquiriese made by them of my Department indicate that they are eager to avail of the opportunity which <Col N="994" /> is now being presented to them.  The scheme should also result in a more efficient shipping service, with lower unit costs, being available.  This should prove particularly beneficial to our export trade on which our economy so heavily depends.  Another valuable effect of the new scheme is that it should lead to additional work for the Irish shipbuilding industry.  In fact, I can now tell you that the B and I Company ship, which will be eligible for the grant, is now nearing completion at the Verolme Dockyard and work has commenced in that yard for a bulk carrier for Irish Shipping Limited.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House we endorse this Bill but I must say in my own case with some qualms.  However, before coming to that I should like to ask a question with regard to the timing of the Bill.  I gather the Bill is a matter of some considerable urgency in relation to the B and I.  First of all, the Bill is retrospective to a date in 1967 and I gather it is going in fact to effect payment to the B and I of grants in relation to the purchase of ships by that company back to two years ago.  If it is thought such payment should be made, and one can see the argument for it, why has it taken two years to get to the point of bringing in this legislation so that it has to be retrospective for such a period, which is contrary to normal practice?  It is somewhat undesirable that we in this year should have to find capital relating back to an investment which took place even several years ago.</P>
      <P>Indeed, if we take the timing of the Bill itself it was introduced in the other House on the 25th March, which is about six or seven weeks ago.  I am wondering why it has taken so long to come to us here in view of the urgency involved.  The Minister explained the need for this Bill as being related to a competitive situation in other countries. This is a familiar argument.  Indeed, there are many aspects of our economy where we find ourselves in competition with other countries, endeavouring to attract or develop industry in some shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> Some of our industrial grants are required not simply to stimulate growth in this country, taken in isolation, but because other countries offer such facilities and we have to compete.  If we did not compete and provide at least as good facilities we would not attract new industries.  Indeed, in view of some of the natural disadvantages of our rather isolated position we have perhaps to do better than other countries. Nevertheless, the argument is one at which I must look with care.  I could not quite follow the Minister's reasoning here where he referred to the fact that in Britain there is a 40 per cent investment allowance.  He seemed to be equating this grant to such an allowance, that is to say, the reason given for the Bill is there exists this competitive situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain. For example, Irish shipowners are in direct competition with British shipowners. Then he goes on to mention this 40 per cent investment allowance, the implication being you have to have this 25 per cent grant to put our shipowners in a competitive position with British shipowners.  Then, later on, the Minister says we have got in fact an investment grant.  I may not be right about the exact figures with regard to Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I was reading too quickly for the Senator.  The British have been giving a 20 per cent grant and then a 25 per cent grant I think it is now 20 per cent.  I was refer ring to our shipping investment allowance, not the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  I misunderstood the Minister.  This is a British grant system similar to what is in the Bill, not a British investment grant.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my fault for not following the Minister more carefully.  Will the Minister say what in fact is the British investment grant at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was put back to 20 per cent.  Having been 20 <Col N="996" /> per cent and then 25 per cent it is now back to 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  So, the difference between their grants and ours is not in fact very great and they can then be fairly equated.  That answers my first point.  In the Minister's speech in the Dáil he seemed to refer to a British 25 per cent grant in relation to the British Railways car ferry ships and this confused me.  Perhaps the 25 per cent being put back to 20 per cent happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what particular grant the car ferry ships got but they got a grant in 1966 of either 20 per cent or 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection was that the Minister said it was 25 per cent.  Anyhow, it is of that order of magnitude so the two can be equated.  Now, we have an investment allowance at the moment.  The Minister said that this is in practice of little value because of the low profits earned. He said it would be removed at the earliest possible opportunity.  Could he be clear about the removal of this allowance?  Does it mean the Minister is giving notice now that it will be retrospectively removed from the date this grant is payable, that is back to 1967 or is it going to be the case that people are going to retrospectively get this grant back to 1967 and also have had the investment allowance over the same period up to some future date when they will all be changed?  I am not quite clear about the time scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure about negotiations in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that people like the B and I, who bought ships in 1967, could in fact get the grant retrospectively and have had three years investment allowance as well, even in relation to the grant that was paid to them.  This is something the Minister might perhaps clear up on a later stage of the Bill if he has not got the information now. While we are agreeable from this side of the House to providing money once, to provide the same money twice for <Col N="997" /> the same purpose is something we would be a little more sceptical about. I would like to be more clear about the purpose of the Bill.  I can see it is designed to put us in a competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> British shipping but are we seeking here in this Bill to create or preserve the Irish shipping industry from the point of view of employment or balance of payments? I ask those questions because I think it is of some importance to know what we are aiming to do.  Perhaps we are aiming to do both but the purpose has not been clearly stated.  This affects the question of how we look at the Bill on the Committee stage.  If, for example, we are concerned about employment, then one would like to have some assurance that ships which get those grants will, in fact, be manned by Irish crews or that at some stage, when they are no longer manned by Irish crews, the grant or an appropriate portion of it will be repaid.</P>
      <P>Is the purpose of the scheme to ensure the employment of Irish people on these ships?  Is the purpose a balance of payments one to ensure that shipping services will be provided by Irish ships owned by Irish companies and that the profits are not taken over by external exchanges?  We want the Bill drafted to ensure that the companies receiving these grants are Irish-owned companies.  Otherwise the Bill could be a channel for exporting capital rather than importing receipts. If we are trying to ensure that the balance of payments position will be improved by carrying goods in our own ships, this purpose would be fulfilled if an Irish-registered company got a grant for a ship and operated that ship from an Irish base, to Great Britain or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>If the profits from that company went to shareholders elsewhere, the Irish balance of payments position would not benefit except by collecting a percentage of the profits.  We need to know the purpose of the Bill and whether it is designed to ensure employment of Irish-owned ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to know whether the Bill has a strategic purpose.  This is another possibility.  We need to ensure that <Col N="998" /> there is a fleet in existence which will be of use to us in time of war.  This question has been raised before with regard to Irish Shipping Limited.  I have not hitherto heard that there has been any problem in maintaining the level of shipping required for strategic purpose as calculated in the Second Programme document.</P>
    <P>If there has not been any difficulty, then the strategic argument for this additional payment does not arise.  We need to know the purpose of the Bill and when we know that, we will have to examine the Bill in committee in order to see that the purposes are achieved and no loopholes left for external operators.  The Minister should be more explicit on this point.  He should mention the purposes of the Bill and the safeguards which will be taken to ensure that its purposes will be carried out and no loopholes left. The profits for the operation of the company could go outside the country.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the criticism of foreigners getting grants for establishing industries in this country.. These concerns are not all as unsuccessful as the Potez concern.  Many of them are valuable to our economy.  I would be quite happy with any grant system which helped the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I referred to the strategic argument which has been put previously with regard to Irish shipping.  I would like to ask the Minister what the latest position is with regard to this matter. There is nothing further in the Third Programme on this subject.  In the Second Programme an opportunity was taken to review the tonnage target. Could the Minister tell us how it stands?  Have there been any difficulties in achieving this?  Mention was made of 250,000 dry tons for Irish shipping. This figure was established arbitrarily. I am not clear on what basis it was established.  It was subsequently revised downwards to 200,000 tons.</P>
    <P>The Minister will note that the figure of 150,000 tons was mentioned on the grounds that such a fleet, even if one-third were sunk, would provide sufficient tonnage to import all strategic goods which we would require even in <Col N="999" /> the unlikely position that all the Northern Hemisphere had been wiped out and that we had to get all our goods from the Southern Hemisphere. This target was one which Irish shipping had attained.  Has Irish shipping any difficulty in maintaining this target?  They are having difficulty economically because of adverse trading conditions.</P>
    <P>It was recommended that we should have tanker tonnage.  It would not be much good to import goods and then to find we are unable to carry them around the country, particularly in view of the dwindling horse population. Have any arrangements been made about acquiring 80,000 tons of tanker space?  This figure was mentioned as an important strategic target. Are we working towards this target? This Bill is connected with the desirability of achieving this target and with the object of achieving it.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us something about the strategic targets and whether they are related to this Bill.  It seems to me that the Bill is more closely related to the position of the B and I Company than to other matters.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us about the position of the B and I.</P>
    <P>I was in the Dáil quite recently when this question came up in relation to another matter.  The competitive position of the B and I <i>vis-à-vis</i> British Railways was discussed.  I have been interested in this question since the publication of the Freight Rates Tribunal Report, 1959.  I feel that the competitive situation is a matter of great concern to this country.  I fully support any decision taken to purchase the B and I.  If it had not been done we might have been in the position here where we were at the mercy of British Railways as the only company of importance operating across the Irish Sea.  The whole history of freight rate position between Ireland and Britain reflects the B and I position.  If we were without State ownership the position might have been so bad that the B and I could not survive.  This Bill is useful in so far as it makes a contribution towards putting the B and I on a fully economic footing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> In the Dáil recently reference was made to the decision by British Railways not to provide any more cattle trucks at Birkenhead which puts the B and I at a very marked disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> British Railways who concentrate all their trucks at Holyhead. Such a decision could undermine the Irish company.  I regard this as a serious threat to our economy.  It is not the first time such a threat has arisen. British Railways operates for the benefit of Britain.  There have been occasions when what is in the interests of Britain has not been in the interests of this country.  This has happened at various points in our history.</P>
    <P>I have the impression that what is in the interest of British Railways is not always in our interest.  I recall an occasion about five years ago when there was a proposal by private Irish companies to operate a new shipping service across the southern part of the Irish Sea, to Milford Haven, I think.  British Railways intervened and threatened that if such a service were operated they would withdraw shipping services to some parts of Ireland.  I seem to recall that the Minister found it necessary to succumb to this threat and the service operated by the Irish companies was suspended.</P>
    <P>British Railways may feel they are entitled to use their monopoly of power in this way but I am not happy that on more than one occasion we should have found ourselves at their mercy as far as our economy is concerned. I was not very happy with the reaction of the Government at that time in succumbing to the threat by British Railways and in ordering cancellation of these services.  The matter was reported in the newspapers some time afterwards; it is public knowledge and should be a matter of public concern.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves, four or five years later, in the position that the B and I Company, having been safeguarded from being run into the ground or taken over by British Railways, finds it is prevented from operating competitively by the exercise of the monopoly of power by British <Col N="1001" /> Railways in relation to services within Britain to divert the maximum cattle trade through British Railways.  British Railways seem to be doing more in the cattle business and, as was stated recently in the Dáil, the B and I are in a position where the decline in cattle business has made it necessary for them to increase their rates.  They tried to win back business by reducing their rates but they failed and they have now had to increase their charges.  That is not in the interest of the Irish economy.  I do not fault B and I for their action.  It is their job to run a commercial undertaking and by turning this into a social service it would become demoralised as has happened in other State enterprises in the past when Government interference prevented them from operating commercially. The decision taken in this instance was the right one; the B and I Company should not be forced to run at a loss.</P>
    <P>The Government might consider it desirable to assist them to compete in the interests of the Irish cattle trade, but that is a matter for the Government, not for the B and I Company. That a situation should arise where a monopoly of power exercised within Britain should undermine an Irish State shipping company to the extent that business is diverted, its rates forced up and our cattle trade affected is surely a matter for concern.  Listening to the debate in the other House I was not happy that this matter was being dealt with in a serious manner but it may be that much more is happening behind the scenes than the various Ministers could disclose.</P>
    <P>Replying to a Dáil question by Deputy Dillon as to whether any representations had been made to the Board of Trade on this matter, the Minister for Agriculture evaded the question and kept talking about having chats with the British Minister for Agriculture.  My understanding of the British Government system does not lead me to believe that the Minister for Agriculture has anything to do with British Railways and it appears someone has got hold of the wrong end of the stick.  The question of the cattle trade is something which concerns the <Col N="1002" /> British Minister for Agriculture; the question of British Railways and its impact on the Irish State and cross-Channel shipping companies is the concern of the Board of Trade and I hope that this matter is being taken up with that body.</P>
    <P>One way in which this country remains most vulnerable to British pressure is the fact that the company operating services across the Irish Sea controls all the rail services and many of the road services in Britain.  This has been a threat to our economy for many years past and no new reading of the Report of the Freight Rates Tribunal, 1959, can leave one in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation.  This was the reason which precipitated the Government into purchasing the B and I but I cannot accept that this decision, which was intended to ensure competition, should be frustrated by the British Government monopoly, and if this is persisted in I would regard it as an unfriendly act of a kind inappropriate between two friendly countries.  Perhaps I am attaching too much gravity to this but I have been concerned about this matter for the past 10 years and we are now reaching the point where some fairly drastic action is required.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to help the B and I Company which has been required to carry out modernisation and development of its services which had not been adequately developed under the previous management.  Without assistance of any capital injection from the Exchequer other than the original price paid for the purchase of the ships, the job done by the B and I has been a remarkable one. This Bill will provide them with some capital assistance not directed particularly towards subsidising them and it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the debate in the other House there was discussion on the question of tramp shipping.  A complaint was made that Irish shipping and many of its services are engaged in tramp shipping throughout the world and are not primarily concerned with bringing goods to and from Ireland.  There was a suggestion that in this way Irish shipping were letting the side down <Col N="1003" /> and not pulling their weight in contributing to the economy.  In reply the Minister made the point, which I endorse, that these activities are of great value to the economy in that they are a source of invisible earnings, in the receipt of foreign currency earned by Irish ships and Irish crews on the high seas, in order to provide us with the foreign currency we need to buy goods and services.  I do not think it would be a fair criticism of this Bill that it might be used to provide additional free capital to Irish shipping in order to operate ships between, say, Japan and the west coast of America, but if it has that effect I would welcome it because for operations of this kind we receive dollars and yens and it also gives employment to Irish crews. It is, therefore, doubly beneficial to this country, and is a point worth making in view of the criticisms made.</P>
    <P>A point was made that Irish shipping should operate additional services between Ireland and other countries for which there is a demand.  If they have failed to do this and other countries are providing the service that is a different matter, but I have not heard that case made.  The mere fact that their services operate very largely as tramp ships between other countries to earn foreign currency is not an argument against Irish shipping vessels receiving the benefit of grants under the Bill.  It is important we should be assured that the benefits of the injection of free capital which this Bill requires us to make to Irish shipping services will accrue to this country either in the form of foreign exchange earnings or in the from of the employment it secures for our people.</P>
    <P>On a point of detail I do not think the Bill makes provision for these grants being applied to containers. Perhaps the Minister would say more about this because it seems to introduce a new principle.  I accept that a modern shipping service will in many cases have to be a container service. That means that the shipping company must provide containers.  Nonetheless one would like to know what limits there are on this question of providing containers.  It could be a little openended&mdash;I do not mean the containers <Col N="1004" /> should be open-ended, but the provisions could be somewhat open-ended. We do not want to find ourselves with a Shipping Bill which finances the provision of containers for all kinds of industry on either side of the Irish Sea or indeed the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is conscious of this and intends that the Bill will be so operated that the financing of the containers will be limited to that which is necessary and appropriate to the shipping services which the Bill is primarily intended to provide, but I would like to hear how he means to secure that.  I would also like to ask him in relation to the sum of £2.4 million which the Bill is providing for in the first instance in the form of injections of capital how much of this sum will accrue to the B and I, and how much to Irish Shipping and to other companies.  We are entitled to know this, and in fact there will be no secret about this, because the balance sheets of the companies will be published in due course and the information will be obtainable there, but we should be entitled in relation to this sum which is already earmarked to know about its distribution between these two Irish companies and other shipping companies.</P>
    <P>These are the points which I should like to raise at this stage, though there may be points which I will take up on the Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say only a few brief things on the Bill.  We all welcome it in so far as if we are in any competitive business we have to match our competitors, but there are a few items which I would like to raise. I do not think I can be as complacent as Senator FitzGerald on the question of tramp steamers.  I would like to see hard facts and figures as to the amount of actual foreign currency those tramp steamers earn, and also the opposite <Col N="1005" /> account of the amount of foreign currency that the provision of the tramp steamers calls for by way of capital.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to see balanced against that what is our foreign currency situation.  Is it so critical that we cannot raise the same amount by other methods?  To me it seems that life in a tramp steamer is about the most undesirable type of life we can create for our people.  Family men are away from home for six or nine months at a time.  There might be certain monetary compensations involved but certainly it is far from the ideal type of employment, and any shore-based activity would seem to be preferable.  On the other hand if the steamers were mainly plying to and from Irish ports that is a different thing altogether.  We would be playing a part in carrying imports in our own ships.</P>
      <P>I raise a very big question mark over this Bill in regard to tramp steamers and further investment in them.  I certainly would not like to see that done without very much greater scrutiny and a very much deeper questioning of the figures involved.  Nothing can be more misleading than when we are told that the service is operating at a loss, because it is just a question of playing with figures from one side of the ledger to another.  The amount of loss produced depends on how you allocate your overheads.  You can have rules for allocating these, but the only hard test you can apply is, if this service ceases can the company carry on, or would it then lose money, which is a totally different thing.  I would appeal for closer scrutiny of this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also this question of the B and I where it is said that they have ordered two 29,000-ton deadweight bulk carriers one of which will be built at Verolme Dockyard in Cork.  I am not very much impressed by one.  I would have thought that in such a marginal type of activity one of the major decisions would be that the building was being done at home.  I do not see that the pressure on the building of those vessels can be so great that the second one could not afford to wait six or nine months until one of our yards was free to do the job.  We must look at this point, that we have this <Col N="1006" /> question of operating at a profit, a type of slide rule exercise, that can be most misleading, because in this case a company like the B and I or another is largely charged with buying something at the lowest price, but it is the community that is paying for it, and if you take the building of a ship the added value in the yard would probably amount to 25 or 30 per cent of the total cost.</P>
    <P>That added value creates wealth that is spent by the workers engaged in that enterprise.  It goes into our economy, and it deposits taxes from the taxes on the pint and every other tax such as on petrol and so on.  It deposits into the Exchequer anything up to 40 per cent of the value that has been added, in other words ten or 12 per cent. Therefore it would seem that apart from creating employment here at home the State would actually not lose even if ten or 12 per cent more had to be paid for having a ship built at home, or indeed any other article built at home rather than abroad.</P>
    <P>I am always worried about this insistence on profit especially in semi-State companies.  We do not seem to allow for the added value to the Irish economy in having the job done at home.  Therefore not being bound in these cases by the lowest tender we should be able to adjust our price so as to take account of the benefit conferred on the Irish economy by it.  In some cases, especially shipbuilding, one or two per cent on a tender can make all the difference.  We should look at the overall co-ordination especially when we introduce a Bill in the Seanad and get it through in under an hour, involving expenditure of £2½ million in the year and probably continuing at nearly that figure over the following years.  The question is, are we scrutinising it closely enough?  Have we the machinery in Parliament or in Government to ensure that this expenditure is co-ordinated and that the work as much as possible is done at home so as to confer within proper economic limits the maximum benefits on our economy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the questions asked ought to be dealt with on the <Col N="1007" /> Committee Stage.  The Bill was delayed because the clauses of it had to be examined very carefully and it had to take its position in the queue of Bills in the Dáil.  Shipping companies have not been making such profits that would make the investment allowance concession any use to them.  The question of when the investment allowance ceases in relation to these grants will be decided by the Department of Finance, who I do not think will ever be over-generous in this matter.  It can be taken for granted that they will be co-ordinated.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald asks the general purpose underlying these grants.  There is the helpful purpose of providing grants for shipping companies giving employment which is of some importance&mdash;19,000 people employed by the B and I and Irish Shipping and a further number employed by smaller shipping companies.  We are putting our shipping services in competition with others of the very highest calibre and setting an example of productivity and charging the very lowest rates possible consistent with earning a profit.  Then there is the strategic element that enters into operations of Irish Shipping plus the fact that they earn very valuaable foreign currency and fly our flag abroad and have a splendid reputation for punctuality and good performance. These are the main reasons why we want to have these important shipping companies maintain their position and modernise their ships.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, an Irish body corporate can apply for a grant and that body corporate might well be controlled by foreign interests.  We will take very great care when providing conditions for grants to foreign companies who might take away the revenue of the company in a way that would be of no advantage to us.  However, it is not likely that any such company would apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, there are provisions in the Bill that they will have to repay the grant if the ships have been sold before a certain period had elapsed.  We have also provision in the conditions for the fact that an Irish or foreign company cannot charter a ship for a single <Col N="1008" /> voyage without stating what the purpose of the charter is and they will not be allowed to charter a vessel for which grants have been given on the basis that the vessel will gradually be purchased by a foreign concern.  We are able to regulate against the misuse of a grant from a national viewpoint. We can do this by conditions under section 2.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked me about the position of the B and I.  The B and I were able to raise a large amount of capital without any State guarantee because they provided excellent market research and were able to present a very good statement of profits and receipts in the most advanced form. Their three new car-ferry vessels, I believe, will be profitable.  The bookings for them are excellent.  The company are carrying more and more freight by their container services which in future will be owned by the company.  The B and I lost money last year.  They lost heavily because of the shipping strike and because of the outbreak of the foot and mouth epidemic.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked also about the position with regard to cattle shipping. The B and I are in the unfortunate position that at Birkenhead there are no rail wagons.  As a result, they have lost a good deal of the trade to British Railways.  It is their duty to provide a service of vessels to fulfil the need and to provide a service that will always be there in case anything should happen as a result of the deterioration in the British rail service. The straight answer to the Senator is that the matter is the subject of continuous negotiations by the Minister for Agriculture who, in actual fact, conducts negotiations in relation to the shipping of cattle.</P>
    <P>The B and I have raised their freight rate by 10/- representing the restoration of the freight rate that was reduced in April last and by another 6/-so that their losses this year, I think, will not be excessive and I am hoping that their financial position will improve steadily.  I see no reason why it should not.</P>

I cannot go into the merits or demerits of sea life but I can only say that certain people enjoy this sort of life.  Irish Shipping looks after its people very well.

As the Senator well knows there is an appropriate subsidy paid to Verolme for the ships that are built by the State.

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The significance of the word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; in line 25 gives me a little bit of trouble. It says:</P>
      <P>make to a person...a grant towards approved capital expenditure incurred in providing, for use for the purposes of that business, a new ship or a new part or equipment for a ship, or in converting a ship for such use.</P>
      <P>Providing cannot include chartering it from another person under the next subclause.  I wonder can the Minister give us the legal meaning of the word providing here?  Who is providing it to whom?  It is the grant towards providing a ship.  Providing is a verb used where somebody provides something to somebody.  Who is providing the ship for whom in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> One would expect the word &ldquo;purchasing&rdquo; a ship here, or some word like that.  Providing seems an odd word to use and it is not a word I have come across in a Bill before.  I am not sure of its significance.  I wonder could the Minister enlighten us as to what is meant by it, how it is defined, what is the significance of it and what limits there are?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It means providing a grant to a company, which is a body incorporated in Ireland, or a company owned by an Irish citizen or a company owned by the Irish Government.  It means providing a grant towards the building of a new ship or conversion of an existing ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it does not say that at all.  It is giving a grant towards approved capital expenditure incurred in providing a ship.  It is the ship which is provided not the grant.  The grant is made. When you are talking about providing a ship who is providing it to whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is just a question of wording.  We intend it to mean a grant to be given by the State towards a company, which is defined, for the purpose of providing itself with a new ship or converting a ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the grant provided to the operating company which is using the ship or to the shipbuilding company which is building it?  It is the shipbuilding company which provides the ship not the operating company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the word providing is used because it does not apply only to the purchasing of a new ship but the fitting out of ships.  It also covers a new part or equipment for a ship or converting a ship.  In other words, the word providing is used because it refers to new parts or equipment in existing ships and that is why that particular verb is used.  I can assure the Senator there is nothing at all sinister behind this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Providing&rdquo; is not clear.  I am afraid as a legal term it is not precise.  In relation <Col N="1014" /> to conversion, conversion is properly dealt with.  It is converting a ship.  It is providing a new ship or a new part or equipment of a ship.  Who is providing the ship, the part or the equipment to whom?  In the ordinary way the provision of such things is by a shipbuilding company to an operating company in return for payment.  It seems to me the Bill, as drafted, requires the grant to be made to the shipbuilding company. I understood it would be made to the operating company.  Under the Bill, as drafted, it could not be made to the operating company.  They do not provide the ship.  They buy the ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the draftsman, who drew it up, that it is intended it should apply to the company which owns the ship not to the shipbuilding company.  It is not to the company building the ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Right. Then, the grant must be given to the company purchasing the ship or the part or the equipment not the company providing the ship.  The word providing is quite clear in its meaning. It means clearly making something for somebody, or putting something at the disposal of somebody.  It relates to the person who is doing the act of providing the vessel, and that is the shipbuilder. He provides it to the shipping company.  It would not be possible to pay a grant to the operating company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that.  The Bill uses the words &ldquo;a new ship or a new part or equipment for a ship&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;for the purposes of that business, a new ship or a new part or equipment for a ship&rdquo; and that word &ldquo;business&rdquo; makes it quite clear that it is the company operating the ship which will get the grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill states &ldquo;make to a person carrying on or proposing to carry on a business in the State a grant towards approved capital expenditure incurred in providing for use for the purposes of that business, a new ship&rdquo;.  The capital expenditure is incurred by the shipbuilding company.</P>

      <P>The Minister could pay the money only to the shipbuilding company.  Senator Ó Maoláin has made the point that the ship is provided by the shipbuilding company but the grant can only be paid for &ldquo;approved capital expenditure incurred in providing...a ship&rdquo;.  The ship is provided by the shipbuilding company.  Nobody can hold that the B and I in buying the ship are providing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald is creating all kinds of confusion where <Col N="1016" /> there is really no confusion.  If the B and I want to get a ship for their own business purposes they might buy a ship which has just been built or get a shipbuilding company to build it for them, but they are providing a ship for their own business.  That is what they are getting paid for. The shipbuilding company provide the ship to the B and I, but they do not come into the provisions of this Bill at all.  The B and I provide the ship for their own use.  It seems to me a convenient word to use because if you are examining words closely there is no other word which would quite cover the situation.  This seems to cover the situation adequately. The B and I wish to provide a ship. Whether they buy it or make it is a matter which does not arise under this Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless they build the ship they do not provide the ship.  I suggest that the Minister change the word to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo;.  He is speaking about a shipping company buying a new ship or converting a ship.  I feel that &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; would be a better word.  After consideration the B and I might build a ship or part of a ship. Alternatively, if the Minister feels there is danger in using the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; he could say &ldquo;purchase or provide&rdquo;. They might employ people to make a part for a ship.  This may be particularly true with regard to the woodwork in the ship, or to the wooden cabins.  Perhaps it might be unwise to use the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;purchase or provide&rdquo; might meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's main mistake is in thinking that one must make the object themselves if one is providing something One may provide food or drink in an establishment but that does not involve one in growing the food or manufacturing the other provisions. They can be got from somewhere. The Senator is simply misled by this assumption that &ldquo;providing&rdquo; implies &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FarrellMcElgunn" hpid="Mr. McElgunn Mr. McElgunn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McElgunn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Yeats.  If you provide yourself with a motor car you do not have to make it.  We are just playing about <Col N="1017" /> with words here.  I do not understand why it is necessary to manufacture something in order to get credit for providing it.  I understand that &ldquo;provide&rdquo; means &ldquo;to make available&rdquo; for one's use.  If I provide myself with a motor car I do not have to manufacture the car.  That is my understanding of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Provide&rdquo; means &ldquo;provide to someone&rdquo;.  In the present circumstances the only reasonable meaning is the shipping construction company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that it is anything but clear.  The Bill says that the Minister may &ldquo;make a grant towards approved capital expenditure incurred in providing...a new ship&rdquo;. I cannot see why the grant cannot be made to the operating company.  The draftsman was perfectly satisfied about it.  I have never had any difficulty before with grants which were made available to State companies in that I was unable to get the grants to the companies to which I wanted to pay them. The Senator need not be worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would have difficulty in recalling the use of the word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; in similar legislation.  I can see how the draftsman fell into the trap in covering the situation here.  He used the word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; in order not to limit himself too much as to purchasing.  By using the word &ldquo;providing&rdquo; only, he has limited it to case where the provision is carried out by the shipping company.  The gránt has to be made to the shipbuilding company.  One cannot turn the English language on its head in legislation.  If you do you could come to a sticky end.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> The Senator is just realising that when in Opposition we attack the draftsman and when in Government we defend him.  The Senator is making use of the fact that he wants to draw his own <Col N="1018" /> interpretation from the draftsman's work.  The Minister is satisfied that the draftsman is right.  He is entitled to hold that view.  Senator FitzGerald realises that not only can the Minister and the Government be badgered, but the Opposition can badger the draftsman. Supposing Senator FitzGerald should be right, which is very unlikely, and I do not think he is, Parliament has the right to mend its hand.  If a meaning should be put on this by somebody outside, for instance, the courts may put a different interpretation on it, there is nothing to prevent the Oireachtas from amending the Bill.  I do not think there is a lot of substance in the matter we are discussing.  We are only trying to split a drafting hair.</P>

We have a power to recommend in the case of a certified money Bill and I should like to propose a recommendation, if that is technically correct, which I think I am entitled to do.  I should like to think for one moment about the exact wording of it.  I should like to propose <Col N="1019" /> the insertion of the words &ldquo;or purchasing&rdquo; in line 26 after the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  In proposing it at that point I think it is clear that the proposed section be amended as follows:</P>
      <P>...incurred in providing, for use for the purposes of that business or purchasing a new ship or a new part or equipment for a ship.</P>
      <P>It gets over the difficulty in which the Minister might find himself in being unable to provide grants for the shipping company for the purchase of a ship.

I was trying to help by dealing with the recommendations on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It is very unsatisfactory to have to devise recommendations as they arise but I was trying to expedite matters.  We will have to have more time to consider each section if we have to put the recommendations down first.  I am prepared to do this, but it may take some time.

      <P>The giving of grants is permissive.  It will come before the Dáil in the Estimate for my Department and if the method of giving the grant is wrong recommendations can be made later.  I have to establish conditions under which these grants may be given.  The Bill limits me to a reasonable extent and makes it clear what cannot be done.

      <P>The Minister's idea of how the Houses of the Oireachtas should handle legislation is not mine.  I am a little surprised that he should take that view.  There are problems on section 6 and I think the Minister has not a sufficient wide range of power as regards the nature of the conditions he has laid down.  He is too limited in the conditions laid down. My view may be wrong but I am entitled to put this forward as a recommendation. I cannot take it from the Minister that as the Bill is permissive it should pass without the Seanad looking at it.

      <P>I have a recommendation to propose on this section.  I move:</P>
      <P>In section 3, line 37, to insert after &ldquo;State&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and a majority of shares in which are held by persons who are citizens of and ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope that that is correctly drafted. The point I am making is that the mere fact that a body corporate is incorporated in the State is not sufficient. If this exercise is to have any value it is necessary that the company should be genuinely an Irish company and that the bulk of the shares should be owned here so that whatever profits there were from the ship would accrue to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A body corporate is not defined in this Bill as the Senator knows.  We rely on the definition of it in the Mercantile Marine Act, 1955 because the vessel has to be registered in the State under Part II in order to be eligible for a grant.  Under section 16 of that Act an Irish body corporate should be qualified to own a registered ship or a share therein and a body corporate is defined as &ldquo;a body corporate established under and subject to the law of the State and having its principal place of business in the State&rdquo;.  A declaration of ownership of the vessel is required under the Act and the principal place of business is the place where all the important business of the company is in fact controlled and managed.  I do not have to pay any grant unless I decide that the grant should be given.  In common with the British, who experienced difficulties in connection with companies controlled by foreign interests, I intend to impose conditions for the making of grants whereby I can scrutinise the position of any company controlled by foreign interests.  It would be under the most exceptional circumstances that I can <Col N="1023" /> conceive that a grant would be given to a company controlled by foreign interests, where the financial and economic advantages would be lost to us.  I said that on Second Reading and I have clearly defined my own principles in that regard.  It will have to be done through the permissive character of this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section the Minister has power to determine the capital expenditure that is to be provided in the form of grants. There are two ways in which this can be done, it can be left to the discretion of the Minister so that if he wishes he can very the percentage according as he thinks appropriate, or alternatively <Col N="1024" /> there is another way of approaching it which is to let the Minister determine the fixed percentage which so long as he has determined it shall be paid in any case where a grant is applicable. There is a case in favour of the latter. If you leave the discretion to the Minister it gives him power of secret discrimination and he could give a bigger grant to one firm rather than another without there being any means of this being known to the public.  We know that when questions are asked we are told that the information is private as it relates to the affairs of a company. This has happened, for example, in regard to hotels.  If, on the other hand, the Minister is given power to determine what percentage should be given at any given time and must state this publicly, then so long as that figure is there he would have to give that percentage. Give him the power, however, publicly to change the fixed percentage, by order.  I would regard this as being a preferable system because we would know where we were and it would remove the excessive power of the Minister.  I am not thinking now of the present Minister but of any Minister.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Senator, Irish shipowners have been informed what the Government's decision in principle is, that the rate will be 25 per cent initially and until an announcement is made that a changes is being made it will remain at 25 per cent for all classes of vessels.  We considered all the possibilities of varying the rate in respect of particular classes of ships but looking around at the situation in the country and at the number of companies likely to apply we decided that the best thing to do was to stabilise the rate at 25 per cent.  All I can say is that I hope it will be accepted by the House even though it is not put into the Bill.  If we wish to change or very the amount below 25 per cent&mdash; under the Bill we cannot increase it beyond 25 per cent&mdash;or decide to have varying grants this will be announced in the same way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister could reduce it at some future time without any public statement.  It <Col N="1025" /> is highly desirable that there should be a requirement in the Bill that we should state such a figure and have power to vary it.</P>

      <P>The Minister also represents tourism and questions have been asked on the Estimate and on other occasions in the Dáil about the amount of grants paid and the different rates paid in regard to the tourist industry and the Minister has replied that this was a private matter and that he could not disclose the information. If that is the approach and there is something to be said for it, that he is using this power to give grants at different rates to different companies, he might decide to give the B and I and Irish Shipping 25 per cent and to give ten per cent to private companies.  It seems to me unsatisfactory that we should not have some system of public disclosure of what the current rate is.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to disclose the current rate in the case of shipping companies.  In the case of hotels it is an entirely different matter. In very many cases these are very small private businesses scattered throughout the country.  It is inadvisable to disclose the rate and I can only give some idea of how the rates vary from area to area in accordance with the needs of hotels in different parts of the country.  I would disclose any variation in the rates and in that way they can be known to the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the recommendation is to clarify the position because the wording here is &ldquo;approved capital expenditure incurred before that date in so far as it consists of any sum paid after that date&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to introduce a recommendation.  By way of explanation for doing so I should say that this section requires the Minister to impose certain conditions which, however, relate only to the use of the asset.  They do not relate to the company. I have already raised the question of the ownership of the company. I move the following recommendation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line 29, after the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;for securing that in the event of an individual in receipt of a grant ceasing to be a citizen of or ordinarily resident in the State, or if a body corporate in receipt of a grant ceasing to be incorporated in or resident in the State, or of a majority of the shares in such a body corporate ceasing to be held by persons who are citizens of and ordinarily resident in the State or of the members of a partnership in receipt of a grant ceasing to be <Col N="1027" /> citizens of or ordinarily resident in the State or body corporate incorporated or resident in the State, the Minister may require the repayment of some or all of the grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the recommendation is to require the Minister to make this condition.  As the section stands, I think the Minister could make such a condition under section 2 but he does not have to do so.  The conditions he has to impose relate to the assets, to insure against shipping charters and so on.  There is nothing there to require him to make conditions of this kind. I am not clear from what the Minister said whether he intends to provide that, if it ceases to be incorporated and that if we are going to provide grants for ships which are to be manned by Irish sailors and operated by Irish companies with a view to foreign receipts coming in here, this condition is not only fulfilled in the first instance but that it remains fulfilled.</P>
    <P>We cannot have a position in which when the grant has been paid the body corporate changes its residence or its shareholding or something else changes and as a result the profits could accrue to people outside the State almost immediately.  The recommendation is intended to require the Minister to make conditions to prevent that happening and would ensure that in such circumstances a grant would have to be repaid in full or in part depending on the length of time for which the ship had remained in the ownership of a genuine Irish concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is quite right to raise the question but I shall make conditions which will provide that information will have to be given at constant intervals by which I would be notified of any change in the qualifying status of the recipient of the grant.  That covers change of ownership of the company concerned or its domination by foreign interests. I shall make conditions of all kinds in relation to the prohibition of a company chartering a ship in such a way that the company ceases to have control of its operations. I am sure the Senator is aware that there are only about <Col N="1028" /> half a dozen shipping companies in this country and the Bill is designed to provide the Minister with sufficient powers to deal with the situation.  We shall not have a lot of fly-by-night companies asking for grants and the position in which I would be sorely tempted to give a grant for some particular economic good and might get myself and my Department and the Government into trouble later on because the grant was made to a company whose intentions were fraudulent or who intended somehow to spirit away the profits of their business from the State.  It is not that situation.  We are not living in a world of gnomes. We are not dealing with grants for a vast foreign concern which is already in the country where you could have undersirable ownership.  I think the Senator should accept the fact that I will make these conditions which will enable me to have power to ensure all the safeguards required in the use of these grants.  I do not think there is any likelihood of a grant being given to a company which would act contrary to the public interest.  Nevertheless, I am going to make these conditions and one of them, as I have said, will be that they will have to notify me of any change in qualifying status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point about gnomes.  I I understand they reside in Zurich and I suppose it is one place you could not bring a ship to.  I am not quite satisfied. The Minister spoke of making regulations and there is no power to make regulations, only conditions.  There is a substantial difference between regulations and conditions.  The Minister said he will require notification of change in status of the company or of the ship&mdash;I am not clear which and he also spoke of the chartering that is covered by section 6.  I am happy about that. But the problem is what happens if the company or the individual to whom the grant was made changes his or its position.  Suppose the Minister makes the condition under which he must be notified of a change in status taking place but what I want to know is, can he, under the Bill or will he, make conditions that the grant is payable on condition of the individual or the company <Col N="1029" /> retaining its status and that it would be repayable in whole or in part if that status changes?  The Minister has not adverted to that.  He has only said that he will require to be notified of the change but not what will happen if the position does in fact change. Does he feel that the Bill gives power to him to make such a condition about the grant being repayable in such circumstances?  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate this.</P>
