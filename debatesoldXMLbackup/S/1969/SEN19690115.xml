      <P>A communication has been received from the Taoiseach requesting that arrangements should be made to summon a meeting of Seanad Éireann for 3.10 p.m. on Tuesday, 21st January, 1969 in the Mansion House, Dublin to hear an address by the President.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that statement which is connected with the documents we have had in connection with the Commemoration Meeting next Tuesday I should like to ask a few questions.  Is the House going to be given an opportunity of approving the recommendations of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges? Has it been agreed by this House that no Independents shall speak at all either of Dáil or Seanad and that no ordinary Members of the Seanad shall have an opportunity of speaking at all?  I should also like some assurance which is not in the published documents that there will be at least some reference to the democratic programme of the first Dáil and not merely a reiteration of commemorative words.</P>

      <P>As the Senator is aware, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges discussed this matter specifically.  Independent Members were represented at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the arrangements were approved by the <Col N="316" /> Committee and ordinarily arrangements of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to issue a protest here on the matters I have mentioned.  It seems to me unsatisfactory from the point of view of this House that we should be represented, in fact, by a very praiseworthy Senator but one solitary Senator who is an officer of this House. None of the ordinary Senators is to be allowed to contribute at all apparently and there are many things that require saying 50 years later.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Senator any indication of when some of the motions will be taken.  I had hoped to take more than the Broadcasting Bill today but due to a variety of circumstances, some of which the Leader of the Senator's Party is aware of, it was impossible to take more than this particular one today. As to when the Seanad will meet again, as soon as it is feasible to arrange for some of these motions to be taken, I shall ask the Cathaoirleach to call a meeting of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I feel, Sir, that in a matter of this nature if a Senator has an objection to a recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges your function as such is to put it to this House, not to make a ruling on whether the Committee on Procedure and Privileges recommendation should or should not be accepted.  It is a matter for the House to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would want to give notice to have that matter raised and discussed.  The procedure has been that when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges made a report automatically it was accepted by the House.  That has been the procedure all along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing what the procedure has been and I am not criticising the Chair in his personal capacity.  The fact is that if a recommendation has been made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges all that can be done at this stage is to put that recommendation before this House and ask the House whether it accepts that recommendation.  Otherwise the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is above this House and can direct it.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges arrived at these arrangements after very detailed consideration of them and if there is any Senator who has any objection to them, then he is going against the precedent established in this House and which we have accepted, for as long, anyhow, as I have been a Member of the Seanad.  I think there should be no more time wasted on it.  We either accept the Committee's recommendations or break with this precedent.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To describe the debate on the Bill as sporadic would be to exaggerate its continuity. <Col N="320" /> About eight months have elapsed since I was last on my feet in the middle of this interrupted speech.  On the previous occasion the interruption was a short one of only three weeks.  Having said that I am, nevertheless, grateful to the Leader of the House for arranging the debate today and to the Minister for attending.</P>
      <P>I think I had better recapitulate the line of argument, without attempting to go into detail, so that I and the House can pick up the threads where I left off on the 29th May last.  I had started by saying that in introducing this Bill and in the comments I had been making it was not intended to reflect on the Minister himself and there was no suggestion that the Minister himself had interfered improperly in any way with RTE.  No such suggestion or allegation had, I think, been made.  Nevertheless, I felt that there existed a problem of which there was substantial evidence.  I accepted that the whole problem of radio and television and its freedom and freedom to criticise the Government, freedom of debate, was a thorny issue and that not alone in this country but in other countries there were divergent views on it and that indeed many other countries had less liberal regimes than ours in this respect.</P>
      <P>I asserted, however, that this service should be a national service and not a Government service, serving the nation as a whole rather than any individual Government.  I suggested that, in order to ensure that freedom of speech was maintained as it should be in such a service, four things were required: an alert public opinion, a strong director general, an independent board and legislation to protect its independence. It was, indeed, with a view towards strengthening this legislation that this Bill was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested that interference with the work of the RTE organisation could come in two ways, through a board or board members who were not completely independent, intervening in the affairs of the organisation in order to suppress programmes or to get certain programmes broadcast.  Alternatively, there could be outside interference of a political character, pressure being put <Col N="321" /> on the Authority or its officers and servants to broadcast things or not to broadcast them.</P>
    <P>We had a two-level problem of interference; there could be interference at two levels.  I suggested as regards Board intervention we had virtually no evidence as to whether the Board did or did not intervence in an objectionable manner.  The only evidence I had related to one instance where Board members sought to prevent certain people broadcasting on certain topics in a series of lectures.</P>
    <P>Apart from that incident of which I had personal knowledge I had no evidence of such interference and whether it existed or not could only be a matter of speculation.  But I added that there was concrete evidence over a long period of years of persistent intervention by Ministers of the present Government in the affairs of RTE&mdash; the Ministers do not include the present Minister.  I gave these instances from the public record: the case of Deputy Blaney's speech at the Ard Fheis in November, 1959, which was followed in a very short time, a matter of weeks or so, by his departure from this post and his replacement by Deputy Ormonde.  There was more sensitivity then to Ministerial misbehaviour in this respect than there has been since.  I gave the case of Deputy Boland as Minister for Defence suppressing a programme on Civil Defence when he personally entered the Radio Telefís Éireann building to inspect the proposals for the programme and to suppress them.  There was the case, again on the record, of interference by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Haughey, to prevent dissemination of a statement by the National Farmers' Association which contrasts markedly with the only role seen by the Minister for External Affairs for the Authority as being the dissemination of information.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs sees this as the only role of the Authority.  The Minister for Agriculture did not think this was a proper role when the information came from the NFA.  There were cases of suppression of programmes or attempted suppression like the case of the Mount <Col N="322" /> Pleasant Square programme, which was dropped not because the Minister asked for it to be dropped, but nevertheless following his intervention it was dropped.  Otherwise it would have been unfair to the Minister who had been misinformed accidentally.  As a result of the Minister's intervention by ringing up to inquire about it, the purpose of the inquiry being quite evident to the Director-General, this programme was dropped.  There were earlier programmes like the one on Nítrigin Éireann and the programme on the Special Branch which were dropped. We do not know whether there were other programmes suppressed.  Whether on the direction of the Minister or by some other method, we know the programmes were dropped because of Ministerial intervention.</P>
    <P>Then we had the cases of Vietnam and Biafra.  I dealt with the Vietnam case.  As regards Biafra I said that there was no Ministerial intervention in this case, but I felt that the decision to withdraw the team could have been influenced by the strong intervention of the Minister for External Affairs on a previous occasion on Vietnam.  However, there was no direct intervention in this case.  Apart from the instances of individual intervention there are statements of principle and policy made by the Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach, which laid down certain principles.  They are dangerous ones and ones which should be challenged. The principles laid down by the Minister for External Affairs are, firstly, that the Government had responsibility for the day-to-day affairs of RTE and had the right to interfere with these day-to-day affairs.  This principle is not applied in any other State body.  Secondly, that a news-gathering organisation of this kind was going outside its normal functions in reporting wars in foreign countries and that he had a right to insist that they should have sought permission. The reporting of affairs outside Ireland is important and we must challenge this principle.  The third principle laid down was that if a group of people go abroad where there might be a difficult situation they must consult with the Department before going, a principle which he said had always operated with semi-State bodies but <Col N="323" /> which to my knowledge is one which does not operate in many of these bodies.  They would not dream of talking to the Department of External Affairs before going abroad to somewhere where there might be some difficulties.</P>
    <P>There were the views of Deputy Lemass on the subject when he laid down the degree of Government responsibility, that it was the obligation of the Government to ensure that the programmes of RTE did not offend against the public interest.  He said:</P>
    <P>RTE was set up by legislation as an instrument of public policy and as such was responsible to the Government. The Government had overall responsibility for its conduct, and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>To this extent the Government reject the view that RTE should be, either generally or in regard to its current affairs and news programmes, completely independent of Government supervision.</P>
    <P>He was speaking of supervision of actual programmes.  He went on to say that:</P>
    <P>The Government would take such action by way of representations or otherwise</P>
    <P>&mdash;ominous words&mdash;</P>
    <P>as may be necessary to ensure that RTE does not deviate from the due performance of this duty.</P>
    <P>These are propositions which concerned me.  The incidence of Government intervention was worrying because of the repeated occasions on which there has been intervention.  But behind these lies the philosophy that in fact this is not a national organisation but a Government organisation in some way.  Its workings could be controlled tightly and there could be supervision of day-to-day affairs.  It must not seek news outside the country without permission to do so and must not go abroad where things might be difficult without getting permission, and all its activities need to <Col N="324" /> be under Government supervision. These are the propositions.  This is the philosophy we challenge, apart from the actual incidents involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I put it to the Minister that unless we could, through the medium of this debate, obtain from him some dissent from this philosophy and a statement of a more liberal philosophy and a statement or a guarantee of an attitude in future that would ensure RTE against Government interference of this kind, I wondered whether this Bill itself would be adequate or whether I might not have to recommend to my colleagues the introducation of legislation to change RTE from a semi-State body to a body formed by many agencies which would take it completely away from political interference. I am reluctant to propose such a move.  We on this side of the House are critical at times of appointments in State bodies.  Nevertheless, a tradition exists that these bodies operate autonomously and do a good job.  One would hesitate at this stage to change to a different system of appointment of a board without strong reasons.  But unless we can get satisfactory assurances from this debate I think we would have to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back at this stage to develop the four requirements which I stated at the beginning and which I have not yet developed and which I would like to put to you. Firstly, there is the importance of an alert public opinion.  In any country where public opinion is not alert and the people allow interference by the Government in news media, freedom is in danger.  I think one of the disturbing features of the French situation over the years, except for a brief period last spring and summer, has been the extent to which the Government has exercised governmental control of television and radio.  When that situation exists and when the Government can use television and radio as a means of propaganda, which is something which has never happened here, you get to the stage where they are used for propaganda as has been the case in France for a long time, apart from the brief interval last year when freedom was asserted and quickly suppressed by the dismissal of two-thirds of the staff.  An <Col N="325" /> alert public opinion is therefore essential. We are fortunate in that we have had an alert public opinion in this matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a growth of public opinion of a healthy kind in Ireland and an assertion of democratic rights in every sphere and we can be proud of it.  Wherever there is a hint of Government interference of any kind, it has been the cause of public concern and condemnation.  This is as it should be. I would hope that if there was any hint of anything undesirable being done in future, there would be a similar outcry if our liberties are to be preserved.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that we have got an alert public opinion.  Our public opinion is still not alert in some other spheres but in this it is.  Here, we have the fair guarantee of an independent Radio Telefís Éireann authority actively engaged.</P>
    <P>The second requirement concerns the Director General.  It would be inappropriate for me to refer to any one Director General and we have no evidence whatever that the Director General has not stood up to any pressures that have been put on him.  I have no criticism to make here whatsoever and I move on, therefore, to the next point&mdash;the independent board. Here, there is need for concern because the board of Radio Telefís Éireann is, to a degree which is, if I might say so, unusual, even among State boards, manned by people of a particular and openly avowed political persuasion.</P>
    <P>The other side may say that of course there will be people on any State board who will have political opinions and, indeed, with the pattern of opinion in this country until recent times about half of these would be Fianna Fáil.  But we are not talking of people who happen to vote for Fianna Fáil; it would not be surprising if out of a board of nine, six voted Fianna Fáil.  This would not be statistically unusual, but what I am talking about is people who are actively or have been actively involved in Fianna Fáil or in a particular Party and who are associated with it in the Public mind, thereby undermining confidence in the Authority.  Each of the members of the board as far as I know is qualified for the post he holds and each of <Col N="326" /> them has something to bring to it. Some of them I know personally and some I do not know.  However, they seem to have qualifications which are quite appropriate for the particular jobs they hold.  Individually, I do not challenge the particular appointments but, taken together, I challenge the board composed of these individual appointments.  We have as the chairman, Dr. Andrews, a man of great ability for whom I have great respect, indeed, I would say great affection but, nevertheless, who, throughout his lifetime has been publicly associated with Fianna Fáil.  He makes a very good chairman and if he were the only one I would not mind.</P>
    <P>However, there are others.  There is Rory Brugha who has been mentioned as a possible Fianna Fáil candidate and who is on the National Executive Council of the Party.  He is an excellent man and a personal friend of mine. Individually, he is acceptable and is, I am sure, making a great contribution to the board.  But it is the cumulative effect of these appointments that worries me.  There is also Mr. James Fanning who is an active Fianna Fáil election worker and who is actively engaged in the Party.  There is Mr. Michael Noonan who was a Fianna Fáil candidate for nomination to Limerick County Council at the last local elections.  I think he was defeated for the nomination and subsequently stood as an Independent but at the time he was appointed to the board his association with the Party was sufficient to put him in a position to go forward for nomination as a Fianna Fáil county councillor in Limerick.</P>
    <P>There is also Mr. Michael O'Callaghan, editor of the <i>Roscommon Herald.</i>  He was a candidate for Fianna Fáil in 1960.  Then we have Mrs. O'Kelly, the widow of the former President who, himself, was a member of a Fianna Fáil Government.  Therefore, we have six people who are publicly actively associated with Fianna Fáil&mdash;people who are not just Fianna Fáil voters but who are openly and actively identified in the public mind with the Party.  There are three others who are not identified.  There is Mr. Fintan Kennedy, though I am not clear <Col N="327" /> that he is an active supporter of the Labour Party&mdash;perhaps I am wrong. There is also Professor Moody and Domhnall Ó Moráin.</P>
    <P>I think it is little short of scandalous that on any State board there should be a predominance of people who are actively associated in the public mind with one particular Party as distinct from having their own private views, and on this board, of all boards, it is vital to public confidence in the board that there should not be such a predominance of people who are actively associated with one particular Party. Individually, they are acceptable, each bringing his own special knowledge and experience to the board but I think it was unwise and improper to have appointed such a board in the first instance.  I would have hoped that on such a board there would have been a minimum of people who are actively associated with politics.  It would be better if at least two-thirds of the board were people who had no active political life or background and the other-third might be political, divided between the different Parties.</P>
    <P>I regret having to refer to people by name but in doing so I am not saying anything to their discredit, but I wish to put the situation on record as I see it.  As I have said, they are individually entirely acceptable and I blame the person who appointed people who are actively engaged with a particular Party to the board.  The board should be, and be seen to be, above politics. As I have said, except in one instance there has been no evidence of interference from these people.  The staff and organisation of Radio Telefís Éireann have clearly and evidently maintained their independence throughout the existence of the organisation.  We have reason to be grateful to the staff and organisation of Radio Telefís Éireann for the way they have maintained their independence.  Except for the cases where they have accepted the suppression of particular programmes under pressure from the Government, they have maintained an impartial and independent view.  Every political Party has suffered at times from exposure to the interviewers of RTE.  We have all <Col N="328" /> suffered about equally and I do not think we have anything to complain about.  They have done such a good job that RTE has overcome to a considerable degree the problem created by the uneven composition of the board of the Authority.  But it should be a principle of all Governments in future that the board should be such as to command confidence and not to arouse suspicion which, in most cases, may well be justified by interference by the board in the particular interest of one particular Party.</P>
    <P>I move on now from that slightly distasteful subject, which I did not wish to have to raise, but which was forced on me by the composition of the board.  The fourth requirement that I mentioned was legislation.  Legislation should be such as to ensure in as far as possible the independence of the Authority.  Experience has shown that the legislation drawn up and enacted in 1960 has one or two defects.  There are one or two areas where it needs to be tightened up.  I think I have pinpointed in this Bill the areas which need attention and I have put forward reasonable solutions to the problems but, of course, if any other Member of the House has a suggestion to make as to how the deficiencies in the original legislation could be better dealt with, I would be more than happy to accept any reasonable proposals of this kind on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I can see difficulties concerning some of the proposals I have made and I shall be glad of assistance from both sides of the House in improving the proposed legislation before it.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the Bill itself and deal briefly with various changes I have in mind.  The first section is, of course, the one naming the Act and defining the &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; as the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  The second section is concerned with the appointment of the Director General and proposes that his appointment or removal by the Minister should require the consent of a body comprising, as well as the Minister, &ldquo;the Chairman of An Comhairle Ealaíon, a nominee of the editors of the daily morning newspapers and a nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> It is important that the method of appointment of the Director General should be one that would command public confidence.  The method of appointment has given satisfactory results so far, but it is not one which commands public confidence.  The Authority have, since this Bill was originally introduced&mdash;certainly since it was originally thought of&mdash;appointed a Director General who is entirely satifactory and against whom I have no criticism to make; but the principle should be established that if the board can be appointed as they are, some check should be required on their power to appoint a Director General or to dismiss him, so that we can ensure that their power is exercised properly as, I must say, it was in the particular instance of the last appointment.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the board's power to remove the Director General should be limited&mdash;that the board should not for political reasons be in a position to remove a Director General who has offended them in some way politically, perhaps, by his impartiality. This is unlikely to happen, and I am quite sure that the present board, despite their political complexion, would not contemplate doing anything of the kind.  However, we are concerned with the principle.  If the board are to be appointed politically&mdash;if they can be and are a predominantly political board&mdash;then, because of this circumstance, some extra safeguard is required in the matter of the appointment and the removal of the Director General.  Even if we accept that the present board would not abuse their powers, the fact that such a board can be appointed could lead to an abuse of political power.</P>
    <P>It is the purpose of legislation to guard against all eventualities and it is not a good answer for the Minister to say he would not abuse this power.  He might not, but one of his successors could.  There is need for constraint here and the constraint should be more than the approval of the Minister who would himself be of the same complexion politically as the board which he had appointed.  Though I am by no means convinced that this is the best <Col N="330" /> solution, I think it offers a solution to the present situation of having politically-dominated boards with power to remove the Director General subject only to the Minister's approval.  This provision is open to amendment and I am sure the House may suggest better ways of achieving this.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is concerned with the expression of free speech on controversial issues on radio and television. The provisions of section 17 of the Principal Act are such that they might be interpreted in a way which would limit freedom of speech on controversial issues and it seems to me desirable that in section 17&mdash;which requires that the Authority, in carrying out their work, should have regard to national aims&mdash;there should be a provision ensuring that this will not be interpreted too narrowly.  &ldquo;Having regard to national aims&rdquo; might mean that one would not be able to debate the ways of achieving these aims, much less the validity of the aims themselves.  What might be regarded as national aims and accepted by the majority as such, might not be accepted by all.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the reunification of this country.  There are people in this country&mdash;I mean the whole island&mdash; who do not share this view.  Though I think they are wrong and though I hope they will be persuaded to change their views, I must stand on the proposition of the right to express that view, not in an inflammatory manner with a view to arousing one man against another&mdash; and radio and television should be careful not to give free rein to inflammatory agitators who might seek to create violence&mdash;but subject to that limitation which must always be there, it is important that free speech should exist in the press and on radio and television, particularly on radio and television because of their great emotive power.</P>
    <P>As I said, subject to the limitation I have explained, it is vital that the views of minorities shall be catered for.  I fear that section 17 of the Principal Act can be interpreted too narrowly to say that in order to pursue the national aims there should not be permitted the expression of alternative viewpoints.  This has happened.  There has been a case where a proposed discussion on the <Col N="331" /> means of reviving the Irish language and of preserving it, and the extent to which one would go to achieve this purpose, was unable to take place because of the interpretation by the Authority of section 17 and the sending out of an instruction to the staff requiring a balanced discussion.</P>
    <P>The section has been interpreted in such a way that if there is a boycott of a programme by the majority view, the minority view may not be expressed. This principle was rejected by the Authority in relation to a political discussion in the case of the boycott of &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; by Fianna Fáil.  That was not allowed to prevent the programme going out because RTE stood their ground, deciding that nobody has a right by refusing to appear to prevent the expression of a minority view.  I may say that even if my own Party had boycotted the programme for some reason, I would still hold this view. However, the principle was rejected by the Authority in the case of the Irish language discussion.  A programme was cancelled because nobody would appear to represent the Irish language organisations and the expression of the view of the LFM was banned because the Irish language bodies, knowing the views that would be expressed by the minority, refused to appear knowing that in that way they could prevent the minority view being expressed.</P>
    <P>That is a most dangerous principle. Thank God it was rejected in the political sphere.  In the sphere dealing with a national issue open to debate, in which a minority view exists shared by, I suppose, a million people in Northern Ireland and some hundreds of thousands here&mdash;perhaps, altogether by one-third of our people&mdash;the expression of the minority view was not broadcast because of the veto put on it by people holding the majority view.</P>
    <P>It is in order to assert this vital principle that I put down this amendment, which clarifies section 17 and provides that the Authority shall at all times maintain the right of free speech and shall make provision for adequate representation of the minority viewpoint. This provision would mean that nobody would be permitted to interfere <Col N="332" /> with the expression of a minority viewpoint from all parts of the national territory.</P>
    <P>Here I wish to press this point about the national territory.  Being partly from Northern Ireland, I, perhaps, take a different view from some people whose background is solely southern. As somebody who is half Northern Irish, indeed, half Presbyterian rather than Roman Catholic and half Presbyterian-Unionist rather than Catholic-Nationalist, I am, perhaps, more sensitive to the partition-mindedness of the people in the south. It seems to me that many people in the south in the matter of politics think solely in terms of a 26-county State.</P>
    <P>I had the experience once&mdash;once only and never again&mdash;of addressing a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party, a research group, on the subject of the Irish language.  I was very kindly invited to do so.  At that time I had not a particular political commitment, and they asked me to speak.  I expressed the viewpoint that using methods of compulsion was divisive and was alienating a part of our people unnecessarily. This viewpoint found support from about one-third of those present to the horror and shock of some of the older members, one of whom was speechless, when they had to report back of their study group what their views were. Several of the people who reported back for their study groups on that occassion described me as being somewhat Orange.  It was extraordinary logic that I should be so described because I expressed the view that the Irish language could be a divisive influence if made compulsory, thereby telling a million people in Northern Ireland we do not want them and that if they come to this country they are not going to get any jobs serving the State.</P>

Those people were totally Twenty-Six-County-minded; they did not seem to think in terms of a 32 Counties nation within which there exist a million people who have a divergent view on a number of issues, a divergent view they are entitled to express.  If we are serious in our views that this is one nation, one part of which is for the time being alienated, then we should give minority rights to people in all parts of the national territory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not challenging his right to have it.  I am only trying to suggest he had a right to express it.  There should be a guarantee of the expression of minority views on RTE because under the present arrangement, with the misinterpretation of section 17, minority views can be and are being suppressed in this part of the country.  I should like to extend this right of expression of minority views to Northern Ireland.  I must say, in fairness, RTE have, in fact, not only because of recent developments but <Col N="334" /> before that, given a degree of coverage to Northern Ireland affairs greater than has been customary in this rather insular part of the country where we have tended to ignore Northern Ireland, and that it has from time to time given an opportunity for the minority to express their views on various issues. There has not been any attempt to suppress those views in regard to general issues, though there has been in regard to the Irish language.  But because of what has happened in regard to the Irish language, we think it is important that the principle should be laid down that all minority views should be given due expression and should have adequate representation from all parts of the national territory.</P>
      <P>I should like to see it accepted as a normal thing that, in political discussions about general matters, matters which are not local to one or other of the two parts of this island, whether it is the EEC, Vietnam or other general matters outside this country, the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, representing about a quarter of the Irish people, should be represented in any such discussions.  They are one of the political Parties in this our country, whereas hitherto we have tended to think of the North as alien, separate and something to be shut out and forgotten about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they should be equally represented.  I thought it unnecessary to suggest that.  I did not think anyone would quarrel with that, but I know people who would quarrel with the other proposition.  That then is the reason for section 3.  I think I have shown the need for it because we have a situation where minority views can be suppressed or a veto exercised by the majority, and I think I have shown the philosophy behind the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several points on section 4.  It is designed to secure that the impartiality requirement in section 18 of the Principal Act is not used to limit programmes of speech or comment other than news bulletins.  The wording of section 18 is a little bit unhappy, a <Col N="335" /> little bit ambiguous, a little bit obscure. I think the people drafting it perhaps did not know enough about the actual working of a television station, and the wording of it is such as to create some problems of interpretation.  It must be said again that the actual interpretation here has been liberal.  It has not been interpreted rigidly or in such a way that in programmes run by the news department or in a public affairs programme no viewpoint can be expressed at all and that Radio Éireann or RTE commentators must merely ask totally neutral questions. It has not been interpreted in that restrictive way, but it could be so interpreted. There was the situation in relation to the news department and &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; some time ago which raised this issue in a concrete form, and it does seem to be desirable to clarify the position and to distinguish clearly between a news bulletin on one hand, which is an impartial statement of fact, or should be, and the programmes of comment, discussion and debate on public affairs after the bulletin or at some other time during the evening.  Interviewers or commentators on RTE should be able to pose tough questions in order to get people to give their true viewpoint, tough questions which could be regarded as biased in particular instances, but which should be posed equally to Government and Opposition.  There should be no inhibition in this regard.  I agree in regard to news bulletins that there should not be any intrusive comment from the news reader which might bias the presentation. We want to narrow down the area of &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; to news bulletins and to leave the rest free, as it is, in fact, free at the moment, for the expression of views.  My amendment will bring the law more into better relation with the realities and in that respect it is perhaps desirable.</P>
    <P>I have also suggested the insertion of a new subsection which will make it quite clear that the impartiality requirement shall not require that every view expressed shall individually be impartial but that taking one programme with another over a period the effect shall be impartial.  Again this is the practice of the Authority.  There <Col N="336" /> might be a programme in which there is an interview with a TD of one Party which might show him up in a bad light, perhaps more because of his own characteristics than because of the interview, and that programme may be regarded as either advantageous or disadvantageous to the Party concerned, taking it in isolation.  However, the important thing is that overall there should be impartiality in the case of all political Parties with no quarter given or favouritism shown to any.  In fact that is what is done, and I have no complaint in that regard. However, the present legislation does not make this clear, and I think it is worthwhile to make it clear that officers of the Authority shall be free to comment, as they do&mdash;after all, what is the political correspondent of RTE doing but commenting on politics every time he goes on the air&mdash;on political matters, whereas the legislation might seem to suggest that they are not free to comment.  They must present different views on matters of public controversy over a period of time, and maintain a balance also in programmes involving politics.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of this proposed subsection there is another provision which I think is important and which says:</P>
    <P>...the Authority shall be free to transmit programmes in which a representative of a political party, whether a member of the Oireachtas or not, appears, provided that a general balance is maintained between such appearances and such programmes.</P>
    <P>This might seem unnecessary.  One might say that, surely to goodness, there is nothing to stop them from appearing.  This is not the case.  I have had personal experience over a period of years of being told by various people on Radio Telefís Éireann that my appearance on various types of programmes was impossible because I was in politics.  Let me give an example.  It was proposed that I would give a lecture in the series of Thomas Davis Lectures, which are historical lectures. They could, of course, be controversial if they were dealing with a recent <Col N="337" /> period.  Nevertheless, they are historical lectures.  I think I was asked in a non-political capacity and I would have contributed in a non-political capacity. I do not think any particular political issue was involved in the lecture.  Subsequently I was told that I could not appear on the grounds of a rule I had never heard of &mdash; I wondered for a moment if it had been invented on the spur of the moment&mdash;that no politicians may appear for more than one-quarter of an hour unless there is another politician there to contradict him!  This is quite an extraordinary rule.  The Thomas Davis lecture lasts for half an hour and therefore under this rule a politician could not lecture on history, on archaeology, and so on, unless there was another politician there to tell him he was archaeologically unsound, and so on.  This is a silly rule, if it still exists, to be put forward as a reason why a politician could not appear in the series.  It did not worry me much but it remained in my mind as an example of arbitrary treatment of politicians.</P>
    <P>We need a clear arrangement that a politician may appear on any programme so long as a balance is maintained over a series of programmes, between different politicians.  To have a rule that a politician may not speak for a certain length of time on a political issue unless there is another politician there to correct him is silly. I have heard, recently, that, under a new arrangement, there is no such rule and that the rule has been abolished: but this is hearsay.  We should know what the position is.  Would the Minister please state what are or have been the rules about the appearances of politicians on Radio Telefís Éireann?  I felt at times that it looked like a three-card trick.  We cannot play the game if we do not know the rules&mdash;if whoever is proposed for an appearance, there can always be a new rule which means that that person's appearance is out. Politicians are entitled to be told the rules about their appearances on Radio Telefís Éireann instead of having new rules on each occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the House will agree with me on this.  I feel I ought to be on a fairly good wicket on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolute nonsense.  I have never asked for permission from a Whip in matters such as this.  The next area of sensitivity is this question of the giving of directions to the Authority on matters of national interest.  I think it is right and entirely proper that the public authorities should have power to give a direction that certain things shall not be broadcast&mdash;and, indeed, that certain things shall be broadcast on certain occasions.  This is important.  The public interest could require that something be not broadcast but there should be a very careful procedure in relation to this matter.  It should be clear that it is in the national interest only and my definition of the &ldquo;the national interest&rdquo; is that it is something on which the Government and the Opposition agree.  This may seem naïve but if there is disagreement between the political parties on some particular matter then you cannot say, as a matter of law&mdash;with which we are concerned here&mdash;that one or the other of these views represents the national interest.  It can only be in the national interest if it is the view of the democratic Parties together that it is in the national interest.  If there is a divergence of views on a matter then it is the Government interest rather than the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exercise of the power to suppress a programme in the national interest is something which should be exercised not just by the Government but by the Government in conjunction with the Opposition.  In drafting this amendment, I had thought originally of requiring <Col N="339" /> that any such direction should be countersigned by the Leaders of both Opposition Parties, but there are practical problems involved.  Sometimes a Minister may hear something at a very late stage and may have to act urgently to get it stopped and, at such a time, to have to chase after the Leader of the other political Party may be a bit much. On such an occasion, if it is countersigned by one leader, this is practical politics&mdash;if it is signed by the Leader of one of the principal Opposition Parties or his authorised representative. This would give us a safeguard against the arbitrary use of the power the Minister possesses to suppress the broadcasting of a programme.</P>
    <P>It is also important if the Minister exercises his power to make an announcement&mdash;the power to give a direction that any Minister shall make an announcement in the public interest &mdash;that this should be accompanied by a statement that this appearance is the consequence of a direction.  It is not good to have Ministers appearing as a result of a direction, given against the views of the Authority, and that the direction is kept secret or that the public think the Minister comes along on the invitation of the Authority whereas, in fact, the Authority may feel it is quite inappropriate for the Minister to speak and may not want him to do so but may be forced to allow it on a written direction to have him speak.  Therefore, if a Minister appears as a result of a written direction that information should be incorporated in an announcement preceding his appearance on television.  Also, where, in fact, something is suppressed, this should, in the ordinary way, appear subsequently in the Annual Report unless, again, the Opposition concur with the Minister that it is in the public interest to suppress this programme and that its suppression should not be known.  Unless there is a real national issue interest at stake and both sides of the House feel it should be suppressed and that it should not be known&mdash;unless those conditions are fulfilled&mdash;such a direction should be published in the Annual Report of the Authority.  It will normally be at least three or four months after the <Col N="340" /> broadcast that the Report is published, so there is not a question of immediate publication.  Those are my points.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is imperative that there will be complete confidence in the impartiality of Radio Telefís Éireann and there should be some external guarantee of its impartiality.  Personally, except where programmes are suppressed on the request of the Government, I think Radio Telefís Éireann is impartial.  There are cynical people who do not agree, but I think they are wrong.  I said at a meeting of my own Party's Ard Fheis several years ago that, apart from such suppression, I think they are impartial.  Many people do not believe this, however.  I think it is pretty important that they should have the confidence of the country.  Accordingly, I propose that a judge of the High Court, nominated by the Chief Justice, should act as Assessor of Impartiality together with any five members of the public&mdash;these are arbitrary figures.  If people feel there is a departure from impartiality, they should be able to lodge this complaint with this Assessor of Impartiality, who is a judge, and who will then report on the case.  If, in fact, the Assessor of Impartiality considers there was a lack of impartiality and directs that action be taken to remedy this situation, then such remedy shall be carried out by the Authority.</P>
    <P>The existence of such an arrangement, which would, I think, be very little used&mdash;it might be used a little in the beginning until people began to discover that most of their complaints were illusory and found the cases they were putting forward were shot down; after that discovery I think it would not be much used at all&mdash;would be a vital safeguard and an assurance to the many cynical people that Radio Telefís Éireann is impartial.  This is a constructive and helpful suggestion and its implementation would increase confidence in this vital news and entertainment media.</P>
    <P>These are the main proposals in the Bill.  The Bill could have gone further. One could, for instance, have gone so far as to take this whole body out of the control of the Government and create instead a board the members of <Col N="341" /> which would be appointed by other outside bodies.  I am reluctant to do that until it is shown conclusively that the present system cannot be worked satisfactorily and that legislation to that end is not practicable.  I have, therefore, limited myself to these specific proposals, every one of which is justified by the case I have made for it.  I have put down no amendment for which a reasoned case cannot be made. In each instance I have shown the need for amendment either because there is some difficulty at present, some weakness, some performance which is unsatisfactory, or, alternatively, because the amendment proposed would help to improve confidence in the impartiality of Radio Telefís Éireann; I personally have every confidence in Radio Telefís Éireann but not everybody in the country has equal confidence in that body.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to be constructive. It has naturally and necessarily involved criticism of the Government in some respects.  I have tried to be fair in that criticism.  I have limited myself to established public facts except in such instances as those of which I have personal knowledge but which are not public knowledge.  I have avoided any general allegations and, in talking about the Authority and its members, I have tried particularly to be fair.  It is, however, necessary to be critical of the Government in this matter and particularly critical of the viewpoints expressed by Deputy Lemass, as Taoiseach, and by Deputy Aiken, Minister for External Affairs.  I have tried to criticise in a non-contentious manner, a manner, indeed, which ought, I think, to command the support of many people on the other side of this House.  Many people on the other side of this House share my concern that Radio Telefís Éireann should be, and should be seen to be, an impartial body.  I know people on the other side of this House have been unhappy about some of the things which have happened and about the phraseology used by the Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken, and by Deputy Lemass, as Taoiseach.  I should not be surprised if the Minister himself was not somewhat unhappy on this score.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> The introduction of this Bill provides us with an opportunity of improving the position and remedying the defects that exist.  It should lead, if the Bill is accepted, to an increase in public confidence in Radio Telefís Éireann and a reduction in the number of criticisms, sometimes misguided, that have been made against the Authority and against the Government in relation to it.  I hope the Bill will be accepted as a useful contribution. It is, as I have said, open to amendment.  It is my hope that, if the Bill is accepted at this stage, we will have a constructive debate on the Committee Stage, on which Stage any amendments from the other side of the House can be considered and, in most instances, probably be accepted so that we can properly amend the original legislation in a manner which will clearly show that it is not just this side of the House but the whole House which is particularly concerned to ensure the maintenance of freedom of speech through public communications media and the maintenance of public confidence in the impartiality of such media.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. The Labour Party support this Bill. We are concerned to ensure that Radio Telefís Éireann is regarded as an impartial body and will not give rise to suspicion of its being an instrument of the Government or of Government policy.  It is now nearly nine years since we debated the original enactment which this Bill proposes to amend.  It is fair to say that the Seanad did a good job on the original Bill and it is equally fair to say that Telefís Éireann, despite the criticisms which are made from time to time, has done a good job.  It has provided a fairly good service.  I would like it to continue to give that good service.  I should also like Telefís Éireann to have the confidence of the general body of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various things have happened. Senator Garret FitzGerald has enumerated them.  These things that have happened have given rise to a suspicion <Col N="343" /> that Telefís Éireann, possibly in spite of internal opposition, was being controlled in some instances by the Government and that, as I said, against the wishes of Telefís Éireann itself.  It is of the utmost importance that the general body of the public should have confidence in Telefís Éireann as an impartial body, a body above suspicion, a body which is not the instrument of whatever Government may be in power.</P>
    <P>We had the incident of the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team being brought back when they were half way to Biafra.  I do not know why that should have happened. The team do a good programme.  They are impartial in their presentation of facts.  Biafra and what is happening there is certainly something of very great interest to the people.  I understand that &ldquo;Radharc&rdquo; have recently made a film on location in Biafra.  This has not yet been shown.  There are rumours that pressures are being brought to bear on Telefís Éireann to prevent it being shown.  I hope these rumours are not well-founded.  If it is a good film and worthy of presentation to the viewing public then I trust the viewing public will have an opportunity of seeing it.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I should like to make.  There have been occasions&mdash;possibly isolated occasions, but nevertheless very important occasions&mdash;on which Telefís Éireann has been regarded by this Government as an instrument of their policy to be used in a Party political interest.  Here I should like to point out that in a most important matter, a matter of great national importance, namely, the referendum, and the campaign leading up to it, Telefís Éireann did a good job and was utterly impartial in its presentation of the campaign.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons I support this Bill.  As I said, the original Act was a good one and the Seanad did a good job on it but, after eight or nine years, it is time we took a look at our experience of what has happened, the more so as Telefís Éireann is growing in importance.  Eight or nine years ago we regarded television as a very important matter.  Our actual experience in the <Col N="344" /> interim has shown that it is becoming increasingly important.  I am not altogether happy about one aspect of the Bill and, if it goes forward to Committee Stage, we will be putting down an amendment to section 5, the section in which it is provided that, if a direction in writing is given by the Minister to the Authority, that direction must be countersigned by the Leader of one of the principal Opposition Parties.  I would say that in a matter like this it should be countersigned by the two Leaders of the principal Opposition Parties as they are at the moment.</P>

      <P>We have not got three or four political Parties at the moment. I say this because there would be a natural suspicion amongst the Labour Party people that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in many instances would be concerned to maintain the <i>status quo,</i> and would not want criticism or presentation of facts which might be regarded as embarrassing or disturbing.  There would certainly be a temptation to enter into a conspiracy to prevent presentations which might be regarded by the Labour Party as being of importance and which should not be subject to ministerial direction or instruction to Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>We support the general principles of the Bill which is designed to improve and amend the original measure.  If we come to Committee Stage I shall be putting down an amendment to section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a number of interesting views on Telefís Éireann on this Bill.  I would agree with some of the views expressed but many of them were irrelevant to the provisions of the Bill.  None, in fact, in my view justified the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald started on a rather high note, on what might be described as a dissertation on political philosophy.  When he dealt with the distinction between Government services and national services he made the point that Telefís Éireann was or should be a national service and that, in that sense, it was unlike any of the other <Col N="345" /> State bodies or any of the other bodies under the control of the Government.  If we examine this proposition we will see that there is very little validity in it.</P>
    <P>All Government Departments, all semi-State bodies, all bodies under the control of the Government are or should be national services in the sense that none of them is there merely in the interests of the Government, and none of them is there merely to facilitate the Government in putting across their point of view or their policy.  They are all national services and Telefís Éireann is no different from any of these State or semi-State bodies in that way.</P>
    <P>Certainly I agree fully with Senator FitzGerald when he says it should be viewed as a national department, an instrument of national policy, and not in any narrow way, but basically it is no different from any of the other Government Departments or State or semi-State bodies over which the Government have control of one kind or another.  Undoubtedly there are strong arguments to suggest that so far as possible Telefís Éireann should be given every possible independence in the way in which programmes are balanced and the way in which views are allowed to be expressed.  It must be given almost complete independence but there is a proviso.  It must not be given full independence because the Government must in the ultimate have control over Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>It must be realised&mdash;and this House in particular should remember&mdash;that the present Authority was set up by an Act of the Oireachtas.  That Act was drafted as a Bill by the Government. It must be realised that Telefís Éireann is financed out of public funds.  It must be realised that ultimately the Government must take responsibility for Telefís Éireann, for the way in which it is administered, and the way it carries out its business.  This is not merely something which the Government have a right to do; it is something which the Government have a duty to do.  The Government would be failing utterly in their duty if they took the view that what happens in relation to Telefís Éireann is none of their business, and if they took the view that Telefís Éireann should go its own way regardless of <Col N="346" /> what it did and regardless of what was said in broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald recognises this fact because in one of his amendments dealing with the question of direction by the Minister, the way in which the Minister can direct the Authority to do or not to do a certain thing, he does not suggest that this power should be abolished: he merely suggests it should be curtailed by the direction being endorsed by the Leader of one of the Opposition Parties.  By adopting that view he acknowledges the fact that, in the long run, the Government have a responsibility and a right to interfere or intervene in certain circumstances. What we are discussing here today is not really whether the Government have a right and a duty to intervene in what Telefís Éireann does but the extent to which they should interfere, the extent that is permissible, and also the way in which they should intervene when they consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>In discussing this question of intervention by the Government, Senator FitzGerald has given a number of examples of how it has taken place in recent years, but his examples are so qualified, and he had so many reservations about them, that really there is practically no concrete case which he is able to put forward as an example of how the Government intervened and should not have intervened.  He introduced most of the cases he mentioned by saying he had no reason to believe the Government did intervene in such cases but that something happened out there and the suggestion was that the Government must have intervened.  He then went on to paint in a rather alarming way the danger and undesirability of Government intervention.  He mentioned in particular the case of Biafra as being one of the most dramatic cases of intervention.</P>

      <P>Although he admits at the beginning that the Government did not intervene he suggests and implies that the Government were at fault.  As I said, several cases were mentioned. The Mount Pleasant case was mentioned as a case where the Minister for Local Government made an inquiry and so on, and again he had to admit that the Minister had not intervened or asked the Authority not to put on this programme, but the whole implication of his discussion before and after was to suggest that this was, in fact, a case of Government intervention.</P>
      <P>No Government, no Party, no person can stand up to this kind of innuendo, to this kind of smear campaign, of suggesting that something was done by the Government and at the same time saying he has no evidence it was, he is not really suggesting it was but then to go on and describe the evils of intervention. This is the kind of thing that can ruin a person's reputation by saying that of course you have no evidence, no reason to believe that X is sleeping with Y's wife at the moment but at the same time you have heard such and such.  You are planting the suggestion that this in fact is taking place.  This is the kind of innuendo which I am afraid I can only describe as a smear campaign and something which no Government, no political Party and no person can really stand up against or can really fight against.</P>
      <P>As far as the examples given by Senator FitzGerald are concerned I think they can be described as no more than suggestions, innuendoes which do not stand up to careful examination even when he examines them himself.</P>

      <P>In no case was there proof that the Government or a Minister <Col N="348" /> had forbidden a thing or intervened so that the Authority or the Director General had to take something off.  I will deal afterwards with the situation as regards what the Authority can do and what the Authority should do.  Senator Murphy said, when he was dealing with this, that a number of things had happened in Montrose in recent years which left the suspicion that the Government had intervened.  Well, if we are dealing with a situation in which there is suspicion that the Government intervened we are dealing with something that is not very serious because there will always be suspicion that somebody or other and particularly the Government intervened in a case of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts about intervention, the facts about the extent to which the Government can intervene are very clear.  The powers laid down in the 1960 Act are very clear.  The Oireachtas at that time, this House and the Dáil and the Government did their very best to ensure that Telefís Éireann would be independent.  They did their best to ensure that it was as far as possible an Authority which would carry on its business, particularly its day-to-day business&mdash;putting on its programmes and so on&mdash;with the absolute minimum of interference by the Government.  The fact is that the Authority can disregard any intervention by anybody unless the Minister gives a direction to do a certain thing or not to do a certain thing. This is the only power which the Government have.  This is the only power which the Minister has and the Authority can thumb its nose at any other intervention or attempted intervention by the Government or by anybody else as far as that is concerned. The fact is that sometimes a Minister or the Government can make representations to the Authority or to the Director General and suggest that something should not be put on and of course the Authority and the Director General may agree on reflection that the representation is a valid one and just because it is a valid one and just because the Authority decides that it is well-grounded does not mean in these circumstances that undue or undesirable intervention is taking place.  It <Col N="349" /> does not mean that the independence of the Authority is in any way being undermined.  It merely means that a representation has been made, that a view has been expressed and that the Authority, on reflection, agrees that it is a valid representation and acts on it.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like to say is that the Minister, apart from the fact that he can in certain very unusual cases give a direction, has no rights whatever to intervene in the affairs of Telefís Éireann, but on the other hand there is no special restriction on Ministers. There is nothing in the Act which says that a Minister just because he is a Minister cannot express his views to Telefís Éireann.  He has the same rights as any other citizen in the country to make his views known to Telefís Éireann.  He has the same right to protest against a proposed programme, the same right to say that a programme should not go on or should not go on in the form in which it is proposed, the same right to say that another programme should go on possibly to counteract one that has gone on. People all over the country, bodies all over the country do this.  There is no organisation in this country of any kind, political or otherwise, which is not constantly making representation; making its views known to Telefís Éireann and there is no reason either why a member of the Government or a member of any Party or a politician has not the right to make his views known to Telefís Éireann if he wants to do so.  The fact about intervention is that Ministers have no rights to intervene but there is no restriction on them either against making their views known if they feel that they want to do so.  Both facts should be recognised and both facts should be balanced against one another to give us a fair view of the rights on the one hand of the Authority and the rights on the other hand of Ministers and politicians.</P>
    <P>When dealing with this question of views and representations Senator FitzGerald uses loaded words.</P>

      <P>One is suppression, the other is legitimate objection.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the Bill in any detail but I should like to say a few words about some of the sections of the Bill.  It is proposed in section 2 that before the Authority appoints or removes the Director General, or alters his terms of employment, not only must the Minister give his consent but a list of persons laid down in the Amending Act must also consent, that is the chairman of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, a nominee of the editors of the daily papers and a nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Why should this particular appointment be subject to this particular kind of complication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the composition of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have several semi-State bodies all of which have Director Generals of one kind or another, all of whom are very important men and it is essential that we should get the best possible man, but in no case do we have to have this particular kind of complicated form of getting the consent of a number of people to the appointment of the board in question.  The appointment of a Director General is already under the Act removed from the control, from the hands of the Government.  The Government have no power of initiating or suggesting who he should be.  Under the Bill the Minister has merely power to approve or disapprove of the person suggested by the Authority.  What kind of man are we going to get who will satisfy all the members of the peculiar panel suggested by Senator FitzGerald?  Because, remember, this panel will have no means of selecting the Director General; they will merely have the power to consent and that means that they will have to take full responsibility for anything this man does without <Col N="351" /> having the opportunity of suggesting who he should be.  This is a form of power which it is very difficult to exercise and one which I am quite sure the panel in question would have grave doubts about adopting.</P>
      <P>Just think for a moment of some of the peculiar consequences of having this panel.  If any one of the panel objects to the particular person suggested, then he cannot be appointed. Even though the Authority select what they think is the best man, even though the Minister consents, even though all the other members of the panel agree that he is the best man, if one man does not consent, the appointment cannot be made.  That is bad enough.  Think of the other side of the penny, which is even more ludicrous.  If any one of the people suggested does not agree to the removal of a Director General, he can never be removed.  So, all that a Director General needs under this section is that he should have one faithful friend on the panel and, according to the Bill, he must remain there for the rest of his life because he cannot be removed without the consent of the people mentioned in this section.  This is an indication of the lack of realism about some of the sections in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In any event, if we are going to have a kind of watchdog on the Minister, a watchdog on the Authority, why this particular group?  Why should we have a representative of the trade unions and not of the Federated Union of Employers?  Why should not the farmers be represented on this panel? Why should there not be a representative of the licence holders?  There are 101 kinds of panels that you could have to do this.  Why this particular one?  I certainly think that I could think up a better panel than the one suggested.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain that every Member of the Seanad could think up one of his own that would be at least as good as this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to deal very briefly with section 3.  Section 3 says that the Authority shall at all times maintain <Col N="352" /> the right of free speech and shall make provision for adequate representation of minority viewpoints in all parts of the national territory.  In my submission it is no function of the Authority to maintain the right of free speech.  This right of free speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and the custodian of this right is not the Authority of Telefís Éireann; the custodian of this right is the Supreme Court and the other courts.  If anybody, including the Authority of Radio Telefís Éireann, infringes the right of free speech, then any citizen who has his rights infringed has a remedy by going to the courts.  It is quite unnecessary to put into this Bill a statment that Radio Telefís Éireann shall maintain the right of free speech. It is not their duty, it is not their function, any more than it is the function of any other State body.  If they infringe that right, then there is a way of dealing with them and there is no necessity to put it into this Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the representation of minority interests, nobody can deny that Radio Telefís Éireann is certainly providing for that at the present time. In fact, if anybody has a legitimate complaint at the moment about representation of their viewpoints it is more likely to be the people who hold the majority viewpoints because it is usually those who have minority viewpoints, who have extreme views of one kind or another, who are featured on Radio Telefís Éireann.  This is understandable because people with minority points of view are usually more vocal, usually have more sensational things to say and Telefís Éireann, not unnaturally, are inclined to give them more time because it is more interesting usually.  Certainly, nobody can maintain that minority viewpoints are being neglected by Telefís Éireann at the moment.</P>
    <P>How far are the Authority to go if they have to do what this section says, if they have to make provision for adequate representation of minority viewpoints in all parts of the national territory?  There is scarcely a citizen in the country who has not got a minority viewpoint about something or other. Are Radio Telefís Éireann to be obliged to give time on their network to allow <Col N="353" /> everybody with a minority viewpoint to express this viewpoint on Radio Telefís Éireann?  The provisions of the original Act which ensure that there is impartiality about viewpoints on controversial subjects adequately deal with this point and it is wrong and will certainly lead to a great deal of difficulty if the Authority are specifically obliged to give time for the representation of every minority viewpoint.</P>
    <P>As regards section 4, which deals with impartiality, all I can say is that, in my view, it represents no improvement whatever on the section that exists.  It deals with section 18 of the Principal Act.  I have read that particular section of the Principal Act several times and have compared it with what is proposed in this amendment. In my view, the question of impartiality is dealt with much more effectively in the Act as it stands at the moment and the introduction of the amendment proposed in this Bill would weaken rather than strengthen the position and would not achieve the purpose which Senator FitzGerald wants to achieve.</P>
    <P>As regards section 5, I fully agree with the suggestion that the Authority must have as much independence as possible but, as I have said already, there must be a limit to this and the limit is provided for by section 31 of the Principal Act which allows the Minister in certain cases to give a direction to the Authority.  Broadcasting, as we all know, is an extremely influential medium and there is no doubt that it can sway public opinion very considerably at times.  I do not think anybody denies that there are cases where it would be necessary for the Minister to intervene and say that a certain thing should not be broadcast or that a certain type of thing should not be broadcast or to ask that a certain programme be broadcast.  I do not think that anybody who thinks about it will fail to think up several examples of cases where a certain policy has been adopted by the Government, a certain policy has even been adopted and agreed by the entire Oireachtas and where Telefís Éireann might attempt to put on programmes which would be contrary to the policy and the measures <Col N="354" /> adopted by the Government.  It is absolutely essential that in such circumstances the Government should have that power.</P>
    <P>The amendment suggested in this Bill is that the Leader of the Opposition should countersign the direction.</P>

      <P>It is quite unrealistic to expect a Leader of an Opposition Party to endorse an action by the Government for which the Government must take responsibility when there is no reason why the Leader of an Opposition Party should do so.  It is quite unrealistic in such circumstances that a Leader of an Opposition Party should be expected to endorse a direction in that case.  If we have two or three Opposition Parties it is even more unrealistic to expect all of them to endorse a direction of this kind from the Government.</P>
      <P>Secondly, apart from that objection to this particular amendment, it must be realised that very often such a direction has to be given very quickly if it has to have any effect and the difficulty of finding the Leader of an Opposition Party or Leaders of the Opposition Parties first of all, persuading them to sign it&mdash;they would almost inevitably say they would have to consult their Parties before agreeing &mdash;makes the whole thing so ridiculous that I think it is not necessary to follow the suggestion any further.</P>
      <P>This power in section 31 is the only power which the Government has with regard to directing the Authority to do anything.  In all other respects the Authority is completely independent and free to do what it likes.  This is the one remaining power left to the Government. I think the Oireachtas and the Government have gone a long way towards ensuring that Telefís Éireann will be independent and I think it is unreasonable to suggest that the Government should hand over the one remaining power it has, not merely hand it over altogether but what Senator FitzGerald is suggesting is to hand it over to the Opposition so that the Government in fact retains no power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event I would ask the Seanad is this power which is criticised, this power under section 31, being abused? Has it been abused?  How many times has it been used?  Senator FitzGerald <Col N="356" /> says that as far as he knows it has never been used&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <P>I am perfectly certain that if it had been used and if it had been abused we would have heard about it long before now, so that the suggestion that this has been abused certainly does not stand up to examination. The Senator said that as far as he knew it had not been used but he was not sure and so far as I know it has not been used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am perfectly certain if it had been used and if it had been abused we would have heard about it. I ask is this, in the circumstances, a live issue?  Or, to use a cliché that has been used over and over again here usually to my annoyance, is there any demand for this particular section?  In the case of everything introduced by the Government in this House, we are asked is there any demand for it?  For once, I should like to use that rather absurd cliché and ask is there any demand for the curtailing of the one remaining power which the Minister has under section 31?  I do not believe that there is any demand for it or any convincing reason for curtailing that power in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I come to section 6 of the Bill I find it difficult to believe that this section was seriously intended.  We are to have a man called an assessor of impartiality.  It sounds very much like one of the characters out of Gilbert and Sullivan, the lord high executioner, the lord assessor of impartiality.  There are many functions in my view arising from administration, arising from disputes about the way in which Government Departments administer the country, which could, to the benefit of the country be carried out by judges but this is certainly not one of the ways in which I would recommend that the <Col N="357" /> judiciary be brought in to adjudicate on disputes of this kind.  When it comes to a question of legal practice, from the legal point of view, when it comes to assessing the impact of words, the effect and meaning of a word, far from adopting the last word in this line of country this is the one case where judges consider themselves to be inappropriate and unsuitable for making a final decision.</P>
    <P>In defamation cases where the effect of words has to be considered, in the interpretation of wills where the effect and impact of words has to be considered, in such exact cases the court hands over the interpretation of words to a jury because they feel they are not the appropriate people to make a decision of that kind.  In these cases the judge steps aside and allows a jury, the man in the street, to decide what exactly was the impact or the effect of the words used. Contrary to the legal practice this Bill proposes that a judge should come in and be a judge of impartiality to decide whether or not a number of programmes, a number of views expressed, add up to impartiality or not.</P>
    <P>This particular proposal is quite ludicrous.  It is ill-conceived and completely unrealistic.  Finally, we must realise in discussing Telefís Éireann that television is seen by some hundreds of thousands of people every day. On television people are constantly expressing views, putting on programmes with which many people, probably at least half the audience, every night, disagree or they disapprove of something or other that they saw during the evening.  Consequently the programmes are bound to give rise to complaints and to suggestions that there was a lack of impartiality and no matter what is done by the present Authority, by the present Director General, or by the original Bill or by any amendment of it, these criticisms will inevitably go on.  In his effort to remedy this situation in which people are complaining and criticising Senator Garret FitzGerald and those who propose this Bill have been driven to extreme lengths and they have, to my mind, introduced a Bill which is, in fact, utterly futile and completely unrealistic, however well intentioned <Col N="358" /> they may have been and however right they may be in stating that it is highly important that the Authority and the station should be impartial and should be as independent as possible. There is no final and complete answer to the kind of criticisms that are being made and always will be made.  I am quite certain that the suggestions made in this Bill go no distance at all towards solving a problem which is in any event insoluble but on which something better might have been done than is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  In his last few remarks Senator Eoin Ryan has indicated not so much opposition to the Bill as criticism of some of its provisions. I would hope on Committee Stage that he would take the opportunity to put down amendments along these lines.  I feel, myself, that Senator Garret FitzGerald in bringing in this Bill was eminently fair and did not exaggerate the dangers or whatever points of difference there may have been, but made a very strong case for the acceptance of this Bill, the legitimate purpose of which really is to ensure the free expression of opinion, within the common good, on Telefís Éireann and on Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>One of Senator Ryan's most engaging qualities seems to me to be his innocence.  I take it he gets this from his association with the Bar Library which is regarded as the centre of innocence in this city.  When he expresses the view that, after all, it would be most unfair to prevent a Minister from ringing up Telefís Éireann and saying anything, he is saying that the Minister should be as free to complain as anybody else.  He seems to be missing the point, very innocently, that the representative of Telefís Éireann on the telephone may well attach what Senator Ryan and I would consider undue importance to a representation of an unofficial kind like this from a Minister or a friend of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say at this juncture that my own personal experience both on Telefís Éireann and on Radio Éireann has been always, without exception, one that has given me no personal grounds for complaint.  Telefís Éireann has, in <Col N="359" /> fact, on frequent occasions, perhaps too frequent in the view of some people, invited me to take part not only in programmes like the &ldquo;Late, Late Show&rdquo; or &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; but even on both of their religious programmes, &ldquo;Horizon&rdquo;, the Catholic one, and &ldquo;Signal&rdquo;, the Protestant religious programme. I am not quite sure why I was invited to them.  I may be regarded, perhaps, as the official <i>advocatus diaboli,</i> or possibly I may be regarded by both as being their favourite piece of stony ground.  However, I have been invited to take part in such programmes, and allowed to speak entirely freely.  I might also say I was given an even bigger opportunity also, three or four years ago, by being invited to be interviewed in a programme called &ldquo;Image&rdquo;, in which I was given a half an hour and was interviewed by Proinsias Mac Aonghusa.</P>
    <P>I might mention that one official of Telefís Éireann, arising out of this interview, said as it was video-taped that there was one passage which they feared it might be necessary to cut. This was a passage in which I quoted President de Valera in 1932 and commented on it.  I recalled what he had desired then and declared to be necessary, if we were to behave properly in Ireland and in the world, to bring about, and his view that if we did not do this, we should be &ldquo;failing cruelly and disastrously&rdquo;.  It was felt by one official of Telefís Éireann that, since Mr. de Valera was now our President, it might be thought unwise to broadcast this reference to what he said then and my comment on it.  I argued the point, and I mention it here now in order to say that no cut whatever was, in fact, made when the programme was broadcast.  There was this suggestion that, perhaps, it might prove necessary to have a cut made, but I was allowed in the event to broadcast exactly what I had said.</P>
    <P>I should like also to pay tribute to the present Minister before us today.  I think it is legitimate to do so.  I can recall a time before Telefís Éireann existed at all, and when Radio Éireann had up to then a rather stuffy reputation. The improvement in this situation is due in large measure to the present <Col N="360" /> Minister.  I remember him coming to a public meeting of the Civil Liberty Association in the Mansion House and speaking on &ldquo;Freedom on the Air&rdquo;. He contributed greatly to the improvement of freedom of debate and discussion on radio.  He was helped by officials like Frank MacManus, who, alas, is no longer with us.  I feel this tribute is due to the present Minister. He had an effect on the freedom of speech from Radio Éireann before Telefís Éireann existed.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present extent, which is fairly large, of freedom of speech in both services, is due now in large measure to the freedom exercised by Telefís Éireann, which is pretty wide.</P>
    <P>I might mention another incident in my own personal experience.  It goes back ten years.  I was asked to give a series of discussions on foreign affairs with some other people.  Arising out of a particular discussion I made some comments which the Director General, Mr. Maurice Gorham, thought were unwise even from my own point of view.  The way in which he dealt with that seemed to me very correct and entirely acceptable.  He rang me up and argued the point; he put his point of view; we discussed it in a free manner back and forth and he agreed to allow the thing to go forward, having first argued with me that I should be prepared to alter what I was saying. That does seem to me to be a good approach.  Since it was my talk, he allowed me to say exactly what was in my script.  On those two occasions &mdash;and reference to such occasions should be made&mdash;not only had I no cause for complaint, but every reason to feel I was being treated fairly, and freedom of speech was being granted.</P>
    <P>I see in general a great improvement, of which we are all aware, in the breadth and variety of subjects which can be freely discussed now.  I attribute this partly to the intervention earlier on by the present Minister, and partly to Mr. Maurice Gorham and his successors, and to a great extent, in current days, to the freedom that seems to be demanded by Telefís Éireann. This is due in part to a general desire for more freedom, but one of the basic considerations also is what we might <Col N="361" /> call &ldquo;viewability&rdquo;.  Unless the thing is attractive to the viewer, it is not attractive to the advertiser; and, consequently, a certain amount of freedom is demanded by the people who are paying for the service.  In fairness to the Government of which I am critical on many points, one might, perhaps, venture to remind Senator FitzGerald that the principle of censorship was first introduced into the Oireachtas by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  The Censorship Act was brought in by them.  I am prepared to recall also, of course, that the prominent speaker for Fianna Fáil at that time, Deputy Seán Lemass, criticised the Act on the grounds that it did not go far enough.  It seems to me, therefore, that both Parties must take a certain amount of the blame for censorious restrictions.  However, this is past history, but I do not think it would be fair to suggest that the laws of censorship or the tendency to censor have been confined to any one Government here.  The political Parties and the country itself are improving in this matter of allowing a great deal of freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself, this amending Bill, seems to be for many reasons acceptable. Section 2 which has been criticised by Senator Eoin Ryan, I think unfairly, merely asks that the consent of &ldquo;a body&rdquo; comprising the Minister, the Chairman of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, a nominee of the editors of the daily morning newspapers and a nominee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, should be necessary before appointing or removing the Director General.  It does not seem fair of Senator Eoin Ryan to suggest that if a single member of the body objects, he can block the decision.  It would seem to me that this section is, perhaps, capable of being usefully amended, but certainly not rejected; perhaps Senator Ryan would concede me this point.</P>
    <P>On the question of Government interference, even when a Minister does not interfere, an official or a civil servant may feel that such and such a thing might give offence to a particular Minister and will, in fact, interfere without the Minister having taken any practical steps.  In other words, the <Col N="362" /> official may fear the wrath of the Minister, and may act along the lines that he thinks will please him.  This may well lead to a certain lack of independence.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I might be permitted to recall an incident which occurred in April, 1946 when my mother died.  I was telephoned by Radio Éireann and asked to give details of her life.  I mentioned, among other things&mdash;I did not know whether they would be allowed to say this &mdash; that she had resigned from Fianna Fáil in 1927 when Fianna Fáil signed the paper containing the oath of allegiance to the Crown and went into the Dáil.  I listened carefully to see how this would be put, because the man on the other end of the line had said he did not know whether this would be allowed to go in, but that he would submit it in his script.  When the item came out from Radio Éireann, what they said was that the late Mrs. Sheehy Skeffington &ldquo;was prominently associated with Fianna Fáil up to 1927.&rdquo; Full stop.  I do not suggest that any Minister or any member of the Government intervened but it was clear that somebody thought that &ldquo;offence&rdquo; might be given by the truth, and no reason was given as to why my mother, who had been prominent in Fianna Fáil up to 1927, broke with that Party then.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan criticised section 3.  He seemed to think that to suggest that &ldquo;The Authority shall at all times maintain the right of free speech...&rdquo; means in some way that if any citizen believes that he has not his full right of free speech, he can in some way force Telefís Éireann to give it to him.  Perhaps he misunderstands this section, which asks that &ldquo;the right of free speech shall at all times be maintained&rdquo;. This to me seems to be a good thing.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a long one and Senator Eoin Ryan seems to think it does not make much difference but I think it does.  The contention that impartiality should be maintained &ldquo;taking one programme with another over a reasonable period&rdquo; seems to me to be a good concept rather than to think of giving the exponents of one point of view ten <Col N="363" /> minutes and immediately giving the exponents of the opposite point of view the equivalent amount of time.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is also a long section and asks that the Minister prepare a direction in writing to the Authority when he wants a particular matter broadcast and that this be validated and certified by the leader of one of the Opposition Parties, which may, of course, be five or six if the next Government is a Coalition Government.  We might well have three or four separate Parties splitting from Fianna Fáil and we would, therefore, have three or four principal Opposition Parties&mdash;a left wing Fianna Fáil, a right wing Fianna Fáil, a centre Fianna Fáil, an ex-Republican Fianna Fáil or a future Republican Fianna Fáil, and so on. Therefore, Senator Eoin Ryan's desire that allowances should be made for various Opposition Parties is, I think, already made in the wording of the Bill &ldquo;the public endorsement by the leader of one of the principal Opposition Parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the Assessor of Impartiality.  To have some kind of officer in relation to Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann who would fill the function in relation to those bodies of the Visitor in relation to the universities would be a useful thing.  This section could be improved by amendment. The suggested name may appear Gilbertain, as Senator Ryan says, but I think it would be better to amend the name than to reject altogether this idea of having a kind of Visitor to judge whether the terms of the Act were being implemented by Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point of Senator Eoin Ryan's which, I think, should be dealt with.  He said there was no evidence that Ministers had interfered in the various cases mentioned by Senator FitzGerald.  He mentioned Biafra but he did not mention Vietnam where we all remember the Minister for External Affairs making a case for stopping the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team from going to Vietnam.  He made the point, among others, that they were not able to understand or to speak Vietnamese and he defended what must surely have been ministerial and Government interference <Col N="364" /> there.  The case was established that it was on Government intervention that it was stopped.  I do not think the Minister denied that, when he made this rather hard assessment which, I am afraid, linguistically, would prevent our news service talking about quite a large number of countries.  Therefore, that reply was not quite fair to the case made by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the Bill is to make sure that on Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann ideas and opinions, no matter which Party or Parties are in power, will be given reasonable freedom of expression.  I should like to mention, for the benefit of the Government, the fact that they might be quite glad in a year's time to have this amending Bill, because it is quite conceivable that Fianna Fáil will by then no longer be in power.  If they are not, they might well be very glad to have these safeguards to protect them against the machinations of the Party of Senator FitzGerald.  He is offering them this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ideas and opinions should be expressed freely, within the common good, on television and radio.  It is quite obvious that there must be limitations.  You cannot incite <Col N="365" /> to violence, to riots, to racial enmity and so on, but within the common good, to ensure the freedom of expression of views is something I hope we would all agree to.  I hope we will pass this Bill, therefore, because it is important that we achieve freedom of expression not only on radio and television but in the Oireachtas itself&mdash; free expression of opinion, whether majority or minority.  Public opinion can be formed and encouraged and matured in that way.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most valuable things Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann have been doing but it could still be improved.  There has been some interference, and even if one were to concede that there have not been more than a few cases of abuse&mdash;for instance, the Vietnam issue&mdash;I believe that additional safeguards against the possibility of such abuse should be welcomed by all of us.  If public opinion thereby succeeds in becoming better informed and more mature, all of this within the common good, it will be also for the common good and for the gaining of real maturity in this democracy of ours.  Therefore, I hope the House will pass the Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that contrary to what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said we will oppose the Second Reading of the Bill.  One of the reasons why we can oppose it is primarily the manner in which the debate has been conducted.  Senator FitzGerald cast a few innuendoes but the way in which he spoke about RTE and the way Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke suggests that in fact it is a very free organisation, able to express the viewpoints of the various elements of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my experience, watching the views of the public and of the various Parties and interests.  There is always controversy about any broadcasting organisation, and in a country as small as ours, where people think very keenly about political and social affairs and problems, there is likely to be more controversy than in a great country with a large population, such as Britain, though there is controversy <Col N="366" /> there too.  The controversy is bound sometimes to rise to the surface&mdash;there are bound to be a great many viewpoints expressed about what purpose the broadcasting service should serve; there are bound to be some suggestions of interference and of some actual intervention as in the case of the Minister for External Affairs on the Vietnam issue.</P>
    <P>However, when you look at the whole picture of RTE since 1960, I can see no reason for our trying to legislate to give that organisation any further freedom than they have.  The Act which set up RTE was framed on the basis of broadcasting services that have been developed in other democracies. Frankly, we had looked at other democracies where there have been broadcasting services, and though we wished to have an Act suitable to our own country, we were able to take advice and to make comparison with countries of an entirely democratic character where services had been set up by law.  There is not very much difference between the legislation here and that which can be found in genuine, real democracies, particularly in Europe.</P>
    <P>Under our legislation, a broadcasting authority was set up and given all the powers necessary for the performance of their duties.  The programmers in RTE are given almost complete freedom. That is a fact.  Apart from that governing the sanctioning of capital, there are only three restrictions of any importance in relation to programming. The first is that they shall follow certain national aims, with none of which anybody here would disagree.  The second is that they shall exercise impartiality, and the third is the reserved powers of the Minister, which have never been exercised up to now.</P>
    <P>My belief is that to spell out in greater detail than that already in the Act how RTE should go about their business, how they should exercise impartiality, would restrict their independence and would give rise simply to the more undesirable type of controversy among the public.  I believe, for example, that the assessor of impartiality would have to be somebody almost with the attributes of God <Col N="367" /> Almighty if he were to exercise his powers adequately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be satisfied with a judge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there would be immediate complaints about certain types of programmes, about certain parts of programmes, of a purely illusory, temporary character, because certain people who would complain might have a different view the following morning or the following week about what they saw.  It is extraordinarily difficult for any one individual to make an impartial assessment of any particular debate or discussion in connection with broadcasting.  People differ, even in the same political Party, as to whether a particular programme is impartial.  My view is that there are various methods by which we could ensure that RTE will do their job and that they are reasonably impartial.</P>
      <P>In the first case, the Authority is ultimately responsible to the Dáil and the Minister in charge can watch the debate on the Estimate and having made allowances for people who are obviously commenting on the organisation from a prejudiced point of view, he can get what I might describe as the general flavour of opinion both from his own Party and from the Opposition as to whether the Authority is doing a good job.  On the occasion of a debate like this the Minister can also arrive at a reasonable assessment of whether the Authority is doing a good job.  Then the Authority itself, through correspondence and discussions of various kinds, can also estimate the extent to which it is acting impartially.  The Authority has established a panel of viewers and listeners covering a very wide spectrum of the community who make comment on the various programmes and send them to the Authority.  That also helps the Authority to examine how far it is serving its right purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way we ought to ensure that there is impartiality, to ensure that the organisation is doing a good job, and to ensure that the Government of the day is not misusing its position in <Col N="368" /> connection with debates on current affairs.  May I say this?  Whatever weaknesses the Irish people may have, one characteristic they do have is a natural liking for justice.  I can say without fear of contradiction, that it will never be to the advantage of any Government to make use of the broadcasting authority in order to further its own purposes, in order to try to embarrass the Opposition or in order to prevent the Opposition's views being known.  The best people to ensure that RTE will continue to be reasonably impartial are the Irish people themselves, and it will never pay this Government or any other Government to indulge in continuous interference with the Authority with a view to having important social problems swept under the carpet or matters discussed where there is only one point of view given.</P>
    <P>I have studied this problem through having met the heads of broadcasting associations in really well-developed democracies, respectable democracies with a long tradition of freedom, and those on the other side of the House who think that in some way or other RTE could be used to the advantage of the particular Government of the day should bear this in mind, that it is accepted everywhere that not only the Government in a country but the whole of the Establishment is inevitably on the defensive when public matters are discussed through this new medium. When unsolved problems come up for discussion, and the problem is insoluble or would take a long time to solve or there is no money available with which to solve it, in the case of the ecclesiastical authorities or any other authority, the weight of conservative tradition means that, if there is to be a discussion, the Establishment will be, on the whole, on the defensive.  This can be found on examination by people of education and culture who have written commentaries on the effect of television on the public mind, that the effect of television is to put the Government of the day and the Establishment of the day on the defensive.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly reasonable for any Minister in charge of any broadcasting organisation which is ultimately responsible <Col N="369" /> to the Dáil to make sure that there is general impartiality in the discussion of public problems.  It is only too easy to give only the side that is opposed to the Government of the day. It is so much easier to be explosive, to be protesting, than it is to make quite sure that the background of any problem is fully given, the extent, for example, to which the Government of the day is partly solving a particular problem, the extent to which money has been found, the size of the problem in the national context, economically and sociologically all these things have to be given.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the temptation in any broadcasting authority is, on the whole, that of castigation rather than of balancing the issues, because it is so much more difficult and so much duller for the experts to balance than to castigate.  I do not think that anybody in this House should have any worry about the idea that the present broadcasting organisation goes out of its way to defend the Government or the Establishment excessively.</P>
    <P>I should remind the Seanad that I have at least four times made it quite clear that as Minister in charge of RTE and as a member of the Government I have a perfect right to make some general statement to the public on what I think should be the attitude of RTE in acting, if you like, as a third force in developing the national thought and national policy on all matters of importance. I made a speech on the occasion of the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; I made a longer speech in Trinity College, Dublin, at a meeting of the Historical Society; and I made another speech on the occasion of the Jacob's Television Awards.  In the Dáil, when I was asked questions about some programme, I asked if any Member of the Dáil disagreed with my general statement on what I thought RTE should do in order to help develop the national personality and to develop the nation sociologically and economically. Nobody has disagreed with my general statement, but it was in effect, a sort of general direction which went a little bit beyond the only direction actually given in the Act, which relates to our <Col N="370" /> cultural heritage being fully expressed and forwarded by the Authority.</P>
    <P>I am not going to repeat everything I said at that time but I do want to make it clear that I did say certain things of a general kind with which no one could disagree.  I said, for example, that I thought that if there was to be discussion in RTE it should be of a kind that would not create abysses within the community, and if there were people who wanted to destroy the existing social order and others who wanted to preserve everything we had, not changing anything, whatever happened, RTE should try to bridge the gulf, that there should be a form of discussion which would make the listener and the viewer think constructively and not destructively about what should be the future of our country.  Nobody disagreed with me about that.</P>
    <P>It is a very important statement to make, because it is very easy to have discussions of a purely destructive kind, at the end of which, while the people who have arranged the programme might think they were being impartial, the mind of the viewer would be left with nothing to discuss, with no feeling that a constructive solution to the problem, which would be acceptable in present circumstances, had been presented. I do not think anybody could possibly disagree with that statement.</P>
    <P>Everything else I said was rather in the same direction, that RTE has an absolute duty to encourage social patriotism, to encourage community thinking and community action on all our problems.  I said that the newspapers had no particular responsibility in that regard but that the organisation set up by the Oireachtas must make use of its powers and its services in order to encourage social patriotism and all that goes with it.  I also said that the newspapers naturally publish, in the main, news that is of interest to the public, and I said recently that we are now flooded, day after day, with news of appalling destruction.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Board of Radio Telefís Éireann a number of times and when I see them again&mdash;I see them at intervals in order to discuss these matters&mdash;I shall ask them again whether they could not possibly do more to <Col N="371" /> provide the people of this country with news of what is going on that is good all over the world, where Governments of whatever complexion they may be are succeeding in solving problems. At the moment, when one reads the newspapers one has a feeling that if one reads nothing about a particular country then, whatever is going on in that country, everything is going on fairly well.  I have asked Radio Telefís Éireann to provide a more balanced picture of progress in the world as against all the appalling problems which exist such as Vietnam, Biafra, Nigeria, and so on.  I do not think anybody would disagree with me in that regard.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill have already been commented on very adequately by Senator Eoin Ryan and I do not think I need go into them.  However, I think, perhaps, I ought to comment on that section which suggests that officers of the Authority should be free to comment on matters of public controversy.  I must say I would utterly forbid that.  I do not believe that the permanent officers of Radio Telefís Éireann should make their own comments on matters of public interest.  If Senator G. FitzGerald, when he spoke, meant that they should have a right to ask searching questions, then I would point out that they have that right but they should not comment themselves. They are not permitted to comment on the BBC.  They are not permitted to give their own editorial viewpoints nor are they permitted to do so in a considerable number of other democratic countries.  It would be impossible for the ordinary public to distinguish between the Authority, which must be impartial, and its officers if we started to give permission to officers of the Authority to make their own comments on matters of public controversy.</P>
    <P>Again, I think Senator Eoin Ryan answered in detail the objections to the individual sections of the Bill.  I quite understand that Senator G. FitzGerald, from his own point of view, wanted to raise this question of the freedom of Radio Telefís Éireann: he had a perfect right to do it.  I think he spoke very <Col N="372" /> reasonably and impartially.  Whatever he suggested, by innuendo, one thing or another, I do not think it over-coloured a very impartial observation.  The way he spoke really is proof that we do not need this Bill and that examination in the Dáil, examination by the Government, examination by myself as Minister, examination by the public and serious and responsible comment by the public&mdash;not irresponsible comment &mdash;on how Radio Telefís Éireann conducts its affairs and, above all, the inherent sense of justice in the Irish people will ensure impartiality in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, so far, it is accepted that Radio Telefís Éireann is doing a good job.  The very fact that it is doing a good job does not mean that efforts cannot be made to ensure that the present progress is kept up and that there will be no return to the position that obtained here some years ago.  I support the views expressed by all the speakers so far about the improvement that has taken place in the scope, the content, of the programmes which we receive from Radio Telefís Éireann.  Various reasons have been given by Senators for the improvement and, without any doubt, a number of people are entitled to be praised and to receive due encouragement for their efforts to improve the situation and to get rid of the stuffiness in Radio Telefís Éireann, particularly, up to some time ago.  However, we must not forget that another element which has been neglected so far here, namely, competition in the field of viewing has helped considerably to give backbone to those people in Radio Telefís Éirean, to give them, shall we say, the encouragement to improve consistently and widen the scope of the programmes they present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we draw a line from Dublin through Mullingar, Athlone and on to Westport, the majority of our people in the counties north of that line have a choice of programmes.  In fact, their choice takes in Harlech, UTV and BBC.  I know that, in isolated parts of the west of Ireland, Radio Telefís Éireann is switched off as a protest. That is how people in the isolated areas deal with programmes they may not <Col N="373" /> like.  The choice is there.  North Roscommon, Sligo and parts of Mayo receive a direct beam from the Six Counties.  I am quite satisfied that, indirectly, the good done by these programmes, of which many people down here disapprove, has enabled Radio Telefís Éireann to produce excellent programmes.  Whether we agree or disagree with a programme, if it makes a person think, if it makes the public realise there is another point of view from that which has been drilled into their skulls over the years, then in my opinion that programme is successful.</P>
    <P>I accept that, to a great extent, there is very little interference with television by the Government.  I believe that in this country it would be very hard to have Radio Telefís Éireann completely free of, shall we say, Government influence. I think that would be a Utopia. Senator Eoin Ryan has given a number of reasons why the Government must accept a certain amount of responsibility for the overall control of this new Authority.  After all, if we have not an alternative, if we have not a second channel directly within the State, then there is very little use at this stage in asking for complete freedom for the existing channel.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, opportunities for interference by the hidden method.  The hidden hand can always intervene.  The telephone is, to my mind, the most potent means of influence today.  In a Minister's hands, the telephone can work wonders.  I say this not as a criticism of this Government.  I am quite satisfied that if there were a change of Government tomorrow morning the Cabinet which would replace the present one would have their hands on the telephone just as fast as members of the present Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if certain matters on Radio and Telefís Éireann hurt them.  I cannot see how that situation can be changed.  I believe, however, that there is sufficient protection there for the personnel in Radio Telefís Éireann to stand up to intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real deterrent to Ministers, or others, intervening too much is the type <Col N="374" /> of personnel placed in key positions or, in other words, the temperament of the structure of Telefís Éireann.  I am satisfied that the talented people there have an independent frame of mind and they are not likely to be influenced to any great extent by people who like to use the telephone in hidden fashion. When it comes to the power of a Government to intervene, I suppose a case can be made in this day and age for Government intervention at some stage or another to prevent, for instance, some outrageous programme being put on the air.  If, however, there is to be intervention that intervention should be seen and it should be known that the Government is about to intervene, or a Minister on behalf of the Government. There should be no hidden hand as far as the public are concerned because, if they get wind of the fact that the hidden hand is at work, the rumours as to what has taken place will be far more damaging than what, in fact, did take place.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what I describe as a very conservative type, namely, the Church.  As we know, the Church in the past intervened behind the scenes in many matters.  I believe the Church will still go on intervening behind the scenes but, when it comes to intervention in Telefís Éireann, I think there has been a noticeable improvement and the findings of the experts in other fields, as commented on by the Minister, are absolutely correct. When matters of major importance to the Church are discussed they invariably appear to be on the defensive. Despite the best efforts of those who produce the programmes the protagonists of the Church inevitably end up on the defensive.  That, in my view, is the way it should be because, if they are on the defensive, they must give their reasons for their pronouncements and their actions and they must justify to the community the steps they propose to take or have taken.  The day of telling the people that they must do this, that, and the other and that they are not allowed to think for themselves has gone.  I know there are plenty of people, apart from political Parties, who do not want to see any changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the age of protest.  It is the age in which people question old established ideas and practices.  If I may say so, without being critical of the Chair, it is the age in which people question precedents. We had here today an example of a precedent that should be changed without further ado.  We had the Cathaoirleach telling us that a precedent had been established for the last 50 years.  The way in which he said it would give one the impression that it would be a crime or a mortal sin even to contemplate altering that precedent. These precedents, if they are not good ones, should be thrown overboard in the same way as many other things have been found wanting and are going overboard.  In this particular context it was, I think, Senator Eoin Ryan who mentioned the question of interference. The words he used were the extent of the interference which should take place and the manner of the interference; that is the kernel of the whole thing.  I trust Senator Ryan will agree with me that the manner of the interference is something on which we should have agreement.  I do not suggest, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington did, that Senator Ryan is all that innocent because he is associated with the Law Library.  I believe, like Senator Ryan, <Col N="376" /> that Minister are entitled to intervene to the same extent as the general public.</P>
      <P>The danger mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington is that ministerial intervention will carry more weight than intervention by me or by somebody in the street.  I think, however, that if a Minister wishes to intervene there should be no secrecy about it.  Neither should there be any secrecy about any other person's intervention.  If intervention has been successful it should be made clear why the intervention took place and on whose behalf.  That would clear a great many of the misconceptions that exist with regard to intervention at the moment.</P>
      <P>Political Parties, being what they are, are bound to be suspicious at times that they are not getting as fair a crack of the whip in Telefís Éireann as their opposite numbers.  I suppose that will continue.  The best any authority can do is to try to be as reasonable as possible.  If a political Party find they are not getting what they regard as a proper measure of time, and so on, there is no group in the country in a better position to make their criticism felt.  I have less sympathy with a political Party in that regard than I have for those groups which may not be so well equipped or in such a strong position to achieve their rights. It is in that particular field I should like to see Telefís Éireann given as much scope as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is intervention in the scope and planning of programmes. Indeed, I think the Government would be very unwise to seek to intervene.  I have little knowledge of the workings of Montrose but, listening to the comments made by those people who are interviewed on television and reading the letters in the papers, I think there must be a tremendous volume of correspondence with the Authority from various groups and individuals, suggesting that the Irish language is not getting enough time or Irish music is not getting sufficient time and there is not sufficient time given for Church programmes. All that kind of thing is going on.  The balance achieved so far is, in my opinion, reasonably good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> I should like now to compliment Telefís Éireann on a new programme. On this programme those who draw up the programmes, and others, face a panel, the members of which proceed to criticise, sometimes very bluntly, certain programmes on Telefís Éireann.  It is a great sign to see these people submitting themselves to questions on this programme.  Some of them seem to think their programmes are beyond reproach, and when they hear criticisms levelled at them their expressions change.  I have no doubt that they learn a salutary lesson, and the only danger I see is that someone might try to rig the panel.  That would be fatal.  The Minister said the Irish people want to see fair play.  There is no group quicker than a group of Irish people to sense if there is a set-up and, if this programme is set up, they will not be long turning it off and finding something else to watch.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that everything I say does not favour the Minister. I do not accuse him of interfering in Telefís Éireann and having programmes suppressed or preventing them being shown, but I have a strong suspicion that if the Minister's speeches are not quoted on RTE someone will have hot ears.  It may be a coincidence but whenever this Minister speaks he gets about twice as much publicity as any of his colleagues.  I wonder why that is so.  Is it because of the content of his speeches?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said &mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him and <Col N="378" /> if I am he can correct me&mdash;that time and again he has spoken to the Authority about the necessity for searching for good news, that we hear nothing but misfortune and tragedy and bad news.  It is true that television has brought home to the people the tremendous happenings in other places and the awful tragedies in places like Vietnam and Biafra.  These are facts of life.  I think that under no circumstances should the people be deprived of the opportunity of seeing these happenings. There may be an attempt by certain people to slant the news about Vietnam.  The sources available to RTE are suspect, but the more the public know about these tragedies the better chance we have of creating an atmosphere in which these things can be prevented.  There is nothing more dangerous than to sweep these things under the carpet, and nothing more foolish than to produce a fairy tale and expect the people to sit down and drink their tea and go to bed happy.  There is no purpose in handing out pap and good night stories and pie in the sky.</P>
      <P>The public should know the reality about these tragedies and have an opportunity to express their horror at what is happening.  I said earlier that this is an age of protest.  Because of television and other rapid means of communication the young people today realise the necessity to prevent these tragedies much more than my generation did or those who went before me. They are dedicated to getting rid of social injustice.  They are not militaryminded but they want to get rid of social evils in the world today.  Therefore I disagree with the Minister when he suggests that RTE should search for good news.</P>

      <P>The old method was to look under your arm or into your heart.  This Bill should get a Second Reading.  The Minister skipped over the reasons why he is objecting to the Bill.  His main objection was that those who spoke, spoke mainly in favour of RTE, consequently, he could not see any reason to amend the legislation and improve it still further.  That is a very weak line of argument and the Minister did not express it with any conviction.  I support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I do not agree with everything in it, but I am sure there are Members of the Government Party who would agree that there are parts of it which should be implemented, and that suitable amendments could be put forward on Committee Stage.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude and to allow a Second Reading to be given to the Bill so that suitable amendments can be put forward to make it a first-class measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill because I feel that television is one of the most powerful forces in the country at the moment.  I do not see enough television&mdash;mainly because I am at meetings every night&mdash;to set myself up as a critic of the programmes, but I have been disappointed in a few. Occasionally, I see a very late show and what narks me about them is that the people who appear on them are mainly foreigners or have just come back from somewhere, the concept that nobody can have anything to contribute or be of any interest to their neighbours unless they are either foreign or have been away.</P>
      <P>On the question of news I cannot go along with my neighbour here.  I feel that there is too much of the time of Telefís Éireann news teams spent on the filming and screening of marches. I feel they should adopt a new view. It is time we got something different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would at least be a change of scene.  Even the floods do not seem to dampen their spirits. Nevertheless it must be admitted that the Authority are doing wonderful work and give a fair service to the public but we should not bury our heads in the sand and say it is all right. We should always strive to improve.  It is nice to see that so many of the personnel of Telefís Éireann are very young people and I feel they are doing quite a good job but, at the same time, the most important section of the television service is the news section and it is in the presentation of news that these people wield the power and are able to mould the public mind and the public thought.  We have occasionally seen the gun being put to people's heads to make them appear on the screen.  One hears a member of the staff of Telefís Éireann saying that nobody from such and such a firm was available to comment on this strike or that strike.  I think that this coercion to make people face the camera and face the public is not desirable.  The main task of Telefís Éireann of late seems to be to focus a lot of attention on strikes. I know that these affect the lives of a great many people but from the newscasts one would think that we were a completely unhappy country.  They never come back to tell us whether things have been settled or not.  All these things are left when they are at their most topical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that annoys me is that people get across and sneak advertising into various interviews and shows.  I feel that should be cut out.  If ordinary Irish firms have to pay for their advertising, whether it be of a commodity or a function, I do not see why people should be imported in, it is mainly people who are selling books, to get their free advertising across.  This sort of thing should be cut out.  People in Telefís Éireann should also remember that we have almost 3¾ million people. Therefore, there must at least be a few people throughout the 26 counties who have succeeded reasonably well in their particular spheres of life and their success stories would be of interest to their neighbours without having so many foreigners on our screen who have little or no interest for our people <Col N="381" /> and from whose careers the Irish people can derive very little benefit.</P>
    <P>As I do not see enough of Telefís Éireann I cannot be critical but I support this Bill because I realise the tremendous power that this organisation has at its disposal and I feel that we must at all times bear this in mind and endeavour to improve and help the ser vice that they are giving to the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>Before Senator FitzGerald concludes I would just like to dispel an illusion that he may have created in the minds of Senators or the press if it is reported, an illusion in regard to his reference to the difficulties of Telefís Éireann teams travelling abroad.  One would imagine from his reference to the Vietnam expedition that it was impossible for Telefís Éireann camera men to go anywhere or for reporters to go anywhere.  I have a recollection, being a regular viewer of Telefís Éireann, that we had on the television screen, made by John O'Donoghue in some cases but by television teams anyhow&mdash;an excellent documentary from the USSR, a documentary from Czechoslovakia, a splendid one from Rumania and another one from Yugoslavia, that is just to mention four countries on the other side of the Oder-Neisse line.  The idea that they could not travel is absurd.  I might also say in connection with the Vietnam expedition that the &ldquo;Seven Days&rdquo; team stuck their tongues out at the Telefís Éireann Authority a day or two after the expedition was recalled from Lisbon by putting on a North Vietnamese film of the war in Vietnam so that if we did not get a Telefís Éireann commentary on South Vietnam and what it was doing we certainly got a North Vietnamese commentary on how the war was going for Ho Chi Minh.</P>

      <P>In the course of this debate there have been a number of tributes paid to Telefís Éireann and also a number of criticisms.  God knows they are not above criticism but I think that if this debate had taken place three or four years ago there would have been more criticism.  Public opinion in Ireland has come to appreciate the good work that is being done by Telefís Éireann much more in the last few years and their general image in the community is better than it was some years ago. People have come to appreciate that even though there have been these instances of Government intervention, attempted or successful, that the duty of impartiality has been fulfilled.  My own experience is that they are punctilious about being impartial.</P>
      <P>I had an experience some weeks ago. I heard on the news something that was said by the Taoiseach.  I was concerned to have the precise wording of it because, if I or my Party were to comment on it, it was important that we should comment on what he had said rather than on some distorted impression of it.  I got in touch with Telefís Éireann with a view to confirming my recollection of the words used and I experienced some difficulty because they took the view that, if they were even to confirm the words used in their report, it might be construed as a breach of impartiality in that by giving me confirmation of what I thought I had heard already they would be helping me to make a case against the Government and on those grounds they felt that they should not assist me.  At first I thought this was being a little bit unduly punctilious but on reflection I fully accepted their decision and subsequently wrote to say that I fully understood their action in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> One can see therefore their anxiety to be impartial even perhaps going too far in this respect on some occasions but it is better that they should go too far than be unconcerned.</P>
    <P>I have been struck also by the conscientiousness of the approach of those concerned with programmes, the amount of thought they give to their duty in presenting programmes.  They are very conscious of the ease with which a distorted impression can be given not only by words used, but by camera shots or angles.</P>
    <P>There have been times when a particular interviewer or programme may have given a slightly distorted impression. This can happen.  After all, the people doing these programmes are human and may at times, even though unconsciously, show bias in the way they present things.  It is very difficult to prevent this happening.  They are very conscious of it, all the time worrying about this and about what they should present and how they should present it and exactly how to fulfil their duties to the public.  To see a body of men concerned with their public duty in this way and giving it so much thought, even in their leisure hours thinking and talking about this problem, shows a great sense of public spirit and great professionalism which is a very important quality in an undertaking of this kind.</P>
    <P>I think, also, they are opening up our minds to many things that we have not given enough thought to in the past.  Here I would not go the whole way with the Minister although I appreciate and up to a point would share in his concern that we should hear constructive and good things and not only, as the news so often is, a list of all the disasters that are happening everywhere.  Although I can sympathise with the Minister's approach to that problem, there are dangers in that approach because it might tend to turn the news and these programmes into didactic programmes to teach us something good rather than present us with the world as it is.  One must be careful how far one goes in that direction even though I know the Minister's intentions <Col N="384" /> are good and I can sympathise with them up to a point.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the debate was that, although there is disagreement between us on this Bill, a general difference of approach, a divergence of attitudes between the two sides of the House, to which I shall return later, nevertheless, I think we are both trying to approach this problem in a liberal spirit even though the result of the efforts may be slightly different on the two sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the points made in the course of the debate, I would accept Senator Murphy's amendment if we reach Committee Stage.  In suggesting the Leader of one Opposition Party I was only concerned about one particular thing, that the thing might become unduly cumbersome but certainly it was not intended that it should be the Leader of the principal Opposition Party.  In many cases the countersignature might be that of the Leader of the Leader Party.  I was not thinking of one Party more than the other in suggesting that one Party should be sufficient.  It is not a very important point and it could be sorted out easily enough.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points that I should like to raise in connection with Senator Eoin Ryan's speech.  I was not very happy with the first part of it. I thought, if I may say so, that he was unfair to me and I had not expected him to be unfair to me.  There is a difference in attitude between the Minister's remarks on what I said and Senator Eoin Ryan's remarks on what I said.  Senator Eoin Ryan said, first of all, that I had given no concrete example of where members of the Government had intervened.  I did give a list of examples of interventions, attempting to be fair to the Government, carefully avoiding cases where they either had not intervened or where there was not full intervention preventing something being broadcast because, seeking to be fair, I have listed all the cases of reported intervention and distinguished those of genuine intervention where things were stopped and those where things were not stopped and because I had decided in regard to Biafra that this was not a case of Government <Col N="385" /> intervention, he then picked on this, listed this case, and said that I said the Government had intervened, that my speech contained all kinds of Government interventions and that, therefore, there was a smear campaign and innuendo.  The fact is, I was relying on the cases that I did not mention, which he specifically left out, the case of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Boland, in regard to civil defence, the case of Deputy Haughey ringing up and seeking to have suppressed and succeeding in having suppressed the NFA reference, and the Vietnam case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion as to what is fair.  If a Minister of State rings up and speaks to a junior official, as was the case of Deputy Haughey in regard to the NFA, somebody other than the Director General of the board&mdash;I cannot say exactly what level but to somebody other than the Director General and says you are not to broadcast that statement&mdash;this was before a news broadcast&mdash;is Senator Eoin Ryan going to suggest that this is not the Government suppressing something because, of course, the Authority can reject the proposal?  For Senator Eoin Ryan to suggest that this is not the Government suppressing something is totally naïve to the point, I am sorry to say, of dishonesty.  In such cases that Government intervention is clearly designed to stop a thing being broadcast and when a Minister of State is dealing with somebody down the line who has not time to pass that on to his superior officer there is a tendency to play safe at that point.</P>

      <P>I am talking of a specific instance because Senator Eoin Ryan accused me of a smear <Col N="386" /> campaign and of innuendo and of not giving concrete examples of where the Government intervened.  He went on to say that there was no case where a Minister intervened and the Authority had to take off programmes.  This is an absurd statement.  If he is saying that there is no case in which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has given a written direction, then I accept this, not because Senator Eoin Ryan says so but because the Minister gave me that assurance later in the debate. That being said, there are these cases where a Minister intervened and while the Authority did not have to take off programmes, because there was no direction in writing, there were cases, including this case of Vietnam, where the programme was stopped because of the Minister's intervention and the Minister intervened in a manner designed to secure that the programme would be suppressed in one case, by intervening at the junior level and in the other case by intervening at the highest level with the fullest authority of the Government.</P>

      <P>This occurred before the Bill was introduced and is not very relevant to the 1960 Act.  This occurred in 1959.  There are, therefore, these cases where Ministers intervened in a manner designed to suppress programmes and they were then suppressed and these interventions created a problem.  It is not an easy problem to solve.  What might have been said on the other side with some fairness is that my Bill does not solve these problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with a number of aspects of the problem of RTE.  I have not found a solution to the problem of a telephone call from a Minister to a junior official but it is a problem that needs to be aired and the more often it is aired and discussed the fewer these telephone calls will be and the more willingness there will be on the part of officials to resist even a Minister when he rings up and asks for something to be suppressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan said that Ministers had the same rights as anybody else to protest that a programme should go on.  Their rights are the same but they also have duties which are different. The duty of a Minister in such a case is not to intervene in a manner <Col N="388" /> which, because of the weight of his office, would have a different effect from John Smith ringing up and asking for something to be taken off.  I do not think that it is in any way sensible to relate the position of a Minister to that of the man-in-the-street.  The Minister is in a different position and while he has the same right in principle his exercise of the right will have a different effect and he must have regard to the different effect his exercise of his right will have.  There are many analogies of that in ordinary life.</P>
    <P>We all have rights but we have duties also and have to exercise these rights with due regard to the consequences of our exercise of them.  I have all kinds of personal human rights some of which if I exercised them would lead to fatal results to individuals. I have a right to drive on the left/hand side of the road but not if somebody is standing in front of my car.  I have a duty to drive carefully as well as a right to drive along the road.  In the same way the fact that the Minister has the same right as other people to intervene does not mean that he has not a duty to limit the exercise of this right to an appropriate exercise that will not lead to improper results.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan misinterpreted, rather wilfully if I may say so, section 2 and suggested that if any person objected to this appointment being made, or to the Director General being dismissed, this could not be done. Quite obviously he is a better lawyer than I am but I should have thought that I was right on this occasion.  If not there is no difficulty about amending the section appropriately to say that this would require the consent of the majority of a body comprising four people.  I am given to understand that if you ask for the consent of a body comprising four people that consent can be given by a majority of the body unless it is otherwise stated and, therefore, the consent of one person could not affect the decision about the appointment or removal of the Director General but if I am misinformed legally on this point I am quite happy to introduce a suitable amendment such as &ldquo;by a majority <Col N="389" /> of...&rdquo; or I should be quite happy to reconstitute the body in a better form if the Senator has a better suggestion. He suggests that you cannot have any kind of body to vet the actions of a Minister because no matter what body you have they might think that another way of doing something would be as good, that, therefore, you could make no decision because one decision might be as good as another which would be nonsensical.  I think the principle of decision-making is not one that we should carry too far.</P>
    <P>I think he said it was not the function of the Authority to maintain the right of free speech.  Here, again, this is a misinterpretation of what is in the Bill.  This is a qualifying section to follow section 17 and designed to qualify section 17 by making it clear that in carrying out their duties under section 17 they shall at all times maintain the right of free speech.  The suggestion that this turns them into a court of law is frivolous and should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>He then went on to ask if RTE is to be obliged to give every minority viewpoint but there is nothing in the wording that I have proposed that says that every opinion and every minority should have a say.  That would be totally impracticable.  It merely says that there shall be adequate representation of all minority viewpoints from all parts of the national territory.  There is nothing there to oblige the Authority to give any particular minority or individual viewpoint but there is something there that requires the viewpoints of large groups of people in all parts of the country to have adequate representation.  The series of misrepresentations in Senator Eoin Ryan's speech suggest to me an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the House in regard to this measure and I am confirmed by his speech in my belief that individual amendments to my amendment are possible and that although there is room for improvement in the Bill the Bill is substantially worthwhile, by reason of the fact that the case made against it is so appallingly weak.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested, <Col N="390" /> echoing Senator Eoin Ryan, that the title &ldquo;assessor of impartiality&rdquo; was rather Gilbertian.  I am not very happy with it myself and I think that Senator Sheehy Skeffington's suggested use of the word &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; as employed in relation to the universities is an excellent idea and I would be more than happy to change the title to &ldquo;visitor&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the manner in which I had introduced the Bill, the case I had made and what I said about RTE showed that the Bill was not necessary.  I am grateful to him for his remarks on my speech and my attempt to be reasonably impartial to RTE, contrary to what Senator Eoin Ryan said.  However, I do not think it is a good principle to adopt that, because at the moment RTE is acting with reasonable impartiality and because there have not been any recent cases of ministerial interference, therefore, there is no need for this Bill.  The time to introduce measures of this kind is, in fact, when there are not current major controversies just as you should not introduce changes in the currency system in the middle of a crisis.  You make the change so that you can prevent a certain situation from arising and the moment to act is when action is not immediately required so that you can be in a position to act when action is required.</P>

Personally, I cannot see how it could be both simultaneously. If it did tie down RTE it would not be ineffective.  I do not think it would tie down RTE but it tends to tie the Government down which is a much more constructive thing to do.  It does tie down RTE in only one respect and that is in maintaining the right of free speech and in making adequate provision for minority viewpoints to be represented.  Perhaps, this will impose a slight extra duty on the Authority but I think that is a legitimate extension of the existing requirement and I would defend that.</P>

    <P>The Minister went on to say that it was perfectly reasonable for the Minister to ensure there is impartiality in programmes and that he had a perfect right to make general statements on what should be the attitude of RTE.  I am not totally happy with either proposition. They sound reasonable and I can sympathise with the Minister's viewpoint.  In principle, the Minister can ensure impartiality in programmes. The Minister might see a programme which was impartial and might think it was not impartial because his viewpoint did not emerge on top.  I view programmes and in cases where I did not like the result of a discussion because my viewpoint did not come out on top other people watching agreed with the viewpoint.  It is very hard for any individual to determine what is impartial.  The Minister or Senator Ó Maoláin made this point.  I am not too sure that ministerial intervention with <Col N="393" /> regard to programmes is likely to work very well with regard to impartiality. Everybody in the country will not believe the Minister is concerned with impartiality.  I believe the present Minister's intervention would be in good faith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator did not understand what I meant.  I was referring to impartiality derived by better background research before the programme begins.  The Senator knows what that means.  The programme is not produced <i>in vacuo</i> with some enormous problem about which nobody really knows anything or what has happened about it previously, I simply asked the board to make sure there was proper background research on social and economic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and see the Minister's view.  There is a lot to be said for the Minister's viewpoint.  I have the difficulty on committees and councils with public servants where I find that one has a problem on which one has <i>prima facie</i> evidence and one feels something should be done about it but the response is &ldquo;You cannot prove that. Therefore we will not do anything about it.&rdquo;  If you applied the principle that it is necessary to have background research before the programme begins there is a danger this could be carried to the point where the research is of such a character to prove there is an issue and the issue should not be discussed. My bias would be a little different from the Minister's.  It would be towards encouraging discussion wherever there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of a problem.  I do not think there is a big gap between us.  I would not be happy to discourage programmes where there had not been research to show whether or not there was a problem to be tackled.  I know it is irritating to see a programme where the people concerned have not done their homework but I think the bias must be towards encouraging rather than discouraging discussion.</P>

    <P>On the other points of the Minister making general statements on the attitude of RTE I say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I would like to agree with the <Col N="394" /> Minister.  It envisages him giving directions in cases where there is a point of national interest involved to publish or not to publish something.  The Minister has not a role.  This is what the board is for.  I do not wish to suggest that the present Minister's contributions to the debate on this subject have not been useful and constructive.  One can overstress the role of the Minister in guiding RTE.  I am sure the Minister has helped RTE in developing their programmes.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of comment.  There is a basic difficulty here for some of us.  The officers cannot comment on matters of public affairs.  They can intervene, perhaps toughtly, but they must not comment. There are really two kinds of comment&mdash;the comment which is required to elucidate and which does not involve the investigation of a viewpoint. The political correspondent of RTE in giving an account of a situation does not confine himself to saying: &ldquo;Mr. So-and-So said this, Mr. So-and-So said that.&rdquo;  He elucidates and in elucidating he comments.  His comments may at times express some degree of criticism or doubt or support.  His attitude may emerge from his comment on a particular issue.  It would be impossible to have it otherwise.  We do not want gratuitous, politically biased commentary in a discussion.  You cannot have any TV service giving news of public affairs and programmes of public affairs that do not involve comment. Every one of the programmes on politics which I have watched has involved comment.  Every time you have Mr. David Thornley putting over a programme on the Oireachtas he is commenting on some point, perhaps on whether Deputies should spend more time on their constituents or not, for example.  He cannot refer to the issue without commenting.  He is giving an informed view of the subject.  The fact is that whatever the Act may say, whatever the Minister may think, inevitably the officer of RTE will comment on public affairs as he goes along.  These officers cannot confine themselves to the role of interviewer. We want to restrain them from commenting in a gratuitous or offensive manner that may seem favourable.  We <Col N="395" /> know when the line is passed here.  At the moment they avoid particular comments.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Senator that there is a line below and above which comment must not be made.  I do not disagree with much of what he says.  I meant that permanent officers should not say that any particular view was absolutely right and that a certain thing should be done.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;comment&rdquo; has a number of meanings. Unfortunately, when you start putting it into legislation you destroy the value of the whole service.  If there were an obligation to avoid censorship in the course of an interview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we all do.  The significant thing in the reply from the other side of the House on this debate, such as it was, was the notable absence of statements from the other benches.</P>

      <P>There has been failure to comment on the question of the statements of principle made by the Minister for External Affairs and Deputy Lemass, as Taoiseach, and I ask the Minister specifically to comment on these statements as I had hoped he would have done and in some way indicate that these do not represent the Government's attitude. Nobody adverted to the rules governing appearances of politicians on programmes.</P>

      <P>RTE.  I am thinking about the Thomas Davis Lectures. A speaker, because he is a politician, must not talk for more than a quarter of an hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I raised.  I asked the Minister to tell me what the rules are governing the appearances of politicians on programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <P>Regarding the Thomas, Davis Lectures, I may say that the other evening I was talking with some students and one of the points they made was about the total absence of any guidance to them concerning the history of Ireland during the past 50 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is something about which we should be concerning ourselves.  The Minister's reply worries me even more as we are in a position where there are not even rules which the politicians can know about and where each case is considered on its merits.  I would suggest to the Minister that he have a look at this.  Politicians are entitled to know what the conditions are under which they can appear on RTE.</P>

      <P>The approval of the Whip is necessary or is the Senator suggesting that there is no such approval of the Whip for a Party political broadcast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about ordinary appearances of politicians on ordinary programmes.  There was no answer from the Minister either on the point I raised on the question of expression of a ministerial viewpoint from other parts of the national territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator not hear Mr. Paisley or Mr. Bunting on the programmes on which they appeared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking more of the ordinary run of programmes&mdash;programmes of public information on which I think the viewpoints of both sides concerning Northern Ireland are not adequately represented.  I had hoped for comment on that during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I raised&mdash;though I cannot blame the Minister for not replying on this as it is eight months since <Col N="398" /> I raised it and I forgot to raise it again&mdash;is the question of the inquiry that was going on into the broadcasting of the PR referendum.  In fact that question was, as it turned out, well and fairly covered.  When a case of that kind arises there should be some duty on the Minister to announce the result of the inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing to it at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should take some opportunity of stating that publicly so that the public might be reassured as it is something that will be raised again and again.</P>
      <P>Finally, regarding the national interest which, to me, is something in which we are all included.  A private national interest held by the Government does not make sense to me.  I do not see how anyone can have the right to give a direction to support something in the national interest or to require something to be withdrawn in the national interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator knows of any country in the world where this is done, we should be glad to hear it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this from the other side.  To reject this Bill would be wrong and the Minister's reason for doing so, my having put forward the case with detachment and impartiality, is wrong.</P>
