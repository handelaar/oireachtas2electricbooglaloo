      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Order of Business I should like with your permission to raise the matter of the inadequacy of the report of our commemorative session of the First Dáil in which I put a question to the Taoiseach as to whether he foresaw any likelihood in the near future of implementing the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil, or whether he thought it would continue to remain largely a dead letter.  The report of the session simply says:</P>
      <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Mac Síthigh-Sceimhealtún isteach ar na cúrsaí i mBéarla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that this is inadequate for two reasons: first, the question was put in English and I was ruled out of order by you in English yet what I said is not reported; now, the Order of the Day contained the business both in Irish and in English.  It said in English, for instance: &ldquo;Address on the occasion of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first meeting of the First Dáil Éireann, 21st January, 1919&rdquo;.  That is on the Order of the Day for the Seanad.  I feel that (a) my question should have been reported as <Col N="422" /> given in English, or at any rate that (b), if it had to be in Irish, what I asked should have been translated into Irish.</P>
    <P>The second point that somewhat disturbs me is the reference to this &ldquo;Seanadóir Mac Síthigh-Sceimhealtún&rdquo;. I have looked at the list of Senators and I do not find any Sceimhealtún there.  I have consulted Dinneen and I find that &ldquo;sceimheamhail&rdquo; means handsome, blooming, comely, ornamental. I was quite happy with that until I saw the next word is &ldquo;sceimhleadh&rdquo;, which means a skirmish, a bickering, a pursuit, a worrying, a torturing, a terror, a dread.  If there really is such a Senator, this is a matter to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I also feel that when a Senator signs his name in Irish it should be given in Irish, but when he signs his name in English, and it appears on the list in English, it should on all occasions appear in English.  It would be rightly resented if a Senator who signed his name in Irish found himself in the English text reported in the English form of his name.  I am saying that just in case &ldquo;Sceimhealtún&rdquo; is meant to represent Skeffington.</P>

      <P>I did not read the Official Report of the Seanad debate on that particular session but had I done so I would have written to the Editor of Debates and protested strongly against the inclusion of any reference to the boorish interruption by Senator Sceimhealtún, or whatever he likes to call himself, on that occasion.</P>

      <P>I was sitting behind Senator Sheehy Skeffington on that day and I do not think his interruption was boorish.  He was acknowledged by the Chairman in my hearing.  I heard the Cathaoirleach ruling him out of order, and he sat down immediately. I do not think, despite what the Leader of the House might say, that there was anything boorish about that interruption.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Sheehy Skeffington for giving me notice of his intention to raise this matter.  The position is that on 15th January, 1969, the Seanad formally agreed to the recommendations made by the Committee <Col N="423" /> on Procedure and Privileges in relation to the proceedings governing the special sitting of the Seanad on 21st January, 1969.  Two of those recommendations were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the Leas-Chathaoirleach was the only member to speak on behalf of the Seanad, and</P>
      <P>(2)  the proceedings were to be conducted in Irish.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pursuant to the Order of the House, I had no alternative but to rule that Senator Sheehy Skeffington was out of order and to instruct that his intervention should be recorded as it appears in the Official Report.  With regard to the question of the Irish form of his name I will undertake to have that matter corrected in the Official Report to the correct version.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable An Bord Gráin to provide a superannuation scheme for its wholetime staff.  The Bill also provides that the remuneration and allowances for expenses of the staff of the Board will be determined by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Gráin was established in July, 1958, under the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958, to purchase and dispose of home-grown millable wheat surplus to milling requirements, the losses involved being met by a levy on growers of millable wheat.  The Act also empowered the Minister to assign additional functions to the Board in regard to grain. The Board has not in fact exercised <Col N="424" /> the original statutory function in regard to surplus millable wheat because a surplus of millable wheat was not produced in any year until 1968 when, however, no levy was imposed and the cost of disposal of the surplus wheat has to be met by the Exchequer.  This arose because a surplus could not have been foreseen.</P>
    <P>The Board has carried out a variety of other functions in relation to the marketing of the wheat crop, such as the marketing of unmillable wheat and the payment of special bonuses to growers.  Additional important functions in regard to coarse grains have been statutorily assigned to the Board over the years.  The principal of these has been the purchase and resale of home-grown barley.  The floor price guarantee for feeding barley is implemented by the Board who purchase for resale such quantities of dried barley as are offered to them on 31st December each year.  The Board purchases the dried barley at a price which enables merchants to pay the growers the floor price for green barley and to meet the cost of drying, handling, interest and storage.  The barley purchased by the Board is resold to compounders and feeders on an ex-store or delivered basis and the Board's activities in this regard are self-supporting.  The Board also subsidises the cost of the transport of barley from the areas in which it is grown to the deficiency areas mainly in the west, and this is financed from the proceeds of a levy of £1 a ton on imported maize.  The Board also operates purchase and resale arrangements for home-grown feed wheat and oats.</P>
    <P>Additional functions also assigned to the Board cover the purchase, importation, and distribution&mdash;subject to my approval&mdash;of maize, sorghums, imported feed wheat and feed barley.  The Board in the fulfilment of these functions generally operates through the established grain trade.</P>
    <P>The Board employs such staff as are necessary from time to time for the performance of its functions.  At present there are 13 wholetime persons on the staff of the Board who would be eligible to participate in a contributory pension scheme.  The number of staff may vary according to the functions of the Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> The expenses of the Board are met from income derived from its trading activities under the various functions statutorily assigned to it.</P>
    <P>An Bord Gráin has sought my approval to operate a superannuation scheme for its staff and I have given my approval in principle, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The Board's operations have proved very useful and of particular benefit to farmers and, so far as can be foreseen, it will remain a permanent and essential feature of the grain trade in this country. The staff employed by the Board should be regarded as on a permanent basis.  Provision of a pension scheme brings the Board's staff into line with other statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of enabling legislation to operate a superannuation scheme, it appears to the Minister for Finance, and I agree, that the terms of remuneration and allowances for expenses to the staff which are now a matter for the Board should for the future be determined by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance. This will facilitate the future development of a uniform pay policy in State Boards.  This procedure already operates in relation to the staff employed in the Dublin and Cork District Milk Boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill follows generally the pattern of previous legislation relating to the operation of superannuation schemes by statutory bodies.  The provision for Ministerial control of the remuneration and allowances for expenses of the staff of the Board is made by an amendment of section 13 (3) of the original Act&mdash;the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958&mdash; under which the Board was established.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not involve any cost to the Exchequer inasmuch as this is a contributory pension scheme the cost of which will be shared by the Board and its staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one measure which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has brought into the Seanad which will receive the wholehearted approval of the House.  There is very little use crying over spilt milk at this <Col N="426" /> stage and in saying that this should have been done long ago.  If an injustice has been done it is being remedied now.  Justice should not only appear to be done but should be seen to be done. The Minister has not said that this will apply retrospectively.  There are a number of people involved who may be penalised by virtue of the fact that a scheme such as this was not brought in up to now and I am sure the Minister will recognise the fact that they should be included from the commencement of their service with this Board.</P>
      <P>The Grain Board was set up as a temporary expedient and has now become a permanent feature in the grain business of the country.  As the Minister has said, it is rendering a very useful service to the agricultural community and as far as one can see it will be required &mdash; and, in my opinion, extended&mdash;during the years to come.  It can render a service to the farming community to an even greater extent than it is doing at the present time because, having regard to the position as it is today, it is obvious that there is a real necessity to have a board such as this and that the demands on its activities will increase.</P>
      <P>The increase in the use of fertilisers is giving greater yields in grain but, unfortunately, due to the uncertainty of our climate we may have even more unmillable wheat in the future. We had a surplus for the first time last year.  That leads us to believe that the Grain Board could exercise greater claim to the business of liaison between the Minister and his Department as to the amount of grain that seems likely in any one year.  They have now entered into the barley and oats market but their activities, while extending, would seem to me to be limited in so far as they are restricted in advising the Minister of the position as it arises from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of current rumours to the effect that millable wheat is being imported. We are told that the Grain Board operate in the purchase of feed wheat and there is a certain uneasiness at the present time because of the belief that wheat is being imported by the <Col N="427" /> millers in excess of our requirements. This imported wheat is mixed with native wheat.  If the Grain Board had greater powers in this regard the agricultural community could look to it with confidence and they would be assured that the greatest possible amount of native wheat would be used for the bread requirements of the nation.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister considers it necessary to take on himself the powers to fix the remuneration and the expenses of the members. This is a solvent body and the reason given by the Minister is that this is done to have the overall uniform system operated by the other statutory State bodies.  The Grain Board is in an altogether different position and their activities and their expenses do not compare in any way with those of the Milk Board, for instance.  Therefore, I wonder&mdash;perhaps it is because of the cynicism that is abroad&mdash;when a Minister takes this sort of thing on himself with regard to a body that is operating satisfactorily what is behind all this.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Grain Board up to now merit the thanks and gratitude of the agricultural community and I certainly will give every support to the measures before the House and I hope that in the future the Board's activities will be extended to cover even a wider field in the grain industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I, too, welcome this Bill. I am very pleased to see that the employees of the Grain Board are to be brought into line with employees in other State bodies.  The Minister has announced that a levy should be imposed on wheat harvested in 1969. This is causing a considerable amount of uneasiness among the small farming community and I should like to avail of this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that when this levy is being imposed it should not affect the first 200 or 300 barrels of wheat that might be supplied by any grower.  I say this out of consideration for the small wheat grower.  I do not think that in the implementation of the levy these small farmers should be put on a par <Col N="428" /> with the man who will be growing 400 or 500 acres of wheat, as many will be.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to take this into consideration when the levy is being put into operation.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill to which we give our wholehearted support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding what the first speaker said, I should, first of all, like to mention the fact that no provision is being made for retrospective contributions to the servants of the Board.  Are they not to get any retrospective credit for the years they have already served on the Board?  If there are to be retrospective clauses in the regulations I think there must be a section envisaging those people.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point I should like to mention and that is with regard to what the Minister said in his concluding sentence about this being of no cost to the Exchequer and that the cost will be met out of the finances of the Board.  In other words, although the cost is small, it will in some way be added to the price of the grain so that when the farmer goes to buy feeding stuffs for pigs or calves he will find that there is an increase in the cost of those feeding stuffs.  This will be particularly noticeable in my part of the country where the farmers do not derive any benefit from the growing of grain because of the unsuitability of the land and the climate.  As I have said, some of the cost will be added to the cost of the grain.  Those, Sir, are the only points I wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to support this Bill because it surely is reasonable that all people in permanent employment should be entitled to a pension.  However, I welcome the Minister's even belated concern for the officers and servants of An Board Gráin but I would wish he would show perhaps even a little of the same sympathy towards the wheat-growers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that in the present year the milling industry will carry over 75,000 tons of grain, which is a strain on the country's storage capacity. Despite the rising costs our farmers <Col N="429" /> must pay for fertilisers and rates and general costs of production the Minister has decided to retain one-third of the price the farmers can expect for their wheat until the end of the coming year.  There will be stopped a levy calculated to be not less than 13/- a barrel.  At this time when the country is feeling the effects of a very serious strike where many thousands of workers are looking for increases in wages, a situation where the farmers have to take a reduction in the price they will get for the wheat in the coming harvest of at least 13/- a barrel is strange, indeed.</P>
    <P>Surely, the Minister was not aware of the situation when he calmly and coolly made this announcement?  There is little that the farming community can do about it.  They cannot just leave the land idle, and it is impossible to get additional contracts for either barley or beet, yet we roll along from year to year without any effort to devise a long-term policy for the important wheat crop.  Surely, the officers of the Department of Agriculture must at some stage get to grips with this problem?  Last year, the acreage of wheat increased by 34,000 acres, which is a sizeable increase.  We find that speculators are allowed to conacre large tracts of estates and lands and grow wheat purely on a speculative basis.  This, in my opinion, is the main reason why, as the statistics show, up to 70 per cent of the total number of farms are on the borderline of being uneconomic.  Farmers must have some means of living.  The imposition of the proposed levy will certainly mean a great deal to the general body of farmers who, in the main, would produce something in the region of 50 to 150 barrels per year.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that the Minister is making this provision for the servants and officers of the Board, but, surely, there has been enough difficulty with the grain crop with the effects on the harvest, good and bad.  The position as I see it is that no matter what type of harvest we have in the coming year, whether it is good or bad from the weather point of view, the farmers will be hit by a levy.  To add to that they are going to suffer the loss of one-third <Col N="430" /> of the value of the crop for two or three months without any interest.  That is a very severe penalty.  I think it is a hit and miss policy as far as the Department are concerned.  It is true that on one or two occasions when the Department were about to levy on the price of wheat the levy was not required.  In the last harvest when a levy would possibly have applied provision for one was not made.  I sympathise with the Minister in his difficulty but I think that the provisions he has made for the coming harvest will certainly bear very hard on an already over-taxed section of the community.  I would ask him to give some thought to the question of a wheat policy which will provide a reasonable return for the vast majority of farmers who are eking out an existence.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Senator Malone in the case he makes for the Board to determine their own wages and standards of salaries.  It is a very reasonable case.  The Department is already taking on a tremendous amount of responsibility, and this is one case in which the Minister could give way to a little decentralisation and give this important Board, at least, an opportunity to decide from their own knowledge the salary scales to which their staffs are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want very briefly to say three things.  The Government, clearly, should be congratulated for making it possible to have this superannuation scheme but, in relation to it, I should like to make the point that the Government trend, which I am very glad to see, in relation to pensions, has lately been to consider not only servants, employees and officers but also their widows, and I should like to ask the Minister whether under the terms of the Bill before us now, which refers in section 1, subsection (1) to</P>
      <P>pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such wholetime officers or wholetime servants of the Board as it may think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the words &ldquo;or in respect of&rdquo; can be taken legally to cover widows' pensions <Col N="431" /> because if not, I would ask him to consider changing slightly the terms of this subsection on Committee Stage.  I am quite certain that the Minister is in sympathy with giving power to give pensions to widows of established servants and officers.  It would be regrettable if the terms of the Bill were to prohibit him from doing that.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is: I note that he told us in his introductory remarks that his reason for the decision that in future the terms of remuneration, allowances and expenses of the staff shall be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance is that this will facilitate the future development of a uniform pay policy in State boards.  This seems to me to be a very laudable intent, and something I would praise and salute in passing but everybody who has read this morning's papers will have noticed that there is at present quite a disparity between the remunerations of various servants and directors and chairmen of State bodies.  Some are only part-time chairmen but the range goes from £200 a year to £7,000 a year and some of them are getting £7,500.  I would, therefore, salute this intent on the part of the Minister and the Government, but I would draw their attention to the fact that in order really to establish a uniform pay policy the Government still have a very long way to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss wheat policies or the vagaries of our climate but I want to deal with two matters in the Bill, namely, the provision for the institution of a superannuation fund and also the question of future policy in regard to the determination of remuneration and allowances. In regard to the first matter I want to say that I with other Senators welcome this belated provision.  I know that this Board is some ten years in existence and we are now providing for a superannuation scheme as such. Under the provisions of subsection (4) of section 1 we are saying that the scheme shall be stated as having effect <Col N="432" /> from &ldquo;a day (which may be a day before such submission).&rdquo;  I hope that this means the scheme when it is approved by the Minister will provide for crediting the servants with previous service and will not simply start from the date of the introduction of the scheme.  I think the employers who negotiated a superannuation fund would wish to allow such a fund to continue.  They would wish their employees in the service who had not the opportunity of participating in the fund simply because it was not previously in existence, to participate now.  I hope the Minister can assure us in his reply that provision will be made for people in the service before the introduction of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to raise has already been made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, that is, the question of provision for widows and orphans.  On my reading of the section it does not seem to be envisaged nor would it be possible to provide for them.  The principle has been accepted by the Government of providing for widows and orphans of State servants and undoubtedly this is now in operation for the civil servants but has not yet come before us by way of legislation.  I hope this will be introduced in other semi-State employment.  This is one instance where the Government have given a very laudable and good example, which we would hope will be followed by other undertakings.</P>
      <P>It would be regrettable if we were now passing legislation which would not allow the Minister to make provision for the widows of officers and servants of An Bord Gráin.  If my reading of the section is not correct, I hope the Minister can reassure us on this point or else introduce the necessary amendment on Committee Stage to give him the right or the power to provide also for the widows and orphans of the servants of An Bord Gráin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point with which I want to deal is something where I am in strong disagreement with the Minister. We are talking now about the officers and servants of An Bord Gráin who are the employees of a semi-State undertaking.  It is the normal and <Col N="433" /> usual practice that employees negotiate with their employers in regard to the fixing of the terms and conditions of their employment.  Now the Minister is coolly and calmly proposing, in the section amending the original Act, to come between the employers and the employees and it will not any longer be the function of the employers, An Bord Gráin, to negotiate and so allow and arrange the terms and conditions of their employees, but those terms and conditions will be determined by the Minister for Agriculture with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This of itself is alarming but the Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;This will facilitate the future development of a uniform pay policy in State Boards&rdquo;. The implication here is &mdash; and here you have a very important decision on a very vital principle&mdash;that for the future, and this is what they would be aiming to do, the employees of numerous semi-State undertakings here would have their rates of pay determined not in free negotiation with their employers but by the appropriate Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I wonder have we given sufficient thought to this?  I am not aware that the Congress of Trade Unions have been alerted to this position.  I wonder whether the employees of this Board are organised in a trade union or whether there has been consultation with any trade union in regard to this matter?  I wonder whether those employees will come within, for example, the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration machinery?</P>
    <P>There are many people whose terms and conditions of employment are determined by the Minister for Finance, namely, the large body of civil servants but, for those, there is an agreed machinery of negotiation and provision for arbitration.  Do the employees of An Bord Gráin now become in effect civil servants and do they come within the scheme of conciliation and arbitration machinery of the Civil Service? If not why not?  As I said the position in relation to their employment now seems to be fundamentally changed so that the terms and conditions will not be as agreed by the employer but will be as determined by the Minister <Col N="434" /> after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I am aware that that shadow has crept into the free negotiation with regard to semi-State undertakings. Nobody has told us officially but increasingly we read that while you are negotiating with the employer there is somebody always in the background who is holding a watching brief, who does not accept responsibility, and who will not answer for the matter in Dáil Éireann, but who apparently has a sort of control over the employers, namely, the semi-State undertakings.  From my own limited experience I am left with the suspicion that you are now not really engaged in free negotiation, that the party on the other side is not equal with you in this matter.  It is felt that policy is being determined by some people in the background, namely, the civil servants in the appropriate Departments, who do not accept responsibility, who are not answerable in Parliament for anything which occurs but who nevertheless have the thumb down on the employer with whom they are negotiating.</P>
    <P>This apparently is now coming out into the open.  Apparently we are now being told that this is Government policy.  They are starting with An Bord Gráin.  This appears to be what the Minister has said.  He said in his speech</P>
    <P>...that the terms of remuneration and allowances for expenses to the staff which are now a matter for the Board should for the future be determined by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This will facilitate the future development of a uniform pay policy in State Boards.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to some explanation as to whether this is now Government policy, whether sufficient consideration has been given to the matter and whether there has been consultation with the trade union movement on what is going to happen.</P>

Is it no longer to be a matter for negotiation between CIE and the employees but will these conditions be fixed by the Minister for Transport and Power in consultation with the Minister for Finance?  This is what the Minister stated in his speech and it is rather alarming.  I think we are stepping out into something which we have not thought out sufficiently. It is all right to talk about uniformity but to do things for the purpose of obtaining uniformity is not necessarily a good thing in itself.</P>
      <P>You are taking from the employers and the trade unions freedom of negotiation while Government speakers have been stating their belief in free negotiation.  Apparently we have now in this Bill a first instance of Government policy&mdash;that it is the Government and the Minister who are to determine conditions, not the employers, the semi-State organisations.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on this matter, whether this has been something determined by the Government as such, whether it is the policy of the Government with regard to employment generally in semi-State organisations, whether sufficient consideration has been given to the matter and whether consultation has taken place with Congress on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this measure which provides superannuation for these people is welcome to all who have spoken on it even if the welcome is tempered with questions of a nature that may or may not be relevant in this category.  Some Senators have asked about retrospection. From the wording of the measure retrospection is capable of being included but the pension scheme will be a contributory one and will be formulated by negotiation between the Board and its employees and then only will it come to me.  Whatever initiation may take place will be initiated at Board and employee level.  There is in section 1 (4) an opportunity for devising methods possibly for retrospection if this can be agreed to and put up to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> So far as provision for widows is concerned, this is not provided for specifically in the Bill but the wording does give an opportunity to make provision for widows, orphans and other dependants who may be left behind after the death of a contributor.  Again, this would be a matter for negotiation and arrangement in the setting up of the scheme although how they would arrive at these provisions I do not know.  The possibility of making these provisions and other such provisions is arranged for in the wording of the section.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the Board itself. We have had a lot of talk about wheat and that is only right because when the Board was set up originally its specific purpose was to deal with wheat.  This was agreed upon by the farming organisations of the day and the fact that it has never been capable of being operated since then does not take away from the agreement itself but rather indicates and highlights the lack of thought which was given to the scheme and the fact that it became unworkable. The original scheme was that in July of each year this Board and other advisers would meet and determine how much extra wheat they were going to have after the following harvest. While the intention was good the working of the scheme was impossible because, short of God, there is no man alive in this country who in the July before the harvest could give any reasonable forecast of what the millable wheat output would be.  That scheme could never work.</P>
    <P>However, I have found a way in which it can work.  Instead of taking money by way of levy at an impossible time in July, we will now hold back part of the payment due to the farmer for the wheat sent to the mills after the harvest.  If, at the end of the intake of wheat, we find we have sufficient millable wheat to supply the 75 per cent grist, or 240,000 tons as it is now estimated, the farmer will get back his full price.  If we find we have more, the amount in excess has to be funded and made capable of being used as animal feed at feed prices.  If we take a levy on 270,000 tons we have to make the price of the excess 30,000 tons capable <Col N="437" /> of being operated for animal feed at feed prices.  If there is no levy it simply means that there has been a good wheat harvest.</P>
    <P>There is no farmer who would prefer a bad wheat harvest with unmillable wheat in preference to a good wheat harvest such as we had in 1968 when we had lashings and leavings of excellent wheat.  Would a farmer not prefer to have a year like last year and take a good, heavy cut rather than have a bad year with little millable wheat or, perhaps, no millable wheat at all?  This is the sense of the 1958 agreement which was subscribed to and arrived at at the suggestion of the farming organisations.  It is that scheme that I am applying today and nothing else, except that I have found a way of implementing it.</P>
    <P>I would say to those who are saying that there will be a 13/- levy next year that no one can say that the out-turn next year will be over and above the 240,000 tons.  The people who are making those calculations do not know what they are talking about and they are inciting the farming community to the point where they will intimidate them into not growing wheat.  We only want net imports of grain into this country.  We are capable of growing a large amount of wheat ourselves.</P>
    <P>To those farmers who have been impressed by the talk of this 13/- levy, I wish to say that they should grow more wheat; that we need more wheat and that it is to their benefit and to the benefit of the whole economy to have more wheat.  If we have the blessing of a really good harvest, then there will be a levy but if the harvest is not good, there will not be any levy.  There will be more wheat for animal feed at animal feed prices and the amount of wheat imported will be less.  It must make sense to all that this is to the good of the farming community and to the good of the economy as a whole. I say to the farmers not to pay any heed to those who talk about a 13/-levy because these people do not even know at this stage if there will be any levy on wheat.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made to the effect <Col N="438" /> that we were not generous enough to the farmers last year.  I should like to point out the extent of our generosity The State is, in fact, contributing almost £4 million to the growing of the 240,000 tons of wheat and last year, because of the unworkability of the levy system which was introduced in 1958 and approved of by the farming organisations, there was a gift made to the farmers of another £½ million&mdash; a gift which, in fact, they should not have got.  Taking all that into consideration, if anybody can still say that we are not generous, I can only say that he needs to have his head examined.</P>
    <P>It is said that the Board could ensure greater usage of Irish wheat and also that they could make sure that wheat was not being imported over and above the needs of our community.  These are things which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, whoever he may be at any given time, has a great deal of control over.  The Board is merely an extension of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries doing a specific job for the Department which otherwise the Department would have to do themselves. Therefore, this idea that the Board should be given these controls and powers is, to say the least, a bit high-winded because the controls are within the realm of the Minister and the Department.  Freedom in that sense can only be assigned from the Department to the Board and, of course, with the liaison and control that a Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must and does exercise in regard to the general policy under which the Board operates. This, therefore, is an unreal sort of requirement.  To give this power to the Board would be completely superfluous because the power, the responsibility and the usage are there at the moment.</P>
    <P>In so far as imports of wheat are concerned, there is control and the amount of imports is related to the deficiencies in various types of grain that may arise.  One of the roles played by the Board is that it co-ordinates and correlates the various elements, the imports of the various types of grain and the transfer and resale within the country from merchant to merchant.  These, then, are some of the <Col N="439" /> functions of the Board and there is, therefore, no need for any further powers.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to uniformity of remuneration.  While this was mentioned by quite a number of people, it has only been strenuously objected to by Senator Murphy.  He seems to be making a big thing out of this.  Quite simply, this is Government policy and there is every good reason why it ought to be so.  The only pity is that it was not always Government policy because had it been so, we would have avoided some of the pitfalls brought about by the giving of the right to fix remuneration to the Board at a time when, perhaps, they, like us, were young and inexperienced in their setting up.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Senator Murphy that he, as a Member of this House, approved of the same principle in the very recent past.  He approved of it when we were introducing legislation concerning An Chomhairle Oiliúna.  He may not be aware of having done so but, in fact, he agreed to the same principle.  He also agreed to this principle in connection with an Foras Tionscal, the very recent legislation on the dumping and subsidies measure, the medical research bureau, driving offences and he agreed to it on my last visit to this House when I dealt with the legislation providing for the setting up of An Chomhairle Olla.  He has agreed to this principle on five occasions and this is now the sixth occasion on which he is being asked to agree to it.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that he is being rather inconsistent.  Having accepted five, it is somewhat inconsistent to come along now and object to the sixth, particularly objecting to it on the grounds that it is something new.  Far from being new, it is very much needed.  Some of these boards, particularly this grain Board &mdash; and I do not want to talk about anybody else's responsibility &mdash; this Board or agency, call it what you will, is a mechanism set up by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries with the authority of the Government to act in a special way with all its functions <Col N="440" /> being the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is quite all right for the Minister to control this body.  In fact, he should be the overriding influence in regard to this body because in a sense it is merely an extension of himself and his own Department which is carrying out in a special way another part of his responsibility, by doing it in a more detailed way than could normally be done.</P>
    <P>It is a sensible and logical thing for control to be exercised.  There is nothing wrong with it, nor has there ever been anything wrong in past cases. There is nobody in this House who will not remember some of the big State boards who started off not so many years ago in a lamentable way by trying to obtain more remuneration for their people than their production justified.  This was started by one such State board that has enjoyed, used and abused the authority that was given to it under this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that as and when we come to any such new boards this matter of uniformity will be brought into being, and if and when opportunity arises in relation to existing boards where we have not this control at present, when the appropriate time comes appropriate legislation should be moved through the Oireachtas.  It is our intention to bring this about in order to bring into proper perspective these particular bodies which are, as I say, merely an extension of various Departments to do a specific job in a very detailed and specialised way.  It is only right and proper that this should be related to and controlled by the elements in the Government that have particular responsibility for them, and that they should not be allowed to run riot and to make their own running in so far as their perks or the perks of their staff are concerned, which in turn will be taken up by others outside as a pattern which others then think that they are entitled to get.  Why should they not be entitled to get them when they find that semi-State organisations are making the running?  It is only natural for them to say &ldquo;Those fellows <Col N="441" /> are doing very well, why the hell should not I?&rdquo;  It is quite obvious that this is happening and should not happen. In my estimation it was started by one such large semi-State Board without the controls we now seek in regard to this little Board, which is doing a very good job in its own right.</P>
    <P>So far as discussing this with the trade unions and Congress and the rest is concerned, I do not think that Senator Murphy is really serious when he says that I should do so.  I do not think that it is in this realm that this sort of discussion now lies or, indeed, at any time lay.  It is our Government's intention, it is Government policy which we are applying in the best way we can, to have this control.  We are applying it to the new Boards and will rectify the situation in the old Boards as opportunity arises.  This is a proper thing to do, and every right thinking person in the country will recognise that it is the proper thing to do so that we can avoid some of the difficulties we got into in the past with a whole lot of satellites chasing each other around into outer space to the detriment of the whole economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole mentioned that as this is not being subscribed to by the Exchequer, then undoubtedly this will be followed by an increase in feed costs.  Undoubtedly, if these costs fall somewhere and they do not fall on the Government they must fall on the actual out-turn of the product, which in the end event is the feed costs, and to that extent the Senator is probably correct to some degree, but is it not right that they should carry it, because these people and their staffs are serving this Board which in turn is serving amongst others the compounders of feeding stuffs, the manufacturers and the farmers, and so this additional cost may have to be borne, but the amounts would be negligible and it would be infinitesimal in relation to the cost of a bag of feedstuffs?  For what it is worth it does come back to this, but it is very small and this little burden will not be begrudged in the long run.</P>
    <P>So far as Senator Murphy is concerned with this allegation of interference with the employer and employee <Col N="442" /> relationship, far be it from me to interfere with anybody's relationship, and I do not think that he is really serious about this at all.  We are not really interfering.  This Board has to do a job for me as the Minister responsible in the Government for agriculture at the moment.  The fact that I have some control over the employees does not mean that I am interfering with the employer-employee relationship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever they may negotiate with, the fact is that I have this responsibility.  I am seeking to get it here for very good reasons and in the national interest, and it is eminently proper that this should be so.  I do not like to start cracking back about who consults with whom or negotiates with whom at the moment, because this would not be very helpful in the circumstances in which we are coming through.  I will leave it at that and just reiterate that interference with the employer-employee relationship is not taking place by me.  This is just not true.  This does not really arise, but I can assure the Senator that I have some regard and responsibility for seeing that the workers are properly paid.  This does come into this question of responsibility.  It is not a responsibility to see that they do not get something, but to see that they get a just wage. We do have this concern and sentiment in our make-up despite the fact that we are members of a Government, and, indeed, this is one of the reasons not clearly evident to people like Senator Murphy why people like myself and my colleagues in Fianna Fáil are in Government, because we have this consideration in dealing with people no matter what situation in life they may be in.  We have as much regard to preserve the rights of our employees and servants as anybody, and it is not true that we are trying to keep them down.  I can assure Senator Murphy that I feel certain that he knows that <Col N="443" /> this is not intended or sought in order to batten on the workers of the country through this little band of people, who are doing a very good job for me and my Department.</P>

      <P>If the Senator read what I said five minutes ago and recalls what I have just said now he will find that there is no inconsistency between one and the other.  They are supplementary to each other and make a whole lot of sense, which if applied today generally outside would leave us in a much more peaceful situation than we find ourselves in at the moment.  At any rate, as I said a moment ago, apart from a few asides that have been raised I think those matters are all that were mentioned by the Senators in regard to this Bill.  As I have already put it to the House, I certainly commend this Bill for acceptance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to the Senator, I would say he is a man after my own heart and I fully agree with the sentiments he has expressed in this regard.  A point I announced earlier and one I should like to repeat concerns the application of a levy system as it will actually apply in respect of this year's crop.  Some of that crop has already been planted, some of it is already growing.  Practically all the crop, in one way or another, is committed to be grown and I think any question of changing the system that would adversely affect this prospective growth could be said to be bad faith <Col N="444" /> on my part.  Therefore, I am precluded from introducing its application this year, but the sentiment and idea behind Senator Fitzgerald's suggestion appeals to me.  Perhaps for the following year's crop we may be able to do this and I have already looked at it.  No readily administrative solution is clearly available. If there had been one, the scheme would probably have been enforced this year.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 14, before &ldquo;gratuities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;widows' and orphans' pensions or allowances&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subsection would then read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as may be after the passing of this Act the Board shall prepare and submit to the Minister a contributory scheme or contributory schemes for the granting of <Col N="445" /> pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions or allowances, gratuities, and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such wholetime officers or wholetime servants of the Board as it may think fit.</P>
    <P>My purpose in putting this in is to make doubly sure that those drawing up such a superannuation scheme will not be precluded from including widows and orphans by the terms of the Bill now before us.</P>
    <P>One of the not very much publicised Committees of this House, which is meeting in a few minutes time this afternoon, is the Statutory Instruments Committee.  If such a superannuation scheme is laid before the House as a statutory instrument, it will be part of the duty of that Committee to draw the attention of the House to such statutory instruments, it, according to the duty of that Committee to draw the attention of the House to such statutory instruments, if, according to the terms of reference of that Committee:</P>
    <P>It appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by statute under which it is made.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of this Committee to draw the attention of the House and of the Minister and his servants to the fact that occasionally powers are invoked which, in fact, are not contained in the empowering Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt very sympathetically with my question.  It is quite obvious he favours having the powers that are enshrined in the words I am suggesting, and my hope is that he will agree to accept this amendment if merely because it makes assurance doubly sure.  It would mean that we can rely on the terms of the Bill as well as on the assurance of intention given us just now by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a question of disagreement of principle. It is a question of whether it is necessary to enable this to be done.  My interpretation of the section as it reads at the moment is that it would enable the pension fund to provide death benefit for widows and orphans, but it would not in my view enable the payment of a pension as such.  If this were to be agreed, the amendment, as suggested, would have to be made on this section.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) of section 1 contains the words &ldquo;the granting of pensions&rdquo;.  If you read &ldquo;the granting of pensions to wholetime officers or servants&rdquo;, and then go back and put in the words, &ldquo;the granting of pensions in respect of such wholetime officers and wholetime servants&rdquo;, obviously if it is only the servants or officers themselves to which this section applies, then the words &ldquo;or in respect of&rdquo; would be absolutely superfluous and no purpose would be served by putting them in.  I rely on the words &ldquo;or in respect of&rdquo; to cover the sort of thing which Senator Sheehy Skeffington has mentioned.  If it were only servants and officers themselves who were concerned we would say so straight away, but here we say:</P>
      <P>... the granting of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such wholetime officers or wholetime servants of the Board.</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;or in respect of&rdquo; are there for a purpose, other than directly for the two categories which do not need to be covered by the word &ldquo;to&rdquo;. That is all we want to know.</P>

It is possible that the Minister's interpretation of these words might not be upheld by a court of law or by the Minister's successor. I cannot feel that he would be losing anything by accepting the insertion of the words, &ldquo;widows' and orphans' pensions or allowances&rdquo;.  He would be making sure that this permissive power &mdash;a power which he admits quite freely is one that he would like the Government to have&mdash;would be given explicitly. It would be far more satisfactory if this were expressed explicitly rather than merely indicated implicitly by the words &ldquo;or in respect of&rdquo;.  I would urge the Minister to accept the amendment, which I feel would not add something to the Bill that would be obnoxious to him, but which would make assurance doubly sure.</P>

If it should be brought to light that a scheme for dependants or widows or orphans should be formulated and brought forward by the Board in agreement with their employees and it was then determined by a court that it should be included if it was not already there, so far as I am concerned and so far as I could commit any successor of mine, we would make the change but I do not think it is necessary.  Certainly, if it should be necessary to make a change in my time I can assure the House that I would come back and change it.  I am quite satisfied with it as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is ridiculous. Since a very important principle was conceded by the Government in regard to introducing widows' and orphans' benefits for their servants, I was suggesting to the Minister that he should take power in this Bill to pay widows and orphans.  Surely it is prudent that he might take that power instead of having the excuse afterwards of saying that under the terms of the measure he is not entitled to do so?  The Government have made provision in regard to widows' and orphans' pensions for civil servants.  I am suggesting that the Minister might take the power to do the same for the people in An Bord Gráin for whom he is now responsible and will be determining their rates of pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as Senator Murphy is concerned I am trying to do the appropriate and fitting thing.  I am glad he appreciates and approves what the Government have done in so far as the widows' and orphans' provisions are concerned.  I just like to get that down twice, not once.  Another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the House is something which I think is relevant in so far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned and that is subsection (7). Every scheme must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and if you do not like it you do not accept it.  If Senator Murphy wants to use the democratic process to get his own way, that is all right but when I suggest to him here that there is democratic process for this he does not agree with me.  How can you satisfy such a man?  I am doing the best I can. As I say, you lean over backwards to do something and then you are tripped from behind.  Seriously, I give an <Col N="451" /> assurance that if and when a scheme comes before this or the other House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's defence of this is quite fantastic because he says that if it transpires that he is wrong about this and widows and orphans cannot be included we can always annul the proposed scheme.  But we cannot reframe it.  We are not being given the power to insert back into the Bill the possibility of having a widows' pension scheme, so, therefore, I feel that the last intervention by the Minister was singularly unenlightened.</P>

      <P>In short reply to the Senator, one cannot have the opportunities and the responsibilities of control of Government unless one is in Government and the Senator is not. It is not possible to have it both ways. I am trying to point out that I am <Col N="452" /> satisfied with what is there and I am endeavouring to make it a little easier for the Senators to accept that there is there what we say is there; in other words, they are not correct in saying what they have been saying.  I have given them these various ways out and they could take them but, instead of that, I am being attacked for making all sorts of defences relevant and irrelevant.  However, I am really being kind to the Senators.  Perhaps, my belief in many cases would be more reliable than the Senators' having regard to the amount of advice which I get from legal advisers and others.  I do not intend that in any way as a reflection as between the Senators and myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would raise the point again of whether this pension can be retrospective to the time these people joined the Board.  I should imagine that under the Bill the scheme would run from the date the Minister mentions in this measure unless we have a special clause making it retrospective to some period before the passing of the Bill. The Bill will only bring it back to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues involved here.  One is whether the Senator is talking about it having retrospective effect for somebody already dead, and the other is whether it should be retrospective to those now serving in regard to their service for qualification purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This contributory scheme would boil down to that we are setting the legislative framework within which by contribution of the employees they negotiate with some trust or insurance company or other such body what type of scheme they wish, and whether they are prepared to pay whatever the amount is.  This is all a matter capable of being settled by them rather than by us.  I do not think that we can make it retrospective or non-retrospective by merely adding or deleting any words in this measure.  It has to do with what they themselves bargain for and are prepared to pay for as regards purchasing any benefits they want.  If that has to take into account service already given this will again be a question of hard bargaining as to how much it will cost them to take cognisance of the various years of service.  This is a bargaining matter, a negotiating matter, between the employees and whomsoever will be providing this service which they will be paying for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Take a member of the staff for ten years or since the inception of the Board, who now for the first time is allowed to contribute towards his pension.  Perhaps ten years of his earning life has been lost towards his pension. A scheme could be produced <Col N="454" /> whereby a lump sum, being his contribution for ten years previously served, would be admitted by the Minister for Finance.  The Board would have to pay its contribution as well as the member who might be willing to pay his contribution.  I think there have been similar schemes providing for a contribution towards meeting an original unpaid ten years or whatever it might have been by the Exchequer or the Board.  I cannot recollect what it was, but I think retrospective payment was made for such a scheme in the past.  I have come across a scheme somewhere where a contribution was paid by the Board or the parent body, whatever it was, towards the years which they would have contributed had there been such a scheme in existence at the time.  If they want to start a scheme now dating from the commencement of their employment in the Board they would find it very difficult to say to the Board: &ldquo;We want you to pay your contribution for the last ten years or whatever it was&rdquo;.  Some help should be given to allow them to date their pension from the beginning of their employment with the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a new problem.  It is quite normal when setting up pension funds for employees that there is an arrangement to purchase backdating of previous service. I think the Minister, in replying to the Second Reading debate about insurance, said that this was being done through an insurance company.  There is no difficulty about this. I recently negotiated a pension fund for 300 bakers in Northern Ireland and it was readily agreed that the service of an employee was limited prior to the inception of the Employment Act.  The Minister asked how long this has been in existence. Again there is no real problem; it is a question of the employer recognising he had an obligation in the matter and that it was not the employee's fault that the pension fund had not been set up earlier.  I hope the Minister will be generous in dealing with the problems which arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are really concerned here with what is possible within the context of legislation.  I am quite <Col N="455" /> satisfied with the types and variety of arrangements that may be arrived at as between a board, its employees and their negotiators with a trust or insurance company, as the case may be, from whom you can get the best possible deal.  These things can be done subject to employees and the Board making their propositions jointly and negotiating at that stage something which will subsequently come up to me.  Unless and until it does, there is nothing I have to say on this matter here.  All other matters are capable of being covered if it is so decided to negotiate in that way and if the negotiating right is worth giving.  Senator Cole will be satisfied as long as it is capable of being done and that is all we are concerned with here today. We are concerned as to whether it is capable of being done within the legislative framework and my answer to Senator Cole is that it is fully capable of being accomplished within the framework of this Bill.  How it is done, how it is worked out, will show itself in the normal way with the normal passage of time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section on which I took issue with the Minister on Second Stage.  It is difficult to summarise the Minister's reply without a copy of his reply but it seems to me he was making two points.  He was linking this, which is admittedly a small organisation with a staff of 13, with other small organisations he has set up for the purpose of carrying out his functions as Minister and doing something that the Minister has decided and agreed to do already.  As the Minister explained, it is the function of An Bord Gráin to carry out an agreement made between the Minister and the farming organisations, and this is his policy. The Minister referred to smaller organisations where the same sort of thing operates but he chided me for making an issue of the five or six other organisations, some of them obscure, which he mentioned.  That is a reasonable <Col N="456" /> answer to the case where you have rather small organisations carrying out in effect, ministerial policy, but then the Minister launched fully into orbit. He referred to organisations which had established their own rates of pay and reached fantastic heights.  I do not know whether he used quite that expression but he was implying that because of the freedom they were given under the legislation they had an exorbitant rate of pay.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister seemed to back pedal very quickly and say that he was concerned not to interfere with organisations claiming good rates of pay, that his real concern was to see that these bodies treated their employees fairly; in accordance with Fianna Fáil policy, they want to see employees fairly treated.  The Minister did not mention these boards but he implied that exorbitant pay increases had been agreed. How is the Minister going to control that situation?  I do not think CIE was one of the bodies he was referring to, but was he referring to the ESB? Is he saying that is now Government policy for the Government to take control of the negotiations of rates of pay of workers in the ESB and CIE as and when they get an opportunity to amend legislation?  I think that is a fair question.  It seems to me a very dangerous thing to be embarking on. Has there been any consultation with Congress?  I am not aware that unions in the public sector have been alerted that it is the Government's policy to intervene and directly fix the rates of pay and remuneration in the semi-State undertakings.  Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps there has been a distinction in the Minister's mind between what he refers to as State bodies and what I am referring to as semi-State bodies, such as the ESB, CIE, An Bord Gráin, Bord na Móna and the B &amp; I.  Are they included in what he is saying is the Government's policy?  I think we are entitled to an answer and if the Minister's answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, then I am opposing this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <P>The Minister in his Second Reading speech said that the terms of remuneration and allowances for expenses to staff which is now a matter for the Board was to be determined by him with the consent of the Minister for Finance and that this would facilitate public development of a uniform pay policy in State Boards.  The Minister went on to say that he was taking the opportunity of this amending legislation of doing this in respect of An Bord Gráin and that it would be their intention to do the same according as the opportunity arose in relation to other State bodies. This may not be the exact wording but it is my interpretation of what the Minister said.</P>

      <P>Faoi réir an Acht Toghcháin (Leasú), 1961, céad daichead is ceithre chomhalta an líon comhaltaí atá i nDáil Éireann anois.  Nuair a bhí an tAcht sin faoi bhráid an Oireachtais, glacadh go foirleathan leis an líon sin.  Ghlac an Dáil leis, freisin, san díospóireacht ar an mBille seo agus, mar sin, ní beartaítear an líon comhaltaí a athrú. Ós rud é go bhfuil Acht na bliana 1961 á athghairm anois beartaítear an fhoráil sin a athachtú in Alt 2 den Bhille seo.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to revise the Dáil constituencies in the light of the 1966 Census of Population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides for a Dáil membership of one hundred and forty-four which is the same as the existing membership and the maximum permissible under the Constitution.  There was broad agreement on this in 1961, <Col N="460" /> when constituencies were last revised, and, indeed, in the Dáil debates on the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that after the next dissolution of Dáil Éireann, the constituencies will be those specified in the Schedule to the Bill and section 4 provides that the number of Deputies to be returned for each constituency will be as set out in the third column of the Schedule.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections contain the consequential and transitional provisions usual in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out the constituencies and is, of course, the really important part of the Bill.  While detailed discussion of the Schedule would not be appropriate at this stage, I should like to mention briefly some general considerations to which the Government have had regard in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection 3º of section 2 of article 16 of the Constitution provides that &ldquo;the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo; Having regard to Court rulings on the meaning of this provision it is clear that very many of the present constituencies do not comply with the Constitution and that a revision must be effected before the next election. It is also clear that in devising new constituencies it is necessary to ensure that the population per Deputy in any case should not deviate from the national average by more than 1,000 per Deputy.  Within these limits we can have regard to certain factors, especially the ratio of electors to population. There has, so far, been broad agreement on this approach.</P>
    <P>The next question to be considered is the size of constituencies.  Over the years the tendency has been towards smaller constituencies.  At one time we had nine-seat and seven-seat constituencies and the present pattern is one of five, four and three-seat constituencies. The Government have come to the conclusion that the five-seat constituency has proved too unwidely and that <Col N="461" /> no new constituencies of this size should be formed.  The two five-seat constituencies provided for in the Bill &mdash;Carlow-Kilkenny and Laoghis-Offaly &mdash;are existing constituencies and are part of an area which is left undisturbed in the present revision.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another important consideration.  I think most people will agree that existing constituencies should not be disturbed unnecessarily. For example, the present constituencies of Laoighis-Offaly, Carlow-Kilkenny, Wexford and Wicklow comply with constitutional requirements and are not being disturbed.  Many of the constituencies to the north of this area (Cavan, Monaghan and Longford-Westmeath) do not comply and some change affecting these and neighbouring constituencies is necessary.  It has been found possible however to retain each of these constituencies by making a number of boundary adjustments and reducing the Kildare representation by one.  The same type of approach has been adopted in the area of Munster excluding Clare.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, limits to the extent to which constituencies can be shored up in this way.  The Census returns reveal a huge disparity between population ratios in constituencies in the Dublin area and the need for an addition of at least four members.  In this case nothing less than a complete recasting of constituencies will suffice. In the area west of the Shannon there must be a reduction of at least three members and widespread alteration of constituencies.</P>
    <P>I think most people would agree that, in providing for a new scheme of constituencies in Dublin city, we should proceed on a uniform basis. Given the decision not to form new five-seat constituencies, this means that the 27 seats in the city area should be divided into either nine three-seat constituencies or six four-seat constituencies and one three-seat constituency. The latter course, which is the one adopted in the Bill, has the merit that it involves less disturbance of the existing pattern of representation.  At present there are three constituencies on the North side and three on the <Col N="462" /> South side.  Under the Bill there will still be three North side and three South side constituencies and in addition a central city constituency.  Apart from this consideration, it should be remembered that constituencies in the city area are comparatively small in size and from this point of view there would be little advantage in having three-seat rather than four-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>When we consider the area west of the Shannon we find the position is quite different.  This area is large in extent and thinly populated.  If the 30 seats in this region are to be distributed in a uniform manner the obvious course is to have ten three-seat constituencies as proposed in the Bill.  Even on this basis the constituencies will be fairly large in area.  Moreover a division on this basis gives a pattern of representation closer to the existing pattern than would be afforded by a division based mainly on four-seat constituencies.  I should add that irrespective of the method adopted the boundaries of most counties in the area must be breached.</P>
    <P>The question of county boundaries, or rather of counties and the loyalties and sentiment they attract, is very important. Before 1961, constituencies were firmly based on counties.  Excluding the four small counties of Carlow, Laoighis, Longford and Leitrim and the counties with which they have traditionally been grouped, each county either constituted a constituency in itself or was divided into two or three constituencies, which were exclusively within the area of the county.  The High Court decision of 1961 forced us to abandon this approach and the court's decision was endorsed by the people at the recent referendum. Nevertheless, I think we should still have regard to the existence of counties, although of course within the narrower limits now permitted.  The census returns show that most counties either have a level of population which, if the county were dealt with in isolation, would not permit of a ratio of population to Deputy within the permitted limits or are affected by such a disparity in a neighbouring county. Faced with this problem we can adopt <Col N="463" /> either of two approaches.  We can merge the counties concerned in huge constituencies consisting of two or more counties or we can retain the identity of each county and bring the population within the permitted level by making boundary adjustments.  The second course, which is more consonant with local sentiment, is adopted in this Bill.  There is, admittedly, the difficulty that people in the transferred areas may feel themselves disfranchised but this can be largely overcome if the number of people in a transferred area is significant enough to ensure that candidates cannot afford to overlook them.  This point has been borne in mind in the drafting of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the main considerations to which the Government have had regard in formulating the proposals contained in the Bill.  I do not claim that they are the only considerations to which regard should be had or that the application of these general principles automatically produces a single answer.  There are very many other ways in which the constituencies could be revised even on the basis of the general approach now being adopted.  What I do claim is that the scheme set out in the present Bill is better than any alternative which has come to notice.  I will, if necessary, deal with this in more detail at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have to say that I regret the necessity for this Bill.  I particularly regret the reduction in western representation and the breaching of county boundaries.  Under the Constitution as it stands no other course is now open to us.  It is in this spirit, and bearing in mind that a general election cannot be held until the constituencies are revised, that I urge a speedy passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Bill at this time has been explained on the ground that there is some constitutional problem.  I had hoped that the Minister would have clarified this, because his references to it have been vague and unsatisfactory.  He has made some reference to the effect that the Attorney-General has given some advice <Col N="464" /> but it is not clear whether this advice was given formally in a manner that would bind the Government or whether it was some off-the-cuff expression of opinion.  It certainly is surprising that at this stage after 30 years under the present Constitution it has suddenly been discovered that the Constitution requires in effect, despite what people have believed it to require previously, redistribution of constituencies after every census.  Hitherto it had been believed that such redistribution was required every 12 years and that when it took place it should be based on the redistribution of population. On that point there was some doubt as to the exact meaning and there was only a constitutional decision in 1960. How is it that we have suddenly discovered that the Constitution has a different meaning from what everybody thought it meant?  How firm is this opinion?  The relevant section of the Constitution is Article 16 subsection (2) clause 4 which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population, but any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann sitting when such revision is made&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the clause of the Constitution which primarily governs the revisions of constituencies.  It makes it clear that such a revision takes place every 12 years and that it shall take account of changes in the distribution of the population. It is now urged that the preceding section, clause 3, takes precedence over this and in some way overrules clause 4.  This clause 3 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It has always been understood until this peculiar ruling was made that redistribution should be carried out in accordance with subsection (3)  of section 2 of Article 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratio between the number of <Col N="465" /> members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I think there is a case of ambiguity here, but I would be surprised to hear that there had been a legal ruling on it. This subsection takes precedence over the next subsection which clearly lays down when a distribution is to be carried out.  Subsection 3 clearly states how and when it is to be carried out.</P>
    <P>We are in the extraordinary position of having this legislation introduced allegedly at this time because of a constitutional ruling, the character of which is unclear.  This suggests that all the constitutional lawyers and the Government have not understood the most important point of the Constitution. Indeed, if it is incorrect to suggest that most of our Dála have been unconstitutionally and illegally appointed &mdash;a fact to which nobody has referred &mdash;the Minister has a duty to explain to the House if a ruling has been given by the Attorney General, and, if so, what the terms of this ruling are and when was it given.  This is an extraordinary issue which has been raised and I think we are entitled to know a little more about it.</P>
    <P>It seems very suspicious that we are having a redistribution of constituencies of a far more drastic character than anything previously carried out, including 1961, several years before it is required under the Constitution. There must be some suspicious reason for the sudden haste in redrawing the electoral map.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister in his reply to give us a full account of the constitutional background of this matter.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister made considerable play of the old argument about population versus electors in explaining the extraordinary redistribution he proposes.  This is a rather different argument from the one he presented to us.  He must have learned in the Dáil that the argument was untenable so he tried a new one with us.  The Minister raised this old hare in the Dáil and used it as grounds for this particular form of redistribution. <Col N="466" /> I would remind the House of the attitude of the Government in the previous debate when the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad proposed to substitute electorate for population.  We caught the Government out on this in spite of the fact that they had previously been pressing that it was essential to have regard to the number of electorate, they voted against it.  Perhaps, the fact that they aired the argument in the Dáil some weeks ago, but they have not aired it in the Seanad, suggests there is some sensitivity to the attitude of the Seanad to the particular weakness of the argument that was exposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in the Dáil, and he said something similar in his speech today, that the boundaries of more than half the counties must be breached and that transfers of population are being kept in this Bill to the absolute minimum.  The Minister's idea of breaching boundaries is different from the ordinary sense of the word. The Minister considers the putting of two counties together into one constituency is a breach of the boundary. This is a concept of fairly recent origin because in all distributions we have had previously where you have counties such as Laois-Offaly put in the same constituency this has never been described as breaching boundaries, yet the Minister keeps talking of these combinations as a transfer of population. He is, of course, trying to hide from the fact that he is causing about five times as much disturbance of population as is necessary.  He is making people vote outside their own counties by attaching part of one county to another as distinct from linking two counties together, which is the practice that has always obtained and has never been referred to until this debate.  In fact, constitutional amendments have never involved the breaching of boundaries or the transfer of population.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in the Dáil&mdash; and I think again today&mdash;that most county boundaries in the West must be breached.  The Minister knows that on Report Stage in the Dáil, Deputy Hogan put forward a distribution for the whole country which involves the <Col N="467" /> disturbance of only one-fifth of the population.  In that distribution three county boundaries are breached and there is one combination of two counties in the same constituency, and that relates to an area in which there are 18 boundaries between two counties either within the area or between the area and the next county.  Out of those 18 boundaries it is, in fact, necessary to breach only three and in one other instance to link two counties together. Yet he had the gall and dishonesty to say that most county boundaries in the West must be breached.  It has been shown that this is not so.  Another feature of the western distribution for which no justification has been, or can be, offered is the transfer of West Athlone to Roscommon constituency. In fact, if West Athlone were not transferred to Roscommon constituency the entire distribution would stand perfectly under the Constitution.  It is a completely gratuitous gerrymander unrelated even to the rest of the distribution which the Minister is proposing, and if the Minister were to abandon it it would be entirely constitutional.  This has been done for purely political reasons.</P>
    <P>In his argument about the eastern part of the country the Minister started off by saying that no change is necessary in South Leinster, and having established that fact he has gone on to say that certain changes are required in North Leinster.  However this is a dishonest argument as the Minister is aware.  Although it is true no change has been necessary in South Leinster for the purpose of having constitutional distribution, there is a desirable change in South Leinster on the basis of the Minister's own argument in the referendum.  That is the reintegration&mdash; to use a word from the Constitution, about which the Minister is fond of making speeches&mdash;of part of County Wexford which has been insidiously partitioned and added to Carlow-KilKenny. It would be desirable in the Minister's view to maintain county boundaries, one of the great arguments in the referendum.  It would be desirable that this part of Wexford should be reintegrated with the rest of the <Col N="468" /> national territory, but the Minister does not propose to do this.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did so reintegrate County Wexford we would then find that by combining Carlow-Kildare and having Kilkenny as a separate constituency it would obviate the need for a large number of changes in North Leinster which involve the complete redrawing of the whole of the electoral map of North Leinster, first by saying that it is not necessary to have any change for the sake of South Leinster itself, although a change would be desirable, despite the fact that such changes in South Leinster would obviate the need for a number of changes in the North.  By this tactic he tries to justify cutting across Kildare-Meath, Meath-Cavan, Meath - Monaghan and Louth-Monaghan. If he adopted the suggested distribution of South Leinster which involves restoring the integrity of Wexford, eliminating all boundary crossings or breaches in South Leinster, combining Carlow-Kildare, and having Kilkenny and Wexford as separate constituencies, it would no longer be necessary to breach the various boundaries in North Leinster which has been done in this extraordinary way with a view to picking up an extra seat for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>In fact, the only boundary crossing needed in East Leinster is Louth-Meath and it is necessary to make some adjustment to that boundary, but the other four boundary changes in North Leinster and keeping Wexford partitioned insidiously is unnecessary and is being imposed on the country by the Government for their own purpose.</P>
    <P>The Cork-Kerry change is one to which we can take no exception; a small adjustment is needed here and the Minister has chosen a particular boundary area&mdash;for all I know he may have had a motive of his own in choosing it.  One cannot fault him for transferring more territory than is necessary in that area.  We accept this as being reasonable.</P>
    <P>We come to Tipperary-Waterford where the Minister had chosen to perpetuate the arrangement under which it is necessary to transfer a large part of Waterford to Tipperary, notwithstanding <Col N="469" /> the fact that the alternative arrangement of switching it the other way round would minimise the disturbance by transferring a much smaller part of Tipperary to Waterford.  Here the Minister, for his own political reasons, is maintaining an unnecessary large disturbance.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area we have had some light thrown on the Minister's motivation for the first time here, which he did not vouchsafe to the Dáil.  It is not a very blinding light but we are grateful for any indication of the justification of the Minister's distribution in the Dublin area.  He started off by saying that, given the decision not to form new five-seat constituencies, the existence of 27 seats in the city area means that it should be divided into nine three-seat constituencies or six four-seat and one three-seat constituency. This contains a number of logical fallacies.</P>
    <P>Even if the decision to form five-seat constituencies were accepted&mdash; and we do not accept that particularly in city areas such constituencies are in any way objectionable&mdash;there exists in Dublin a number of five-seat constituencies. But the Minister's argument is that in a decision not to form five-seat constituencies you can only divide Dublin into three seaters and four seaters.  This is nonsense.  There are already three five-seat constituencies in Dublin city.  Given a decision not to form new five-seat constituencies there are any number of combinations of constituencies in Dublin, including the existing five-seat constituencies already there.</P>
    <P>This is a logical fallacy and the Minister's acute mind will not have missed it&mdash;in fact, I suspect the Minister's acute mind invented it. Moreover, even if that pattern is true, which it is not, he goes on to suggest that there are only two alternative divisions on 27 seats.  The Minister's factorial arithmetic is I am afraid defective. He suggests that you either have to have nine three-seat constituencies or six four-seat constituencies and one three-seat constituency to make 27.  I have been doing a little arithmetic and I am open to correction but I suggest three four-seat constituencies, that is 12, and five three-seat <Col N="470" /> constituencies, 15, add to 27.  So, in fact, there is nothing that requires the Minister to have nine three-seats or six four-seats and one three-seat and this is also untrue.  I do not recall in my brief history in politics any sentence of any Minister which contains so many untruths packed in together as this one does.  It is a measure of the dishonesty in the approach to this whole problem that he has managed to pack so many untruths into so short a space.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, on the issue of the five-seat constituencies I would recall to the House that the argument against that is that they can be terribly big. Cavan-Monaghan, 60 miles from one end to the other, is a very big constituency but in the city of Dublin you can get a five-seat constituency in which you do not have to go three miles, never mind 60 miles, from one end to the other.  So, it is not even clear what is the objection to five-seat constituencies. So much for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should make the point that the distribution proposed by Deputy Hogan minimises the disturbance and it has been designed by Deputy Hogan to do so and he has achieved his objective with twice the success which I have achieved in the suggested distribution I put to this House in the referendum debate in which the House will recall I put forward the point that it was not necessarily the best and I was making no claim it was the best, a distribution which involves the disturbance of only 39,000 people.  Deputy Hogan's ingenuity has enabled him virtually to halve this and he has produced a distribution which is far superior to mine and which reduces the disturbance to 20,500 people.  This compares with the Government's proposal which involves disturbing over 100,000 people, five times as many.  What are the objections to Deputy Hogan's proposal?  One would have thought that a proposal which reduces the disturbance to one-fifth of what the Government are proposing would have commended itself to the Government's consideration.</P>
    <P>What are the arguments against this? I have searched the Minister's speeches to find the argument against and I think I have found it.  There are, in fact two arguments.  One is that Cavan-Monaghan <Col N="471" /> would be too big&mdash;an interesting point&mdash;with 785,000 acres together.  I would point out, however, that Donegal-Leitrim must be almost as big and is longer than Cavan-Monaghan and Mayo is almost as big. It is certainly as long as Cavan-Monaghan would be and is a much odder shape.  Laois-Offaly which the Minister has left quite happily as it is has 917,000 acres which is about three per cent more than this far too large constituency.</P>
    <P>The dishonesty of the Minister's argument is self-evident.  There is nothing too big about Cavan-Monaghan compared with other constituencies which the Minister is apparently happy about.  The only other argument put forward against Deputy Hogan's distribution that I can see&mdash;and the Minister will no doubt remind me if my research is not correct&mdash;is that Carlow-Kildare is too straggling.  Has the Minister looked at Donegal-Leitrim where you have to go from the middle of Leitrim up through that narrow corridor past Northern Ireland and work your way to the islands off the north coast of Donegal?  Has he looked at this extraordinary constituency of East Mayo which he has produced which must be the oddest shape outside the gerrymandered city of Derry that this country has every seen?  Compared to this, Carlow-Kildare is not straggling but compact.  Those are the only two arguments the Minister has put forward against Deputy Hogan's distribution which would reduce by four-fifths the amount of disturbance of population.</P>
    <P>The principal objection, perhaps, to the Minister's proposals is that they involved gerrymandering not so much by boundary changes as such because this is part of the act but by a combination of different sizes of constituencies in different areas.  The Government Party have decided if they can to rig the whole of the west at the expense of county boundaries or any other considerations into a series of three-seat constituencies, that in parts of this area or in most parts of this area they hope they can secure perhaps 45/50 per cent of the vote and they calculate that with that percentage of the vote in a three-seat constituency there is an excellent <Col N="472" /> chance of getting two of the three seats. It is a good bonus if you can get 45 per cent of the votes and 66? per cent of the seats.  That is pretty good going.</P>
    <P>My calculations suggest that a Party which gets 49 per cent of the votes has almost invariably got two of the three seats in this country.  Once you get below that you may not in every case get it but down to 45 per cent you have a very good chance.  In that arrangement Fianna Fáil hope to get not a majority of the votes&mdash;at this stage in their career it is beyond their hopes I think in almost any part of the country judging by the referendum&mdash;but to get in any event something approaching 50 per cent of the votes and therefore to get a bonus and to get two-thirds of the entire seats in each constituency. They have divided the west into three-seat constituencies without any regard to county boundaries or any other consideration other than the electoral advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In Dublin, by contrast, the Minister is using the extraordinary dubious logic I have referred to of dividing the city into a series of four-seat constituencies with one exception because you cannot divide four evenly into 27.  Even the Minister's ingenuity cannot achieve that.</P>
    <P>The rest are divided into four because the Minister believes that Fianna Fáil might get between 38 and 42 per cent of the votes in Dublin and, of course, with that percentage, they could get two of the four seats.  In that way, the Minister is abusing PR and is introducing gerrymandering into PR which even Miss Lakeman was not aware could be done under PR.  She thought that the system was safe. While I was in London last week speaking to a society to which she had been invited, I found her to be quite upset about this when I first mentioned it.</P>

I resent the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government have attempted to gerrymander in such a way as to ignore completely any consideration of county boundaries, and this in the most ruthless way possible.</P>
      <P>I know that some people accused Fianna Fáil of gerrymandering in 1961 but I will say that the disruption which they devised in 1961 was one which would involve more or less minimum disturbance.  However, they picked the parts which they most wanted to disrupt when they had to cross a boundary somewhere but they did not cross any more than they had to.  I would suggest, with respect, that we had as Taoiseach at that time a man who was not prepared to allow his Ministers get out of hand in the way in which the present Taoiseach, politics have been brought to a very low level.  At least, Neil Blaney was under some control under the leadership of Seán Lemass but the present Minister is under no control under the present Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I apologise and move to another area.  While I do not wish to detain the Minister who, I understand, has an appointment, I wish to make one other point and that is in regard to the need for an electoral commission.  I know that different views have been expressed by different people on this question at different times but I believe that it is vital that we have a commission.  This may not <Col N="474" /> have been so necessary before when the extent to which gerrymander could be carried out was minimal but now that this operation is on a scale without parallel, it is vital that we have this commission and a Fine Gael Government in office would introduce such a commission, thereby putting an end once and for all to the gerrymandering that this Bill entails.</P>

      <P>There can be very little doubt that the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968 in its present form springs from the defeat of the Government in their first attempt to deprive the country of the democratic PR system.  This system is the one which as we all know gives the fairest representation to all sections of the community.  But what we see in the present measure is the second attempt to take away PR by making it less effective if not, indeed, unworkable.</P>
      <P>The Bill is altering the seat content of a large number of constituencies from four- or five-seat to three-seat constituencies when everyone knows that PR can give proper and fair results only in constituencies with more than three seats.  We have in the Bill before us a change in the existing provision for 17 three-seat constituencies. These have now been replaced by, I think it is, 26 three-seat constituencies. It is significant also that these three-seat constituencies are located in areas where the Fianna Fáil Party have always been strong and where that Party will reap the fullest advantage in seats in an endeavour to counteract in other areas the growing discontent with their policies.  There is, of course, the hope that the electorate will see clearly the purpose behind the manoeurve and will record their protest against the flouting of their already recorded decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were discussing the Constitution Bill dealing with the constituencies I recall that the Minister showed great anxiety to preserve the county boundaries.  What has happened in the interval, unless of course the vote on PR?  We have in this Bill a wholesale slaughter of county boundaries <Col N="475" /> to the extent of wiping out one complete county and handing its mutilated remains to Roscommon, Sligo, and South-West Donegal merely to bring advantage to the Minister's Party. Leitrim ceases to exist on the electoral map drawn up by the Minister for Local Government.  This is surely super-gerrymandering.  I can understand any political party doing all in its power to win control of the machinery of Government but I cannot understand legislation being introduced to ensure the handicapping of opponents to the extent apparent in this Bill in order to win that control.  I can recall that the heroes of other days sought only opponents &ldquo;worthy of their steel&rdquo;.  Not so the present Minister. The proposals in the Bill are clearly aimed at securing the defeat of certain Opposition members, Deputies who have proved they are worthy of anybody's steel but who are, at the same time, thorns in the sides of the Minister and his Party.  This is a most unstatesmanlike attempt to secure what the Minister considers to be success. What glory can there be when success comes because the fight has been so arranged that all the advantages are with the Minister himself?</P>
    <P>Reading carefully through the Bill I was struck by the fact that had the Minister in the Long Title replaced the definite article in line 5 by the indefinite article, the Title would have given the Bill a truer description.  It would then have read &ldquo;An Act to fix a number of Members of Dáil Éireann&rdquo;<i>et cetera</i> for this indeed is one of the unworthy aims of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1968.  However, the situation has its hopeful side.  Irish people have always had a great regard for those who fight under severe handicaps and it is possible that they in voting will give a repeat performance of their vote on the PR issue.  I should have thought the Minister would have learned wisdom in the interval since last October but apparently not.  I cannot see the Fianna Fáil voters in the mutilated areas such as Leitrim, Clare, <i>et cetera</i> queuing behind Fianna Fáil and voting for their executioners. There could be another shock in store for the Minister and his Party.  The <Col N="476" /> declining spirit of fair-play in the Minister's action as shown in this Bill has been well aired in the other House but we cannot bring about its defeat no matter what we say.  However, we of the Labour Party, will record our votes against the Bill and hope that the good commonsense of the Irish people will once again manifest itself by the defeat of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Senator O'Reilly.  I shall be brief.  I feel we have already said on the Referendum Bills more or less all that is needed to be said on this question.  I should like to start by saying something about the breaching of county boundaries.  Personally, I do not think there is any great sin in joining two or even three counties together.  In fact, it is far more damaging to our democratic system to reduce the number of five-seat constituencies and to maximalise the number of three-seaters. Senator Garret FitzGerald pointed out to the Minister that under the Government's Bill here the disturbance of people as it is called&mdash;meaning the linking up of people of one county with another&mdash;amounts to some 100,000 people, whereas under Deputy Hogan's proposals in the Dáil it would not be necessary to disturb more than 20,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I followed as best I could the proposals made in the referendum debate by Senator Garret FitzGerald on the <Col N="477" /> distribution of constituencies and it seemed to me he made a very good case for redistributing the seats, taking into account the depopulation of certain areas.  I looked forward, I must say, to seeing the Minister dealing step by step with the case made by Senator Garret FitzGerald.  Whether the Minister had not sufficient time at his disposal or for some other reason it seemes to me that he did not deal at all with the case made by Senator FitzGerald then.  I refer to it now in the hope that the Minister may, in fact, show us how the Government think it is necessary to have what some six months ago the present Minister for Local Government thought was the appalling prospect of disturbing so many people.  The Government have now decided to disturb about five times as many as has been shown by Deputy Hogan to be necessary in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister at the end of his speech said that he particularly regretted reducing western representation and the breaching of county boundaries. If he is sincere in this, and I know of no particular reason to suppose that he is not, there is an obligation on him to demonstrate why he is going so very much against his own inclination and breaching many county boundaries which it is unnecessary to breach.  It has been shown to him, both in the Seanad by Senator FitzGerald some six months ago and in the Dáil by Deputy Hogan, that it is not necessary to go anything like as far as he went.  So, his painful regret in this matter is unnecessary.  On the previous occasion he evaded the issue and did not explain why he could not divide the constituencies as proposed by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>I would ask him this time not to evade the issue but to tell us precisely why he is not taking a division which would disturb the least people in fact. The other portion of this sentence which expresses his particular regret refers to the reduction in western representation. This of course is a reflection on western depopulation. While it would be wrong to blame one Minister or indeed one Government for western depopulation we ought to <Col N="478" /> recognise, all of us in Parliament, that this western depopulation is something for which we all bear a share of responsibility and which in fact is not being catered for by measures taken to change it.  The Minister said earlier on in his speech and I quote him:</P>
    <P>Over the years the tendency has been towards smaller constituencies.  At one time we had nine-seat and seven-seat constituencies and the present pattern is one of five-, four-and three-seat constituencies.  The Government have come to the conclusion that the five-seat constituency has proved too unwieldy.</P>
    <P>As was made clear in the referendum debate the result of deciding that the biggest constituencies would be five-seaters was that this reduction to five-seaters as the biggest ones reduced the chances of the smaller Parties and of the Independents and increased the margin by which the largest Party would exceed the amount of seats to which proportionately they were entitled. When you reduce from nine seats to seven seats and from seven to five seats the trend is against the Independents and against the smaller Parties and in favour of the bigger Parties. Consequently, when you reduce further from five seats to four seats and three seats you are quite consciously loading the dice against the smaller Parties and in particular against any chance the Independents may have of getting elected.</P>
    <P>The Minister simply says: &ldquo;The tendency has been towards smaller constituencies.&rdquo; I would say the tendency has been in that direction because the bigger Parties have been increasingly intoxicated by the sense of their own power and the feeling that unless they remain in power for very extended periods the country will suffer an irreparable loss.  This is not my feeling and I point to the fact that this tendency is simply a big power, a big Party, a Cabinet tendency and does not by any means correspond to the will of the people.  The will of the people expressed itself pretty forcefully in the referendum in favour of the system of proportional representation and the effect of proportional representation is least when the number of seats per <Col N="479" /> constituency is smallest.  Some people might say: &ldquo;After all, if that is what Fianna Fáil are doing, that is not so bad.&rdquo;  The reason for that is in Article 16 of the Constitution.  It prevents them from doing so.  In subsection 2, paragraph 6 it says:</P>
    <P>No law shall be enacted whereby the number of members to be returned for any constituency shall be less than three.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing is getting gradually nearer and nearer to this minimum.  Now we are being asked to approve a Bill which will give us out of 42 constituencies 26 three-seat constituencies and where possibly we had as many as 14 five-seaters we will now have only two five-seaters.</P>
    <P>This is quite definitely going against the whole principle and effect of proportional representation, the issue which was put to the people and the people gave a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Fianna Fáil policy on that issue.  Now the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister in particular are using this Bill to extract from the proportional representation system the maximum advantage by reducing as far as he dares the number of small seat constituencies and he puts it before us by saying &ldquo;five-seat constituencies have proved too unwieldy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Garret FitzGerald when he asks what does &ldquo;unwieldy&rdquo; mean?  Let us have a look at some of the three-seaters which the Minister is proposing and ask ourselves are they not quite obviously unwieldy? In fact, the five- or seven-seat constituencies in which five or seven representatives of different Parties often drawn from different localities within the constituencies will give a variety of representation and the word &ldquo;unwiedly&rdquo; has no meaning there.  If it had a meaning it would certainly apply to many of the constituencies proposed in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister, having talked about the tendency towards smaller constituencies and the Government having come to the conclusion that five-seat constituencies were too unwieldy says and I quote him:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> Given the decision not to form new five-seat constituencies, this means that the 27 seats in the city area should be divided into either nine three-seat constituencies or six four-seat constituencies and one three-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald has already dealt with that and I will not go over it again.  I merely mention the fact that the Minister is regarding Government decisions as if they represent the national trend when in fact the national trend was represented by the sound hiding the Government took by nearly a quarter of a million votes in the referendum on the very question of proportional representation and its effects.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have us accept his view which he stated over and over again in this House before and in the other House, and I again quote him, when he says this today:</P>
    <P>The question of county boundaries, or rather of counties and the loyalties and sentiment they attract is very important.</P>
    <P>Having done that he proceeds to slice them and to have, I think I am right in saying, 13 or 14 constituencies which quite obviously cross at least one county boundary.  He does this, as has been demonstrated both here and in the Dáil, without its being necessary.  Must we therefore assume that either he does not understand what he is doing or that he does not mean what he says? I would regard it as not very useful for us to debate at very great length this measure in which we are being asked to divide up the county into 26 three-seat constituencies, 14 four-seat constituencies and two five-seat constituencies. I am afraid I am driven to accept the view of Senator FitzGerald that the considerations of Party advantage have been in the Minister's mind when he was laying down the lines for those constituencies.  This is a harsh thing to say and is something one regrets finding oneself in the necessity of saying it.</P>
    <P>As a result of a change in a strictly working class area which voted strongly for him, Dr. Noel Browne lost his seat in the Lower House.  Similar changes <Col N="481" /> occurred at the same time as in other areas, for instance, Donegal, the reason being, if we are to believe the Government's theory at the time, the existence of an almost impassable range of mountains.  However, it did not become apparent that there was any such range between Ringsend and the rest of Dr. Browne's constituency.  On that occasion, in comparision with the present Bill, it was merely the thin edge of the wedge but now the Minister has gone completely to town, as it were, for the purpose of carving up constituencies as best he can and, in the light of past knowledge available to him, in order to ensure that the maximum number of Fianna Fáil Deputies will be returned to the Dáil after the next election.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the end justifies the means and that it is necessary, in order to save the country, that a maximum number of Fianna Fáil Deputies be returned to the next Dáil. It is quite possible that the Minister is convinced of this but I am not convinced of it and I do not believe that the people are convinced of it either.</P>
    <P>The message that we can convey from this House to the people of Ireland is that the Government have noted how positively the people have indicated their wish to have the proportional representation system retained&mdash;a wish so clearly expressed in the referendum&mdash;and they have decided, in so far as in them lies, to thwart the effects of this system by reducing its effects to a minimum.  The Government have reduced the number of five-seat constituencies to two, the number of four seaters to 14 and the number of three seaters to 26 and all this for the advantage of their own Party.  This represents a glaring example of contempt for the will of the people and I trust that the people will indicate at the polls to the Minister and to those of his Party who accept this administrative devaluation of the system of PR that the strength of opinion is for fair play and decency and for democratic behaviour under PR as was represented in the referendum and which will have its counterpart in the voting in the next general election.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  The Minister, in this Bill, has my sympathy because he has had to perform a most unpleasant task.  In normal circumstances, a problem should be to fit the garment to the wearer but, in this case, the job was to fit the wearer to the garment.  This garment is an inelastic one and the Minister cannot change it. The provision of 20,000 population per Deputy means that the garment cannot be changed to fit the wearer so the unfortunate wearer must be changed to fit the garment.</P>
      <P>There is no use in pretending that this can be done in a painless way even if it is true that there is an infinite number of permutations that could be arrived at in the drawing up of these constituencies.  Regarding the question of gerrymandering, I contend that it is impossible to gerrymander unless, firstly, one knows how each individual votes and, secondly, one would have to be sure that the particular voting pattern would not change.  This, as we know, is the case in Northern Ireland and it is not to anybody's advantage either here or in the Six Counties to pretend that this Bill is an attempt to gerrymander.  It is not possible to compare conditions here under a democratic Government with the set-up elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald spoke of an attempt to gerrymander when he referred to the fact that a 42 per cent vote might result in a gain of two seats out of four in a four-seat constituency and, in doing that, he portrays his own lack of confidence in the future of his Party.  It does not seem to have entered his head that this might be of benefit to Fine Gael.  Senator FitzGerald's alternative proposal&mdash;the one which he had published in the papers and which seems to be more or less the same as Deputy Hogan's&mdash;has at least taken the whole country as a unit and not like some of the other Deputies in the Dáil who, when speaking on the Bill, confined their remarks to their own particular counties.  Senator FitzGerald provided a map of the proposed re-arrangement under this Bill.  He also provided a map in relation to his own proposals but he neglected to make available a map of <Col N="483" /> the position as it exists at present.  In other words, he is thinking in terms of black and white as if there was no such thing as an in-between colour.</P>
    <P>For instance, he neglected to refer to the fact that there is at present a constituency of South Tipperary-West Waterford.  In the same way, he treated Leitrim as if it was already divided. Some Deputies, when dealing with this question were even less fair&mdash;I might say dishonest&mdash;because each of them treated his own county as if it existed in isolation and as if the population of his constituency existed in isolation from the rest of the country and as if other counties did not have to be taken into account.  We have a typical example of this in regard to Leitrim.</P>
    <P>There are two Fine Gael Deputies in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  Of course, what we in Leitrim would have liked, if it had been possible, would be to have a two-seat constituency of our own because we would then have one Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil Deputy.  The only problem I can foresee in regard to that would be that we would have two Fine Gael friends competing against each other and what I would be afraid of would be that the people in Telefís Éireann who are responsible for televising such bloodsports as coursing, cock fighting and so on might hear of it and then we would have squeamish people objecting to this being shown on television.</P>

      <P>There has been a lot of talk about Leitrim.  Those people who are now regretting the division of Leitrim believe that Leitrim was already divided in 1951.  They leave out of account the 1961 court decision. They leave out the recommendations that they made at the time of the referendum.  They leave all these things out of account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has adequately answered Senator O'Reilly's question as to how they would propose to deal with Leitrim.  You have the added problem of Donegal and how do you add <Col N="484" /> either a piece of Leitrim to Donegal or a piece of Donegal to Leitrim?  You could not go into Tyrone or Derry or Fermanagh because of an earlier arrangement that was made in 1925 and which may be a little bit embarrassing to some of the people in the Opposition.  It is another noteworthy fact that the arrangements proposed by Senator FitzGerald and by Deputy Hogan would result in Ulster representation in the Dáil being reduced by two seats.  Not content with having signed away six counties, they now want to reduce the representation from Ulster by two further seats.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is that not all the people in Leitrim have been changed from the areas in which they are at present voting.  People in North Leitrim have been changed into Donegal and a smaller number have been changed from the Roscommon-Leitrim constituency back into the Sligo-Leitrim constituency where they traditionally voted, but two-thirds of the people of Leitrim have not been disturbed at all.</P>
    <P>Another thing that was mentioned in the Dáil debate on this was the delegation from the Fianna Fáil Party in County Leitrim that was received by the Minister on this matter.  The Minister has stated since that this delegation, men who were honest and sincere, made a better case for the distribution of Leitrim than did any of the Opposition people.  The point with regard to Leitrim is that no one has answered the question fairly of what the alternative is to the Minister's proposal, and we are entitled to ask for the answer to that question.</P>

      <P>It is rather disheartening in a way to have to resume the session with the present Bill, because in it we find embodied the worst in legislation and the type of approach that is at present threatening to wreck the country outside of Dáil Éireann.  Here we find that approach being used in the same way&mdash;in other words something which should clearly be above Party considerations and Party advantage is presented to us in a blatant Party fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of setting up constituencies should most certainly have <Col N="485" /> been decided by an independent commission or, if that were not available, a commission should have been set up by both Houses that would work on this as Irishmen working together in a committee, Irishmen seeking to get a fair and just solution to a problem. Surely we could work together in a committee and we could, using the ordinary rules of fair play, agree on the proper means of arranging constituencies for this small country of ours?  But that was not done, and what is presented is so obviously wrong that to call it a gerrymander is to misuse that much-criticised word, because we find the basic principle used is, first of all, to get away as far from proportional representation as possible, to make the representation as disproportionate as possible, to go against the expressed will of the people only three months ago.</P>
    <P>Again, we find the principle involved is to neutralise Dublin and its 40 seats. The next election might just as well not be held in Dublin at all for the effect it is going to have on the final result.  Money could be saved by not having an election in Dublin.  Senator FitzGerald says that with 40 per cent or 42 per cent of the vote the Government Party would get two out of four seats everywhere but you do not need 40 or 42 per cent for one Party to get two out of four seats in a four-seat constituency.  Twenty per cent of the vote is the quota, and the Party getting a quota plus 15, in other words 35 or 36 per cent of the vote, in the Dublin constituencies next time will almost certainly get two out of four seats in every Dublin constituency.  That is what the Government are aiming at. That is very plain and simple&mdash;that a vote which can go as low as 35 per cent will take half of Dublin's representation. Then the remainder of the country is divided up into three-seaters, meaning that 49 per cent of the vote takes two out of three seats.  This is the net effect of the mathematical juggling, but this is not fair play or the type of example that we can hold up to people outside Dáil or Seanad Éireann as to what constitutes fair play here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have been giving very wrong example to the people outside, first of all less than 12 months ago when the Government salary increases <Col N="486" /> were given without any talk whatsoever of productivity or of any other standard except more pay. Secondly, how can we ask strikers or students or others outside this House to sit down and be reasonable and rational people and to work out decisions around the conference table when here in such a vital matter as constituency arrangements we ordinary, sensible Irishmen elected and sent here are apparently not to be trusted by the Government to constitute a committee that could work this out to the satisfaction of all?  Time is running out with us, and we have every right to be disturbed with happenings outside this House, but we should look at ourselves and see are we leading. Unfortunately, we are not, because the legislation that has come through here in the past year has been negative, one series after another.  Now after the referendum and the loss of time, all we can find time for is this highly negative and wrong piece of work.  It is very wrong, and we had better look to it and examine our consciences and see how we can give more leadership. Perhaps the acrimonies of Party debate are undermining our whole structure. Perhaps the time has come when in the present crisis&mdash;because crisis is the word for it&mdash;we should put a national Government going.  The time has come when opponents either in the Government or on the other side will be generous in acknowledging good work done by others, just like Deputy Childers did in London when far away from our shores he was man enough to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Deputy Dillon and the loss he would be to the public life of the country when he retired.</P>
    <P>Could we not have a little more positive work?  Could we have not a reorganisation of constituencies but a reorganisation of our work here to bring it into line with the requirements of 20th century national leadership, worked out and hammered out at the committee table, in full and generous acknowledgment of the contribution each and every one is making to the future?</P>

      <P>The Senator from the fast-disappearing constituency of Leitrim will probably have an opportunity before the House rises to give me the benefit of his wisdom.  Until then I shall continue to develop this. It is obvious that there is a shifting away from proportionality in the five-seat constituency.  The man of ability and intelligence who was not simply prepared to make himself a doormat for his constituents, who felt that Dáil representation really meant legislating, not messenger boy tactics, this man, no matter what Party he was in, had a chance in a five-seat constituency of having his real work as legislator recognised by 16 per cent of the people and could just manage to get returned to the Dáil.  This is impossible in the three-seat constituency where he has to get between 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the vote before being returned.  Consequently, we are making it hard for the real legislator to get back to Parliament. Ideally, Parliament should be a blend of both, but now the whole emphasis is going to the man who makes himself the best messenger boy. This is unfortunate.  I wonder if we can do something about it before it is too late, or must we keep on deluding ourselves, feeling all is well within Parliament, but that it is outside Parliament that things are wrong.  The outside will respond to leadership from Parliament.  My suggestion is that we are not giving them 20th century leadership today.</P>
      <P>As to the Bill itself, I do not worry too much about county boundaries. They are outdated in any case and go back to King John in 1200, and if the Minister is undoing some of the work of King John I do not think that is really significant.  What is significant is the disproportionality between giving the country one treatment of the three-seat constituency and the city another treatment of the four-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that is wrong is that we have had this recent Bill, in addition <Col N="488" /> to one we previously had in 1961.  The next Government is entitled to bring in a new electoral Bill which will neutralise the country and probably throw the deciding power to the cities; in other words, divide cities into three-seat constituencies and the country into four-seat constituencies.  That is typical of the unfortunate practice we are encouraging and I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, if he could give us some ray of hope for the future.  Could he promise us this is the last time we will be faced with this unpleasant type of manoeuvre and that he will set up a constituency commission to carry out this job in future, once every 12 years, and ensure that as far as possible the same measure of constituency is used in all areas, that if we are going to have three-seaters in the country we will have three-seaters in the city?</P>
    <P>Let us go back to the five-seat constituency, and let us, as Irishmen, work together in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to set an example to the people outside whom we criticise for not being able to resolve their differences around the conference table.  Perhaps we are not giving them the headline. We should resolve our differences and thereby set an example for others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is probably what one would refer to as an unpleasant necessity, a necessity that is being forced on the country by the wishes of the people.  Some short time ago the people were offered the opportunity of agreeing to a certain tolerance&mdash;a one-sixth tolerance&mdash;which would not necessitate altering boundary constituencies.  Senator Quinlan and those who now so strongly oppose this Bill, which is absolutely essential, were those who persuaded the people that under no circumstances should this tolerance be allowed.  They now say that there is an orientation towards the cities and that there should be fewer seats for Deputies in rural Ireland.  As a result of their efforts, rural Ireland loses four Deputies and Dublin gains four Deputies.  Due to their efforts, 10,000 votes in Dublin are as good as 13,000 in most parts of the country.  At that time they concealed the true facts from the people. <Col N="489" /> Population and residence are two completely different things and the city is getting the benefit of the votes not only of the country people who were in Dublin but also foreigners staying in our hotels and people on our ships on that particular night.  Now they find that as a result of their determination to oppose everything of which the Government are in favour, rural Ireland loses four seats to Dublin and rural Ireland, per Deputy, must have approximately 20 per cent more votes than Dublin.  That is one of the unpleasant results of being two-faced.  It is unpleasant when the Opposition feel their sole role is to oppose everything that the Government proposes.  That is their definition of parliamentary opposition.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan asked &ldquo;Are we leading?&rdquo; and he replied for himself &ldquo;Unfortunately we are not&rdquo;.  I say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to that as far as the Opposition are concerned.  They led the people by such shibboleths and such catch cries as: &ldquo;You must have one man, one vote.&rdquo;  What they were really saying to them was that ten votes in Dublin city were as good as 13 votes in rural Ireland.  Surely any responsible person must accept the normal consequences of his own actions?  Now they are not prepared even to do that. Now, because they must deal with this Bill, because this Bill is absolutely essential, they are wondering what colour to put on their opposition and so, of course, they stoop again to the same sort of tactics and they talk about motives.  They say the Government are doing it for some particular motive.  Can Senator Quinlan or any other Senator in this House say what would the actual result be in any constituency in this country with very few exceptions, how many seats would go to any particular Party?  I feel it would be utterly impossible, but of course they must endeavour to attribute base motives and so they talk about gerrymandering.  The Minister and the Government find themselves in this position as a result of the efforts of Senator Quinlan and his friends to mislead the Irish people by saying that only 14 out of the 38 constituencies are now within the defined electoral limits.</P>

      <P>And that 24 of the 38 constituencies must be recast.  There is no alternative.  There is no option. Twenty of the 27 administrative counties would have to be either added to or a portion taken from them so as to keep within the requirements of the Constitution decided on by the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The Minister then finds himself in this difficulty.  How does he set about doing it?  There is the whole western portion of the country, which is depopulated from Donegal to West Cork, and Senator Quinlan suggests there should be five-Deputy constituencies there.  Of course, if there were he would find some other argument against it.  Can one sensibly picture a Deputy for County Galway properly serving the entire interests of that county from east to west, from north to south?  Can one picture a Deputy from County Donegal, if it were all one constituency, serving properly the interests of that constituency?  In rural Ireland, as distinct from the city, various parts of a large constituency require completely different treatment. You have not such a constituency in the city.  You have portion of the constituency, like the seacoast, interested in fisheries.  You have perhaps the east coast interested in a small industry, you have perhaps some interested in agriculture. Any Deputy who is worth his salt will serve not only his own Party but every constituent in his area irrespective of what Party politics may be affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the Deputy on the extreme west coast, where fisheries are a prime concern, a concern which today gives valuable employment, a concern which today adds considerably to our national wealth, must make himself completely <i>au courant</i> with every aspect of that.  He must understand the hopes, the wishes, the aspirations, the ambitions of the people in his area it <Col N="491" /> he is going to be worthwhile.  No Deputy can do that in a constituency which perhaps from the extreme west to the extreme east is 50 miles or 60 miles or from the extreme north to the extreme south is an equal distance.  If a Deputy is to serve his constituency he must know his area thoroughly.  He must know not only the members of his own Party.  He must know all his constituents and he must also know what is good for his area.  He must know what is well suited to his area and he must know the traditions in his area. So, it is quite obvious, if rural Ireland is to be served as rural Ireland should be served, the most appropriate constituency should, at the outside, be a three-Member constituency.  Even there the distance may be very great, the interest will be varied and sometimes complicated, but that is the maximum and that is exactly what the Minister has done in this case.  Senator Quinlan is satisfied that a certain type of person, somebody whom he suggests is a national leader, a man of whom this country might be proud, would be unable to get one in four votes in his constituency.  That is his actual statement. In a three-seat constituency the quota is one more than 25 per cent, one vote more than 25 per cent.  Even all of those he has not to get on the first count.  He can get transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to somebody who is so little interested in the area, who is so little in the constituency and in the people that between the first votes and the transfers he is unable to get one-fourth of the votes in that constituency.  He talks about the unfairness of four-seat constituencies, that they will break two-two, that is to say if a Party gets 40 per cent of the votes in a constituency they will get two seats.  All right, they will get two seats but what Party will get the two seats?  Will it be Labour? Will it be Fine Gael?  Will it be Fianna Fáil?  He says it would be fairer to have five-seat constituencies.  In a five-seat constituency if any Party gets, between the original votes and the transfers, 51 per cent of the votes or 50.5 per cent of the votes they get three seats out of five; so for the extra 10 per cent, between 40 per cent and 50 per cent, they get <Col N="492" /> one extra seat.  He says that is fairer.  I do not know.  It does not correspond with my idea of fairness.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, he suggests that there should be a revision of the constituencies every 12 years.  He is completely ignoring the terms of our Constitution.  The only guideline the Government have is the decision given by Judge Budd in which he suggested that 1,000 votes one way or the other would not be objectionable.  When the Irish people got the opportunity of voting on a tolerance proposal, on what would have been a reasonable tolerance, they decided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I agree it was in no uncertain terms but I repeat that they did so because of the highly skilful propaganda, slander and backbiting put forward by the Opposition.  Having fooled the people once, surely they do not hope to do it a second time?  Let us be factual about the whole thing. At the moment, the national average for a Deputy is 10,869 in population and the Government find themselves in the position that they must keep within 1,000 of that.  This is what is involved here but, if a tolerance of one-sixth had been allowed, there would be no need to keep within a thousand.  The Government could have kept within about 1,800 and there would have been fewer of these changes.  Senator Quinlan says he has no regard for county boundaries because they were introduced by King John.</P>

They play a very big part in the Department of Health, in the Department of Local Government, in roads, in housing and in tourism.  Therefore, the closer the Dáil constituencies can be kept to the administrative areas of county councils, <Col N="493" /> the better; otherwise, a Deputy is a county councillor for one area and a Dáil Deputy for another area.  The interests of both areas may be conflicting and the Deputy cannot possibly hope to serve properly those people whom he represents as a county councillor and those whom he represents as a Dáil Deputy.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan asked the question &ldquo;How can we give more leadership?&rdquo; May I answer that shortly for him and for the Opposition in both Houses of the Oireachtas in general?  They can give more leadership to the Irish people if they are more concerned with doing what is right than appearing to be right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before and during the referendum campaign, the Minister told the people that, if the proposals contained in the referendum were not accepted, the constituencies would be butchered.  When we look at the map, it is obvious that that is exactly what the Minister has done.  I believe that the Minister should not have been allowed engage in the kind of retribution he did engage in.  Deputy P.P. Hogan showed that there was no need to shift people back and forward to the extent the Minister did in the re-arrangement of constituencies.  Deputy Hogan pointed out how the re-arrangement could have been carried out with a disturbance of only 20,000 people.  The Minister has not answered that and cannot answer it.  It is my contention that the proposals put forward by Deputy Hogan would have been carried by an independent commission. It is obvious that, at some future time, and in fairness to the people, we will have to agree to an independent commission being set up in order to have a situation created in which we will be assured of the one man, one vote representation instead of the kind of representation where it is possible to have three-seat constituencies in the country and four-seat constituencies in the Dublin area, as has been done by the Minister.  The Minister created a large number of three-seat constituencies in the western areas where there is no wide diversion of political opinion among the people; whereas in the urban areas, where there is a divergence <Col N="494" /> of political opinion, he has created the four-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>This commission that I believe must come at a future date when this political gerrymander can be undone, as it must be under the Constitution, may be sooner than we expect.  Looking back over the years we can see that in the past we were satisfied here to revise the constituencies within 12 years to comply with that section of the Constitution, but now we see that a more important section of the Constitution is the one relating to the census, that after every census the constituencies must be reviewed at periods not exceeding 12 years.  There is, in other words, a limit of 12 years; but it arises after every census, when the constituency representation must be examined again.  As a result of the Supreme Court decision in relation to the balance between representation, it is confined to a difference of 1,000 votes.</P>
      <P>Another thing which the Minister has wrongly done in connection with this legislation is that he has allowed the difference of 1,000 upwards as far as the west of Ireland is concerned and downwards as far as the cities are concerned; but already, if the population were to be counted, the difference of 1,000 is far more here in these constituencies than what the Minister is working on.  He is working on the 1966 Census, and he knows himself the stampede that has been taking place from the rural areas not alone in the form of emigration&mdash;approximately 20,000 to 25,000 a year and even more &mdash;but in addition the scramble out of the rural areas into the urban areas particularly towards Dublin city.  We are now passing legislation where actually the average is 990 in a couple of cases above what would be required and in fact, as a result of the increased population in Dublin city, this is now probably 2,000 per Deputy above the national average instead of the maximum of 1,000 which was laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the east of Ireland is concerned, and particularly Dublin city and county, the Minister is using the high figure.  He has put a figure 1,000 above the national average instead of <Col N="495" /> being fair, because if he were to do it fairly what he should have done was to go a thousand below the national average and then he would come nearer to the real figures as far as representation is concerned.  When the next census comes out it will be shown clearly that Dublin city and county are under-represented and a number of the areas which were given the lower figure, that is down 900 fewer than the national average, are actually getting more than they are entitled to even at the present time because the Minister is working on the 1966 Census.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister could have done a fairer and better job by taking these considerations into mind when he was making out this map.  Take Dublin city and county.  The natural boundary between the north and south in County Dublin was the River Liffey.  Instead of that the Minister decided to give four seats to the northern side of the Liffey, which on population was entitled only to three.  In order to bring the figures up he has put in areas from the South County Dublin, such as Walkinstown and even as far as Kimmage Manor, stretching back to Balbriggan to create a four-seat constituency there.  This includes areas north and south of the Liffey instead of staying north of the Liffey and providing the north county with three seats only.  In the south county the Minister, having given a slice of the south to the north county, is left with only a three-seat constituency, when in fact the area south of the Liffey was entitled to a four-seat constituency.  Those of us who are familiar with the political set-up in the constituency of County Dublin realise that it was deliberate on the part of the Minister, in carrying out the distribution of population in this way, in giving to the north county a slice of population to which it was not entitled and in not taking the Liffey as the boundary between north and south County Dublin.  We all know, and in fact people outside the city know, that the Liffey runs practically west out from the city towards Lucan and was a fair divide between north and south County Dublin.  I can tell the Minister, and he knows it himself too, that the <Col N="496" /> people in the northern part of County Dublin&mdash;Skerries, Balbriggan, Rush, Swords and all those places&mdash;are shocked to hear that Walkinstown and Kimmage have been put in with the north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>We know what the Minister has done in the west.  He had to split a constituency there to keep two Ministers from being at loggerheads.  My friend from Leitrim mentioned the fact that two Fine Gael Deputies in Leitrim would not be very willing to agree if they found themselves in the one constituency there, but the Minister deliberately drew a line in the County Mayo which could be described as nothing but a clear case of gerrymandering of the constituencies to suit the political set-up of the Fianna Fáil Party so far as County Mayo was concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not going to delay any longer except to say that the people were asked to decide on two issues in the referendum, and, whether we like it or not, we must agree that the people have displayed a remarkable degree of intelligence from one election to another.  Any of us who have examined ballot papers and the way the people have voted and passed their preferences must agree that the Irish people vote in a very deliberate, intelligent manner. It may not be the way politicians might like to see them vote, but at least we must say that the Irish public are an educated people so far as elections are concerned.  In the matter of electoral representation, we got a very clear call from the people in the referendum. They turned down by a huge majority &mdash;the biggest defeat ever suffered by a political Party in this country&mdash;the two proposals, one being the &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; proposal that was an opportunity to fiddle with the figure as far as representation is concerned and the other was the straight vote system.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland there are only 13 Opposition members in Stormont, although the number of persons who voted for Opposition members is probably as high as 33? per cent.  We have not that kind of representation in this part of the country under the present system which we have decided to keep, but we could have found ourselves in <Col N="497" /> the same situation as Northern Ireland if the direct vote system had been accepted, with three-quarters of the members for Fianna Fáil and one-quarter for the Opposition, although they might have obtained up to 49 per cent of the vote.</P>
    <P>I feel even at this stage, although I suppose it is nearly too late, that the Minister should consider bringing in amendments to this Bill which would bring the representation into line.  The Minister is not just legislating for Fianna Fáil.  He thinks he is and that was his object, but he is legislating for future generations, and in fairness to people who will be voting in five, ten or 15 years, he should ensure it is a case of one man one vote and equal representation for all the electors.</P>
    <P>The argument about people on boats, in hotels, hospitals and so on is just a spurious argument, although the Minister has tried to win it by putting forward figures to support his case.  It was suggested, for instance, when the Minister was amending the Constitution, that the question of the electors could be brought in instead of the census population.  But that amendment was not carried out and the Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to adopt the scheme put forward by Deputy Hogan. It seems the best and fairest one and will ensure that people will get equal representation instead of Fianna Fáil getting more than they are entitled to in some areas where the line has been drawn in a manner the Minister thinks will suit them.</P>

One argument he used was that the number of foreigners who happen to be in the country at a given time have an opportunity to vote in this country.  He must be aware of the fact that one must declare oneself to be an Irish national before being permitted to register as an elector.  This fallacious argument has been advanced and repeated <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I feel some sympathy with British residents here who use the argument that when an Irishman becomes <Col N="498" /> resident in Britain he is immediately given the right to vote in the British elections, but we, in the special committee that sat on electoral reforms, came to the conclusion we should adhere to our decision to confine the responsibility and privilege of voting in this country to our own nationals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point and I intend to deal with it.  This point of basing the constituencies on population figures was endorsed in the 1937 Constitution after many years of experience of the original Free State Constitution.  It was the Fianna Fáil Party, led by a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil Ministers, who presented that Constitution and it was passed by the country and enacted on the advice of the Fianna Fáil Government on the basis of population. However, I am sure that the originators of that proposal did not foresee the entire denuding of the population of the western seaboard which occurred during the 30 years of their administration. If there are crocodile tears today at the loss of seats in the western seaboard, it is merely a consequence of the fact that the people whom one would expect to have voting rights in those areas are now voting in London, Coventry and Birmingham and are more concerned with the advantages of a Labour or Conservative Government in Britain than they are about putting in a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Government in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, a big song and dance is being made about the dire effect it would have on the western seaboard to have that area lose some Deputies &mdash;three or four&mdash;but it cannot be forgotten that the present Government, and the preceding Governments, have had four Ministers representing that region and it is a reflection on those Ministers if they have failed to influence Government policy to the advantage <Col N="499" /> of the western seaboard.  How is it suggested that four humble backbenchers could have more success than four Ministers, who sit round the Government table&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That even fortifies my argument&mdash;five Ministers from the west of Ireland.  How could four backbenchers succeed where five Ministers have so radically failed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been remarks regarding the duties of effective Deputies and arguments have been advanced that we must reduce the number of large seat constituencies to three or four member constituencies.  In the earlier days of the State we had constituencies comprised of seven to nine members where proportional representation operated to its logical conclusion.  In those days doubtless those Deputies had grave problems to resolve on behalf of the electorate.  They did not have the emoluments which Deputies have today and I certainly do not sympathise with a Deputy elected today in a five-seat constituency from the point of view of the amount of travelling his work entails.  He is well compensated for any additional work he may have to perform.  A system has grown up in recent years that has seriously aggravated the amount of unnecessary work Deputies have to perform; a type of messenger boy work, Deputies sending letters to ordinary applicants for a simple grant and replies from Ministers where the Deputies never at any time made representation on behalf of those persons. When that is so, how can a Deputy complain about the volume of work he has to perform in a multiseat constituency?  Undoubtedly, the vast majority of constituencies are reduced in this Bill to three-seat and four-seat constituencies.  The three-seat constituencies are those where the Government Party hope to secure two out of the three seats with 50 per cent of the votes.  The four-seat constituencies are those where they have no hope of obtaining that number of votes, where they hope with 38 per cent to obtain two out of four.  This is gross gerrymandering. <Col N="500" /> I am amazed that the Minister presenting this Bill should be the same Minister who held this House up for some 6½ hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Minister who had wasted 18 months of the time of Ministers who should have been engaged otherwise and had wasted the people's money on this fruitless exercise would not have been retained in office by any government or head of government in Europe or in any western democracy.  They would not retain any Minister who had been responsible for such waste of time as this Minister. Were it not for the innate good commonsense of the Irish people it would not be on record that it was the most fatal political blunder since this State was established to have embarked on that exercise.  Every argument advanced in the course of that long drawn out debate was blown sky-high by the democratic decision of the electors, who made good use of the polling booths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to one argument advanced at that time as it has a bearing on the discussion of this Bill, that is, the argument as to the advantage of the three- and four-member constituencies <i>vis-à-vis</i> five-seat constituencies.  The Minister spent hour after hour in this House and in the other House and indeed throughout the country where he worked prodigiously in his effort but it was the greatest waste of time, effort and money since the State was established.  The argument was made then that there would <Col N="501" /> be a proliferation of Parties if there were multi-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>There was recently a general election in Northern Ireland under the system which we were told would lead to a reduction in the number of Parties contesting seats and we have seen what happened there.  Despite the fact that they were reduced to as low as single-seat constituencies there was a proliferation of Parties to the point that the people must have been completely confused as to where they stood relative to the policies of the people whose names appeared on the ballot paper. The electorate were given no opportunity of exercising a preference other than for a single person under the various details presented to them on the ballot paper in the Northern Ireland election.  This completely wipes out the argument advanced that the larger the number of seats in a constituency the more likely it is that there will be a proliferation of Parties, in our case, in the Dáil.  That argument is thrown overboard by what has happened in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when he is replying to speak about the loss of contact between a Deputy and his electorate. In a constituency extending over a wide area, how he can correlate that with the present decision of his colleague, the Minister for Health, to rationalise the health services, I do not know.  His colleague has made a decision to abolish health, to remove it from the control of county councils and to create new authorities for vast regions comparable, practically, to a province or a vast area in relation to local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  There was a seminar on this subject as recently as last week and we are fully aware of what this entails.  I am bringing it up as a comparison between what is happening in one Department and what is happening in this Bill relative to another Department.  By increasing the number of three- or four-seat constituencies relative to the whole country, the Minister and the Government are attempting to divide the electorate who so recently gave their opinions in relation to the electoral system.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to the point made by Senator Nash regarding the unfairness of determining a constituency on the basis of population, that you have to take into account people who are resident in hospitals, in county homes, and so on, people who are temporary residents.  The Senator must know there is a qualifying date, that the 15th September every year is the date on which the authorities responsible for the compilation of the register are obliged to record for registration purposes those who are normally resident in an are at that time.  It is alleged that this is unfair to a certain extent.</P>
      <P>We tabled an amendment in this House to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill to overcome the weaknes which Senator Nash points out was in the 1937 Constitution.  That amendment was designed to substitute the electorate for the population as the basis of determining constituencies. The record shows voting against that proposal in the division Senator John Joseph Nash who has made the argument here in support of the point of view that we put forword in a reasoned amendment in the Seanad on 23rd July, 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were endeavouring, as was our obligation in Opposition, to improve the Bill that was put before us at that time.  We suggested this inclusion to overcome what <Col N="503" /> then existed and what has existed since the foundation of the State.  However, that was defeated by a majority of 23 votes to 13.</P>
      <P>One would not think that it would be logical on the part of anybody who voted against that amendment to complain now because the constituencies must be based on population rather than on the number of electors.</P>
      <P>Many Member of the House have appealed for the establishment of a non-Party commission to determine constituency boundaries.  I would ask Senator Ó Donnabháin to explain to me and to the House why it was considered suitable to have a commission to define the constituency boundries with relation to one type of constituency. This was a Government submission and it emerged from the constructive discussions that went on around the table when the all-Party committee met to consider electoral reforms but there is no doubt that any givernment, no matter which Party, that would be charged with the definition of constituency boundaries would be open to the allegation of gerrymandering. If, then, such a commission existed it would satisfy the people that not only was justice done but that it was seen to be done.  Far from justice being seen to be done, not only was injustice done but appears quite clearly to be done.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the loss of seats in the west of Ireland has been caused because of the rejection by the people of the tolerance provision of the proposed constitutional amendment. This, of course, is fallacious because there was never a reference to or an inclusion in the Referendum Bill of the tolerance being applicable to the west of Ireland.  The extention of tolerance would have meant that a better gerrymander could have been done in Cork city, in Dublin city or in any other part of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the people rejected that proposal because, perhaps, it was not indicated to them that it was anything other that what it was designed to be. I do not intend at this stage to go into detail regarding the type, shape or size <Col N="504" /> of constituencies as presented to us in the Bill.  We shall have another opportunity of going into more detail in that respect.</P>
    <P>In so far as the constituency where I am now obliged to register as an elector is concerned&mdash;South-West Cork&mdash;I do not regard this as an undesirable creation. It is almost as analogous to Cork as Chile is to the continent of south America.  At one time, it included Bandon and Kinsale.  Fianna Fáil have written off the good, solid and honest people of west Cork who have never given them more than one out of three seats and who never will give them more.</P>
    <P>Regarding the centre if the county, mid-Cork, they have taken one crooked leg which runs down to Bantry Bay to link up with Guilfoyle and they have put another leg into Rathluirc on the Limerick border to link up with the Golden Vale.  There was a time when Cork county was divided into four three-seat constituencies.  These constituencies were reasonably sized but for political reasons it was thought that by increasing their size, certain political gains could be obtained.  However, they did not materialise and that idea has been abandoned now.  The five-seater in North-East Cork, Fianna Fáil having failed to gain three seats out of the five, has now been reduced to a four-seater and the remainder of the county comprises three-seat constituencies, and the representation of Cork City, which was a five-seater, has been increased to six in two three-seat constituencies. This is a deliberate effort to make it difficult for the numerically smaller of the three political Parties in existence in Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you were wiped out in the referendum.  The Leader of the House has merely confirmed my views and the views of everybody in that respect.  That was a great waste of time, effort and money, the worst that the country has ever known and the greatest political blunder any Party ever made.  It was the <Col N="505" /> greatest misjudgment of public opinion, and the editorials were quite right in commenting that if a Minister or Government or Taoiseach is so remote from public opinion even in their own Party, how wrong are they and how remote are they from the feelings of the people in regard to the economic and other aspects of the national life as well?  That is a logical and reasonable argument.</P>
      <P>I would conclude by saying that there has not been even a sense of chivalry indicated by these proposals because the female sex represents the majority of the electorate and there is frequent complaints that there are not enough lady Members in Dáil Éireann. Lady Members on both sides seem to have come in for particularly unfavourable attention having regard to the effect on their constituencies of this measure.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill designed to abate the wishes expressed and recorded by the Irish people within very recent times. It is a measure which I feel will not have the desired effect although we are aware of the intention.  I do not think it will in any way minimise the recorded displeasure of the people with the Party in office.  I do not think that any manoeuvring or gerrymandering that is implicit in this Bill will effect the return of that Party to power.  I happened to be engaged in open debate.  I was very glad to have an opportunity, having failed in repeated efforts to get open forums where we could debate the system of elections with representatives of the Government Party.  But I did happen to obtain an opportunity, of an open forum on one occasion and on that occasion the Government representative opened for his side by saying that irrespective of the constituency revision unless the electoral system was changed his Party could not assume re-election.</P>

      <P>It was very apparent that very many people believed it.  At any rate I consider that this Bill is unjust inasmuch as it is a blatant effort to gerrymander.  Even looking at efforts made in the past this appears to be one of the worst.  There is no point in saying that there is an obligation on the Minister to bring in a measure precisely as he has done in consequence of the declared will of the people, because this is an effort to reduce the expressed desire of the people for the retention of PR as a fair and equitable system of election, and the reduction in the number of high-seat constituencies is designed to that effect.  Deputies are very well rewarded now and it makes it easier for them to employ secretarial assistance to cater for more constituents.  They would be all the better Deputies for having a wider area of representation and a wider section of our people to meet, and that reduction in the constituencies in the west particularly was an obvious effort to get away from what were certain embarrassments caused in the ranks of the Government Party and between Ministers when lines were drawn specifically to suit them.  We also note that since the Bill was presented in the Dáil backbench Deputies of the Government Party have had their influence in certain minor adjustments to suit their own needs. We do not hope in this House to have much effect in improving this measure, but we can avail of the responsibility imposed on us to expose what is in this measure and what it is intended to do though we feel confident that it will not succeed.</P>

      <P>The exposition of the last speaker has compelled me to spend ten minutes in discussion of this project.  I am never long-spoken or too loud-spoken, the only occasion being on an intervention possibly in a debate, but in this case I have been literally appalled to think that in a vocational body we have such slander and such a vicious attack on the Party who constitute the Government.  No wonder that <Col N="507" /> young people are being misled when they hear all the abuse of the Minister and the Government, who are accused of doing everything wrong for selfish purposes.  One word that distinctly antagonises me is this word gerrymandering. I have seen on television the Leader of Fine Gael who has pronounced in favour of the single-seat constituency and the single vote speak of gerrymandering.  Then the Government in their wish to satisfy the community generally in the referendum proposed specifically to put it to a judge of the High court to define the constituencies in collaboration with representatives of the Parties in the Dáil.  How could the Leader of the Fine Gael Party say on television that the object was to gerrymander when he himself is in favour of the single-seat constituency and has never denied that?  I spoke here when the Government brought in the Bill to give the community an opportunity of amending the system of election to Dáil Éireann, not Seanad Éireann, and I congratulated the Government on bringing in that Bill.  I spoke in favour of the Bill and pointed out that Fine Gael would never beat Fianna Fáil on proportional representation and what an opportunity they would have under the single-seat system.  I still maintain that they were very foolish in recommending the people to reject the referendum proposal.</P>

      <P>Then they come along clamouring about gerrymandering though it was provided to have a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court in collaboration with representatives of the Dáil to define the single-member constituencies. The result then was that in compliance with the decision of the court the Government and the Minister were faced with the obligation to amend the constituencies under the proportional representation system for the whole country, and of course the Minister is abused and this is called gerrymandering.  I hate this word.  It was false on the question of the referendum <Col N="508" /> and it is just as false today. There have been five-member constituencies in the country and nobody protested about gerrymandering. When the Government cut them down to four-seat constituencies the only thing that the Opposition could say on this question was to accuse them of gerrymandering though they were trying to accommodate public opinion on the question.  Gerrymandering should never have been referred to on the Referendum Bill when the recommendation was to have single-member seats, and yet you have the Leader of the Fine Gael Party saying that it was gerrymandering.  It just shows the level to which Members of the Opposition in this House and in the other House have descended when they come in here again in a vocational body and resist this with the argument about gerrymandering.  For the Leader of that Party to come back and say he objected to the gerrymandering content of this Bill just shows the extent to which Members of the Opposition in both Houses have descended.  I am a Member of this House as a vocational nominee.  Of necessity, we all have political opinions in Seanad Éireann but I object to any Opposition who will descend as low as Senator Quinlan in abusing the Government and the Minster for Local Government for doing everything wrong, when, in fact, all they have to do is look back at the Fine Gael Government and take heart.</P>

      <P>One thing which irritates people is talk about gerrymandering and changing of county boundaries.  I have considerable experience in the drawing up of electoral lists.  They are complied and published by the local authority.  When dividing counties such as Leitrim &mdash; which it has become necessary to do &mdash; I always anticipate difficulties in producing <Col N="509" /> a satisfactory register of electorate because there is no actual representative for County Leitrim.  The local authority has an obligation to compile and produce a register of electors.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to the difficulties he had in connection with the adoption of an amendment to have representation on the basis of electorate rather than population.  Population is known, whereas the electoral list &mdash; as anybody who has any experience of it knows&mdash;is inaccurate because it is complied from a census of people in residence on a particular night.  Subsequently, when an election comes along people who are registered as electors are not electors at all.  I would be against any system of electing representatives to the Houses of the Oireachtas based on the electoral list rather than on population, although it would be much easier to submit figures showing exactly what is what.  The result would be an administrative figure as to the representatives in the Oireachtas relative to the electoral list of various counties and various sections.</P>
      <P>County Leitrim is now in three sections. It is a very different constituency from that arrived at when compilation of the electoral list is an obligation of the county council who will have to divide townlands.  Leitrim would be asked to pay for producing such a register and, as the other county councils cannot compile a register for the three sections of County Leitrim, electoral lists in the future will be very difficult.</P>
      <P>I resent the accusation of gerrymandering and the suggestion that Fianna Fáil are an outrageous omnipotent Government who do nothing in the interests of the people.  The people who make those accusations now are the same people who sold out in 1921 in the Treaty and in 1925.  It is only a pity that the people did not accept the Government's Proposals last year.</P>

      <P>I can speak as one who has no aspirations towards election to the Dáil.  I, therefore, would like to think I could comment objectively at least, and without any bias, on what this Bill proposes to do.  It is fairly evident that the Bill is wide open to, and does, in fact, invite certainly criticism if not suspicion and even I find myself asking what precisely is the Bill designed to do?  I find this Bill is quite deliberately designed as an effort to undo some of the harm that was done to the Government image by the people's rejection of the last proposal to abolish PR.  As I say, this Bill is designed precisely to achieve some good from the result of that vote.  I will not repeat or attempt to go over some of the things which the other speakers have alluded to but I think enough has been said in this House to satisfy any fairminded person that the Bill is not an honest measure to give the people the pattern or system of election to which they obviously aspired when they went into the ballot boxes only a matter of a few months ago.</P>
      <P>I am particularly opposed to this Bill for those reasons.  I and the other members of the Labour Party in this House would be lacking in our duty if we did not place the objections which we found to parts of it on the record. We have heard the Bill described as an effort to gerrymander.  This is not, of course, the first time that the sitting Government of the day have endeavoured to ensure their continuance in existence as a Government by measures of this kind.</P>

      <P>That is a word which has been used here very frequently in the past.  I do not see any difference between this Bill and some of those Bills which have been an attempt at gerrymandering.  It is clear to my mind, at least, that the Government have not yet learned the full lesson from the <Col N="511" /> last referendum.  If it is their intention to come back to this House with measures of this kind I do not think it will serve either the Government or the country.</P>
      <P>It certainly will not do the country or the Government any good of the Government have to be told repeatedly, as we are obliged to tell them on this measure once again, that they are not playing the game.  They are not playing the game with the electorate.  They are not playing the game with any of the sections of political opinion in this country.  As I said, I do not wish to descend to any of the charges that could be regarded as perhaps in some sense unwarranted by some people, such as my friend Senator Ó Donnabháin, but I want to repeat that in the opinion of the Labour Party and in the opinion of every member of the Labour Party in this House, it is very evident that this is an attempt to put forward what was rejected by the people in the referendum. We believe it to be another effort so to arrange the constituencies that the Fianna Fáil Party and their hold on the people of this county will continue.</P>
      <P>It is for those reasons that we are obviously opposed to this Bill as we would likewise be opposed to any measure of a similar kind that they would introduce.  Therefore, I, in common with my colleagues in the Labour Party, intend to oppose the passage of this Bill through all Stages in this House.  We believe the Government would be doing a better job for the country if they went back and took serious and objective notice at least of what they were told in the ballot boxes in the recent referendum.  They have not done so and they have failed to do so in this Bill.  That is the reason why I and my fellow members of the Labour Party are opposed to it and will continue to be opposed to it.</P>

Understandably, we have not the same detailed interest in the size or the lines of constituencies as would Members of Dáil Éireann but still we are part of the Oireachtas.  We are one of the Houses in a parliamentary democracy. Our objection to the proposal to abolish PR was that whilst it would not necessarily result in a dictatorship it would be a step back from the type of parliamentary democracy we had managed to establish in this country and of which, I think, we could all be proud no matter from what Party we come.  I have always thought that as a new State emering from centuries of domination and occupation by a foreign power, we have shown the world how we could reasonably govern ourselves.  That was, perhaps, the biggest thing we had to teach ourselves and the British after we got the measure of freedom we have &mdash; at least, I should say, the previous generation, including myself, had got it.  What we had to prove was that we were capable of governing themselves.</P>
      <P>That may seem a very small thing but if we look at the experience of many newly emergent nations since we got our freedom we will realise it was no mean achievement itself.  It is something we have taken for granted but I have always thought it is something of which we as a nation can be proud.  We managed to do that after, as I say, centuries of occupation and after our people had been conditioned and persuaded, not all of them, but many of them, that we were incapable, because of some fault in our make-up, of governing ourselves.  We did this under the system of election known as proportional representation.</P>
