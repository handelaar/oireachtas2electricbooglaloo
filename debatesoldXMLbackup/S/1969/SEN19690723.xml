      <P>The position is, as Senators are aware, that the reconstruction business in relation to the <Col N="1245" /> electrical installation will be put in hands at the start of next week and that is one of the reasons for the adjournment of the Dáil.  The contractors require the whole house to do the job and to begin it on a comprehensive basis from the start.  Therefore, it is proposed to complete the business on the Order Paper and we expect to get from the Dáil two more Bills, the National Stud Bill and the Land Bonds Bill.  It is proposed to complete that business before we adjourn.</P>

    <Title>Grass Meal (Production) (Amendment) Bill, 1969: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the share capital of Min Fhéir (1959) Teo. from £200,000 to £350,000 to enable the company to carry out its functions including, in particular, the manufacture of grass meal.</P>
      <P>The Grass Meal (Production) (Amendment) Act, 1959, fixed the share capital of the company at £200,000 all of which has been issued. The figure £200,000 was based on a recommendation of the Committee on the Glenamory Grass Meal Project.  The committee estimated that the project would involve capital expenditure of £164,113 and recommended that £195,000 should be made available to the company, of which £165,000 would be for development purposes and £30,000 for working capital.  In the event, the actual expenditure on development work amounted to £191,000, that is, an excess expenditure of £27,000 approximately.  The excess expenditure was due to increased costs between 1957-58 when the estimates were prepared and 1962-63 when the works were carried out and to some unforeseen expenditure, for example, on staff housing, culverts, outfalls and fire-fighting equipment.  The increase of £27,000 on development works reduced the company's working capital to £9,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company commenced production in 1964 and output of grass meal rose from 914 tons in the first year of operation to 1,800 tons in 1968-69. The level which the committee considered <Col N="1246" /> necessary for economic operation, however, was 2,000 to 2,500 tons a year.  The reduced output was due to insufficiency of funds to meet the costs of full grassland development and the provision of adequate drying and storage facilities coupled with difficult marketing conditions in recent years.</P>
    <P>The company have tentative plans for expansion.  These include the extension of the existing drying and storage facilities and the development for productive purposes of a further area of land held by it.  It requires an immediate injection of £50,000, however, to restore its working capital position. It is proposed to continue production at an annual rate of 1,500 to 1,600 tons for the present but the company is engaged in a survey of the production and marketing situation with a view to a decision, as early as possible, to increase production to the economic level of 2,500 tons per annum. This survey will explore the feasibility of diversification from grass meal alone, for example, to grass cubes or grass biscuits suitable for inclusion in coarse dairy rations.</P>
    <P>The secondary purpose of the Bill is to enable the company to make short term borrowing.  Under existing legislation the company may, under certain conditions, borrow money by means of debentures.  The pattern of the industry is that stocks of grass meal build up during the production season (May to September) each year.  Sales are negligible until the autumn and reach their peak in the spring.  The company must have sufficient working capital to finance stocks at the highest point.  The normal commercial method of financing is by temporary bank borrowing.</P>
    <P>An injection of additional capital is vital to the survival of Min Fhéir Teoranta, which, in turn, is of paramount importance to the social and economic well-being of the Glenamoy area of County Mayo.  The direct staff employed by the company average 26 per year.  In addition, local small-holders find seasonal employment in the cultivation, cutting and transporting of grass to the drying plant.  Wages paid in the locality in recent years exceeded £13,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The company are co-operating with <Col N="1247" /> private producers in tackling the problems of the grass meal industry, particularly in the marketing field.  I am, however, fully conscious of the urgent necessity for the company to improve their performance and I intend to meet the board of directors of the company at an early date for the purpose of seeing how best this can be done.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the difficulty of attracting new industry to remote parts of the west.  It is imperative, therefore, to foster and develop the industry already there.  I, accordingly, recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in this Bill has put forward to us by way of explanation that this particular enterprise is one which is worthy of a further injection of capital.  In doing so he has not been able to give us anything like the detail which would be given to a private individual who was being asked to lend some of his money to such an enterprise.</P>
      <P>The situation we face in regard to this Bill exemplifies rather clearly the inadequacy of our present Parliamentary methods in regard to matters such as the grass meal enterprise which we are now discussing.  From time to time we hear talk about the reform of our Parliamentary institutions.  The fact, apparently very widely agreed upon, is that there is room within our institutions for a committee system.  Only in the last few days it was said in answer to a Dáil question that this matter was being kept under observation.  It is just as well that the question of bringing a committee system into the Oireachtas is kept in mind because it is in grave danger of dying of starvation: it is being continually talked about, but nothing is being done about it.  Matters such as the proposed investment which we have before us are things which could be dealt with far more efficiently and with far more satisfaction to all by some committee method.  The Minister in putting forward these proposals to us, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An injection of additional capital is vital to the survival of Min Fhéir Teoranta, which, in turn, is of paramount importance to the social and <Col N="1248" /> economic well-being of the Glenamoy area of County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Under the course we follow at the moment we have to take this on trust. It may be that an injection of additional capital is vital to its survival, but surely we should know more about this particular enterprise: surely we need to know something more before further capital is committed to it.</P>
    <P>We heard nothing from the Minister when he introduced this Bill about the attempts which have been made of perhaps have not been made in regard to the efficiency of this particular operation.  The Minister asked us in his speech recommending this Bill that we should grant the money and he will then talk to the directors of this company about the improving of their performance. One would hope that before asking for additional moneys in order to keep this company going that the Minister would already have been assured by the directors that definite steps had been taken in order to improve the performance of this undertaking.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised in Dáil Éireann about the particular quality of the produce of Min Fhéir Teoranta and specific questions were asked in regard to the protein content.  In regard to the question of market arrangements, on how many harvests a year are taken in this particular grass meal enterprise. These questions, as far as I know, remain unanswered in the Dáil and remain unanswered here.  In a case such as this, we should have had far more information.  The House is left in a very invidious position in regard to this.  I, like many Members in this House, am committed to public enterprise, rather in a pragmatic fashion, being without an ideological commitment to State enterprise or semi-State enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is always an onus on the Minister when he comes to us asking for support to prove that this is a case in which State enterprise, public enterprise, is necessary because of the failure of private enterprise.  It might well be that, under probing, it would be revealed that the whole grass meal industry of this country, both the sector represented by Min Fhéir Teoranta and that represented by the small number <Col N="1249" /> of producers, are all operating on a relatively small scale.  These are things which should be known before this money is voted.</P>
    <P>We have no information from the Minister as to the degree of contact between the grass meal enterprise in Glenamoy and the research station of An Foras Tionscal.  Are they constantly in touch with one another?  Is this particular enterprise able to call on the specialist services directly and in a special way of the people in the peatland experimental station at Glenamoy who know so much about the particular problems of the peatland areas? There is a great dearth of information in what the Minister has given us and this is an instance in which if this House and the whole Oireachtas had a committee system, a Bill of this kind could go to a committee where there could be a thorough discussion of all the various points that are omitted by custom from a brief such as that which the Minister has read today in recommending the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that this particular enterprise is of paramount importance in this particular area of North Mayo but we do no good to North Mayo or, for that matter, to any other part of the west of Ireland by continuing the enterprise under the guise of economic enterprise which may not be economic.  We shall have to distinguish clearly not only to the west but to the whole country what is economic enterprise and what is social support.</P>
    <P>We are too ready to throw in the social argument in an enterprise such as this and to say it may not be fully justified on economic grounds.  There is a case in regard to this particular enterprise, and it is one of many, that is that these things should be thoroughly probed.  It may well be that the information I am talking about is available; it may well be that information is available in regard to the question of the economics of the enterprise; it may well be that information is available as to the social effects of this enterprise and that detailed reports are available.  If they are available, they should be available to the Members of <Col N="1250" /> this House who are being asked to approve this money.  If they are not available, they should be made available before the Minister comes to the House.</P>
    <P>Enterprises of this nature are desirable and I am not questioning the desirability of this particular enterprise, but are we too ready to act and to grant the money to start the project when the information we have received is insufficient?  As I have said, if we had in our institutions a system whereby capital advances went before a committee of the Oireachtas, there would be sufficient probing at such a committee to ensure that it would be pointless for any Minister to come before such a committee without having these facts available.  All we have here is a plea from the Minister in which he says that he is prepared to trust this enterprise a little longer.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and through him, I appeal to his colleagues to consider seriously the question as to whether the manner in which he has approached the Oireachtas with regard to this particular project is the one which is most appropriate to the efficient running of Oireachtas Éireann; whether it is the most appropriate way to make the right decision about enterprises of this sort and whether it is the most appropriate for ensuring that in regard to the particular, the peculiar problems of the west of Ireland, that when we invest money in the west, which is so badly needed, we invest it to the absolute maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>This is my reaction to this Bill because we are being asked here on the basis of the Minister's trust in the directors of this company to go along with the Minister in this particular instance. We are prepared to go along, but reluctantly. If the Minister is prepared to express his confidence in this particular enterprise in the way he has indicated, I suggest that he should also be prepared to express his confidence in the Members of this House in so far as he should accept that we can be trusted with the facts of the situation and that we can be trusted to reach a proper conclusion if we are given the facts.  In this instance we have not been given <Col N="1251" /> the facts.  This is a pity and a disservice to Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which this Bill has been presented to the House today is indicative of the atmosphere in the House this afternoon&mdash;the atmosphere of a dying House.  However, I wish to support the previous speaker on the points he made.  Like him, I do not think the Government are being fair to the House, as they are not being fair to the people of Glenamoy and the west in general, in their approach to the Bill.  I do not suppose that anybody, least of all anybody from these benches, would wish either to curtail or to reduce the necessary amount of support that must be given to the west: not only is capital of this order required but capital of a much greater magnitude is required.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I believe that we have other responsibilities both to the people of the particular areas concerned and to the people in the rest of the country.  We are being asked in this Bill for an increase in the share capital from £200,000 to £350,000.  We are told very briefly that if this money is not provided, the future of the grass meal project in the west would be doomed to complete extinction.  I do not wish to see a Bill being brought in in this particular manner.  If we are to confine ourselves to the Minister's brief on this particular project, we must ask ourselves some serious questions. We are told for example, this is one aspect of it: we are told that the staff employed by this company averages 26 people per year.  In the same paragraph we are also told that the wages paid in the locality in recent years exceed £13,000 per annum.  Am I to take it that the £13,000 represents what was paid to the average number of 26 people employed?  I can hardly accept that.  If it is true, it seems to me that 26 people are there sharing £13,000 between them each year.  It can hardly be called a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You do not have to be a mathematician to know how much each person gets on average.  To my mind, that sort of proposition is not good enough. Neither House of the Oireachtas should be asked to pass a Bill in those terms. <Col N="1252" /> We seem to be meeting in an atmosphere of unreality, perhaps because of the particular time in which we live.  In the past few days the thoughts of most people in the country have been on the moon.  It seems to me that asking us to pass a Bill in these terms is asking people to accompany us on some sort of imaginary voyage of that nature.  I feel, therefore, that, like Joxer, we are entitled to ask what is happening in this country.  What is, in fact, the justification for the expenditure of something of this order on a project of this kind?</P>
    <P>It is clear to my mind that if no better case can be presented for the passing of this measure through this House than the brief of the Minister this afternoon there is something wrong.  Every Member of this House has a duty and a responsibility to ask what is wrong.  I can see no benefit whatever to the people of Glenamoy in this measure.  If they are getting no better return in terms of work than 26 people employed, getting between them £13,000 a year, the benefit is indeed very small.  Obviously, this is a case for examination by a representative committee of either this House or the other House, or of both Houses combined.  Measures of this order should not be presented in the manner in which this is presented to-day.  It is just not good enough.  It is an insult to Members of this House to ask them to pass a measure in these terms.  I do not propose to support it for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We passed the Grass Meal Project Bill ten years ago. At that time we had before us the results of a committee which held out high hopes for the success of the project. I am not worried about the increase in capital, which is the sort of thing which is natural, and the depreciation since the money was voted in 1959 would take account of that I am worried about the failure to reach the very modest target of approximately 2,500 tons of grass meal per annum.  I would much have preferred had this project come back looking for greater sums than are asked for here, with a much higher target If it is only a very small local industry <Col N="1253" /> of a type that should be capable of expansion, my question is why is it not expanding.  Why are our sights not being set higher for the next five years? At present agriculture is pressing ahead and gaining a bit.  The scientific side of it particularly is making great strides.  There is an obvious need for protein and grass meal is a good source of that and one which we have at home in our own country.  Why is it not being expanded further?</P>
      <P>I ask this next question in ignorance. Has there been co-operation between the Agricultural Institute, the research side of agriculture, and the grass meal factory?  Has the co-operation been sufficient?  Have the problems associated with making grass meal palatable as a stock food been solved in that period.  There seems to be something missing in public relations because the sale of grass meal is not progressing very well.  There seems to be a case for all parties interested in this project to come together.  I have no objection to voting the small increase asked for by the Minister at this juncture so that the small industry shall be kept going.  We have no other objection at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister setting up a committee to examine the progress of the industry.  If we cannot very substantially increase the target over the next five year period, I cannot see much hope for the industry as such.  I hope for a target increase of tenfold.  It is only by committee action and by careful study that we can arrive at that target.  The present measure is, perhaps, a panic measure. There is urgent need for extra capital. The situation has to be dealt with and is too urgent to await inquiry.  This amount will only keep the industry alive.  We want it to expand.  Now when we are at the beginning of a new period of Government and at the beginning of the Third Programme, I should like to see the Minister taking the initiative in getting many subjects like this back to committees.  I should like to see the Minister using the new Seanad in that capacity.  The Minister would get great co-operation from all concerned.  It is impossible to make a snap judgment on the figures as they have been presented to us and as they <Col N="1254" /> are seemingly available to the Minister at this juncture.  They do not answer our question as to when we can make an industry contribute in a worthwhile manner to the development of that region.</P>
    <P>We want to know about the board of Min Fhéir Teoranta.  Are they sufficiently representative and do they command the confidence of the interests involved?  Are the organised farmers and the research-minded agriculturalists represented on this board?  I do not know myself.  I have not the personnel of the board before me.  I presume the board will be due for renewal shortly.  I should like the Minister to take this opportunity to see that we get a more aggressive board.  The record is anything but a success story.</P>
    <P>With these few comments, I am quite agreeable to support the measure, as it is purely an interim step, in the hope that the Minister will be back for a greatly increased sum as a result of a re-examination, and that our target figure will be increased at least tenfold if this industry is one which will make a contribution to our economic progress in the 1970's.</P>
    <P>Also, indeed, I could not see such an industry surviving in the free trade competition which we must face in the next decade.  It could hardly survive based on the small standard of production it has got.  It would need to link perhaps even out of that part of North Mayo where it may not be possible to get an adequate supply of grass for conversion, and it may need to link into many other areas.  If we are to have a grass meal project it should now be moving into the national level and should have figures commensurate with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who was associated with this project in its very early stages and up to the time that I was a candidate for the Seanad, I should like to give a reasonable, fair and honest picture to the House.  I want you to consider an area in North Mayo where nine-tenths of all that you can see, standing at the highest point of the highest hill in the area, is blanket bog, where there is not an industry of any type or shape, where <Col N="1255" /> the people are depending on the dole and the money they can earn by migration and emigration.  You are asked here today more or less to compare that area with an area where grass can be produced naturally without any development whatsoever, where the land on which it is produced is eminently suitable for tillage, market gardening, beef production or vegetable production.</P>
      <P>Now let me say that in the beginning when the original Min Fhéir Teoranta were set up, the board sought and got every single bit of help and co-operation from all those people in this country and outside it who were engaged on the effort of reclamation of blanket bog area or fen country.  We had a pilot scheme in operation at Gowla under General Costello and we had the big development carried on during the last war in the fen country in England where efforts were made to reclaim part of the fen country for the purpose of producing grass meal and protein.  Both of these schemes were examined.  The personnel in charge of these schemes gave the utmost help and co-operation.</P>
      <P>We first acquired 2,000 acres of bog land at Glenamoy.  Approximately 680 acres of that was grass land on the side of a hill and was reasonably dry and capable of being drained immediately, but 1,400 to 1,500 acres was low level, flat blanket bog which was entirely unsuitable for any use.  It was not required for turf production, it was completely unsuitable for mountain grazing.  Cattle could not walk on the place.  Sheep could, with difficulty, but did not try because it was absolutely water-logged.  We started into a scheme of development of 680 acres, and that was drained in fields 100 feet wide.  We found that those drains at 100 feet centre to centre were not capable of draining all the bog in between, so eventually we had to divide our fields into 50 feet wide fields.  Drainage had to be carried out in a three year period to be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first year you could just break the bog grass and get down into the moving peat which was underneath. If you went too deep the whole <Col N="1256" /> thing caved in on you.  After the second year you could go down a certain depth lower, and in the third year we succeeded in putting in drains about 3½ feet deep.  Then that particular 680 acres was solid enough to bear some of those tracked machines for the purpose of rotovating and we did seed down some of that in the third year. I am not surprised now that there is a certain amount of opposition to the original or to this scheme and to the proposal before us, because when we had reached that stage and 680 acres was actually ready for cultivation and some had been seeded down, the board were closed down by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>During that time men were employed entirely during the summer period as long as it was possible to work, and as many men as were required were employed during the winter period in the maintenance of the drains.  That was the first time in the history of the Barony of Erris where a number of men had a pay packet even for eight months of spring, summer and autumn during which they could be permanently employed.  It was the first time in the history of Erris, and this scheme was closed down and subsequently, I may say, it was the first choice after a most intensive investigation of that area of the country.  Then when that was closed down it was handed over to the Peatland Development Company, and the man who was put in charge of the Peatland Development Company was our second officer.</P>
    <P>I may say that we advertised for a manager and an assistant manager.  We held interviews and, let it be mentioned here to our credit, that the manager who was first selected for this particular scheme in Glenamoy was Mr. Con Murphy, who has since left for the Sugar Company and is now one of the outstanding men in connection with the development of youth employment in this country.  Second to him was Mr. P.J. O'Hare who was left in charge of the Peatland Development Scheme and is still in charge.  Both these men up to today have absolutely the keenest possible interest in the grass meal project as it is now being carried out at Geesalia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> So much for the beginning of the scheme.  When we tried to go on to a new scheme in fact the second area was more water-logged and more difficult than the first in so far as we did not have 680 acres of reasonably high ground which was reasonably well-drained in advance.  I can assure Members of the House that I tramped through those bogs on Sundays with my colleagues in wellingtons, and without wellingtons you would not be able to go 100 yards in any direction on that 2,500 acres which they acquired for the second scheme at Geesalia. Eventually drainage work had to be carried out as in the original scheme, and indeed we found the area was so difficult that we had to put in solid roads in order to try to bring out the grass to the mill when it was ready for cutting.  That was an expenditure which was not foreseen and which greatly added to the cost in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House some figures, because it is left without a lot of information, and I can vouch for these figures for I have got them from the chairman of the board.  In 1964 in Geesalia, 900 tons, 17 cwts of grass meal was produced at a cost of £27 15s. The weekly rate of wages for a labourer at that time was £8 10s. Drivers of tractavators were getting £9 1s 10½d; chargehands had £9 1s 10½d and a foreman had £10 15s.  In 1965, 1,356 tons were produced; in 1966, a difficult year, the production was 1,071 tons; in 1967 the production was 1,503 tons; and in 1968 the total amount produced was 1,805 tons.  The cost of producing 1,805 tons in 1968 was £27 11s 1d as compared with the first year figure of £27 15s.  In the meantime the labourer's rate of wages had increased from £8 10s to £10 10s, the driver's rate of wages had increased to £12 9s 2d, the chargehand's rate of wages had increased to £12 2s 6d and the foreman's rate of pay had increased to £13 12s 6d.  The price of sacks went up from £34 2s 10d per thousand to £40 10s 4d; phosphate and potash increased in price from £10 15s to £18 1s 8d; nitrogen increased in price from £16 17s 6d to £23 10s.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when Senators take into <Col N="1258" /> account the extra cost of wages, of fuel, of sacks, of manuring, quite a reasonable job of work was done and reasonable returns were shown, because between 1964 and 1968 the amount produced went up from 900 tons to 1,800 tons and the cost dropped from £27 15s 5d to £26 11s 1d.  During the summer period there are only 31 people employed.  During the winter, because of lack of capital, of money of any kind for expansion or further development, the number employed, on maintenance alone, is 12.</P>
    <P>Some comparison has been made, or some fault has been found with the protein content, with the quality of the grass meal produced in Geesalia and Glenamoy.  As in any other area, it varies according to the amount of manuring, particularly in proportion to the amount of nitrogen used in the manuring.  The Grass Meal Board have produced grass meal with a protein content as high as 21 per cent, and 21 per cent to 16 per cent is regarded as high.  Fourteen per cent to 16 per cent is standard and below 14 per cent is sub-standard.  We are asked to compare the protein content of grass meal produced in Glenamoy and we are apt to forget that we are operating entirely on a bleak, exposed area on the sea coast subject to all the storms and excess rainfall coming in from the Atlantic, on ground on which it was not found possible to get even a sheep to walk; we are asked to compare that with production from land in County Louth which is entirely suitable for any form of agricultural produce&mdash; beef, milk, market gardening.  I wish Senators would keep those two things in mind and that they would keep them apart&mdash;that they would give this scheme at least a fair crack of the whip: that they would take into account something which they decry here, the social aspect of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Particularly they should keep in mind the fact that men can look out for the first time in their lives, for the first time in the history of the area, on 2,000 acres of green, not on blanket bog, not on barren mountains, not on an area completely denuded of any form of growth except heather.  If this scheme failed now, at least the developed <Col N="1259" /> grass land will remain.  I hope Senators will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>The only interest I have in this scheme is the interest any person would have who was associated with it from the beginning&mdash;the interest of a person who has seen the outlook of these people changed, who has worked among them.  Let this thing be criticised as much as you like, but let it be fair, just, honest and above board criticism. Let Senators kindly bear in mind the circumstances in which the Grass Meal Board are trying to operate the scheme and do not compare it with another area where anything in the world can be grown at the cheapest possible cost.</P>
    <P>It has been said we have not given any information as to the number of crops produced in a year.  That has varied considerably because at one stage we were producing crops of grass which was growing to such an extent that we were not able to put it all through our mill because the capacity of our drying plant was not sufficient to enable us to use all the grass that came in in a good season, and the grass was allowed to ripen, it was cut and sold as meadow to local people. In different circumstances, in a bad year, the output and the number of crops varied.  This is not a peculiarity of grass meal production.  Bord na Móna found when they carried out their first experiments in milled peat production at Rathmogan in the vicinity of Bangor Erris that they got six crops of milled peat in the first year. I doubt if they are averaging three crops now in good years.  That happens in relation to any other crop in any other area.</P>
    <P>There has been the greatest possible co-operation between the development people and the people at Gowla. General Costello gave every possible help and co-operation at the beginning.  He gave men for the commencement of the scheme, he gave prototype machines, he gave every possible help and I wish to pay him a tribute for having done that.  On every side, people who came to see the scheme in Glenamoy were anxious and willing to give every help and co-operation.  Indeed, I must <Col N="1260" /> say as far as the officers appointed by the Grass Meal Board are concerned, they did not work for wages: they worked as a challenge, they worked to improve the lot of the less well-off in the worst and most barren part of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley does not think the Government are being fair to the House in the presentation of this proposal with regard to the increase of the share capital from £200,000 to £350,000.  He then went on to criticise the number of men employed.  As I stated at the beginning, it took at least three years, in good circumstances in the better areas of comparative drainage before any seeding could be done. In the worst areas it takes four years, so you can see the development depends entirely on having sufficient money available in order to look forward, not from year to year but for three to four years ahead.  The wages are mentioned as being £13,000. The number employed, as I already stated, is 31 during the summer months and 12 during the winter months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the number it takes.  There is no capital available for further expansion.  I am happy to see Senator Quinlan is not concerned about this application for increased capital but he is disappointed we have not reached an annual target figure of 2,500 tons at least.  I explained the reason for that is that you are tied into a certain estate which was made available in 1959 and not increased since and you were tied to an area of ground which was purchased and badly developed as far back as 1959. We do not have any money for the purpose of further expansion, acquisition of land and drainage in order to expand.  However, the market for grass meal is limited.  There is absolutely no market at the present time.  If we increase our output tenfold, as Senator Quinlan hopes, we would not have a market for it.  We have to sell in competition with people who are producing under the most favourable circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project is being hit by the fact that synthetic materials are being <Col N="1261" /> produced possibly at a lower price. Even against all those things I am not asking for any charity or any handout for the people in this particular area. They are working hard for what they get, they are working hard to make a living and they see some prospects before them.  They see the prospect of employment for themselves and their children if this scheme is developed within the economic limit of a market being available.  Those people can look out onto a green field.  That, mind you, must be refreshing to people who have been reared in such a desolate, backward area.  Above and beyond that they have pride in carrying home in their pockets money which they worked for and earned rather than money which was handed out to them in the Dole Office.</P>
    <P>There is the difference.  There is one particular aspect of this scheme which I would ask you to consider in addition to the economic aspect, which is important in any State scheme of development.  I would ask you to consider the social aspect to those people which is very important and I would ask you, not to do anything which would prejudice further development or an improvement in the social aspects and the social outlook of those people in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have a slight experience of this as I visited the Foras Talúntais installation at Glenamoy and I was amazed at the time to see the possible development there.  I would not like to go into detail because I would not be able to do justice to them. However, when I visited this installation I spoke to a man attached to An Foras Talúntais.  I know that An Foras Talúntais have nothing to do with the work there only to help and assist by explanation and demonstration.  What I saw there was explanatory and demonstrative of the possibility of growing grass where there was only heather before.  By the system of <Col N="1262" /> artificial manuring I was amazed to see the production of grass on the land attached to the Foras Talúntais installation.</P>
      <P>This is a small industry and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government are interested in small industries.  In this connection I should like to mention to the Seanad that there is great potential in this industry at Glenamoy.  I asked the man who spoke to me if the rest of the citizens who live on the land nearby could benefit from this.  He told me that the expense was the difficulty.  The expense of providing the facilities for growing this grass is tremendous.  If more money could be provided please God this would develop very much in the future.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention also that I was glad to see that the Forestry Department were establishing forestry belts in this area.  I should like to say, as a Member of the Seanad, that we should not be so critical of the Minister and the Government for not giving us those particulars because if the particulars given by Senator Flanagan here today were given to a committee some members of the committee might get fed up although some of them would be interested.  However, it is good that we have got this information and I think the Seanad would be wise in passing this Bill now and being satisfied with the recommendations of a Government who are prepared to look after this small industry and to help the people in this barren area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, of course, that our difficulty with regard to the efficient running of Oireachtas Éireann has been mentioned repeatedly before, that is this thing of getting Bills at the end of a Parliamentary session of the Dáil and the Seanad then, having been here to discuss them, all we could do was to talk about them.  We could not recommend any alteration to the Government because of the fact the Dáil would be adjourned and that it would cost so much money to assemble the Dáil again if the Seanad did anything more practical than talking.  That is the only thing we can do.  We can not do anything negative.  The best thing we can do is to talk about this, pass a Bill and let this work continue. <Col N="1263" /> This is one of the difficulties between the Dáil and the Seanad.  I appreciate we have had discussions on it before but it is very difficult to have collaborations between the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to say that I support this proposal and the fact that the Minister needs extra capital for the reasons which he has mentioned.  It is only right to say that this project was embarked on in rather difficult circumstances.  It was a project which the experts said would not be justified by the results.  We now have a situation where this project is being operated at a loss.  There are many grass meal concerns operating at a profit because they were established on a proper basis in conditions which enabled them to make a profit.</P>
      <P>But it was pointed out that from the very beginning this project was a pretty hopeless one.  It was said to be as impossible as trying to grow grass on the moon to try to grow grass in an area such as the one which was chosen, in spite of all the drainage work, the technical skill and the agricultural science that was made available in an effort to make the project a success.  I know it has been a success in so far as it has enabled students of the fluke to deal with that particular plague. They have been able to make comparisons and to carry out experiments in relation to this particular project so far as fluke is concerned.  I am sure that was a valuable contribution to science, but on the question of producing grass meal, those who said before it was established that there was no prospect of its being a viable enterprise have been proved correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, this project is being operated at a loss of approximately £12 per ton, calculated on the output.  There is also a very big capital investment involved.  However, there is one point which I should like the Minister to deal with in his reply in regard to the sale of grass meal at a cheaper price than the grass meal being manufactured by viable concerns. Naturally enough, with the aid of State capital and a loss of £12 per ton, it is only reasonable to say that there <Col N="1264" /> appears to be unfair competition between this State-supported project and the enterprising grass meal manufacturers who are able to produce a high-class product and who are compelled in the commercial world to sell this grass meal at a price which will give them an operating profit and keep them in business because they have not the taxpayers' money and State finance to keep their businesses going, to keep their gear maintained and to replace all the other equipment that is necessary in connection with the production of grass meal.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know from the Minister when he is replying whether when this increased capital is made available and is put to work for the purpose of improving the effort if there is any prospect even then that a better quality grass meal will be put on the market and whether there is any hope that it will be operated at a smaller loss than at present, or are we financing something which is going to keep operating at a loss?</P>
    <P>There are approximately 25 to 30 people employed on this losing project and, of course, they and their families are getting a week's wages in return for their labour.  They are entitled to that, but is there any prospect for these people to be employed in a business which they know is successful, profitable and achieving something rather than being supported at the expense of the community.  One Senator did mention that it was better to have these men working at this project, earning a week's wages and coming home to their families after a satisfactory week's work with his wage packet instead of going to the Labour Exchange to collect their dole and then returning home.  I agree with the Senator on that. I think it is most important that people should be given the opportunity to work where this can be done, but I think it is soul-destroying for people engaged in various projects to be told that in spite of their best work, their best efforts and all the organisation involved, it is a losing effort.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether this extra capital will change the kind of results that we have been getting from this project.  If not, could we have a change of policy in relation to the <Col N="1265" /> growing of grass meal to some other kind of grass growing operation, even if it is for the purpose of growing grass for laboratories where scientific experiments can be carried out in relation either to the growing of grass or to the feeding value of grass from this type of soil in comparison with any other types of soil in other localities?</P>
    <P>If this concern is to continue in operation as a grass meal project operating all the time on a losing basis, at some time or other we must make up our minds to face the fact and to change the activity there and to see whether at this particular station we can carry out some other kind of work in relation, if you like, to the growing of grass.  Apparently that was why the thing was started in the first place.  As I say, the experts said that grass could not be grown there compared with other soils in different parts of the country which are more suitable for the growing of grass.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say in relation to this matter.  It was established contrary to the advice of the best experts at that time when they were told the purpose for which the project was being established and what it was hoped to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dooge in dealing with this Bill went into some detail about the advantages of a committee system.  I do not propose to follow him on that.  As he said himself an answer has been given by the Taoiseach in the Dáil during the past few days which indicated the matter is being further considered.  There is no doubt that the committee system will have many advantages but it could also have disadvantages.  However, in the circumstances in which it is being further considered, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me at this stage on this Bill to discuss that matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Dooge and Crowley did less than justice to the Members of this House in suggesting that the only information available to them was in my speech introducing this Stage of the Bill.  The Senators are, of course, aware of the fact that the reports from the company&mdash;not up-to-date reports, I admit, but nevertheless a number of them have been appearing year after <Col N="1266" /> year and are available to the Members of this House.  I am sure that anybody who was interested enough in this project will have referred to them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in so far as Parliamentary efficiency is concerned, it does not appear to me that it would make for more efficiency to have a Minister come in here and spend a great deal of time giving the House a lot of detail which the House may not want to hear.  I have considerable details of the operation of this company available to me but I do not wish to inflict on the House a recital of the facts and figures which the House might not require.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the procedure that is followed at present without any committee system allows that any Senator during the course of his speech may indicate information which he would like to have and if the information is available to me I can give it when concluding the debate on this Stage before the Senator has made up his mind as to the attitude he will adopt when the question is put to the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to some queries raised in Dáil Éireann and he pointed out that I did not reply to them when bringing this matter before the House.  This is perfectly true.  However, I intend to reply to them now.  I did indicate in the other House that if this information were required when the Bill came before this House, I would produce it or failing that, the Deputy who raised the queries could get the information directly from me.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, before I go into this matter I should like to point out that there are quite a number of commercial rivals of Min Fhéir Teoranta who could be said to have a vested interest in seeing that Min Fhéir Teoranta did not compete unduly with them.  I have no doubt that there are some commercial rivals who would be very happy if Min Fhéir Teoranta were wound up.  Some of the criticisms that have been made in regard to this company, particularly in the other House, were clearly based on allegations made to Deputies by commercial rivals of Min Fhéir Teoranta and in that respect they must be viewed in the light of the source from which they came.</P>
    <P>One of the matters raised was the question of the percentage of protein <Col N="1267" /> content in the grass meal produced by Min Fhéir Teoranta.  The Deputy concerned said that if there is less than 16 per cent protein&mdash;the company's grass meal is of little value and does not come up to the standard of quality required by most consumers.  The same Deputy also asked how often the grass is harvested, if it is harvested once, twice, three times, four times or five times a year.  The position in this regard is that the Department of Agriculture lay down standards required in regard to protein content in grass meal and these specify that for high grade grass meal a minimum of 16 per cent protein is required and for grade 2 or standard grade, as Senator Flanagan referred to it, the minimum protein content required is 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Min Fhéir Teoranta produce both grades and what they produce is subject to inspection by the Department of Agriculture.  Their plant is visited regularly by inspectors of that Department and random samples are taken for testing.  In addition to that samples are taken from various customers of the company throughout the country and they are similarly tested.  Some of the company's customers are manufacturers of feedingstuffs and they have the Min Fhéir and other grass meal manufacturers' products analysed independently of official samples.  In so far as the Department of Agriculture are concerned, the grass meal produced by Min Fhéir Teoranta complies fully with the standards that have been laid down by the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the query about the frequency of harvesting the grass this depends as, indeed, it depends anywhere else, on weather conditions. Favourable weather conditions may permit of five cuttings in a season while adverse conditions may allow of only three cuttings.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made in the other House and here again by Senator Rooney that Min Fhéir sell their products at a very low price thereby undercutting the commercial producers, the private sector producers, and that they do so simply because they have State money behind them.  It is my information that it is the normal practice of all grass meal manufacturers <Col N="1268" /> to dispose of unsold stocks at the end of the season at the best price they can obtain and that all manufacturers cooperate with one another in this task. Consequently, according to the information available to me, it would not be correct to suggest that Min Fhéir Teoranta are using their position of having State money behind them to undercut their competitors.  In fact, all the producers whether in the private or public sector follow the same practices at the end of the season.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether there is any co-operation between Min Fhéir Teoranta and the Peatland Research Station is also raised.  Senator Flanagan dealt with that from personal knowledge and I wish to confirm from the information available to me that there is the greatest possible liaison between Min Fhéir Teoranta and the Peatland Research Station.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge suggested that it seemed a little strange to him that I should come here and talk about meeting the board and about plans for future development to be worked out that I should do this before I get the money from the Oireachtas.  I am making this comment also in the context of the allegation of lack of information.</P>
    <P>The position is that in introducing this stage of the Bill I gave considerable detail about the original capital proposed by the company, how it was expended and the effect of the excess expenditure on capital requirements, meaning that the working capital available was very substantially cut down. It does not seem to have done any good.  Some Senators have heard it but have ignored it.  It must be clear enough that the directors were not in a position to do any great development work or to improve the performance of the company very much when they did not have working capital available to them.  Within the limit of what they had available, they have done a first-class job in improving the performance of the company.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that I am satisfied that this company, viewed as a commercial proposition, have had a satisfactory performance.  I do not think they have.  Viewed solely from the point of view of a commercial proposition, it is unrealistic to assess this without <Col N="1269" /> having regard to the working capital available to the company.  If we want to view it on a purely commercial basis, we must apply normal commercial criteria to it which includes an assessment of what was available to the company by way of ordinary and working capital.  On this basis this company did not have enough working capital available to them.  This is one of the things which we hope to cure as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the market in this field has not been as buoyant in the last few years as it was previously.  There are a number of reasons for this.  There are conflicting views as to whether this situation is likely to continue.  It seems clear enough that there is considerable scope for improvement in this company, firstly, in the sales methods and organisation.  They have been weak in this regard.  There is also room for improvement in regard to their products. I have indicated that it is intended to examine the possibility of diversifying into certain aspects of grass production for animal feed and not have it just as plain grass meal. We must consider grass cubes and grass biscuits.  This requires further examination. It seems to me in a situation where the market is doubtful that the right commercial approach is to examine the possibilities of diversification in the product, and diversification into markets which are more attractive and more secure than the existing market. As I have indicated to the House, this is being done.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of operation which could be improved.  Within the limits imposed on the company heretofore, their performance has not been bad but there is room for improvement. I believe that by the injection of the capital proposed here it will be possible for the company to improve their commercial performance.  I have also indicated that I intend to meet the board of the company at an early date in order to ensure, as far as I can, that the lines which I desire, and which I believe both Houses of the Oireachtas desire, will be followed by the company in the future.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that I am guaranteeing to this House that this company will be commercially viable in five <Col N="1270" /> years time.  The information available to me suggests that they will, but I am not in a position to give a cast-iron guarantee to the House that this will be so.  In these circumstances, it is natural enough that Senators should ask themselves the question which I had to ask myself when this problem was brought to me.  I asked myself whether we are prepared to close down this project in the light of the information available to us about past performance and future prospects and in the light of the effects, social and economic, on this very remote area of North Mayo in respect of which a much more adequate picture than I could paint has been painted by Senator Flanagan.</P>
    <P>It seems to me if the prospects of this company of being viable were nil one would have a clear-cut issue in which to make a decision.  If that was the position many Members of the Oireachtas would still decide that it should not be closed down.  But that is not the position.  The position is that the prospects of viability, in my view, are better than 50-50.  This, in conjunction with the very important social and economic aspects of the matter in that area of the country, all add up to a very compelling case for this injection of capital.  This was the conclusion to which I came on examining this matter.  This was the conclusion to which the Government came when it was submitted to it.  This will I hope be the conclusion to which this House will come having considered the matter now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, in the absence of the committee system it is necessary for me to carry further the discussion on some points of section 1 which is a section empowering additional capital.  I am greateful to the <Col N="1271" /> Minister for the information which he has given in his reply.  I must express mild regret that the information was not included in the Minister's original statement, and that the information which he gave to us was only given in reply after the specific points were raised.  There are a few other points which I would like to raise.</P>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to say that it was mentioned by Senator Flanagan, that, the &ldquo;social aspect of this was being decried&rdquo;.  I would like to make it perfectly clear what the issue was which I raised with regard to the social aspect.  It was not an attempt to decry the social aspect.  It was an appeal to distinction.  It was an appeal, not that we should disregard the social aspects of such matters, but, that we should not disguise them.  It was an appeal that we should face clearly and distinguish clearly between the economic and social costs.</P>
      <P>This is the only realistic thing which can be done.  The Minister has given us a statement that there is a 50-50 chance of this being economically viable and on this basis there is no doubt whatsoever, given the circumstances of the Bangor Erris area, that the particular enterprise is one which should be continued.  I would like to say that I myself am satisfied that this particular enterprise is fulfilling a valuable social function.  I had occasion to visit the Bangor Erris area on a number of occasions in connection with certain investigations and indeed it is quite clear that the work which is being done in that area, the whole work done by the Peatland Research Station there, is of the utmost value both economically and socially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the form of co-operation at the moment between the board of Min Fhéir Teoranta and An Foras Talúntais. Senator Flanagan has told us that there was a position after the closing down of Min Fhéir Teoranta that many of the leading staff and employees were employed in the work of the Glenamoy Research Station, but quite apart from the initial development I should like to ask the Minister specifically what is the form of co-operation now.  Is it a continuous one?  Is it <Col N="1272" /> merely continual or is it occasional?</P>
    <P>Another point on which I should like to ask the Minister is that the Minister said that an allegation has been made that there is a tendency on the part of Min Fhéir Teoranta to dump on the market, and he has stated that it only does what its other competitors are doing, namely unloading its stocks at the end of the year.  Is the Minister satisfied that Min Fhéir Teoranta do not start to unload their stocks earlier than anybody else?  We must of course have regard to the social aspects of the problems of North Mayo and the Bangor Erris area, but also we must have regard to the whole problem of people who invest their own money in enterprises, and it would be very wrong if we took lightly the question that because of the social benefits in North Mayo people in the other parts of the country should not be protected against what in effect would be the dumping of a product.  I should like to ask the Minister is he completely satisfied on that point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, in regard to the co-operation by the company, the exact details of how this is done and whether it is sufficiently close and satisfactory is one of the matters which I intend to discuss with the board, but I have been assured firstly that the company maintain very close liaison with the Peatland Research Station, and also that the technical personnel of the Department of Agriculture keep in close touch with the company and, as I have mentioned earlier, take samples for the purpose of testing the product; but they do much more than that, I understand, in the way of discussion of the technical aspects of the operations of the company.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I omitted to mention when talking about the value of the operations of this company the expertise which is being accumulated and which in a country with the amount of bogland that we have must be of considerable importance to us in the long term, and not just in the North Mayo area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with dumping, or alleged dumping, I am told that the company deny absolutely that they dumped grass meal on the market in <Col N="1273" /> 1967, as was alleged at one time, or in any other year.  It is true that they have occasionally sold substandard meal, as fillers, at less than the market price of good quality meal, but the quantities which they sold were very small indeed and, as I have indicated, all the other producers follow exactly the same course.  As evidence that the company are not recklessly dumping their product on the market irrespective of the price is the fact that in most years&mdash; I am speaking now offhand, from recollection&mdash;they have a carry-over of stock, which seems to indicate they they are not just recklessly dumping it at any price they can get.  Consequently, I think that anybody who wishes to establish that this company have been dumping grass meal has an onus placed on him to give details and also to establish that they are not doing simply what everybody else is doing.  I am not saying that this onus rests on Senator Dooge, because he is not making the allegation.  He is merely putting the question.  It is on those who make this allegation outside the House that this obligation lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I carry this a little bit further?  We are at a disadvantage, as the Minister will appreciate, in that there has not been a report since 1967 and many of these reports are not very informative.  Senator Flanagan mentioned, I think, a price of £26 for the year 1968.  An allegation has been made, and I am not making it, but just asking the Minister if he can deal with the matter, that meal which I presume was standard was sold at £21.  Is the Minister satisfied that this is incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the figures that I have been supplied with by the managing director, that is not the case.  The figures I have are: 1968, net sale price, 26-Counties, £26 11s 1d; net sale price Northern Ireland £26 5s 3d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <P>I have available to me the average selling price per ton for each of the years ending 31st March, 1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968.  If I give those they might be of assistance to the Senator.  In the year 1965 it was £27 14s 10d; in 1966 it was £28 9s 8d; in 1967 it was £24 18s 11d and in 1968 £26 18s 2d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Keating in the Dáil who mentioned that the company had been selling a product which they found hard to shift at prices of the order of £21. The point is, is the Minister satisfied that that would be unusually shortlived if the figures the Minister has given are correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had assurances on this and I am also satisfied if for no other reason than that the average selling price which I have given would not exist if this were a regular practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the Minister made some remarks that I want to take up with him.  He mentioned that the granting of capital here was most important in view of the large amount of used up bogland that may become available in this country.  The Minister mentioned that there was a 50-50 chance of success here of the company making it a viable product. Would he say that there was a 60-40 chance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Senator but I think Senator Dooge quoted me and I did not bother to correct him but as Senator Rooney is going into this now I want to say that the actual words I used were &ldquo;A better than 50-50 chance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Commercial enterprises have to be over 100 per cent. The other thing I want to mention is this.  The Minister mentioned the possibility of introducing this grass growing in other boglands in the country.  I suppose there is approximately one <Col N="1275" /> million acres of Irish land as far as using up bogs is concerned.  If we are going to contribute so heavily from the social point of view to this small acreage here it is hard to imagine how this small Irish population could make such a substantial contribution towards growing grass or using up the bog land all over the country when even this small acreage here is causing so much concern and has demonstrated up to the present at any rate that it is not a viable project and that there is no prospect that even this little scheme will make ends meet.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister was asked in the Dáil to answer a number of technical questions and he declined to do so.  I suppose that is fair enough.  However, there is one question I would like to ask him and he may have the information available now.  It has been mentioned that there are approximately 26 persons employed.  I wonder are they all generals and no privates?  Have we a good percentage of manual labour here or is it mainly highly paid technicians and very few manual workers? I mention that because when we are talking about the social value of this project and the matter of paying a week's wages to those engaged in this industry or having those people walking up to the labour exchange for unemployment assistance I would like to know out of this 26 people how many of those, who would otherwise line up at the labour exchange, would be highly technical and highly paid people whose services could be made available in other places where their technical skill and knowledge would be of benefit in whatever project they were associated with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might take the last point raised by Senator Rooney first. He said I declined to answer certain technical questions in the Dáil, which was true, because I did not at that time have the information available to me.  I have in this House answered those questions I was asked in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the number of manual workers involved in this I have not got the exact number available but I <Col N="1276" /> can tell the House that virtually all of the employees are manual workers and they include categories described as labourers, drivers, charge hand and foreman.  I think the Seanad may rest assured that we have not got a number of highly qualified technical people tied up who would otherwise be available in the rest of the country.  The bulk of the employment here is of manual workers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the amount of bogland we have available in the country I do not think I said, and I certainly did not intend to convey, that it was the intention to develop all our bog land throughout the country for the production of grass meal. What I intended to convey was in this project we have built up a considerable amount of technical expertise in this process of growing crops on bog land.  This was all I intended to convey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned that.  I think we are lucky in having such a large acreage of this type of land available for crop growing but from our experience I think we should not keep on with the grass growing but should concentrate on vegetable growing because there is a good prospect for it on bogland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be able to answer one or two of the points raised. One question asked was the amount of local people employed.  To my knowledge there were only two people from outside employed.  One is the manager and the other man worked in the office but has since died.  All those people employed as drivers and so on were local men and they were given positions of responsibility after a time.  If they were not employed here they would be on the dole.  Since this scheme was initiated it has proved of tremendous benefit in comparatively dry slopes of mountains which did not require this intensive drainage and could, by rotivation, putting on lime and phosphate and then putting in seed, produce crops.  On much of this land cattle could not be reared and sheep could only walk with great risk.  People could not walk there even 100 yards without wearing wellingtons.  This land, after <Col N="1277" /> intensive drainage over four to five years, was suitable for grass growing.</P>
      <P>I can foresee in the near future that tremendous areas of this ground will be brought into grass production by this scheme.  If selected areas are set aside they can be adequately drained and after drying out seed can be sown. The side of some of those mountains, where there is good drainage, can be brought into this scheme by rotivation, lime and phosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could the Minister give us an idea of what percentage of the Irish grass meal production is supplied by Min Fhéir and has that remained relatively static over the past few years or has it gone up or down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have it in the form of a percentage but I have figures of the actual production.  The national production in 1960 was 11,729 tons; in 1961 it was 13,677; in 1962 it was 15,242; in 1963 it was 15,480; in 1964 it was 15,223; in 1965 it was 18,084; in 1966 it was 19,059; in 1967 it was 20,250, and in 1968 it was 19,810.  They were the national figures. The figures for Min Fhéir Teoranta for the years 1956 to 1968 were under 2,000 tons per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be scope for Min Fhéir Teoranta to consider increasing their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the field of grass meal production alone there are the limiting factors such as I mentioned earlier that the market is not as buoyant as it was some years ago, when we used to export to the North.  In fact there are still exports to the North but a new grass meal station is likely to be commenced there which, while indicating confidence in the future, will in the short term affect the amount which can be imported.  I would not like to say that there is unlimited scope for expansion in pure grass meal, but as I have indicated I hope there will be expansion not necessarily in the form of straighforward grass meal.</P>

      <P>The Minister did mention in the course of the discussion that he was not completely satisfied with the marketing method being <Col N="1278" /> adopted by Min Fhéir Teoranta.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to empower the Minister for Finance to take up additional shares in Aerlínte Éireann Teoranta to the amount of £10 million;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to empower the Minister for Finance to make further payments for capital purposes to Aerlínte, not exceeding £5 million; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  to increase to a total of £50 million the limit of money which Aerlínte and Aer Lingus, between them, may borrow under the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Since the enactment of the Air Companies Act, 1966 there has been no statutory provision for further investment in the airlines by the State.  That statutory provision was replaced by the 1966 Act in the light of a decision reached some years earlier that at that time the Companies could be regarded as having reached a stage where they should be able to finance further normal growth from revenue and commercial borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This view has had to be modified in the light of a number of new factors. There has been sharp growth in the transatlantic traffic.  The pace of technological change leading to the introduction of faster and larger aircraft and intensified international competition have brought about the need for <Col N="1279" /> further substantial capital investment in new aircraft and equipment.  The air companies in common with other carriers on their routes have to face the effects of the rapid pace of technological change and intensified competition. Once newer and more profitable aircraft types are introduced on a particular route by one airline its competitors have no option but to re-equip themselves in like manner unless they are prepared to accept a declining share of the traffic, reduced profitability and, ultimately, a cut-back in the employment of staff.</P>
    <P>The growth in air traffic is expected to continue and the air companies have made forecasts of the traffic they expect to cater for over the next five years.  These forecasts show an increase in passenger numbers from 1,372,000 in 1967-68 to 2,163,000 in 1972-73.  Over the same period revenue is estimated to increase from £24 million to £46 million.  This period will also see the introduction on the Atlantic of the Boeing 747 jets.  To maintain this momentum and to secure the forecasted increase in traffic and revenue in this dynamic industry the air companies must acquire the necessary new aircraft and ancillary equipment.</P>
    <P>The five year programme for capital re-equipment by Aer Lingus and Aerlínte up to 1973 includes the acquisition of eight Boeing 737 jets for Aer Lingus, one Boeing 320 jet and two Boeing 747 (Jumbo) jets for Aerlínte. The originally estimated cost of these aircraft has escalated and has also been affected by the sterling devaluation of November, 1967.  The companies' total capital outlay for the five year period is estimated at £71.5 million.  The companies are satisfied that this heavy investment would yield a satisfactory commercial return but the sheer amount involved created serious difficulties for them.  They undertook a close study of the financial aspects of the proposals in consultation with three leading international bankers.</P>
    <P>They were advised that to service commercial loan capital on this scale <Col N="1280" /> would, because of the burden of interest and capital repayments, be beyond the capacity of an airline of their size.  Furthermore, if the companies were to rely solely on borrowing and on their own resources, the high proportion of their capital which would then be in the form of loan capital, would tend to worsen future prospects of borrowing.  It was considered that the only satisfactory solution was to reshape the capital structures of the companies so as to increase the proportion of equity to loan capital.</P>
    <P>This conclusion was reached independently by the companies and by their consultant bankers.  The air companies were satisfied that of the total of £71.5 million required, they could, over the five years, find £28.8 million from their own resources, namely depreciation reserves and accumulated profits.  They also, considered, with the concurrence of their advisers, that they could prudently borrow a further £28 million.  This left the balance of £15 million which the companies proposed should be provided in the form of equity by the State.  Following detailed joint study by the companies and by the Departments of Finance and Transport and Power, the Government decided that the Minister for Finance should provide to the companies a further £10 million share capital and a further £5 million in the form of non-repayable interest bearing advances.</P>
    <P>The £5 million non-repayable sum is a permanent capital investment but is neither equity nor preference capital. Interest will be a charge against revenue and not profits.  It is the intention to require payment of interest at a rate equivalent to the cost of borrowing to the Exchequer.  Thus the company will be relieved of the burden of repayment but the Exchequer will have an assurance of interest payments.</P>
    <P>The £10 million equity is risk capital and any dividends payable on it must come from profits and be dependent on their being earned.  The airlines expect to earn profits which will enable them to pay some dividends on this new equity by 1972-73 but the rate of dividend will, of course, have to be struck each year in the light of the companies' earning position and commercial prospects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> The £15 million is a new capital contribution by the State.  The air companies will borrow this sum in the first place from sources not normally available to the Exchequer and this borrowing will be taken over by the Exchequer to finance the new investment.  Thus the amount available to finance the Government capital programme will be increased; the companies will secure the long-term capital injection they need and distortion of their balance sheets will be avoided.</P>
    <P>The proposed further State capital contributions are an investment in an outstanding growth industry.  Apart from any direct return account must be taken of the very substantial indirect return from our investment in the companies which play a key role in the development of tourism, in the provision of highly skilled employment and in the development of technological and management skills.  The air companies are one of our major growth businesses whose continued welfare remains a major concern of the Government.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years the joint revenue of the air companies has increased from £4.8 million to £24 million, an increase of 400 per cent.  Passenger traffic has increased from 515,000 to 1,372,000 an increase of 166 per cent and employment has increased from 2,000 to 5,000 approximately. The companies have been operating profitably for many years but their profits have been re-invested in growth rather than distributed as cash dividends and the State's investment of £13.6 million shows a growth of £4 million as at 31st March, 1968.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the profits made by the companies have derived from the transatlantic operations of Aerlínte.  Short haul operations of the type carried on by Aer Lingus are everywhere marginally profitable but the Aer Lingus network plays an essential role in our national economy by virtue of its services to tourism, to business and as a feeder to Aerlínte's profitable transatlantic routes.</P>
    <P>The value of the airlines to the national economy was recently the subject of a study commissioned by them <Col N="1282" /> from distinguished consultants.  The study shows that the total return to the community after the most realistic possible estimation of the indirect and social benefits accruing from the activities of the airlines but not susceptible of precise measurement in money terms, is certainly not less than 11 per cent and possibly as much as 26 per cent on the total capital investment.</P>
    <P>Some interesting points which emerge from the study were that the airlines earned 70 per cent of their revenue from outside of Ireland while only 45 per cent of their expenditure was incurred outside the country leaving a substantial favourable balance.  It was also reckoned that in the absence of our own national airlines up to £1.6 million annually would have left the country by way of fares to foreign carriers.  The net contribution of the airlines to our foreign earning was in the order of £6.4 million per annum. The five year programme, the financing of which this Bill deals with, will see the companies expand into a new and greatly increased level of activities.</P>
    <P>They will, by Irish standards, be very big business indeed.  It would be unwise, however, to believe that either the aviation industry generally or our own airlines will be able to relax after 1973.  The pace of technological progress continues to increase.  There are prospects of even larger jets than the Boeing 747 and supersonic jets are just around the corner.</P>
    <P>Because of the magnitude of the capital outlay which the expansion of the air companies is likely to involve in future years the Government have, therefore, decided to carry out a thorough review of the position before the end of the present programme.  The companies are planning to undertake in 1970-71 a review in depth of their capital programmes and commercial prospects and will engage specialised consultants, as necessary, to assist them in doing so.  I should avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate the boards and staffs of the air companies on the success the companies have achieved to date.  I have every confidence that this success will be maintained and that the companies will <Col N="1283" /> reach and surpass the difficult commercial targets which they have set themselves.  I consider that the investments we are now making will be put to good use and that they will yield returns both direct and indirect which will be of crucial benefit to our economy.  I have, therefore, no hesitation in recommending this Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to this proposal and we consider that it is essential at this stage particularly having regard to the problems of Aerlínte and Aer Lingus that are likely to arise in the near future.  I notice that the Minister for Finance intends taking up additional shares with Aerlínte to the extent of £10 million and that future payments for capital purposes amounting to £5 million are to be made to Aerlínte.  I should be interested to know whether any strings are attached to this advance £5 million to be made available to Aerlínte.  For instance, will the finance be available for expenditure on projects other than the purchase and maintenance of aircrafts or the purchase and maintenance of equipment associated with the air service?</P>
      <P>I see also that it proposed to increase the limit to £50 million which Aer Lingus and Aerlínte between them may borrow.  What strikes me first of all is that Aerlínte and Aer Lingus are being treated separately and then they are being treated together because it is also mentioned in the Minister's statement that Aer Lingus and Aerlínte between them may borrow under a guarantee of the Minister for Finance. Apparently there is some arrangement here and perhaps the Minister will make clear the reason for the separation of finances for separate operating purposes.  There is also the fact that while Aerlínte are able to make an operating profit from their transatlantic operations at the present time, Aer Lingus are only barely able to make ends meet.  From the technical point of view, the reason is of course because of the longer hauls between this country and the USA by comparison with the short haul activities of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> Apparently the transatlantic type Jumbo Jet, the Boeing 747 and the Boeing 320, are to be brought into operation in the future.  These are very expensive types of aircraft and we have already placed our orders for them; possibly a deposit has been paid for them, too.  We know that air travel is developing very rapidly and with it technical changes are coming very quickly in the matter of design of aircraft, types of aircraft, the facilities available to travellers and all the amenities that make up the journey for one passenger between two points. Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are fully aware of the need for change in order to keep up with these technical developments. Consequently, at the present time the life of an aircraft is limited by the speed with which new prototypes are adopted and put into operation. The result is, unfortunately, that it is very difficult to get a return on the capital invested because it has no sooner got to the stage of showing a profit than it becomes necessary once more to replace the aircraft by a more recent model.</P>
    <P>All the technical equipment which goes with the aircraft has also to be replaced and the aircraft which we have had up to then is almost outdated.  I know that a number of countries are still interested in purchasing obsolete aircraft.  The word &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; is used by those who put modern aircraft into operation and who try to capture the valuable traffic on the airlines where these modern aircraft are put into operation.  Our obselete aircraft are sold to countries or to airlines who are able to operate on a commercial, or perhaps a national, basis with the older type of aircraft.  We in Ireland are on the western outpost of Europe.  Our country is between the Continent of the United States and the Continent of Europe.  We cannot stand down by using outmoded aircraft while airlines operating between Europe and America are using modern aircraft and modern techniques of attracting passengers to their particular lines.  For that reason perhaps it is necessary for us to keep abreast of modern developments so far as air traffic is concerned. Our geographical position is perhaps fortunate.  We must ensure that we will <Col N="1285" /> get our share of the traffic available between this country and the numerous airports in Britain and on the Continent of Europe.  In addition to that, we have to compete with the transatlantic aircraft and the various airlines who operate transatlantic air-services. If we are not able to offer to transatlantic passengers the facilities available to them from other airlines we would lose business.  It is necessary for us now to provide the necessary finance to enable Aerlínte and Aer Lingus to keep up their position by purchasing modern aircraft as it becomes available.  It will be some years yet before the 747 jets or the Boeing 320 and what are described as the Jumbo Jets will be available to us. At this stage it is necessary for us to take our place in the queue of those who have already ordered these aircraft.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has quite a problem to keep above a certain level and to operate so as to break even rather than lose too much.  Aer Lingus is the airline which operates the services between this country and Great Britain and European airports.  It is important that we should have our national air services flying between these places in order to cater for the tourists interested in coming here.  It is possible that we would lose a percentage of tourist traffic if we did not have an Irish airline service available to these European airports for people interested in travelling to this country.  Aer Lingus can be regarded as a substantial contributor to our tourist income.</P>
    <P>There is a point which it is only right to mention at this stage.  We cannot lay all the blame at the doorstep of Aer Lingus, but there are complaints from people regarding the fares being charged by them between the various airports.  Generally speaking, these charges hit the tourist.  The tourist is the person we are interested in seeing here.  We do not want to have him discouraged by the air fares.  I know Aer Lingus must try to make ends meet and must put up their fares to a level designed to meet the cost, and possibly to provide a reasonable profit.  We must be careful about the air fares.  We have had complaints <Col N="1286" /> from Irish people travelling back and forward to Great Britain regarding the cost of flying between this country and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the air fares between the European ports and Dublin and Shannon are also rather high.  There is a considerable amount of anxiety in the minds of our people at the moment with regard to the prospects for this year's tourist season.  There is a feeling that we are not getting the business this year and that the tourists are not coming here in the numbers we had expected.  People fear that the profits we had anticipated from these visitors will not be realised.  It is possible that we are pricing ourselves out so far as tourists are concerned and that the Aer Lingus fare is one aspect of the problem which is turning away the tourist from this country or discouraging him at least.  We ought to see whether Aer Lingus can adopt any kind of tourist season adjustment in the fares which would encourage tourists to come here.</P>
    <P>We cannot blame Aer Lingus completely if tourists are discouraged from visiting our country and from staying to spend their money here because unfortunately there are other interests involved also which, of course, involve the tourists in expenses which they are not prepared to meet if they have an alternative.  I know that if Aer Lingus did adopt some kind of tourist season air fare structure the wintertime revenue would not be sufficient to make ends meet, because it is possible that the number of persons travelling by Aer Lingus at this time of the year would be eight times as many as the number in the valley season when there is not this tourist traffic between this country and outside.</P>
    <P>I know that it is with Great Britain and Europe that the tourist problem for us is most important, but we do depend too on visitors from the United States and Canada who will avail of our transatlantic service via Shannon. When I mention Shannon it is a peculiar fact, and it is lucky that the situation is as it exists, that with some kind of adjustment in fact our transatlantic service is from Dublin via Shannon to the USA.  The United States have been seeking permission to <Col N="1287" /> fly direct into Dublin and they have been refused, so our Irish airlines by an arrangement with Aer Lingus are able to make the flight from Dublin to Limerick, land there and then take off from Shannon transatlantic to the USA.  There is a part of the Aerlínte service in which Aer Lingus is involved. I believe that in fact Aer Lingus provide the technical personnel or the necessary computers and machinery involved in this exercise, for which they secure a nominal payment.</P>
    <P>I raised one point earlier with the Minister here and I would like to get it cleared up.  We noticed some months ago that Aer Lingus&mdash;please correct me if I am wrong &mdash; invested £350,000 in Ryan's Tourist Hotels. Now of course that investment may be a good one for Aer Lingus and those associated with them, but it is, in my view, unfair competition with the commercial hotels who hope to get support and business from visitors to this country.  This tie-up between Ryan's Tourist Hotels and Aer Lingus means that when a person in America or Canada decides to come into this country his programme is mapped out for him there and then, including the Ryan's Tourist Hotels wherever they may be and the services associated with them such as the hire car service and whatever facilities people would expect to get when they land in this country.  It seems to be very unfair competition to me.</P>

The complaint is that when a complete stranger walks into a travel office in New York, Boston or elsewhere <Col N="1288" /> coming to this country of course Aer Lingus has this tie-up with Ryan's Tourist Hotels and of course the travel agent is going to produce in black and white his booklet, his time table, his price list, and all the costs and all the problems which will be solved right along the line from the time he leaves Boston or New York until he gets back there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the purpose of the Bill, which is to make this money available, because of course Aer Lingus or Aerlínte would be hamstrung if they found it necessary to pay interest on all this money out of profits or even out of revenue; and, on that point, after £5 million will have been invested in the company the Minister proposes to charge interest not out of profit but out of revenue and I think <Col N="1290" /> that that is fair enough because it is part of the operating cost of the provision of this particular £5 million.  It is a peculiar arrangement that this £5 million is described by the Minister as an advance and is not described by him as a loan; and still he is going to get interest on this advance and apparently it is a non-repayable advance. Apparently he does not want to call it a grant which, of course, would be non-repayable anyway.  He called it a non-repayable advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I appreciate that it is interest bearing but apparently at no stage will the Minister expect this £5 million to be repaid except if the amount of interest charged against it eventually overtakes it.  We could calculate, of course, over a period of time at a rate of 8 or 9 per cent, how long it would take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but what I wanted to put to the Minister at this stage is why decide to do this at all?  Is he just going to charge interest against the non-repayable advance or what is he going to do with this interest he has received from the non-repayable advance?  It seems to be a very peculiar adjustment.  What is the point of charging interest against it at all if he does not expect it, first of all, to be repaid and, secondly, if he does not take the interest which he is charging?  Apparently he is going to charge interest on this non-repayable advance but does not intend to take the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £45,000 if you want to know.  Let us hear from the Minister if he is going to get this £45,000 from Aerlínte or is he going to leave it with them.  He said he is going to leave it with them.  Let us hear from him now whether he is going to leave it with them.  If he is going to leave it with them why is he charging it?  I see here a very satisfactory operating statistic.  The revenue in 1949 was £4.8 million compared with £24 million last year which shows an increase of approximately 400 per cent.  The number of passengers in the meantime, who contributed to this increase in revenue of 400 per cent, increased by over 166 per cent. Then the employment figure, if I am right&mdash;please correct me if I am not&mdash; has gone up by 250 per cent during that ten year period.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is doing his sums well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am.  So, if you put the employment percentage up and the passenger percentage up it shows there is a measure of efficiency there in relation to the revenue in 1969. There are other aspects here associated with this capital loan and the Minister may be able to advise me with regard to them.  He mentioned here the Boeing <Col N="1292" /> 747 Jumbo Jets, bought for Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  This will involve a considerable development at Collinstown Airport, such as longer runways, the purchase of hundreds of acres of land, the equipping of those runways with radar and all the other services which are provided in connection with an airstrip.  I wonder whether part of this finance, which the Minister has mentioned, will be used for the purchase of this land and for the construction of those runways or is it only for the purchase of aircraft?</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister which way this money will be used.  Will it be left to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte to expend the money in all the different ways associated with those Boeing Jets, not just on the aircraft alone but on the ground equipment, the airstrips, the purchase of land and all the different services which go to make up carrying passengers by those Jumbo Jets.</P>
      <P>Here again, although we have the finance available between Aerlínte and Aer Lingus, we have separate purchases being made by them. Apparently Aerlínte are going to purchase eight Boeing 747 Jets and Aer Lingus are going to purchase one Boeing 320 Jet.  Why are those separate purchases being made when in fact the capital of both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte is put together for the purpose of making separate purchases of aircraft to each of those services?</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to know from the Minister how soon we may expect the Boeing cross-channel aircraft to be available.  I know the transatlantic aircraft may be delayed somewhat and it may be a different type aircraft which will be purchased but I would like to know how soon those large planes will be going into service?  I do not believe at the moment the airstrips at Collinstown Airport will be capable of dealing with them.  Does that mean they would be located at Shannon Airport if they are purchased before the new airstrips are made and the land is purchased around Collinstown Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at the present time there are widespread complaints from the residents of Dublin City and towns in <Col N="1293" /> County Dublin, such as Dún Laoghaire, regarding the noise made by these planes as they cross over the city and nearby towns.  I wonder whether the Minister, now that he is in this Department, would inquire from Aer Lingus whether any steps can be taken either to change the route of those aircraft or to cut down the noise. Dublin City and its citizens were there long before Collinstown Airport was established and these services came under way.  I think the citizens are entitled to expect the least possible interference with their normal comfort. Something will have to be done about the noise and also about the vibration caused when aircraft are flying at low levels, in order to reduce to a minimum the nuisance caused by those aircraft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can avail of this Bill and the opportunity it presents to us to congratulate the air companies, Aer Lingus and Aerlínte, on their continued success record.  It is good to see that they are back again with expansion problems.  Of course the expansion is not altogether all their own doing because the greatly-accelerated pace of technological development in the aircraft industry is making itself felt with the demand for bigger and faster jets.  Aer Lingus have, of course, to maintain their proud place as an international airline and have to keep up with this even though I think many of us hope and pray that many of the marvels of science will be delayed for many years yet.  Certainly the supersonic jets will pose very great problems when they arrive, not least of all the sonic boom and the effect that will have on the country as a whole.  So far, little or no progress has been made in mitigating it.  However, we are not facing it in the present period and we hope it will be well into the next five-year period before it becomes a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum involved for the next five year period is quite a large one by any standards&mdash;£71 million.  It is satisfactory to find that Aer Lingus are providing £28 million from their own resources, £28 million by way of borrowing and £15 million from the Government, £5 million of which is full interest-bearing and the other £10 <Col N="1294" /> million of which is by way of share capital.  The only figure I question is the £28 million borrowed because I presume it will have to be borrowed from outside the State.  We know that in such a case it makes very expensive money because there is no return by way of taxation here to the Exchequer on the interest paid&mdash;it just leaves the country.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into any great details on the Bill, except to point out again the necessity for co-ordinating our various State enterprises, because success to Aer Lingus in many ways might be in some fields rather costly to the country as a whole: in other words, the great promotional effort that Aer Lingus make to convince our people that holidays abroad are much better and that to be &ldquo;with it&rdquo; one should take one's holidays abroad and, no doubt, fly in an Aer Lingus jet.</P>
    <P>Although flying in an Aer Lingus jet is shown on the positive side by Aer Lingus, certainly it is very much on the negative side for the tourist industry. I am not satisfied that the Government have evolved an adequate means for co-ordinating the activities of the various semi-State bodies, because they are all on the basis of the success of the indivilual body.  I think we need a Ministry for Co-ordination, primarily to ensure that activities are harmonised, and secondly to produce the best result not only for the company as such, but the best result for the national economy.</P>

      <P>During the last two months we have had a row between CIE and Aer Lingus over the fare from Cork to Dublin and the inadequate air service which operates from there.  As I understand it, CIE have been adopting a rather dog-in-the-manger attitude to this service.  I should like the Minister to elucidate that.</P>
      <P>We should have adequate link ups between our airports.  It is ridiculous for tourists arriving in Dublin not to be able to continue to Cork or Belfast if their journey so requires them to.  The amount of revenue lost to CIE by any such arrangement would be negligible in comparison to the inconvenience caused to the travellers and the damage that it can do to our image abroad when we cannot provide facilities which most tourists regard as elementary air travel facilities between Dublin, the capital city, Cork and Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the airline live up quite well to the reputation of the &ldquo;friendly airline&rdquo;. Certainly on transatlantic services they compare with the best.  But when will Aer Lingus succeed in breaking through the red tape that prevents them making the trip from America to Shannon a comfortable one?  It is the most uncomfortable air trip that can be had anywhere.  The travellers get on board at the end of the American day, nine or ten o'clock at night.  The meals and so on take the best part of another three or four hours.  One may then doze for two hours or so before entering the broad morning of the Atlantic and within an hour of that one lands at Shannon.  The whole night has to be a strain on the traveller.  It would seem that if at all possible a daylight service should be operated on that route or, alternatively, a sleeper service.  If meals are to be served, especially a big dinner on such a trip, it could be done best by giving the passengers coupons to have a meal either at New York or Boston while they are waiting to board the plane, apart from a drink or two in the first half hour.  Some effort should be made to enable the passengers to sleep for the remainder of the night.  Indeed, there is no need to serve orange juice when approaching <Col N="1296" /> Shannon in the morning.  It would be much better to provide a breakfast coupon which could be used either at Shannon or at Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand that this is not entirely the fault of Aer Lingus but that it stems from international air regulations. I am speaking not only from personal experience but from the considered opinion of many travellers when I say that the complete loss of a night's sleep between New York and Shannon is a very uncomfortable experience.</P>
    <P>While the amount of State investment involved in this is not considerable&mdash;it stands at present at £14.8 million and there are £10 million by way of loan capital, making a total of more than £24 million&mdash;it is quite high for a number of 5,000. In other words, it is £5,000 per worker.  I know, of course, that the workers involved are very highly skilled and I suggest to the Minister that it might be possible to develop through Aer Lingus the consultancy side of the business.  Legislation was passed to deal with this in the case of the engineering services, to facilitate consulting engineers abroad.  Our airline here has a great deal to offer to other countries in the consultancy field&mdash;countries that are at a less-developed stage than we are.  It would be sound policy to get our investment back in this way.</P>

      <P>Before the tea-break I was dealing with the highly-specialised staff we have been fortunate in assembling in Aer Lingus.  I was expressing the hope that it would be possible to use that staff to provide a consulting agency in the airline business to other countries.  We must try to get some return from modern technology. Being a small country, we have to buy the products of technology in a manufactured state, whether they are computers or jet aircraft.  We just simply pay for them.  We get nothing at all from the great amounts spent in development work in connection with these marvels of modern science. Therefore, the only way we can get anything back from science is by using the talent we have gathered together <Col N="1297" /> here on a consultancy basis.  Many other small countries which are less developed in air travel than we are would be quite anxious to use our talents.</P>
      <P>Three months ago we had the Export Promotions Bill before the House.  One of the tasks in that Bill was to encourage An Foras Tionscal to aid consulting engineers in going out and seeking consulting work all over the world. In the debate on that Bill, which I commended to the Minister, we stressed that this should be broadened considerably and should reach out to any pool of specialists we have got. We should use this as a basis for looking for appropriate work anywhere in the world.  Now right here we are in one of our dilemmas in that that board with the present task that was entrusted to it is controlled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by Deputy Colley, and the airlines are controlled of course by the Minister for Transport and Power.  I do hope that it will be possible within the Government to get over this divided responsibility and see that Aer Lingus are encouraged to go into the consulting business as much as possible.  It could be very lucrative for us and we would be doing a service to the rest of the world and at the same time giving our trained scientists and engineers, accountants and others in Aer Lingus an opportunity of doing some really high-grade work in developing systems elsewhere, so I ask the Minister to look into that and push it as far as he can.</P>
      <P>I was very encouraged by the Minister today when he said at the end of his statement that a very comprehensive review is being undertaken of the requirements of Aer Lingus in the next five-year period.  He said &ldquo;The companies are planning to undertake in 1970-71 a review in depth of their capital programmes and commercial operations and will engage specialist consultants as necessary to assist them in doing this&rdquo;.  This of course is as it should be, and in a very rapidly-developing business like airlines it is a necessity.  I assume that the Minister and his staff will be doing something similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now here I come to the commercial <Col N="1298" /> We have pleaded many times in this House to the Minister to take this House into it at least before the planning is finalised by setting up an Oireachtas committee that will receive the reports from Aer Lingus, the air companies and the Minister's Department and work with them in helping to finalise Government policy also in regard to the very heavy capital commitments that might be expected in the following period.  This is a task that is ideally suited to Seanad personnel, and I feel that if the Minister did it he would be taking the first step in getting the promised committees review that the Taoiseach spoke about under way. I promise him for myself and for Members of this House if any of us will be fortunate enough to be in the next House, that we would feel that we were discharging our real function in the national economy if we could be in a little earlier in the planning stages to bring the voice of the Oireachtas to bear on the discussions and deliberations of the specialists from the airlines and the Minister's Department.  If that were the case it would be much more satisfactory than just to be faced with another demand like we have got now for a further £71 million and not being able to do very much in a short debate except to approve of it and let it go.  I appeal to the Minister to give us this opportunity.  If he does I know that the Seanad will not be found wanting in its responsibility.</P>
    <P>With this I again congratulate Aer Lingus on their progress and I hope that their expansion in the next five years will be as spectacular and as profitable as it has been in the past five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear that there might be some lack of expertise on behalf of the Aer Lingus staff in the development of the airline business, because being near Shannon I am personally aware of the close work that has gone on between the technical people in Aer Lingus and the companies that manufacture planes I know that the technical people in Aer Lingus are recognised in America and in England and in any other place where the technological business of airlines is concerned as being some of the <Col N="1299" /> finest exponents of technological activities in the airlines.  I am surprised Senator Quinlan does not know this. Aer Lingus have had a lot of their representatives at the actual manufacturing operation of the aeroplanes where they were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference was they were actually deficient technologically. Aer Lingus staff have actually been engaged in this for a long time.  Some of their pilots and technological people have been sent to the different places where the aircraft were bought.  I am well aware of this fact.  Aer Lingus, in my opinion, for the amount of money made available to them, have done a remarkable service to this country by advertising and the promotion of the country's tourist trade but also in the technological field.  I do not believe they are deficient in any respect.  The Senator inferred that we should start sending those experts abroad to acquire this knowledge which I know they already have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, I suggested sending them abroad to consult and advise others in the skills which they have got, which is the reverse of what the Senator imputed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that.  When you consider that we do not make aeroplanes in this country and that we are going to start sending people abroad to advise others how to make them, that is taking on a lot.  Aer Lingus, for the size of this country and their own resources, are undertaking very considerable <Col N="1300" /> promotional activities.  We have in Aer Lingus at the moment the highest experts you could find anywhere. It is most unlikely that we can go to some other country to advise them how to make aeroplanes.</P>
      <P>Actually what we are doing is availing of the knowledge of the people who make aeroplanes and we are getting this knowledge at a comparatively low cost in return for using their products. I consider Aer Lingus one of the most important semi-State bodies and I think everybody, even foreigners, regard them as being highly skilled, highly organised and people devoted to their work.  We have every reason to be proud of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the general welcome given to the Bill in Seanad Éireann.  It is quite obvious as far as the air companies are concerned &mdash;I do not intend to go into the mechanics of their interlocking together&mdash;both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are operating in a very competitive field.  They are doing so very successfully and they are operating at a profit.  In the other House this fact was acknowledged quite clearly by Deputy FitzGerald speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and there is no need for me here to eulogise the type of commercial progress made by our air companies in a very highly competitive field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just to elaborate on what this is about in practical terms, the amount the air companies propose to raise over the next five years is £71.5 million.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that as far as the State is concerned the Minister for Finance on behalf of the State will take equity shares up to £10 million.  In addition to that, he will be empowered under the Bill to make loan capital available to the extent of £5 million.  It is also provided in the Bill to increase to a total of a £50 million limit the money which both companies can borrow. The remainder of the £71.5 million required during the next five years for capital purposes after the £15 million invested by the State in equity share holding and loan capital will be raised <Col N="1301" /> by the air companies from their own resources.  What is involved in this&mdash; I am answering the question myself&mdash; is a complete re-equipping of the Aer Lingus/Aerlínte fleet of planes and the airport facilities designed to meet the need for those new planes in order to retain, maintain and improve the air companies' competitive position in the world air markets.</P>
    <P>Briefly what is involved is this: as of April of this year, we have had one Boeing 737 jet brought into operation. The other six that are now commissioned will be delivered in September, October and November of this year and in March and April of next year.  In regard to the Boeing 320, we have five.  One was delivered in April, 1969, and the rest will be delivered later.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 747, which is properly known as the Jumbo Jet, which is the major transatlantic effort on the part of Aerlínte, two of those have been commissioned and one will be delivered early next year and the other in 1971.  The whole purpose of this exercise, which is being well calculated, well organised, well thought out, is that our airlines will have a fully-equipped jet fleet to meet the requirements of the modern air traffic age.</P>
    <P>The Viscounts, which served their purpose in their time, will be replaced by the type of fleet which will keep Aer Lingus/Aerlínte in the air as far as the future is concerned.  Mind you, I want to say that this is not a limitless future.  We are planning for five years ahead and there will be other developments. There is no need for me to emphasise that the recent moon movements will mean that there will be a very rapid change in airlines in the future.  Our air companies, which have had tremendous success since their foundation, have all the time to keep right up to it in this respect and the type of money that is involved in going into the supersonic jet age in the future and the further investments that will be required by our national air companies to keep in competition profitably, as they have done heretofore, into the 1970s and the 1980s will be different from what it was.</P>
    <P>The sort of thinking which air companies <Col N="1302" /> have to engage in is not limited to five years: it is limited to ten, 15 and 20 years.  This sort of thinking involves contemplation of massive capital investment in the future.  The main purpose of this Bill is to put Aer Lingus into a capital structure position whereby they will in the future be, and appear to be, a viable enterprise that can raise money in any market in the world for its future expansion.  What we are seeking to do here in this Bill is to ensure roughly a fifty-fifty balance between equity investment and loan capital investment.  The State is placing, I think, a very well-earned trust in our air companies by ensuring that it will put a £10 million equity investment into Aer Lingus; an investment which, in my view, will be well remunerated on the commercial record of the company heretofore and in addition to that it will have a £5 million loan capital investment on which interest repayment will be guaranteed.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the company will move forward into a position where&mdash;and I am certain they will in the years ahead&mdash;raise the necessary finance for further expansion.</P>
    <P>I had occasion the day before yesterday to be in Wicklow looking at the new generating station which is now being constructed by the ESB.  This is a £12 million investment, half of which is being put in by the World Bank.  We want more of this sort of investment. All our State companies and private companies will require investment and the only way to build up that type of investment in our country in our enterprises, both private and public, is by creating confidence and creating a situation where these companies can be seen to be totally and completely commercially viable.  They will then be in a position to generate confidence which will raise whatever funds they require.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to emphasise the fact that our airlines are the most successful in the world at their particular level of operation.  There is no need for me to emphasise that on the transatlantic haul they are making commercial profits on the most commercial assessment that one can make they are making money and that on their short haul operation between Britain and <Col N="1303" /> Europe they are more than holding their won and fitting into the overall commercial profit which is being made by the airlines as a whole.  Apart from that there are substantial tourist benefits. Aer Lingus receive the revenue earning benefits from the services operated by them which would otherwise be operated by another airline. There is also the substantial employment benefit, where we now have 5,000 employed compared with 2,000 ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator Rooney that there are no strings, to use his phrase, attached to anything being done in this respect.  This is a completely commercial operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in regard to what Senator Quinlan has said, that his point of view is one that is concerning me, on the whole question of to what degree there can be a reasonable extension of parliamentary control in regard to our State-sponsored organisations.  My own thinking at the present time is that we should&mdash; although I do not think it is appropriate on this particular measure&mdash; draw up some form of differentials or separation between what you might call the social orientated corporations and the commercial orientated corporations.</P>
    <P>What Senator Quinlan suggests might be more appropriate in regard to some of the other State-sponsored organisations, but in my view it would not be appropriate in regard to this particular one.  But we do have other State-sponsored organisations which do not have to be commercially orientated to the same extent and in respect of those particular corporations I think there does exist a <i>Prima facie</i> case for some degree of parliamentary supervision.</P>
    <P>But with regard to this particular area, air companies are totally commercial and are engaged in the toughest commercial business in the world and I think anything of that nature would be inappropriate as far as they are concerned.  We must rely on the expertise of the board, the expertise of the management and the expertise of their staffs at all levels. <Col N="1304" /> They have proved themselves heretofore and their only problem in the future will be to raise the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>The funds will not be of the order of £71.5 million which we are talking about today, they are going to be substantially more than that&mdash;and when I say substantially I mean substantially with a capital &ldquo;S&rdquo;&mdash;because that is the reality as we move in the 1970's and the 1980's, and moving into that sort of world in this highly competitive field I feel we must give them the greatest possible commercial freedom. The main purpose of this Bill&mdash; again I am going back to my point&mdash; is to ensure that they have a financial structure which will enable them to attract the commercial capital which they can attract if they get themselves organised as between equity and loan capital on a reasonable basis.  I appreciate the fact that both the Seanad and the Dáil have welcomed the Bill generally in that respect.  I am very glad of the contributions made here by members of the House on other aspects which might not have been striclty relevant to this particular Bill but have certainly been helpful to me in my own thinking on the whole future of our State-sponsored organisations in our community.</P>

      <P>With regard to the investment of the Government in this, I want to return briefly to the point made by the Minister about the question of control of semi-State bodies operating commercially.  I should be the last to advocate any unnecessary control, but I would interpret the Minister's job as being able to get the maximum national return from both the air companies and the tourist effort <Col N="1305" /> together.  Both are his responsibility. He has to maximise not the individual returns but the sum of the two.  I question there the extent to which the airlines can act negatively to tourism by encouraging large-scale holidays abroad. I thought perhaps there should be a balance there.  It is good business for Aer Lingus to take our people to foreign parts but it is a loss to tourism.  It is a condition in which the Government are investing, and I want to make sure the condition is solved.</P>

    <P>That the Dublin Gas Order, 1969, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in <Col N="1306" /> draft before Seanad Éireann on the 25th day of June, 1969, under subsection (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas. Modifications to the special Acts required by the undertakings from time to time are made under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to make by Order the required modifications.  Before an Order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>In 1954 an Order was made which gave the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company power to appoint either the Chief Engineer, the General Manager or the Secretary of the Company as a Director of the Company.</P>
      <P>The General Manager is now on the Board of Directors but the company wish to have the power to appoint the Chief Engineer and the Secretary as directors also.  These officers hold divisional responsibility in the company's organisation and the company feel that, to give them stronger status, it is desirable that they should be permitted to be on the Board.  The Order now laid in draft before the House for approval will give the company the necessary authority to make these appointments whenever they see fit to do so.</P>
      <P>Notice of the proposed Order was published by the Company in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a daily newspaper. Copies of the draft Order were sent to the public and local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>No objection to the proposed Order was received.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to make in connection with this Order and it is this: apparently, the Gas Regulation Act of 1920, section 10, requires to be done what the Minister has done here tonight.  I should like to say that we are in favour of this move because these technical men acting on this board can only improve the service and improve the conditions of this company.  The point I want to make is that it is an unusual regulation and apparently carries a restriction in so far as the Gas Company are concerned, the restriction being that a request for permission to make changes must come before the House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Many companies have power to bring a general manager, secretaries and chief engineers on to their boards without seeking the permission of the Oireachtas.  The legislation in respect of the Gas Company was brought in in 1920 when consideration was given to the provision of gas supplies but at this time, when we are tidying up a lot of old legislation, this particular piece of legislation ought to be dropped or altered so that we will not have a situation in which the Minister has to come in here and ask both Houses of the Oireachtas for permission to permit the Gas Company to bring these three officers on to the board.</P>

    <P>With regard to the new relief for artists, writers, sculptors and composers, the exemption will depend in the main on the general status which an individual attains in his own particular field rather than on any specific work which he has produced.</P>
    <P>I expect therefore that painters, writers, sculptors and composers who have won general acclaim for work of artistic or cultural quality will be granted the tax exemption on earnings from their work in those roles without having to submit works for consideration by the Revenue Commissioners.  A person who has yet to make his name will be able to claim exemption by submitting to the Commissioners any work which, in his opinion, possesses the required merit.  Once the Revenue Commissioners make a determination in favour of a particular work, all the person's earnings from work in that category will be exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to approach their task of adjudication in a liberal way and, if anything, to err in favour of borderline cases.  Of course, questions of cultural or artistic merit cannot escape subjective judgment; opinions on any particular work may diverge widely. But I feel confident that these obstacles can be surmounted and that the scheme can achieve the objective of improving and enriching our daily lives.</P>
    <P>Most of the other provisions of Part I of the Bill are concerned with tax easements and the relief of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>At present there is no special tax relief where a housekeeper must be employed to look after a totally incapacitated person.  Section 3 provides a new allowance of £100 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>A further improvement in tax relief <Col N="1309" /> is set out in section 7; the amount of medical expenses on which relief may be claimed is raised from £300 to £500; and the total health expenses of a taxpayer and his dependants may now be grouped together for relief purposes instead of dealing with the amount spent on each individual as was the case previously.</P>
    <P>At a cost to the Exchequer of over £3.5 million, provision is made in section 9 for increases of £30 in the income tax allowance for married persons and £15 for single persons.  This will have the effect of taking some 30,000 persons out of the income tax net.</P>
    <P>Because of the prohibitive cost of really worthwhile increases in these allowances, I am examining the possibility of easing the burden of personal taxation by a comprehensive re-structuring of our tax system.  This is, of course, a formidable task, but I would like, if possible, to introduce the necessary legislative measures this year.</P>
    <P>Section 15 extends to 1990 the period within which the &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief may be claimed.  Section 16 extends the exports tax relief to the same date. There are many other noteworthy provisions in this Part of the Bill but, as they are described in the explanatory memorandum, I need not dwell on them further at this stage.</P>
    <P>Part II contains the detailed provisions necessary to effect the repeal of Schedules A and B.  A year ago I announced the abolition of tax under Schedule A because it was a burden falling mainly on owner-occupiers of private residences.  As a measure of relief for farmers, Schedule B tax&mdash;on income from the occupation of land&mdash; was abolished also.  The removal of these Schedules simplified the tax code; the 16 sections excising them are somewhat complicated as they are mainly of a technical nature.</P>
    <P>The Customs and Excise duties changes announced in the Budget are confirmed in Part III of the Bill.  In addition, this Part simplifies the tobacco manufacturers' licence duty; introduces a number of minor changes requested by Irish business interests; increases the penalty for breaches of <Col N="1310" /> the regulations relating to the excise duty on table waters and applies the Customs and Excise laws to hovercraft.</P>
    <P>Two sections improving death duties reliefs are introduced in Part IV, in response to various representations to the effect that, in certain circumstances, the widow and family of a deceased person were not obtaining in full the benefits which it was intended to give them.</P>
    <P>Section 49 in Part V relieves from stamp duty first purchases of grant-type houses, sales by public utility companies to their members and sales by local authorities to tenant purchasers. Section 50 imposes a stamp duty of 10 per cent on contracts for the construction of office blocks.  This is intended to raise most of the revenue needed to pay for the stamp duty relief I have just mentioned and also to divert our scarce building resources away from office blocks.</P>
    <P>The sections in Part VI of the Bill deal with corporation profits tax and follow from changes in relation to income tax made in Part I.  The effects of the sections in the three remaining Parts of the Bill are fairly straightforward.</P>
    <P>At the Committee Stage, I shall of course be glad to answer any questions Senators wish to raise on particular aspects of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the debate, the Chair would like to indicate for the guidance of Senators that this debate on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill should be along the lines of a Budget debate as it takes place in the Dáil.  That is to say, it is confined to taxation, to general expenditure and to financial policy and to other matters in so far as they are connected with financial policy.  Matters of administration, and details relating to matters of administration, may not be raised. Opportunities for debating these latter subjects will arise in due course on the Appropriation Bill.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill usually affords the opportunity for one of the major debates of the Seanad year.  It is indeed, together with the <Col N="1311" /> Appropriation Bill, one of the two debates in which general and financial policy are discussed.  We usually find these bills come to us at the end of a session, and, indeed, usually after the Dáil has adjourned, which makes realistic hopes of making recommendations in regard to these Bills somewhat empty.  We must congratulate the Minister in managing to have the Finance Bill in the Seanad before the Dáil is adjourned, if only by a matter of hours.  It is unfortunate, when for once this has been achieved, that this Bill happens to come to the Seanad at what is, for another reason, an untimely season.  The Members of this House find it difficult to concentrate in this debate on the minutiae of taxation proposals when our minds are elsewhere on matters such as counties still to be covered and preferences still to be won.  Indeed, it may well be that the Seanad members will not feel in the humour for a fully comprehensive debate.  Perhaps Senators will be relieved to know that I certainly am of this disposition and I do not intend to make a major or prolonged speech on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On occasions such as this, we discuss the question of taxation policy in general and taxation in particular.  I should like to refer first of all to the question of our general level of taxation.  There is a tendency for Government spokesmen to be slightly complacent in regard to this. It is an easy thing to say that the level of taxation in this country is lighter than that in countries at a similar stage of development.  This has been said but it does not happen to be true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago I went into some detail on a Finance Bill to point out that at that time the position was that by a margin which was considerable, our level of taxation, taking the total taxation as a percentage of our GNP, was somewhat higher than in countries which could be classed as being at the same level of development.  The circumstances have not changed greatly in the interim.  I am sure if this exercise <Col N="1312" /> were done again we would find that we still hold somewhat the same position.</P>
    <P>If we look at the <i>Second</i> and <i>Third Programmes for Economic Development</i> in regard to this question, we find that the hopes of the Second Programme in regard to the level of taxation were not realised.  It is hoped that a certain stage of development could have been achieved by a moderate rise in the level of taxation.  It was unfortunate that this particular level of taxation was the first target to be passed and outpaced during the operation of the Second Programme.  We do not know what the precise figure is but we are now running at about 30 per cent of our GNP in total taxation.</P>
    <P>This is not necessarily a bad thing. It is not necessarily something to be deplored in the sense that we are taking this much in taxation and redeploying the money within the economy.  However, we are getting to such a level of taxation that certain dangers as regards the weight of this taxation and the general burden of this taxation now emerge.  Consequently, we must be more careful than ever to ensure when we ask the people to bear a burden of this size that, in fact, the money is being well used.  As the figure of total taxation gets higher and higher, the onus becomes greater on the Government, and on the Minister for Finance in particular, to ensure that the money taken from the taxpayer in this way is efficiently returned to public use.  In particular, there is an onus to see that money is not unnecessarily raised in taxation only to be diverted back to pretty much the same area from which it originally came.  The greatest amount of efficiency in both the collection of the money and its disbursement cannot avoid a loss if we are circulating money unnecessarily in that way.</P>
    <P>When we approach this problem of general taxation there are some criteria which must be applied.  There must be criteria on which any financial policy and any budget must be based and assessed.  These criteria will be somewhat different when we are dealing with taxation on individuals and when we are dealing with taxation on corporations.  The criteria would be in <Col N="1313" /> each case social and economic but there will be a differing emphasis in regard to the two.  In regard to the taxation of individuals here the emphasis is on the social purpose.  Here we are concerned with the re-distribution of wealth, with the promotion of social justice in our society, so that in regard to the framing of general taxation policy with regard to the taxation of individuals what we are concerned with is the achieving of a social purpose without doing undue economic damage in the process.</P>
    <P>So we have various arguments about the level of the balance between direct and indirect taxation.  Many people believe that if we allow the level of direct taxation to go too high there is a serious disincentive effect here, so that in fact in attempting to achieve social justice through the re-distribution of wealth we may well do economic damage.  I take the view that this case is not a proven one and that in fact we know too little about what are the incentive and the disincentive effects of various types of taxation. This is something on which we need more information, something which would well commend itself to our Economic and Social Research Institute, who could assist the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas by an investigation of what are the incentive and the disincentive effects of various types of taxation in Ireland, given its economy, given its habits of life and given the psychological disposition of our people.  This is something well worthy of investigation.</P>
    <P>As I say, I feel that in spite of what is very often glibly quoted, the case for the disincentive effect of direct taxation is not a proven one.  There are needs for incentives throughout our whole taxation system, but we know little about their effects.</P>
    <P>When we come to the question of the taxation of corporations here the situation is somewhat reversed.  We are not concerned now about social justice. Here we are concerned with economic developments, and just as in the case of the taxation of individuals which involves trying to achieve a social aim without any bad effects from the economic viewpoint, here our aim <Col N="1314" /> should be a taxation system on corporations which will achieve certain economic objectives without interfering with our conception of social justice.  I wonder does our present system of taxation of corporations do this.</P>
    <P>I wonder in fact have we got the best system of taxation of corporations and of institutions which will give us the best allocation of resources.  I am inclined to doubt it.  I am inclined to say that here again there is need for study, there is need perhaps for cautious experimentation on the part of the Minister in regard to this particular topic, because if we raise much of our taxation from corporations on the basis of profitability we may well be going in the wrong direction.  The alternative is not easy. It is perhaps easy to say in the abstract, to say in an academic way, that we need a taxation system in regard to corporations which will give rise to the best allocation of resources by penal taxation of the waste of resources.  But to translate this from an acceptable principle into a real policy and into actual provisions in the Finance Bill is, as it must be freely admitted, very far from easy.  Experiments in Britain in regard to the selective employment tax have not been entirely happy, but nevertheless I do commend this approach to the Minister as something which should be kept in mind as it may well be that it is in this direction that we will have to move if we are to modernise our system of taxation and modernise our budgets.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come here with a well-shaped Budget of the traditional type.  It is a post-Keynsianster Budget but I think that we have possibly been in this regard post-Keynsianster long enough and that we should from the point of view of using the Budget as an instrument of public policy be moving in new directions still.  I think that this is, talking in a general way, something to which the Minister and his adivsers might well turn their minds.  We have become used now to the idea of the budget as a controller, not merely balancing the books but also a controller of the economy, and indeed certain <Col N="1315" /> provisions that have been introduced in recent years have improved it as a controller.  The introduction of PAYE brought in an automatic feedback in regard to the question of the taxation of increased incomes virtually as soon as they arise.  I think that once again there is possibly a need to move further in this direction of control.  The Minister for Finance can now manage through his Budget, though we have found in the past few years that it requires two budgets a year to do it, to exercise a sort of control to a certain level of grossness as it were; but there are other fluctuations in the economy of a shorter term nature and it is necessary that we should turn our minds towards the question of evening out these fluctuations, these higher frequency fluctuations, which do occur in the economy.  This cannot be done by action and re-action.  It cannot be done by waiting for things to arise and then acting.  In the sort of economy that we must develop here within the next decade it will not be sufficient to have plans available for what must be done in regard to the regulation of the economy, or that we have a contingency plan if this or that should happen. What we need is to solve the problem of how to put a built-in stability into the economy.</P>
    <P>How are we to devise a system which is best suited to the Irish economy? This should not be outside our ingenuity.  We have seen in the technological field that this building in of automatic compensation and of stability into the engineering systems enabled men to land on the moon.  It should not be beyond our powers to build in some more stability so that there will be need in the regulation of the Irish economy for an absolute minimum of direct intervention.</P>
    <P>This is the problem we face in regard to the construction here of an appropriate taxation and financial policy, as we face many problems in the next decade, facing problems the like of which we have never faced before.  This I think is the sort of way in which we must think out our problems and our taxation policy.  Mere alterations in the Budget from year to year, merely trying to put a new version <Col N="1316" /> of the old-type Budget, will hardly be enough.  It is of course in general terms that I am talking.  I am talking now not about what should be in the Finance Bill, 1969, or perhaps not even what should be in the Finance Bill for 1970.  I am talking of things which might well engage the attention of the Minister so that as we get well into the 1970s we will have a new type of Budget to meet a new type of age.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing so far with general points.  There are just a few things I would like to say about the particular provisions of the Bill.  Most of them would probably be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage but I think it would not be right if I did not welcome some of the provisions of the present Budget.  The Minister is to be commended in regard to the introduction of the provision regarding the earnings of artists.  The position in the age we live in is different from what has been the position in centuries past.  With very few exceptions, the State is now the patron to whom artists must look both in regard to the commissioning of works and in regard to seeing they have an adequate livelihood.</P>
    <P>There are dangers in this.  We have just one munificent patron.  I suppose this is not much different from the position of patrons in the medieval cities of Italy centuries ago where there was one powerful family who by their wealth and their interest in art were the major patrons.  The State could use their powers of patronage as well as they were used by the great Italian families of the Renaissance period and it would be doing something for the general good.  I commend the Minister for what he is doing here.  We all clearly realise that this is a start in a particular direction and one in which the Minister will feel able to go further in the years ahead.  For the moment let us welcome what he is doing.</P>
    <P>There are other provisions which are also welcome.  They are provisions which are moving in the direction of recognition of the fact that family welfare is the great social problem of this country, that it is the large families, the families afflicted by sickness and incapacity, who bear the great social burden.  Again we must <Col N="1317" /> commend the Minister for what is being done in this Budget.  These are all things for which the people will be quite ready to provide the extra taxation. Here again what the Minister is doing, though worthy in its way, is only going part of the way to meet the general problem.</P>
    <P>There are other matters in this Finance Bill which I could comment on but they are perhaps better left over for Committee Stage, where they can be dealt with in detail.  I wish to say that the main burden of what I have to say on this Stage is that this Budget which we have is a good example of a Budget which we must now consider as being a classical type and perhaps adequate to the problems which we face as we enter the next decade.  A great deal of serious thinking will be needed on the part of a large number of people and I ask the Minister to initiate that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will take the Minister up on his offer and make a bid for his number 4, 5 or 6 vote on the Labour Panel during the next ten minutes.  Clearly we have got to realise even tonight that the Finance Bill is one of the rare times we get a chance in this House to take a square look at the very broad fabric of taxation. It is important, if we are to make any approach to the subject at all, to recognise first of all that we have got to look at this very big problem as a whole.  We have got to ask ourselves some questions concerning it.  Some of them have been posed so often that we are inclined to take them for granted. However, the question is quite relevant today, no matter how often it is repeated, about how relevant the present system of taxation is.  It is unfortunate that there is in fact no up-to-date information available whatever on the incidence of total taxation in this country, on the pressures which exist on the different income groups.  I suggest that there is a pressing and urgent need for such information, first of all, to be collated and made available and to be made available quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, in passing, I should like to suggest also that it is not quite sufficient for the Minister to point to the incidence for example of income tax <Col N="1318" /> and surtax because I believe if we are to solve the problem in the future we have got to have a long, square and honest look at the overall incidence, both of direct and indirect taxation. We have built up a structure of taxation in this country and in many other countries in which to a very large extent the bulk of the burden borne by the tax payers is in fact concealed and not made fully apparent to the unfortunate people who have to foot the bill. It is there and I suggest in any examination of the problem now and in the future, which examination is overdue, it will have to take a long, hard, searching look both at direct and indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>That examination is urgently needed because I believe, without any fear of contradiction, there is an unanswerable case for a much wider and a much more equitable distribution of taxation as a whole, both direct and indirect.  I should like now, having said that, to look at the picture in reality and to suggest that we have got to recognise, if we are to have State services of various types, if we are to have, for example, health services for the lower income groups, if we are to have a better provision for education, health services and so on, that that sort of planning, that sort of thinking and that sort of provision can obviously only be provided by taxation.</P>
    <P>I say, on behalf of the Labour Party, that we readily accept this.  Our quarrel is not about the taxation which has to be raised but with the manner in which the taxation is imposed.  We believe the present system is grossly unfair, grossly inequitable and that it is long overdue for an overhaul.  I want to say in passing also that the present Minister or, for that matter, any of his predecessors have satisfied us so far that the present system of taxation is either fair or as fair as it ought to be or if it could be made fair if we had the will to do it.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that the time is both ripe and opportune for a complete review of our taxation system. From 1957, I think it was, until 1961, the Commission on Income Taxation sat and after much deliberation produced many valuable conclusions and many valuable recommendations. <Col N="1319" /> Not all of these have been either accepted or recommended; some of them have and some of them are still there on the record, and I am afraid with the pace of modern life as we find it, some of these are quite likely to be overlooked, if not forgotten.  I would suggest therefore that now is an opportune time for a similar type of commission to look at our entire tax structure, both direct, indirect as well as the special types of taxation such as rates and even social welfare.  This is the broad type of picture which has got to be looked at squarely and honestly if we are ever to arrive at equity and justice in this particular field.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest to the Minister that that is the type of review that ought to be undertaken and which, in fact, could only be undertaken in the Minister's own Department, activated by the Department and carried through with the facilities and information available to the Department.  I think the Minister would perform a most valuable national service if he were to initiate some such steps as these.</P>
    <P>In all fairness, I think, we have got to give the Minister full credit at least for his effort to introduce some very badly needed reforms and improvements. On behalf of the Labour Party I want to welcome the reliefs, minor though they are.  We fully recognise that even though these are minor they are very costly.  But I would suggest to the Minister that they are costly because the overall burden of taxation is so unevenly and so inequitably distributed.</P>
    <P>I, like the previous speaker, should like to welcome the Minister's approach to the exemption of writers and artists from income tax in certain brackets.  This is an imaginative gesture, which a person would be bound to welcome.  I think it is fortunate also that it will not result in any great loss of revenue but it will be a very considerable help and aid to the relatively small numbers of people involved.  This is the type of thinking that we ought to be doing on this problem of taxation.  I suggest that the Minister's imaginative approach to this particular aspect of taxation is one which he could well take example <Col N="1320" /> from and have a look at certain other factors to which I have alluded.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to note that in the Dáil yesterday as a result of an amendment put down by the Labour Party the Minister undertook to consider giving further assistance to the live theatre.  I believe this is both desirable and necessary because if financial assistance is not given to the live theatre in this country, and given very soon, the wealth of talent we have produced down the years&mdash;and, unfortunately, which we have to export &mdash;will go and in a short time the country will be denuded of much of that talent.  If we do not make some realistic attempt to recognise the problems which confront the live theatre and those which confront our young actors and actresses, then our reputation as a country which has always tried to cherish, promote and nourish the live theatre and all those who work in it, will be lost.  I personally regard the Minister's approach not only as imaginative but as a ray of hope in a very materialistic world and one for which he should be given full credit.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks to general points because I do not think we could hope to discuss the Finance Bill in this House in the atmosphere in which we are meeting tonight, with any real attempt at breaking it down into any detail.  I have tried to suggest, and I hope effectively, that two facts quite clearly emerge from the Finance Bill of 1969.  One is that our taxation system obviously needs to be overhauled; and two that in order to do that we should select and appoint competent people to do that job in an objective way, but above all in an honest approach to the solution of the problem. We have got to recognise that our taxation system is the key to the shaping of our society in the future. The question therefore arises as to whether the tax code as we know it today is either sufficiently comprehensive or sufficiently elastic to do the job it is intended to, and if you ask that question you must answer it in the negative.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that there is an unanswerable and social case for a capital gains tax in this country.  It could be one of the solutions to the overburden of taxation from which sections of our <Col N="1321" /> people are suffering at the present time. I believe my suggestion to the Minister is one which is pertinent, useful, and highly desirable at the present time.  I would urge the Minister as soon as the new Seanad has taken office to make use of the material that I am sure will be available in the House to assist him in his examination of this problem.  Whether we are here or outside those of us who know anything about it, will, I am sure, be only too happy to help.  These are my observations on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what the House would say if it could speak with one voice as to the essential and ideal qualities of a good budget.  I suppose most of us would say it should be just and fair to all citizens equally; it should be intelligent and realistic; efficient and honest.  But there is at least one other quality which makes a budget a distinguished budget.  It has been referred to already by previous Senators.  It is the quality of imagination&mdash;the quality which suddenly, out of the blue, after careful consideration, of course, produces an idea and a workable idea, which has not been introduced into a national budget for 20, 100 or a thousand years, perhaps. In fact, I am sure we are all very happy that the present Budget has such a feature.  Financially, it is a small thing.  But it has brought great credit to our nation in the press of the literate world.  I mean the clause which has been referred to by the two previous speakers&mdash;the clause that gives exemption to writers, artists and musicians for their creative work.  We have never had anything like this before.  We have had competent budgets, but we have never had this flash of imagination.  I wish we knew the history of this.  Some people say that it was the Minister himself who thought of it, while others say the idea came from his advisers and there are still others who say that the idea was suggested by a certain Irish writer.  But whoever made the suggestion was a man of imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has ever denied that the Irish have the gift of imagination.  But when people are paying us this compliment <Col N="1322" /> they usually add that we have this gift in a very impractical way.  We are said to be imaginative in literature and art, but not imaginative in the hard realities of life.  Here, however, we have a marriage of imagination and good financial sense.</P>
    <P>This is particularly apt in our country, and it has brought this country great credit throughout the world. Perhaps, however, I should declare some interest in praising this section. As the author of some books I have a certain curiosity about the section's interpretation.  But I do not speak just for myself in this matter.  I speak for what I hope the House considers a respectable class, the scholars of Ireland.  I remind the House that our most famous title refers to scholars as well as to saints, a title that goes right back to the time of Columbanus and to the time of Sedulius when the saints and scholars of this country were famous.  Perhaps the scholars are not so saintly any longer.  But at any rate there are a great many hard-working men in our universities and elsewhere who have produced works of scholarship&mdash;editions of the classics, histories, textbooks and so on&mdash;and they are particularly interested to know if their books will be regarded as coming within the meaning of the section as works of cultural merit.  I understand that this is to be left to the Revenue Commissioners.  I hope that in the light of our national history and in the light of the realities of the present day they will rule that works of scholarship are of cultural value.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to debate this section at length.  It has been debated and discussed with universal praise&mdash;this is something very unusual&mdash;in the public press and in the Dáil, with one lamentable suggestion.  I congratulate the Minister and his advisers on their imaginative decision which is bound to encourage the creative arts and which has already won us considerable credit abroad.</P>
    <P>I hope this will not be a flash in the pan and that it is the beginning of a series of imaginative clauses in our Finance Bills.  I hope, for example, that very soon some imaginative way will be thought for preserving our national heritage; that some imaginative way <Col N="1323" /> will be thought of to preserve our Georgian buildings in St. Stephen's Green; that something will be thought of to make our National Library worthy of its name.  When I go into the National Library, though I know how well they are doing within the resources at their disposal, I feel that it is a disgrace to this country that our National Library should be in that state.  We want something both imaginative and practical in this regard.</P>

      <P>You allowed Senator Crowley, Sir, to refer to the theatre, so may I underline his plea for an imaginative and constructive decision on that matter?</P>
      <P>I move now to a different point.  We all agree that Budgets should be honest. This Budget of ours, is, in so far as I can judge, an honest Budget.  But it accepts a kind of international dishonesty about which I should like to say a few words&mdash;a form of international dishonesty in which all the countries of Western Europe, North America and South America are conniving. I refer to the steady inflation, the steady decrease in the real value of the £.  We are all accepting this without a demur saying that it is inevitable and doing nothing about it.  But at least let us not be complacent about it, because it is dishonesty.  Why is it dishonest? Because the Government are encouraging people to invest their money in the post office, but some day the farmer from Kerry or the shopkeeper from Galway will go to the post office to take out £100 that he invested 20 years ago and what he will get will be only worth half the value.  So he is being cheated.  It is a form of bankruptcy. The Government and other organisations of the kind are paying only a percentage of their debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows best about that.  It is unfair to the people that we encourage them to <Col N="1324" /> save in the post office at the moment. What fools they would be.</P>
      <P>There is a remedy for this.  It was suggested in this House about 15 years ago by a previous Senator, Senator George O'Brien.  I have consulted economists about this and they tell me it would be workable.  The idea was that when a man puts £100 in the post office he would get it back at the time of withdrawal in terms of the real purchasing power of the £1.  That would be honest, and would encourage savings in a way in which no interest rate would encourage them.</P>
      <P>There is another reason why this is dishonest.  There are pensioners in this country who served the State well for 20 or 30 years and who at the time of retirement got what looked like a reasonable pension in 1945 or 1955.  Now it is barely a living pittance.</P>
      <P>This kind of thing is international dishonesty.  It has a demoralising effect throughout the world today.  It is tempting us all to be debtors for as long as possible.  It is subsidising the debts that Governments accumulate. The only way to stop it is to introduce some drastic measure.  I hope that the Minister will turn his imaginative and decisive attention to this problem.</P>
      <P>These, then, are the only points I wish to make, except to offer my congratulations to the Minister on bringing in a very successful Finance Bill.  In conclusion, as these will probably be my last remarks in the Seanad, may I say that I shall always value my 21 years as a representative of Dublin University in this House as a high honour and as a salutary part of my education as an Irish citizen.  I shall not develop that, but I mean it.  It would be out of order for me to say more.  I shall simply affirm my belief&mdash;against a good deal of opposition outside this House&mdash;that the Seanad has done, and will continue to do, much for the welfare of this country.  I am proud to have shared in its debates for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief on this Finance Bill.  There are just one or two points which I should like to make.  Perhaps I might say at the outset, on behalf of myself and of other Senators, how much I regret the <Col N="1325" /> imminent departure from this House of Professor Stanford.</P>
      <P>The part of the Finance Bill which I wish to discuss is not the most important part from the point of view of the amount of money involved or from the point of view of the effect it will have on the country's economy but it certainly represents the part of the Budget which will be remembered for generations long after the circumstances of the present day have been forgotten.  I refer to the concession to writers, painters and sculptors which the Minister has brought in.  Others have said that this is an imaginative and extraordinary step.  It is unusual to get a concession from the Minister which has not been pressed for by various lobbies of the public.  It is more unusual to get one as far-reaching as this one.</P>
      <P>In view of the munificence of the Minister's gesture, it might seem unreasonable of me to press for a change in this which I think would be an improvement.  The change could not be made this year but I would ask the Minister to consider it between now and the date of the Budget next year. This concession is given to living writers, painters and sculptors.  I am anxious about the widow of a writer who finds herself bereft and the income of the family certainly goes down because there are no new works coming along.  She will find herself faced, for the first time in many years, with a demand for income tax since the concession in the Finance Bill only refers to living artists, painters and sculptors.</P>
      <P>I have an interest which is not personal in this.  I say there could be no conceivable justification for a general exemption from tax of copyrights after the death of an author or performing rights in the case of others.  In the case of a widow it might be considered whether in reference to copyrights or performing rights the exemption from taxation might be extended to her.  In considering a widow there is also the question of orphans.  It might be considered whether in the case of copyrights owned by children in full-time education they might come under the provisions of this exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a case for extending the <Col N="1326" /> class of people who benefit.  It is merely extending the time in which a section of them might continue to benefit.  I would be against the case made for bringing in whole new classes.  To bring in an extension of this kind might make the whole thing collapse, which would be a tragedy.  The Minister might consider the question of the wodows or orphans who suddenly find themselves, at a time when family finances were not as good as they had been, faced with demands for income tax.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which people have mentioned to me.  The suggestion has been made that perhaps this tax concession in the case of writers would only be given to what are described as inoffensive, establishment writers, and that there might be a sinister financial censorship and that writers who offend might not be counted at writers of cultural value.  I am in no doubt whatever that the Minister's view is that if the writer is a writer of ability and of great literary merit the nature of his writings, whether offensive or not&mdash;and whether people like them or not&mdash;should not come into it.  People have made this suggestion. The Minister might care to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on the Finance Bill.  It seems to me that this question of exemption from taxation is so new and so fundamental in its nature and of such interest to writers, painters and sculptors all over the world that it is a step of the greatest importance and one which may well be copied by others.  The Minister's munificence may not have an effect here alone but may affect artists and writers all over the world.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill and on this provision in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching the general debate, I should like to begin by making a plea for reconsideration of the facilities for debate in this Chamber.  A reversal to the old system of handling Government debates here would be a great improvement. The Finance Bill is the only one which has retained its place.  The opportunity we had on the Vote on Account in March of each year of having a valuable opportunity of discussing <Col N="1327" /> Government policy following the publication of the Book of Estimates is gone.  The Seanad always had an excellent debate on that.  We cannot in this Bill tonight discuss the details of administration.  This is what we are vitally interested in and where we have our main disagreements with the Government in the sharing out of the national cake and the amounts given to various bodies under various headings. We cannot discuss it now.</P>
      <P>Previously we could discuss it within two weeks of this in the Appropriation Bill.  We will not get an opportunity until perhaps next Christmas of discussing these matters. At that stage we will have no hope or opportunity of influencing Government policy in the following Budget. We are rather long suffering in the Seanad.  When we speak on a measure we take it for granted that we will not influence the measure before the House very much, but we are hoping always that we can influence the following measure.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in speaking on a Finance Bill we are trying really to throw out suggestions and ideas that might influence the following Finance Bill, and in the case of the Appropriations Bill that will affect the distribution of the finances between the various Departments and the various bodies.  Now coming next Christmas there is no hope of that.  This hope is rendered more nugatory by the recent Government decision, which I do not think has been very well publicised yet, that all Estimates for the following fiscal year have to be in on the 1st of June of the previous year, so that there is little use in speaking and hoping to influence the Budget for next March, speaking next December, when the Estimates have to be in on the 1st of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the Leader of the House and the Government to try to see can something be done about this. Can we get some opportunity of having a timely word on the distribution of the national cake as shown in the Book of Estimates?  A compromise might be to agree to have a debate on a motion <Col N="1328" /> in July, seeing that the Appropriation Bill is not then available, that Seanad Éireann notes the Book of Estimates. If the debate were held at that time with two or three days allocated to it then the following Bill could be taken without debate in December.  That might get over the situation, but the present situation is completely ludicrous. I am appealing for an end to that.</P>
    <P>To return to the present Finance Bill, in dealing with a Finance Bill when you are not in the Government Party or in the Government you can of course advocate all sorts of concessions and reliefs and so on and you do not have to worry about providing the money.  The unfortunate position that every Finance Minister finds himself in is that he can see the necessity for most of the reliefs but money has to be provided to meet those.  We will try to be realistic on it, and we welcome what has been given, especially the slight increase in personal allowances. It is very little but yet is costs £3½ million&mdash;£15 to a married man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>£30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>£30 to a married man and £15 to a single man.  That does not of course restore the position to what the personal allowance was ten years ago, making due allowance for the depreciation of money meantime, yet we welcome what has been given and we hope that the next Finance Bill may produce something more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We look to the Finance Bill now more as an instrument of fiscal policy. It is there I think that we can profitably contribute to the Bill by suggesting ways and means that can succeed in shaping our economy.  The first thing that we have to recognise is that the Government are very much influenced&mdash;and I think rightly so&mdash;by the National Industrial Economic Council.  They give their reports periodically and they are always worth reading, challenging, usually pretty straightforward in their thinking and so on. Indeed we have often tried to get discussions going in this House on their reports but very often the motions <Col N="1329" /> stand on the Order Paper long after the report has lost its value.</P>
    <P>I again have to return to this, that this Council have in some mysterious way been caught up in the conflict between the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and the result is that agriculture, our main industry, producing more than 30 per cent of the national income, is not represented on the National Industrial Economic Council.  I appeal to the Minister at the start of a new Government to right this as soon as possible, because its recommendations on agriculture are always wrong, because it has no faith or belief in agriculture, and it has not the type of faith or belief that every practising instructor in agriculture and every good agriculturist has.  It does not put agriculture in its proper perspective as the one facet of our economy that is capable of great expansion if only we are courageous enough to face the task of that expansion.  So I appeal to the Minister to right that.</P>
    <P>Also I think that the Minister could broaden out that Council by seeing that provincial opinion is available there, because by and large another criticism I would make of their reports and findings is that they are very centralised, very Dublin-centred, and in general I do not think that they reflect in an adequate manner the contribution that the provinces can make.  In that regard I think that the Minister might look at the personnel available in the provinces and see if these cannot be included to broaden that.  I know that the Minister by a rather imaginative stroke of his went against all this outside Dublin to Galway to produce the head for the Science Council.  Where he has been found there are other men who have a great contribution to make to a body like the NIEC.</P>
    <P>Any discussion on taxation leading to a fair measure of redistribution of incomes brings out the necessity for a prices and incomes policy.  It is now four years since we had a long and very worthwhile debate in Seanad Éireann on the necessity for a prices and incomes policy.  We have had <Col N="1330" /> many reports and yet we got no action. I know that the subject is an exceedingly complex one.  You have to steer between a completely regimented and as it were planned approach to this and our present chaotic approach which like the maintenance men's strike really depends on the pressure a group can exert.  I appeal to the Minister again at the start of this new period that perhaps by the autumn we might see the beginning of a proper prices and incomes policy.  The NIEC have written quite extensively on this, and the recent issues of the <i>Banking Review</i> have again come out quite strongly on this as the only firm basis on which we can base our economy in the future.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's Dáil statement that the Government expect quite shortly to have a general review of the Free Trade Area Agreement which has run 3½ years.  I think that its impact on our economy can be weighed at this stage and we should seek to modify it.  At all times I have held that it was the best that we could get at the time and that those who negotiated it were to be complimented on it, set as it was in the expectation of free trade in the 70s and entry into the Common market in the 70s also.</P>
    <P>Those two realisations are not quite as near as they appeared to be then. Also we have the fact that twice when it pleased Britain she broke the terms of this Agreement.  It was not called breaking, still by any other name it means breaking the terms, and consequently we are in a strong position in going to negotiate and we should be able when the time comes probably to bring results.  In that regard we have in the Free Trade Area Agreement and the reduction of tariffs the main door to the entry of British goods into our market.  I do not want to develop that here too much, but it calls for some revitalising of the Buy Irish Campaign.  I wonder whether the Minister can bend our fiscal policy to achieving that, because at present the Buy Irish Campaign is an absolute dead letter.  Very careful steps are taken in most of the stores to camouflage the foreign origin of the <Col N="1331" /> goods displayed and 70 to 80 per cent of the housewives have no idea for the most part that they are buying foreign goods.  I reckon that correcting that is a No. 1 priority in trying to right our position and our balance of trade.</P>
    <P>What is done here from the point of view of the rights of widows and dependent children amounts really to just a little bit of tidying up.  I do not think it amounts to anything more than that.  It certainly does not go any distance to meet the strong case we made last year and the year before for the mitigation of the impact of death duties on a widow with a family.  We have shown the iniquity of the capitalised value of the pension accruing to the widow.  If a widow is left a pension of £2,000 a year and she is 70 years of age, according to the life expectancy tables she has only about four years to live and that means that she will probably draw on average only four pensions; the present value of those four pensions is something around four times £2,000&mdash;slightly less; £7,500 &mdash;but, if she is a young widow, aged 35, with young children, then she is held to have a life expectancy of about 33 years and the estate is increased by the full present value of the £2,000 received each year for the next 33 years.  It would not be exactly 33 times £2,000; it would be about 12 to 14 times £2,000.</P>
    <P>That increases the estate by about £24,000 and can easily move it into the higher income category.  In response to appeals here and elsewhere, the Minister did try to mitigate this situation by giving allowances for dependent children off the death duties.  These were increased very substantially last year. But the main problem still exists, this aggregation of pensions or insurance. If the State cannot see its way to remitting the tax on these sums they should at least arrange for the tax to be paid each year instead of imposing the full sum on the unforunate widow at the very worst possible moment, within six months of the death of her husband.  The tax could be on a pay-as-you-live basis which would mean that it would be paid each year on the £2,000.  I trust the Minister will come <Col N="1332" /> back to us next year with this next instalment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remission of tax in the case of artists, writers and so on, presumably one of the motivating factors in this is the uncertaibty of income.  While these people may earn a good deal one year the following year may be a very lean one.  This is a generous gesture on the part of the Government.  There are others besides artists and writers in a similar position and I think the important thing to do from the point of view of our taxation code is to ensure that it does level out. I would also like to think that the income tax paid would form the basis for earning the right to a pension, a contributory pension, so that those with uncertain incomes would have the assurance that what they contributed in the heyday of their earning power would entitle them to consideration in the future and to a pension afterwards and the &ldquo;afterwards&rdquo; should really begin to operate when their incomes fall to pre-determined levels.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Stanford in his plea for a broadening out in the case of writers.  Writers in science or ain education should certainly qualify and this should really have been spelled out as artistic, cultural or educational.  They are not mutually exclusive terms.  We are short of textbooks and every inducement and encouragement should be given to those with the ability and the energy to spend the time necessary compiling these books.  The available market is a small one and no writer could make any large fortune out of such textbooks.  I agree there should be a broadening out here.</P>
    <P>There is this imaginative approach, this variation of tax to achieve a specific end.  We have it in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  The industries there get certain tax remissions which have now been extended up to 1990.  There is the same idea in the export tax relief system. This is designed to encourage industry.  However, we should not confine ourselves to the factory floor.  On occasions here we have appealed for a more imaginative approach towards attracting back retired people to live here.  We have much to offer such <Col N="1333" /> people.  If the Government would make imaginative tax concessions to these people I think we would get a great number of them.  They would, of course, need special amenities and personal social services.  The late Father Coyne, who was President of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, had a pet scheme for attracting retired people to the Bantry-Glengarriff area. He felt it could do a great deal for that area which had its climate to offer. Provided the organisation of a personal service matched up then it could really provide a great deal.  I see the Minister is smiling.  I hope he was not at the Olympia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  If the Deputy is talking about attracting retired people we have already provided that pensions will be free of tax here if they are not liable to tax in the country of origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you should go further.  You could be selective: take a few areas and provide certain personal and social services, which could be on call in the area, and so on, and other services that would make life more pleasant.  There are many people in England and America who would be induced to come if that was the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most pensions are taxable in those countries, are they not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If we exempted a pension which is taxable in the country of origin we would simply be making a present of that tax to the revenue in that country.  The two important types of pension with which we are concerned are the Social Security Pensions and the Railway Retirement Pensions in America which are not liable to tax in the US.  They are exempt here if the people who receive them come and live here.  It is another one of my enlightened proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly needs to be organised on a community basis and needs to be pursued strongly really to attract those people here.  Another matter to which I want to refer is the recent increase in borrowing abroad and about which I am a little uneasy. I am not talking merely about foreign subscribers to Government loans and so on, but the various semi-State bodies and other concerns doing some of their financing by external borrowing.  In an earlier Bill we had Aerlínte being financed to the extent of £28 million, presumably by borrowing from abroad. We may say that is testimony to the soundness of our economy if we can get money from abroad, but I want to look at it from the point of view of cost to the country and in the situation where at present we have interest rates of 8½ per cent and 9 per cent prevailing.  The interest is a very great burden on our national loans.  At least if the interest is paid to an Irish person here it is part of the person's income and it is used to buy Irish products and meets the various tax laws, whether it is the tax on petrol or on drink or the wholesale tax.  The result is that of the £9 that the person gets in interest on each £100 about 40 per cent, or £3 10s, ultimately finds its way into the Exchequer again.  The Exchequer gives out £9 and gets back £3 10s so that <Col N="1335" /> it is at a net loss of £5 10s.  On the other hand, if that payment was made to somebody outside the country, if the money was borrowed from abroad, there is no money coming back to the Exchequer from it.  In point of fact we get say 14 per cent paid to an Irish person and when you subject that to the tax laws about 40 per cent would find its way back to the Exchequer, or almost £6, leaving 8 per cent to 8½ per cent, so that the cost to the Exchequer in paying 14 per cent to an Irish lender, is the same as paying 8½ per cent to 9 per cent to a foreign lender.  That should bring home to us the cost of foreign borrowing.  We should make every effort to get more of our needs at home through a greatly increased savings campaign.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that we should start paying 12 per cent or 14 per cent at home because we cannot disturb the equilibrium of the economy. It is being disturbed enough at the moment because you have last year's Exchequer loan at 8 per cent being quoted at present at 96 or 96½.  Perhaps it may be possible to combine both the national and social objectives by having attractive schemes aimed at the small investor.  One does not mind giving the small investor additional rates or additional advantages in order to encourage him to save more.  I should like the Minister to say what is the level of our foreign borrowing at the moment.  My figure suggests that it is between £30 million and £40 million, but it is probably higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to feel that we could reach out to the small people for more. We could look for savings from the overtime earnings of some workers in our factories.  The only solution is to run those idle factories for longer hours.  That is the only way in which the purchasing power of the vast bulk of our workers will be increased and yet not disturb the cost of production. Out of those increased earnings the State might hope, by giving tax reliefs on a certain amount of overtime within certain categories, to attract savings directly or through workers acquiring shares in the company. Either way the money would be put to work productively for the community <Col N="1336" /> rather than having it spent on consumer goods.  That is something that could well challenge the ingenuity of the Minister, to come up with a scheme to meet those double objectives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, I would appeal also in relation to this matter of getting industrial efficiency.  Agriculture is not represented and again it is not having the impact it should have.  Many of our bodies sound well but judged by their performance they are not matching up to what is required. I will end by asking the Minister to reform the NIEC as a first prerequisite to getting a proper prices and incomes policy in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now discussing the Bill which is intended to legalise the provisions of the Budget.  A lot of debate went into the section of the Budget which was regarded as an innovation granting reliefs to artists, writers, composers and sculptors for creative work.  I consider that it is a humanitarian section more than anything else.  There are not many people engaged in this activity who earn the kind of money that would involve substantial tax on income.  Many creative artists have very low earnings for very many years.  An artist might go five years before he would succeed in producing something creative.  He might go five years before he would hit the jackpot in one year and then his earnings for that year would be taxed but he would have had four or five lean years before that and would not have been taxable on his income.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know, for instance, and it may be possible for the Minister to make out a list now, the number of creative artists, writers, composers and sculptors who were taxed annually or even once in the last few years and then we could assess how much, in fact, it will cost the Exchequer to grant this new relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the relief in money terms, as far as the nation is concerned, will be substantial.  There are a few creative artists and composers who earn substantial money but <Col N="1337" /> the vast majority of these creative artists only occasionally succeed in getting a substantial return for their work.  For that reason I think it is a humanitarian clause taking into consideration the fact that these people in most cases have many lean years before they may have a success.  Taking it over a number of years, on the average, the relief will not be substantial. Of course, it is encouraging to those people to be told that they are being recognised as creative artists by the fact that there is a special section in the Finance Bill to relieve them of the payment of taxes in relation to their earnings on creative work.</P>
    <P>We are discussing now the election Budget of 1969.  It was described as such and it was designed in good time for the election campaign and the Minister is to be congratulated on having designed a very popular Budget.  But, in money terms, what is the meaning of this Budget?</P>

      <P>He has used £8 million of the taxpayers' money for political party purposes.  The canvassers went from door to door.  A canvasser, going to the doorstep of a house where the housewife and six children were living, told them how much this Budget would mean to that family and then went to the next house where there were pensioners to tell them what this Budget would mean to them.  Of course, in each case they were told that Fianna Fáil were giving them this money.  It is the taxpayers' money, subscribed, in fact, by those very people whom they interviewed at their doorsteps, that is being given out.  It is proposed to give out £8 million.  We are discussing a Finance Bill now which is intended to collect £12 million.  The distribution of the £8 million at the doorsteps was very successful but the canvassers forgot to mention that, in fact, the Budget <Col N="1338" /> intends to collect £12 million from the same people or their neighbours in the form of one tax or other.</P>
      <P>Of course, these people who will benefit by the distribution of this £8 million of their own money will pay back a very substantial amount of it in other taxes&mdash;taxes on their drink, their cigarettes, their entertainment and all the other items that are taxed in his Bill.  There are 65 sections in this Bill and there is a trap in every one of these sections to take money in one way or another from the classes of people affected by the sections.  Let us see the Budget for what it is.</P>
      <P>Now I am going to criticise the Government for the fact that, with the Budget increasing substantially from one year to another&mdash;it is nearly £400 million that our 2¾ million people, including infants and aged persons, are going to subscribe this year in the form of taxation towards the running of this little country&mdash;the Government have made no attempt so far in respect of the recommendations of the NIEC to design and implement a prices and incomes policy.</P>
      <P>Are we going to drift on as we have been, watching the value of the £ fall annually?  In the last 12 months the value of the £ fell by 1s, approximately. The purchasing power of the £ fell in 12 months by 5 per cent. It has fallen by 10s since 1948.  Twenty shillings in 1948 is worth only 10s 4d now.  The fall in the value of money continues but no effort is made by the Government to preserve the value of the £.  This fall in money values affects most severely people who are on small fixed pensions.  The Government have made no attempt to protect those people against the steep increases in prices.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that no attempt is being made by the Government to control price incrases.  In the shops the price of an article goes up this week and the Government do nothing about it.  The following week the price goes up again and still there is no action on the part of the Government.  There is no regulation of prices and these prices must be met out of the earnings or income of the people who are purchasing the article.</P>

      <P>Sorry.  Every year we see an increase in Government expenditure. If we examine the statistics, we shall see that the number of people at work is less than the number who were working this time 12 months ago and apparently the number of people in employment continues to fall.  Apparently, the Government take no interest at all in trying to ensure that the number of people in employment will be increased: they are satisfied to see a reduction in employment.</P>
      <P>Emigration continues.  There are anything up to 60,000 registered unemployed persons seeking work.  The taxation at the moment, at between £300 million and £400 million, is approximately one-third of the total earnings of the community.  It is a very substantial charge on the earnings of the people.  Approximately 6s 8d out of every £1 earned by the people is taken back from them in the form of taxation one way or another.</P>

    <P>The national debt has reached approximately £1,000 million.  We are not satisfied merely to beg, borrow and steal in every possible way within our <Col N="1340" /> community here: we borrow the balance outside this country one way and another.</P>
    <P>In the past and up to the present, we have had a system of financing the capital programme with the aid of national loans.  In his Budget statement, the Minister indicated his capital programme but did not indicate how this capital programme would be paid for.</P>

      <P>If the Minister did so, I am sorry that I did not notice it. If the Minister did mention that he proposes to float a loan for the purpose of financing the capital programme, I am sorry if I missed that point.</P>
      <P>Up to the present, people have been investing their money in national loans. As soon as they have invetsed it there, at very attractive terms, the value of their money is not protected because the purchasing power of the £ is not protected.  It was allowed to drop one shilling in the past 12 months.  There is nothing in the agreement with those people who subscribe to the national loan to assure them that the £ they subscribed in 1968 will be of the same value when it is redeemed.  We have reached a stage now when that guarantee or undertaking will have to be given to people who are asked to subscribe to the financing of capital programmes.  They cannot continue to subscribe to our national loans without these assurances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This raises the point as to whether the Irish £ sterling should be tied to any particular currency&mdash;the dollar, the German Mark or any other of the currencies.  At the present time, with a policy pursued by the Government of allowing things to drift, in the absence of a prices and incomes policy, no attempt is being made to protect the value of the £.  The result, of course, is that the price of house property in this country is now equal to or higher than the price of similar property in England.  Much of the money being invested in Irish property&mdash;whether it be houses, offices or land&mdash;is foreign money.  It has certainly upset the <Col N="1341" /> situation for Irish citizens who would be interested in purchasing these houses and property.</P>
    <P>The cost of land has gone up very considerably.  Probably it has gone up in anticipation of entry into EEC.  If that is the case, I think the interests of Irish citizens should be protected.  I suggest their interests should be protected by a very substantial tax&mdash;possibly up to 50 per cent&mdash;on the purchase of land in this country by non-nationals. The first of this exercise began when talk of our entry into EEC was around.  Central Europeans &mdash;I might describe them as Germans, Belgians, Dutch and possibly Danes&mdash; looking at the price per acre of land in their own country, decided they would come to this country and purchase Irish land in anticipation of our entry into EEC, because of course the cost of land in Europe was at least four times as high as the cost of Irish land at the time.  Now this price in relation to the Common Market countries has moved up towards that level and before we find a situation where Irish land is snapped up by so may non-nationals we should do something about it.  I would mention that non-nationals usually interested in large holdings. There are many small farmers, congests, uneconomic land holders in this country seeking an opportunity to become owners of Irish land with the aid of the Land Commission or other financial means provided by the State but there is no attempt made effectively to discourage the purchase of Irish land by non-nationals.  These uneconomic holders, small farmers, congests and the like have no chance of having their hopes of getting land realised. I feel this should be stopped immediately by the imposition of a very heavy tax so far as the purchase if Irish land by non-nationals is concerned.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get into the Common Market, for good or ill.  I am sure that will depend on ourselves to a very great extent but we could find ourselves in great difficulty economically when we do go into the Common Market if we are not geared for it. We may find that we are not able to compete in the agricultural and industrial fields and of course the provisions <Col N="1342" /> of the Treaty of Rome will ensure that all countries are equal within that market when it comes to competition for agricultural or industrial prices, output and conditions.  I feel that with this prospect in view our Government should ensure that the investment of foreign money in land and houses in anticipation of entry into the Common Market should be controlled in addition to being discouraged by the application of very heavy taxes, much more than the nominal taxes which apply at present.</P>
    <P>At the moment 2¾ million Irish people are contributing between three and a half hundred million and four hundred million pounds towards the running of this little country and the people who subscribe from their week's wages are actually contributing nearly £70 million of that.  Seventy million pounds of that is being taken out of their wage packets.  The Minister in his budget gave a tax concession of £15 to a single man and £40 to a married man and stated that this would relieve 30,000 persons.  Of course as soon as those people receive an increase in wages or if they work overtime or get any other kind of increase such as a bonus in their earnings the tax will go back almost immediately.  Anyway, that relief amounted to only £3.5 million out of a total of £70 million being subscribed at the moment.  We know that if wages go up by, say, 5 per cent which results perhaps in an increase of £10 million in wages and then 5s 3d PAYE tax is taken off that there is immediately a very substantial contribution under this PAYE system and it certainly obliterates the £3.5 million relief.</P>
    <P>One bone of contention with people who pay PAYE is that no allowance is made for the person who must travel a long distance to his or her work. There are people travelling 70 miles a day to and from their work and there is no allowance made.  For instance, there are builders' labourers travelling from Navan to Dublin and from the Midlands to Dublin every morning by car and back again in the evening and no allowance is made for that.  Those people would not travel from Navan to Dublin if they could get employment around the corner.  For that reason travelling expenses should <Col N="1343" /> be recognised and allowances made under the PAYE scheme for those people.</P>
    <P>I have much more to say on this but I shall reserve it for the Committee Stage.</P>

I regret to see that once more the iniquitous Finance Act of 1965 has been retained in our legislation.  That is the Bill which was designed to raid the thrift of those who decided to protect their wives and families against the ravages of the estate duty system. Those people took out insurance policies to cover the cost of the estate duty after their deaths which would leave their families in much the same position as before those persons died. The situation now is that the insurance policy taken out to protect that estate is put in with the estate and counted for <Col N="1344" /> taxation purposes.  It was obviously improper and I felt that at some stage since 1965 this provision would have been repealed but it is still there.  It means that people are not given a chance by means of insurance to protect their wives and families against this very heavy tax.  Frequently successive deaths in a family cause very great hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the discussion has taken place on section 2 of the Bill which I think has become fairly popularly known now as the artistic provision. I should like to mention briefly that in so far as we are trying to improve what has now become fairly commonly known as the quality of living or quality of life, the Budget in fact contains three measures of some importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we all agree in the Oireachtas that as our economic programme continues, and as we seem to be able to achieve greater economic expansion and development, we must devote more and more time to ensuring that the way in which our people live is constantly improved and that they are enabled to lead fuller, better and more satisfying lives.  That is what is behind the three provisions I mentioned. Section 2 is fairly obvious in its intent but there are two other measures which, perhaps, have been to some extent overlooked.  One is the setting aside of an initial sum of £100,000 for the provision of better sporting and recreational facilities for the young and the provision contained in section 64, <Col N="1346" /> which is designed to encourage employers to provide such facilities for those who work for them.</P>
    <P>I should like also to remind the House that these three measures simply carry on a tradition which we have established over a number of years of trying in each Budget and Finance Bill to do something to make a contribution towards the objective I have been discussing.  The measures which we introduced to provide free transport and free electricity for the old people in their own way made a substantial contribution towards improving life for a very large and important section of our people.  I mention these matters to assure the House that the Government are aware that it is necessary in this age to make better provision for leisure and to do what we can to help people towards a fuller and better way of life generally.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Stanford has announced that he will no longer be a Member of this House because I feel that not alone intellectually but also visually he contributed to making the Seanad a more distinguished place. I might perhaps on this occasion of farewell also remind him of the happy occasion when with some assistance from me he put through a Private Member's Bill of some significance.  I shall always remember the considerable Parliamentary skill and the dedication which he exhibited on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I am interested in Senator Yeats' point in connection with section 2 in regard to widows and it is something I shall keep in mind and look at on another occasion.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge made a plea that we should continue on a course of reform on budgetary machinery and I assure him we shall do that.  In fact, we hope to do a substantial amount of work during the remainder of the year in this area.  We are also looking at the possibility of devising, to some extent, multi-annual budgets with a reasonable tolerance both on the expenditure and taxation sides.  The Senat or spoke about the achievements of scientists and engineers in our day and, of course, he is quite right.  I do not think, however, we could ever achieve any sort of inbuilt stability in <Col N="1347" /> the economy in the way it is done in those scientific type of programmes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, while we in this country could never hope to put a man on the noon, I might remind the House that we have here an asset of our own which is very distinctively ours, that is, a tradition of intellectual endeavour. I think this is true.  I am more and more convinced of this fact.  Our people have, for some reason I am unable to fathom, a great reserve of natural intelligence and a great propensity to achieve intellectual excellence.  Perhaps we could, if we devoted more of our time and effort to it, make a contribution to the world in this sphere and, perhaps, modestly give a lead to other countries not only in what we produced in the intellectual sphere, but in the arrangements we made for the development of a sympathetic intellectual environment here for our people. This Government will keep this in mind continuously as an objective.  I do not think there is anything to prevent us doing this.  We may not have the material resources with which to achieve the spectacular things other countries can achieve but, perhaps, if we persist, we can quiently create here a sort of community which in its culture and intellectual excellence would be a very satisfactory place for Irish people to live in, in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley made what he called an unanswerable case for a capital gains tax.  I must very strenuously disagree with him.  The Commission on Income Taxation, a very representative and impartial body, having examined this matter very fully, concluded that the disadvantages associated with such a tax were so enormous that they would have to recommend against it. It has not been very successful in Britain.  In fact, it has produced very little revenue and that very fact would indicate that, as a potential for redistributing income in the community, it is of very limited use.  I am satisfied that, in our circumstances, a capital gains tax has not very much to offer to us.  Indeed, it could be positively disadvantageous in a number of ways.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford talked about inflation. Of course we are all very much <Col N="1348" /> aware that the world today is in a serious inflationary spiral.  Unfortunately, because we have an openended economy, we cannot escape the over-flow of that world wide movement. The nations of the earth seem to be singularly unable to agree on sensible international monetary policies. It seems this is an area in which it is very difficult to get any improvements agreed between the different nations. We will continue to do what we can in the international monetary councils of the world to try to improve the situation. I am not at all optimistic.  From what I have seen of the way things have been developing in recent years, there does not seem to be any great deal of international commonsense in this area, whatever about other areas.</P>
    <P>The remedy Senator Stanford proposed, a simple remedy, I am afraid is not one I would regard as being very effective&mdash;that of tying loans and borrowings to the cost of living.  That was tried in Finland and they had to give it up.  Indeed, it seems that one could argue that this very device, in itself, generated inflationary pressures.  That was their experience in Finland.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Quinlan, we have a very dedicated and energetic voluntary Savings Committee which is all the time looking for new methods of encouraging savings.  There is now a very wide range of media available to the public to encourage them to place their savings at the disposal of the community.  Any additional incentives which appeared to me to be desirable would be adopted.  If Senator Quinlan can suggest anything of a practical natural I will, by all means, consider it.</P>
    <P>I think these were the main points raised.  Perhaps I might mention that Senator Rooney seems to have put himself in the unfortunate and unenviable position of being practically the only representative who spoke in grudging terms about the provision in regard to artists and others.  He more or less missed the point of the whole thing.  This is very largely an effort to create a sympathetic environment and the amount of money involved one way or another is not at all important.</P>

      <P>It does not matter what it costs or does not cost.  It is the spirit which motivated it that matters and that is what will bring us the greatest benefits.</P>
      <P>To come back again to the opening speaker, Senator Dooge&mdash;and I think most of us would agree that he made a very good speech on this Finance Bill &mdash;he said he hoped we would be able to devise new and better methods of budgeting and better techniques, more in line with the age in which we live. He seemed to suggest we should throw the traditional methods overboard and develop something new and, I think he said, imaginative.  I do not think that would be too easy.  I do not think it will ever be possible to come up with policies in the financial field which will be universally acclaimed as suitable, desirable, attractive or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The harsh reality of the situation is that the Government have to achieve certain social and other purposes, and, <Col N="1350" /> to achieve them, they have to interfere with the situation of a vast number of citizens.  No matter what methods or techniques are devised, that basic unpleasantness will remain at the root of all financial and fiscal policies.  We will always have to take money from some people in order to give it to others or to devote it to some desirable ends.  When I say that, I want to make sure that no one thinks it is simply a matter of suddenly, overnight, devising beautiful and attractive and acceptable new policies.  But I do not despair of being able continuously to improve matters.  We are always looking at the whole taxation structure and we shall look at it much more keenly in the next few years and, I would hope, overhaul it.  Whether people will subsequently call that a radical overhaul or not is something I cannot envisage at this stage, but certainly we intend to have a good try at bringing the whole system of taxation into line with the requirements and demands of a modern developing community such as ours is. That is the furthest I could go in replying to Senator Dooge's interesting speech on this measure and his appeal with regard to future Budgets.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan is still here and I could not help thinking as he was speaking that the only thing he was short of suggesting was that we would give out a few Green Shield stamps with every £1 of income tax we collected.</P>
