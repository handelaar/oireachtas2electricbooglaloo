      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Go dtoghfar an Seanadóir Micheál Yeats sa Chathaoir agus go rachaidh sé i gceannas an tSeanaid anois mar Chathaoirleach.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tá sé de onóir agam ainm Micheál Yeats a chur os comhair an tSeanaid chun é a thoghadh mar Chathaoirleach ar an Teach seo.</P>
      <P>I have the honour to propose the name of Senator Michael Yeats as a fit and proper person to occupy the Chair of Seanad Éireann.  I have no doubt that the name of Michael Yeats is well known not alone to the Members of the Seanad but to the people of Ireland generally and to people far from the shores of Ireland.  He is a man of great dignity and culture and he has taken a great interest in the parliamentary work of this country. He is, in my opinion, that rarity of being a born parliamentarian, that is that he not alone attends to his parliamentary duties but he takes an active and a vigilant interest in every piece of printed material which emanates from the Stationery Office and from either House of the Oireachtas.  Michael Yeats is a regular attender at meetings of the Seanad of which he has been a Member for many years.</P>
      <P>For the information of Senators, I recall that he is the distinguished son of a distinguished father.  His father, William Butler Yeats, was a member of the first Seanad and his reputation is world wide.  I am happy to say that just in the same way as his distinguished father did, Michael Yeats has made a name for himself not alone in Ireland but in countries in the New World, on the Continent and as far away as Japan.  He has a knowledge of law, having graduated from Trinity College, Dublin and he has studied the procedures and Standing Orders of this House.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that Michael Yeats is competent to administer the duties of Chairman in a manner that will give satisfaction to every Member of the House.  He has the levelheadedness, the even temper and the broadness of vision which are required of a chairman who is to be the impartial comptroller of discipline and good order in this House.</P>
      <P>In electing Senator Michael Yeats to be Cathaoirleach of the Seanad for the next period of this Seanad, we shall not alone be doing an honour to the Senator himself but we shall also be doing a good day's work for the House in electing the man who I believe to be one of the best possible choices that we could make for that position. It is with confidence that I ask the members of Seanad Éireann to elect Senator Michael Yeats as Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba maith liom cuidiú leis an dtairiscint seo.  Níl aon dabht ar domhan ach go ndéanfaidh Micheál Yeats a dhícheall dualgaisí na h-árd oifige seo a chomlíonadh mar is ceart. Tá mé cinnte go n-oibreoidh sé go dian, dícheallach, dúthrachtach chun go mbeidh cothram na Féinne le fáil ag gach éinne.  Tá súil agam go gcuideoidh gach Seanadóir leis an tairiscint seo, agus guím gach beannacht ar obair an Chathaoirligh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I, in the course of seconding this resolution, pay a personal tribute <Col N="9" /> to Senator Michael Yeats?  He has the incisiveness of mind, the clarity of expression, the firmness of purpose and, above all, the tolerance which are essential for a good Cathaoirleach.  I hope that the Seanad will accept this resolution unanimously.  I have no doubt that Senator Michael Yeats will win and retain the respect of all of us as Cathaoirleach and that, therefore, we shall one and all, at all times, and without question, accept his rulings, thereby adding to our own stature and winning and retaining the respect of the nation for our Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it has been the practice in recent years in the Seanad that the Cathaoirleach be drawn from among those Members in the House who support the Government. I should like to say quite clearly that we in the Fine Gael Party do not regard that as a precedent which should be binding in all circumstances but we appreciate that the practice exists and it is not a practice that we propose to interfere with on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I understand also that the procedure of this House differs somewhat from the procedure in the other House in that when divisions are taken here it is not the invariable practice that the Cathaoirleach should be in the Chair but that it is the usual procedure and understanding that if a vote is concerned with a matter of confidence in the Government or an important matter involving Government policy that the Chair on all such occasions will be occupied by the Cathaoirleach. As far as I am concerned and as far as Fine Gael are concerned we must record that that is the procedure and that that procedure should continue in practice during the lifetime of this Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin referred quite properly to the distinguished father of Senator Yeats, who is the Government nominee for position of Cathaoirleach, and I subscribe fully to what he said with regard to the Senator's distinguished father.  It might also be relevant to recall, as Senator Ó Maoláin did, that he was a Member of the first Seanad and that Senator Yeats' distinguished father was nominated <Col N="10" /> as a Member of the first Seanad by the distinguished father of the Leader of my Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fourth occasion on which I have been present in this House at the election of a Chairman.  The other occasions were in 1954, 1957&mdash;I missed 1961 owing to circumstances over which I had no control&mdash;and in 1965.  Looking back, I find that on each of those occasions I voted for the Fianna Fáil nominee.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins has said that it has become the practice here to have the election of Chairman uncontested, but in 1954 when we had a coalition Government, Fianna Fáil were the Opposition and did contest it.  On that occasion, for reasons that I need not go into now and although I was not connected with the party, I voted for the Fianna Fáil nominee and I also voted for the Fianna Fáil nominee in 1957 and in 1965 in the knowledge that the nominee on those occasions had not only a splendid knowledge of the procedure but was quite notably impartial in the Chair.</P>
      <P>I have known Senator Michael Yeats for about a quarter of a century&mdash;I know him well&mdash;and I like to think that he might still be a friend.  I certainly think of myself as being a friend of his and I agree with much of what Senator Ó Maoláin has said about him.  He is certainly an excellent, attentive and conscientious parliamentarian and a useful, practical, effective one.</P>
      <P>I see two objections to his filling this Chair in the way I should like to see it filled.  One is that I have found&mdash; and other Members of the House may remember also&mdash;that not infrequently questions of procedure seemed to defeat him.  Not infrequently he found himself lost in a muddle of procedure. The second point is much more important. He is a deeply-committed party politician.  I do not think he believes his party have ever been wrong in any detail on anything.  I fear that in the Chair this will be a serious disadvantage, not only to him but to many of the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that there were other possibilities in the Fianna Fáil Party.  If <Col N="11" /> Senator Eoin Ryan had been willing to accept the nomination&mdash;as I know he was not and I hasten to say that I know he is more than satisfied with the present nomination&mdash;I should have voted for him for his knowledge of procedure and also for his known impartiality. I had hoped also that possibly the name of Senator William Sheldon might have come before us. Of all the Members of this House he is the parliamentarian with the greatest knowledge and experience of parliamentary procedure.  Notably, as Acting Chairman many times, he was impartial. Personally I think he would have made an admirable choice.  He suffers from the disability in this nonpolitical House of not belonging to the Government party.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Yeats belongs to the Government party and I feel he is so committed to the party that he will find it difficult to bring the degree of impartiality to the conduct of the business of this House which is so important to us.  My hope, is, consequently, in saying these things that to some extent my words may influence Senator Yeats not to regard himself too much as being in the Chair mainly to protect Ministers.  I would ask him to bear in mind when he is making other decisions such as whether a particular matter is in order for being raised on the Motion for the Adjournment, that he will not be too much conditioned by party loyalties.  As a result of my feelings in regard to these two matters, and in particular the second one, I find myself bound to vote against the nomination of Senator Michael Yeats. I believe that in the body of the House he will prove a far more effective and useful Member than sitting in the Chair.</P>

Is mór an onóir atá sibh tar éis a bhronnadh orm agus geallaim díobh go ndéanfaidh mé gach aon iarracht na dualgaisí a bhaineann leis an oifig seo a chomhlíonadh comh héifeachtúil agus comh cothromúil agus is féidir liom é sin a dhéanamh. De réir sean-thradisiúin an tSeanaid bíonn cáirdeas agus comh-oibriú eadrainn sa Teach seo.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun an ard-traidisiún sin a chothú agus a neartú sna blianta atá romhainn.

      <P>I wish to thank the Members of the Seanad for the honour they have conferred on me in electing me to the Chair.  It is an honour I fully appreciate. I should like to assure all the Senators that I will do my utmost to act with fairness and with justice to all.  I am sure in the future there will continue to be the same spirit of co-operation and friendship between the Chair and the House that has always been such a notable aspect of our procedings in the past.  May I wish you all every success in the work that lies ahead?</P>

      <P>My first duty as Cathaoirleach is a melancholy one.  I announce to the House the tragic and untimely death of our colleague, Senator James J. Martin.  Ar flaitheas Dé go raibh a anam.  From the early years of his manhood Senator Martin took an active interest in the national movement.  In the War of Independence he played a prominent part with the Roscommon Branch of the Irish Republican Army.</P>
      <P>He was a well-known farmer and farmed extensively at his home at Derrymoyle in Laois.  He was also a member of the Laois County Committee of Agriculture.  Not surprisingly, his agricultural interests played a part in his election as Senator.  In the general election of 1965 and again this year he was nominated by the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horseowners' Association of Ireland for the Agricultural Panel.  On both occasions he was successful in being elected to the House. Senator Martin was for many years a member of Laois County Council and he devoted much of his time and energy to the interests of the people in the area.  As a Senator he was most zealous in his parliamentary duties and he rarely missed a meeting of the Seanad.  Of a kindly and friendly disposition, he was popular with members of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the widow and children of the late Senator I should like to convey on your behalf and on my own our <Col N="14" /> sympathy and appreciation.  Solas Dé lena anam.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your election as Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann and on behalf of the Labour group here to assure you of our fullest co-operation to enable you to carry out the onerous duties which you have undertaken.</P>
      <P>I should also like to make the plea at this, the first meeting of this Seanad, that much further use will be made of the Seanad in the future than has been made of it in the past.  The Seanad has a role to play in the national life of this country and I sincerely hope that you, in co-operation with the Leader of the House, will be able to use your influence to ensure that much better use will be made of the present Seanad than was made of the two Seanads of which I have had the honour to be a Member.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that there is a very cynical outlook with regard to the role and function of Seanad Éireann.  I believe that in the Seanad we have the people and the talent to play a very big part in the future political and economic life of this country.</P>

      <P>Well, this is the only opportunity one can get of putting over the point of view, which I believe is shared by many, that this Seanad should be enabled to play a bigger role than has been played by the Seanad in the past.  On occasions we have had motions on the Order Paper for two years because Ministers could not find the time to come into the Seanad to take them.  We have had also the very unfortunate situation that arises very often of a number of Bills coming before the Seanad when the Dáil is in recess.  That, in effect, means that all the Seanad is being asked to do is rubber stamp those Bills.</P>

      <P>Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé de chead agam ach ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leat ar do roghnú mar Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confirm an order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, in regard to the supply and distribution to retailers of jewellery, watches and clocks.</P>
      <P>The inquiry was undertaken by the Fair Trade Commission on its own initiative following complaints from retailers that they were experiencing difficulty in obtaining supplies of jewellery, watches and clocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 30 Irish manufacturers of jewellery, and eight watch and clock assemblers.  They normally supply their products direct to the retail trade. Some manufacturers and assemblers also import completed products and these are also supplied direct to the retail trade.  There are some 70 wholesale firms most of which are engaged in the distribution of imported products. There are several hundred retail outlets.  There are three trade associations representing retail jewellers and two organisations whose members are engaged in the manufacture of jewellery and in the assembly of watches and clocks.  Thirty witnesses representing trade associations, manufacturers, <Col N="16" /> wholesalers and retailers were examined in the course of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The commission considered that certain practices obtaining in the supply and distribution of jewellery, watches and clocks to retailers are not compatible with the public interest.  These practices include the confining of supplies to retail firms which comply with standards established by retail trade associations; commercial pressures on suppliers to confine supplies to such retailers by means such as the issue of lists of suppliers approved by retail trade associations; refusal of supplies to a retailer by reason of non-membership of a trade association or on representation by a competitor; and the recommending or suggesting of retail prices for watches and clocks.  The commission recommended that suppliers should be free to determine their own sales policy based on equitable criteria and that retail trade associations should be prohibited from taking action to have supplies withheld from retailers who are not approved by them.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the recommendations of the commission except that regarding the recommending or suggesting of retail prices for watches and clocks and I have made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Jewellery, Watches and Clocks) Order, 1968 to give effect to the recommendations which I have accepted.  As regards retail prices, I am satisfied that the terms of the order and in particular the provisions of Article 7, will be sufficient to ensure a fair and competitive retail price mechanism.</P>
    <P>I would like to lay particular emphasis on the fact that while the order has the effect of relieving the supplier from organised pressure by trade interests it does not require him to supply all comers.  He is free to prescribe conditions which must be fulfilled by retailers before they become eligible for supplies and he is also free to limit the number of retail outlets he is prepared to serve in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I recommend this confirmation Bill to the Seanad without reservation.  Its enactment should ensure that persons are not unjustly excluded from engaging <Col N="17" /> in the retail trade in jewellery, watches and clocks and should result in a more competitive system of trading with consequent benefits to the public.  Similar enactments are in force in respect of carpets, groceries, motor cars, building materials, radios and television sets.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an order of this kind shall not have effect until it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give force of law to the order concerned. With Bills of this kind, the order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but may be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>

      <P>I may be permitted to say very briefly a few words, before being strictly relevant to the matter now before the House.  It is simply to say that it has been the greatest honour that has been done to me to have been elected to a House of the Irish Parliament, and I am sure that in expressing this sentiment I am feeling something that is shared by all those here today for the first time.  We come to this House along very different routes.</P>
      <P>Some come through nomination: they are the wise virgins who have kept their lamps well trimmed and have known the shrines before which to place these lamps; others are the merely distinguished, those who have been selected by the two universities, who have been intelligent in the selection of their parents and who owe, through accident of birth, the good fortune of having the great qualities that bring them here today.  I came here as one of the rest of the Senators along the most arduous route, where the performances of one's parents, particularly perhaps one's grandparents, and the geographical distribution of their various descendants, were very important, but we are really the heroes of this Assembly because I suppose the Cuchulainn effort was merely a dryrun for the Panel election system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1968, which comes today for consideration <Col N="18" /> by the Seanad, is designed to deal with practices that are objectionable in my view from a number of viewpoints. They are designed to prevent unfair trading, to stop men being deprived of the opportunity of employing their initiative and talent in the places where they wish to employ that initiative and direct that talent; they limit the scope of competition by their operation; they raise prices and costs.  They are, in fact, for those who wish to defend, preserve and develop the existing system, one of the greatest obstacles to its preservation and development. Those practices are operated by the possessors of wealth, power and influence in order to exact a toll on the general community.</P>
    <P>I see the objection to them under two headings.  First is the objection in terms of economic cost.  To an extent that has unfortunately not been measured in the report made by the Fair Trade Commission to the Minister, there have been no attempts to employ modern techniques and to establish the extent to which they add to costs.  I think it may perhaps be an unfortunate consequence of the development of macro-economics, the thinking about economic aggregates in the last 15 or 20 years, that the eyes of the people guiding this community in Government and in Opposition may have been taken away from consideration of equally important matters, such as we are considering here today.</P>
    <P>The effect of any of these practices, if it be unfairly to raise prices, is seriously to damage the economy because it transfers resources from people of enterprise who with these resources could make them fructify for the benefit of the community.  I take the approach of every Member of the Seanad to be that of concern for the welfare of the community and with no particular interest in any association with which he might have a connection.</P>
    <P>In addition to the economic objection to unfair trading, there is the more grave objection of the injustice done, the immeasurable injustice, when people are forced to pay more than they ought to those who have contrived by association with others to exact tolls from the community.  A <Col N="19" /> very great thinker in the history of this field, some would say the father of economic thought, Adam Smith, said that no group of people engaged in trade meet together even for merriment and diversion but they are not engaged in some kind of conspiracy against the public interest and are likely to happen on some means of enhancing prices at the expense of the public interest, of the common good, the common good that pays the price where the common good is not served for the weakest members of the community. Funds are not available to help those who need that help, the rate of growth is not achieved by the power the community would otherwise achieve were it not for this injustice and unfair enrichment.</P>
    <P>This is probably the shared view of this Assembly.  I may discover otherwise in the course of the debate but I understand from the Minister that this is his view and that this thinking lay behind the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953.  While remaining strictly relevant, I may be permitted to criticise some of the terms of the report and one aspect of the Order and also have a look at the procedure which lay behind the Bill which is now before us.  If injustice has been done and is being done, I think this point should be made and I should like to make it with the Minister here.  It is not yet law.</P>
    <P>These injustices are identified with those in the 1967 report.  They were reported on 16th November, 1967. Strangely, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, requires the Minister if he is not going to adopt the report, to make an Order to this effect within three months of his not adopting it&mdash; the three months period, by virtue of an amendment of the 1959 Act, only being counted if three days meeting of Dáil and Seanad take place in each month.  I do not understand why the legislature decided the Minister needed more time to adopt the Order than he needed to reject it, but he was given more time and he certainly took it.  He did not make the Order until 10th April, 1968, and the Second Reading and other Stages of the Bill <Col N="20" /> were not taken until 16th April, 1969.</P>
    <P>Now, on 5th November, 1969, we are considering the Bill in the Seanad. Two years have passed.  What degree of injustice has been done by that failure to cope with a failure discerned two years ago?  What has been the cost to the community?  I do not claim competence in this field, but we have an estimate in the report of the retail of the goods affected by this Order; £3 million approximately was the retail value of goods affected in 1965.</P>
    <P>We are so used to hundreds of millions of pounds that we forget the importance of millions or of hundreds of thousands.</P>
    <P>The years 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969 have all passed and there has been a growth in productivity in those years and in the values developed.  There has been an affluent society which has enabled people to go further in buying jewellery and watches, and we may presume that the values of the articles that have passed undetected and uncontrolled are considerably in excess of £6 million.  I wonder as a result of this how much productive resources has gone into <i>mortmain</i>, has gone into the hands and pockets of people to whom it should not have gone as a result of this failure by the Government and the Minister who is charged with this matter to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not go so far as perhaps some might to adopt the words of Proudhon, that property is theft, but property resulting from the practice of injustice is theft, and if the findings of this report are to be accepted by the two Houses of Parliament &mdash; they have been accepted already by Dáil Éireann &mdash; a good deal of thievery has been done and injustice permitted.  This is the type of thing to which insufficient attention has been given and the importance of it has been insufficiently measured but it is the sort of thing which should not have happened.</P>
    <P>May I ask you to look at what the Minister said in Dáil Éireann as reported in volume 239, column 1620?</P>
    <P>As regards retail prices, I am satisfied that the terms of the Order and in particular the provisions of Article 7, will be sufficient to ensure <Col N="21" /> a fair and competitive retail price mechanism.</P>
    <P>This is a statement by the Minister. He has said it.  It is an <i>ipse dixit.</i>  But he does not give any reasons for his satisfaction.  I think he might be invited to do so this day or in the course of this debate, because the report which has impressed him so much that he has adopted every single recommendation, states in paragraph 45:</P>
    <P>There is evidence that the present system of recommended or suggested retail prices for watches and clocks has an influence on retail prices.  One consequence is that price competition between retail jewellers is lessened.</P>
    <P>This is a finding based on evidence before the Commission.  Paragraph 49 states:</P>
    <P>The practices on the part of manufacturers and wholesalers of recommending or suggesting retail prices for watches and clocks should cease.</P>
    <P>This practice as a result of this Order will not cease if this Order be enacted, and if we accept the proposition which has been reiterated for 16 years, a proposition on which I have considerable personal doubt because of its very significant implication, the proposition that this kind of order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but may be accepted or rejected as it stands. If this is the position then if this Seanad passes this Order a recommendation without any evidence which should not be accepted cannot be rejected.  I find it difficult &mdash; I am not going to press this point any more than to mention it &mdash; to understand how to reconcile repeated statements that there is no power to amend an Order with Article 20 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>Every Bill initiated in and passed by Dáil Éireann shall be sent to Seanad Éireann and may unless it be a Money Bill be amended by Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann shall consider any such amendment.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to tell us how we can operate in this House the power of amendment given to us under Article 20, sub-Article (1) if we are not permitted to amend but must <Col N="22" /> accept or reject the Order which is offered to us.</P>
    <P>Article 7 which the Minister relies on as being sufficient to prevent price rises only prohibits the supplier from withholding goods because of the prices offered by the retailer.  I have reservations about that.  This prohibition is the only sanction against price rises, but in practice there are other kinds of pressure, moral and otherwise. There can be all sorts of pressures brought to bear on people to keep their prices in line with others.</P>
    <P>I share with the Minister some of the obvious prejudice which he has against trade associations, but I must refer to the failure of the Minister to make an Order which adopts the clear recommendation based on evidence of the Commission&mdash;in fact I think that this Commission has insufficiently distinguished between trinkets, jewellery and watches.  There is, it seems to me, a very great distinction between precious stones put together in a particular way to look gorgeous on your neck or wherever else you would like to wear them and the watches and clocks which are instruments of marvellous precision, wonderful achievements of the human race, matters of the most delicate and sophisticated refinement designed to attune to the movements of the human body.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for treating watches and clocks, the most sophisticated ones which really are valuable, differently from ordinary jewellery.  It is not, I think, wrong to say that over the years our workshops have been obsolete, and I would like to pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for participating in a measure which has done or is attempting to do something to improve that, namely the establishment of the Irish-Swiss Institute of Horology.  It is very important for this country that we should develop particular skills in all the different fields where we can, particularly when we think that with regard to watches and clocks it has been estimated that in the value of a watch or a clock 95 per cent is of labour, and that could be 95 per cent of Irish labour.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Commission that it <Col N="23" /> is not a matter for a trade association to determine whether people have a workshop which is adequate to supply the service, after-service and care that these sophisticated human achievements should receive, but there is a strong case&mdash;and I would invite the Minister to consider this&mdash;for his Department to make appropriate Orders with regard to the qualifications that workshops attain and the obligations of repair and after-service that should be imposed not by authority of a trade association but by the Minister concerned with the community.</P>
    <P>With regard to the report, I find in it a disappointing lack of evidence of the development of any body of expertise.  I mentioned the lack of the application of modern techniques with regard to the establishment of costs. It is very interesting to reflects, and it cannot be irrelevant to this debate, that this Order relates to a process which began 16 years ago under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have given a wholly exhaustive consideration to this matter, but I think that in the 16 years as far as I can see we are now dealing with the tenth Bill, and in the course of the debate introducing the Bill which was enacted in 1953 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, retired now to other fields, listed a considerable number of commodities which have not been the subject of any orders, and I think that the time may well have arrived for the community to consider whether there is not in fact an immediate necessity to deal with this type of injustice, this type of economic ill-health.</P>
    <P>The current cost of the Fair Trade Commission is £30,000 per annum. That is a fair bit of money.  Based on current prices&mdash;I have not and do not purport to offer the total cost of the Fair Trade Commission to the community, to the taxpayer&mdash;that is, over 16 years, nearly £500,000. That would erect a few hundred houses for people who need them.  Are we getting value for money?  There is provision in the Act for prosecutions.  Have there been many prosecutions?  I feel the Seanad <Col N="24" /> would be interested to hear whether there have been many prosecutions.</P>
    <P>This Commission are obliged by section 10 to consider, to keep under review, the operation of Orders made under the section which we are here proposing to operate by this Bill.  Have the Commision considered the operation of those orders?  Have the Commission reported to the Minister?  Is the Minister prepared to tell the House whether those Orders, which have been made with regard to those various matters, have, in fact, been working well and are adequate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I though it appropriate to know whether the practice with regard to the operation of this Act can encourage the Seanad to believe that the order made when enacted by Parliament will in fact be kept under review.  It would help us to know if this will be done, if previous Acts have been kept under review.  I have made my point on that and I am quite satisfied to leave it at that.  I thought the Minister would have encouraged me rather than discouraged me to invite him through you to consider whether he has, in fact, the proper instrument to deal with an ill which from the fact that we have this Bill offered to us here I believe he shares and identifies himself with this.</P>
      <P>In Britain we have a completely different type of procedure, a procedure, may I say, which is followed in Denmark, Germany, Israel and Switzerland, where you have general prohibition against unfair practices and where you have a procedure whereby you register agreements restrictive of trading and you get approval of those agreements as being fair in the circumstances which are established to the court.  There is in Britain a registered, as the Minister very well knows, Restrictive Trade Practices Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Switzerland, it has been prohibited since 1962 and price discrimination <Col N="25" /> is illegal if it is not justified in the public interest.  This is very important and the Minister might well consider, whether he may improve the instrument which the community needs, the value of this.  Any individual or company harmed or threatened by a restriction in free competition can institute legal action and seek damages.  That is very much more powerful, as the Minister knows and as many other Members of this Seanad know, an instrument and a sanction than to rely on prosecutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words.  As I think Senator FitzGerald has already branded me as a wise virgin, may I assure him that I think the wise virgins on this side of the House will show all the staying power of the heroes both to the left and to the right of the Chair, although I think in this, my initial contribution, I may not well be able to keep pace with his long run at this particular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Leader of the House would allow me one flight of fancy to match Senator FitzGerald's, might I say I would welcome this Bill as a piece, I hope, of consumer emancipation.  It would be very nice, speaking in this splendid room, if this legislation covering the jewellery, watch and clock trade, might in fact lead to or contribute to a renaissance of the Irish jewellery trade which would match our products of the eighth century which are so splendid in the museum which is across the way from here.  I think this may not be such a flight of fancy because there is every sign of a growing interest in jewellery.  It is rather refreshing to me at any rate to find as one goes up and down Grafton Street these days young men sporting medallions and rings in the same way as the young women of our fair city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald spoke in very formal terms about the restrictive practices of the retail associations.  Speaking as a plain customer I would like to say <Col N="26" /> that I feel behind this mere business of banding together to protect their own interests the associations have been in fact promoting an undesirable exclusiveness and snobbery in the country.  I would welcome any contribution that this Bill can make to the breaking down of the exclusiveness of the jewellery trade because it always strikes me how intimidating some of those specialist jewellery premises are.  It is unfortunate, particularly when young people are getting married and perhaps buying their first elaborate piece of jewellery, that they should suffer the intimidation of so many of those exclusive jewellery houses.  I would think in its own way this move to curb restrictive practices in the jewellery trade would help to get rid of this exclusiveness.</P>
    <P>As I say, to get down to some of the detailed matter here, I welcome the Bill and its steps to get rid of undesirable practices, but like Senator FitzGerald, when I was reading the report of the inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, I was drawn particularly to paragraph 45 on page 20 where I saw that the Fair Trade Commission seemed to be rather staggered by the prospect of excessive price cuttings.  They said that to prevent excessive price cutting suppliers in the jewellery trade should be permitted to withhold their products from retailers who sell at or below the cost price.  It seems to me, as a consumer, there could be nothing better than excessive price cutting.  It seems to me staggering that the Fair Trade Commission should regard this as a doubtful quality.  That is just one slight disappointment I have about the order. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of this.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to section 7, Subsection (2) of the 1953 Act where a supplier can withhold goods unless a retailer gives an undertaking to the supplier that he will refrain from selling goods of that kind at or at less than the price he purchased them from the supplier.  I look forward to the explanation of this but this seems to be an effort to curb what is one of the practices in supermarkets that I so much enjoy, that is the practice in current marketing of what I think is known as <Col N="27" /> a loss leader whereby a supermarket can put forward goods at way below cost price so that they attract in the customers.  Of course when the customers come in to buy this product that is selling at a loss the supermarket owners hope the customers will buy plenty of other goods as well.  I did think that it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility that we might see a tray of watches being offered at 30s each in such a place as the Stillorgan Shopping Centre or Dunne's Stores at Cornelscourt.  There could be no better way of drawing people in to buy goods in a supermarket.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if 30s were lower than the price at which the goods were supplied to retailers, the supplier would, in fact, be able to refrain from supplying the retailer in future.  That is a small disappointment as I see it in this section.  We should support this Bill for the good it does and I hope it will be followed by many more Bills drafted on these lines.  I welcome the general sympathy that the Minister has shown towards the consumer and I welcome also the fact that he hopes to gradually build up a consumer charter in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred quite rightly to the importance of distinguishing between jewellery and watches.  This is an important distinction but as far as I can see the order meets this under section 9 under which a supplier is permitted to make various conditions about the way in which he will supply retailers.  I have been speaking to some of the wholesalers of the expensive precision watches in this city and I understand from them that they are loath to supply retailers who cannot provide some form of maintenance and after-sales service.  Again, in the watch trade it is very important to distinguish between the watch which is a genuine work of art, a genuine precision instrument, and those watches that are offered at 30s because I do not think that anybody who buys a watch for 30s could expect after-sales service. These, then, are just the small points which I wish to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just say a few <Col N="28" /> words arising mainly out of the Minister's speech.  First of all, I think we all accept the purpose of this Bill which is to protect the interests of the public by insisting on certain standards among their members.</P>
      <P>I must admit to being somewhat surprised that the Minister found it necessary to bring in a Bill of this description because looking at the structure of the jewellery and watch trade, one gets the impression that there are sufficient outlets to ensure competition at almost all levels.  There must be very few industries or distributive trades of any kind in the country in which there are 30 manufacturers and 70 wholesalers and, as the Minister said, several hundred retail outlets.  No doubt, the Minister must have been satisfied that the 30 witnesses who were examined by the Commission made a case on behalf of the trade of distribution as a whole.</P>
      <P>On one or two points, the Minister might make some reference in his reply. One point relates to a section on page 2 of the Minister's speech which reads:</P>
      <P>I would like to lay particular emphasis on the fact that while the Order has the effect of relieving the supplier from organised pressure by trade interests it does not require him to supply all comers.  He is free to prescribe conditions which must be fulfilled by retailers before they become eligible for supplies and he is also free to limit the number of retail outlets he is prepared to serve in a particular area.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that &ldquo;Similar enactments are in force in respect of carpets, groceries, motor cars, building materials, radios and television sets.&rdquo;  Is it correct to say that anybody can enter the distributive section of the motor car industry provided that he conforms to certain requirements?  I do not think that is so. The motor car industry is severely restricted.  Perhaps the Minister would very kindly refer to that point when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pay a very sincere tribute to Senator FitzGerald for his contribution which is of the greatest assistance to the House. <Col N="29" /> The points he made confirm that he sincerely and wholeheartedly accepts the spirit behind the restrictive trade practice legislation.</P>
      <P>However, Senator FitzGerald says that there has been a delay of approximately three years from the time this report was made to the present.  The report was made on 16th November, 1967.  As Senator FitzGerald will realise, a very long delay may, in fact, be completely justifiable.  Looking back over the volume of legislation that has been enacted during that period and considering that we had a general election this year I do not think it could be said that the delay in introducing this Bill was in any way due to the fault of the present Minister.</P>
      <P>The last matter to which the Senator referred was that it is not within the competence of the House in dealing with this Act to amend it.  That is so but that inability is not based on this Act itself.  It is based on the Restrictive Trade Practices Act of 1953. Under that Act the Minister may revoke or amend, by order, an order under subsection (1) of section 9 but subsection (3) of that section says that:</P>
      <P>An order under this section shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas but, upon being so confirmed, it shall have the force of law in accordance with its terms.</P>
      <P>Under that section it is quite clear that in any future legislation, unless and until that is amended, there is no power to go back to investigate the Orders and to amend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only the orders which cannot be amended.  The Bill itself merely has a section.  We can accept or reject the orders.  There is a considerable amount of commonsense in that because if we had power to examine the order with a view to amending it it would mean that all the evidence which came before the Commission in the first instance should be available to us.  It is quite obvious that that evidence should be secret.  Otherwise some people, and in <Col N="30" /> particular the complainants, would suffer very severely.  That information is given to the Commission and by the Commission to the Minister in confidence. It has to be in the strictest confidence. It is quite clear it would not be in the public interest if it could be submitted to us.  In the circumstances and on reflection and reconsideration, Senator A. Fitzgerald will agree that it is in the public interest that we have no power to have made available to us all the statistics, all the evidence and all the reports which the Commission had at their command when preparing their report for the Minister.</P>
      <P>The next point which Senator A. Fitzgerald made&mdash;and it seems valid at first thought&mdash;is that in this case we have not prohibited the recommendation of prices.  Prices can be recommended even though there is no obligation on the retailers to adhere to them.  The Senator makes the point rightly that if prices are recommended everybody will tend towards the recommended prices.  On the other hand we must realise&mdash;and in this I find myself somewhat at variance with the last speaker&mdash;that very often it is not in the public good to sell goods at below cost.  In this case the Minister had to make an exception in the order which gave manufacturers the right to refuse goods to people who were selling below cost.</P>
      <P>Selling below cost has been found in other countries, and particularly in America, to be a very severe menace. I hestitate to mention the names of the companies but I am sure the names are familiar to most of us.  What has happened frequently is that one large wealthy retail firm will sell goods of a particular type below cost.  In this case we have only two manufacturers mentioned in the Minister's opening statement.  He refers to manufacturers of jewellery here.  I do not mind whether there are two, four or five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a wealthy firm wish to create a monopoly, the obvious thing would be to sell the products of those factories below cost.  Thereby they would practically get the entire trade of the country. That being so, they would be the sole customers of the manufacturers in question.  The next step would be for <Col N="31" /> them to go to the factory and say &ldquo;You are charging too much for the goods.  We require these goods at considerably less.&rdquo;  The manufacturer is unable to supply the goods economically at considerably less cost so they say to him &ldquo;It is just too bad.  I tell you what we will do instead.  We will take over your factory and give you so much for it.&rdquo;  They have a complete monopoly now of the manufacture and of the sale because they can manufacture only for themselves and they have the monopoly for the country.  Then they increase the price to whatever limit they wish.  Therefore, to say that because goods can be sold below cost they are cheaper to the customers is not always sound.  The Minister has made an unavoidable exception here. Any manufacturer may recommend that his goods cannot be sold below cost.</P>
    <P>I raised these few points because they are the only points on which I find myself in any way in disagreement with the very excellent contribution to this debate by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator FitzGerald in recommending this Bill.  I feel we should have similar orders covering practically every section of the retail trade.  There is one question I should like to ask the Minister.  It has come to my notice recently where a distributive agency have notified a small industrialist who was starting off in a small way that they insist on their retailing outlets charging 110 per cent approximately over the wholesale price for the articles that the distributive agency supply; or otherwise they will not handle any of the merchandise.  This is surely extortion and there must be some legislation in which cases like this could be dealt with.  If I give the Minister details of this complaint, which does not deal with jewellery, watches or clocks, would he be good enough to have it investigated?  I wish to commend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the Minister or the House for long. There is one point in this Bill which, <Col N="32" /> like the previous speaker, I generally commend, and I should like to speak on it.  I do not like the section which gives power to the supplier to limit the number of retail outlets he is prepared to serve in any particular area.  I have a considerable amount of business experience and I know that where you have a supplier, whether manufacturer or important importer or wholesaler, between this supplier and his normal retail customer there is, in the normal course of trade, a type of friendship. Perhaps it is commercial friendship but cordial relations normally develop. If somebody else wishes to commence retail trade in this area there will be a certain amount of pressure, moral or otherwise, put on the wholesaler not to supply this new person entering the trade, assuring him that the areas is adequately covered already.</P>
      <P>Every person who is prepared to do this should be free, in a free society, to establish himself and to enter into the normal commercial operation and if we allow this to continue we will do a great injustice to a number of people who are perfectly entitled to start in business.  I should like the Minister to give us his views on that and to assure us that this will not be allowed to happen and that if they are to be allowed to restrict, that somebody other than the supplier himself will be able to judge and decide whether it is in the interests of the local people or not.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill but also though to associate myself with what Senator Alexis FitzGerald said about its lateness in coming before us.  However, the general principle is good.  I know that the Minister has drawn attention to the fact that part of its purpose is to re-establish a more competitive system of trading.  We often hear about the benefits of the profits system and private enterprise but it would seem to me that they are lost altogether as far as the consumer goes unless real competition is maintained and that is the purpose of the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations and a Bill and an order such as this.</P>

    <P>The Minister mentioned several commodities that are covered by other <Col N="33" /> orders.  I remember occasions upon which one or other of his predecessors failed to implement recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission in relation to pharmaceutical products.  I wonder has the Minister any thoughts about whether or not it would be similarly advantageous&mdash;since he mentions carpets, groceries, motor cars, building materials, radio and television sets&mdash;to reconsider other products too.</P>
    <P>A very important point made by Senator Alexis Fitzgerald is that these things&mdash;watches, clocks and so on&mdash; have a very high skilled labour content. That is a point of major importance to a country such as ours.  The major content is not raw material, is not power, but skilled labour content. Therefore, these are commodities the production of which should be encouraged in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to one sinister fact and it is that we are debating this and our clock apparently has been purloined.</P>

      <P>Like the other Senators I, too, welcome this Bill but I would like to endorse the remarks of Senator Norton in regard to the last paragraph on page 2 of the Minister's introductory speech from which it appears that he is leaving quite a lot of power in the hands of the importers or wholesalers.  He says: &ldquo;I would like to lay particular emphasis on the fact that while the order has the effect of relieving the supplier from organised pressure from trade interests it does not require him to supply all comers.&rdquo; I feel there is a certain amount of restriction contained in that paragraph and I feel that it is quite likely to nullify the effect of the Bill.  I would be interested to hear the Minister on this and I hope he will allay the fears of Senators about it because as it reads here it appears as if this Bill will have very little effect.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the first point with which I should deal is the one recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission which I did not accept, that was that we ought to prohibit the recommending or suggesting of retail prices for watches and clocks.  Senator Nash touched on this.  In the context of <Col N="34" /> the rest of the order this means that a supplier could not enforce, in the way he could before this order comes into operation, a price list.  Therefore, all he could do once this order is in force is, as stated here, to recommend or suggest prices.  Because they cannot enforce it the position is quite different from what it has been in the past.  There seems to be no particular reason why we ought to prohibit this.</P>
      <P>There are conceivable circumstances in which it could be of advantage but in circumstances where it is not of advantage people are not obliged to adhere to it.  The essential point is that under the other provisions of the Order this kind of list cannot be enforced, it can only be recommended or suggested. Therefore, I think that taking the order as I have put it before the House, it allows sufficient flexibility to cover any conceivable set of circumstances. The essential feature of what we are doing is to take away the power and the pressure which has heretofore been exercised by the various vested interests concerned to ensure that things were done their way.  This is the essential feature of what we are doing in this order.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general operation of the Fair Trade Commissions, I did interject, somewhat unwillingly&mdash;unwillingly in the sense that I do not like to interrupt a Senator, in particular a Senator who is making a very impressive maiden speech&mdash;but I did want to draw attention to the fact that I did not think it would be possible for him to deal with the operations of the Fair Trade Commission on this Bill.  However, since the point has been raised I feel I should say this much: that it would not be in any way equitable or accurate to judge the effectiveness of the Fair Trade Commission absolutely by reference to the number of orders made or the number of prosecutions taken.  Indeed many of the activities of the Fair Trade Commission involve receiving a complaint, making informal inquiries about it and thereby putting an end to the cause of complaint without any formal inquiry or order at all. This is something that would not appear in any balance sheet of prosecutions or orders made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Having said that, I might perhaps remind the House that in the Third Programme there is a reference to the proposed expansion of the scope of the activities of the Fair Trade Commission. I might say, in parenthesis, that I hope that some of the Senators who have spoken in a very high-minded way today will be equally high-minded when this matter comes before them, when their own personal interests may well be involved.  However, the House should know that legislation to implement what is outlined in the Third Programme is at present in preparation. It will also, apart from widening the scope of the Fair Trade Commission, propose to alter the structure and indeed, it might be said, the basic approach of the Fair Trade Commission. However, the legislation is at present being prepared and I would not be in order in going into it in any further detail.  I say that merely to indicate to Senator Alexis FitzGerald that the question of whether the Fair Trade Commission is an effective instrument for the purposes that we require is in fact being investigated and dealt with at the moment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Keery, this was dealt with very clearly by Senator Nash but I want to confirm that my approach to it is the same as that of Senator Nash, that is that loss leaders, as they are called, very often ultimately may not be any help but rather a hindrance to the economy for the reason that Senator Nash mentioned.  If we allowed it to get out of hand, a wealthy retail firm would be in a position to hold the community up to ransom.  Although in the short-term one may be tempted to support the sale of goods at cheap prices, one must take the long-term view.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell made the point about a statement I made when introducing the Bill, that the retailer would be free to prescribe conditions for suppliers before they became eligible for supplies. I think the best I can do to explain what is in mind is to give an example of the kind of conditions that might be prescribable&mdash;the size of orders from people, the services which would be provided, particularly a repairs service, if one retailer is offering <Col N="36" /> such a service and another retailer is not.  It is not unreasonable in the case of a supplier offering different terms to a retailer, or if the scale of order is very much larger in one case than in another, that better terms might be offered to the larger than the smaller concern, but the House will note that the order provides that the same class of customers have to be dealt with in the same way.  It is reasonable to make a distinction between somebody who orders a very large quantity and a person who orders, say, one or two items, but as between two retailers, both ordering one or two items, they must both be treated in the same way.  This is what is intended by the provision for prescribing conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator McDonald, if he will give me details I will have the case investigated.  Senator Norton, Senator FitzGerald and others were concerned about the provision which would allow limitations on the number of retail outlets in a particular area.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, it is conceivable that in a certain line in the range of jewellery, watches and even clocks there might be a value in exclusivity in a particular line, and if this value is the only one of its kind available it is a legitimate approach from the point of view of the retailer that he should demand if he is to carry this line that there should not be any competitor in that area to deal in that line. This can only apply where the quality of exclusivity is important.  This is especially important in the fashion garments industry as the House will appreciate.  I am merely mentioning this as a possibility in relation to these items.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, more to it than that.  If one takes a not very large provincial town in which there is a retailer dealing in these commodities who provides a repairs service and another retailer who does not provide such a service, it appears to me legitimate that the supplier should be entitled to say &ldquo;I want to sell my goods through an outlet which will provide this service and if I can do so I will deal with the person providing the service, but if somebody else is not prepared <Col N="37" /> to provide that service I will not have to sell to him&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of a not very large town the volume of demand may be such that it would not support the provision of this kind of repairs service on a large scale and a legal commitment on the part of the supplier to supply anybody in that town who wants to get supplies, no matter what the circumstances, no matter what the volume or the services supplied, would, I think, be not unduly onerous but probably unenforceable in practice.  This is an extreme case but one could see a situation in which the sheer volume of demand in a particular area, if many people wanted to get into the business, could not be met by the manufacturer, and, therefore, how is he to choose between whom to supply or not, and is he to limit the small concern?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Senator will appreciate that if you take the case of a manufacturer who says, &ldquo;I will supply only this outlet which provides an after-sales service or a repairs service&rdquo;, this rule must be applied to everybody.  He cannot supply to one and not to the other.  If he distinguishes between them he can be dealt with under the order, but if he decides to do this his competitor may decide to take a different line.  This means that somebody who wants to open a retail outlet can get supplies, not from the same manufacturer but from a different manufacturer.  This is what we want&mdash; competition between the manufacturers and retailers.</P>

      <P>I would remind the <Col N="38" /> House that the underlying principle of this is that whatever restrictions may be imposed by the supplier must be reasonable.  If they are not reasonable he takes the risk of being prosecuted and we may take it that he will think twice before trying to apply unreasonable conditions.  There may be cases where this happens but on the basis of this order they can be dealt with and I would ask the House to appreciate that in any particular line of commodity, but especially one where the question of service provided can be important, it is not easy to strike a correct balance between the interests of those concerned, not least the consumer, but it is my opinion, having given some consideration to this, that this order is as good as we can make it, having regard to the legitimate interests of all the parties who are concerned in this, and I commend it to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Building Agency was originally established in 1960 as a company under the Companies Acts.  Its purpose at that time was to meet a need for housing required in connection with industrial development&mdash;a need which was not being catered for by private enterprise and which could not appropriately be met by local housing authorities.  It was placed on a statutory basis by the National Building Agency Limited Act, 1963, and, in 1965, the scope of its activities <Col N="39" /> was extended to cover any housing or related operations assigned to it by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide additional moneys for the Agency's industrial housing operations.  These operations are financed by repayable advances made by the Minister for Finance under section 6 of the 1963 Act.  Provision is also made in section 7 of the Act for the Minister for Local Government to guarantee moneys borrowed for this purpose.  Under section 9, the aggregate at any time of advances and guaranteed borrowing by the Agency, still unrepaid, may not exceed £2 million.  No guarantee has as yet been given under section 7, but the full amount of £2 million has now been advanced to the Agency under section 6.  An extension of the statutory limit is urgently required, and the purpose of this Bill is to extend that limit to £5 million.</P>
    <P>The Agency's original purpose of facilitating industrial development and expansion by providing housing accommodation is still an important aspect of its activities.  Houses are also provided by the Agency to the order of local authorities and for State employees, such as members of the Garda Síochána, whose duties involve occasional transfers of residence.  In its operations it works within broad policy outlines, determined by me from time to time, and in co-operation with the local authority or Department concerned, the Industrial Development Authority and any other relevant public body.</P>
    <P>In catering for housing needs associated with industry the Agency not merely builds the dwellings required, but acquires the sites and plans the building and financing of the houses. In the normal course the dwellings are provided at the request of individual industries and are financed by way of mortgage loans, granted by the Agency either to the firms or to nominated individual employees.  The usual grants payable by the State and local authorities are also obtained.  A small proporation of houses are provided for letting.</P>
    <P>Special arrangements have been <Col N="40" /> made with An Foras Tionscal to provide industrial housing in Galway and Waterford on a more general basis related to the anticipated growth of the industrial estates in these cities as a whole, rather than for specific industries. The White Paper which I recently published&mdash;&ldquo;Housing in the Seventies&rdquo;&mdash;indicated that similar arrangements will be extended to housing for industry in other areas generally, to the order of the Industrial Development Authority.  The White Paper also stated that it was the Government's intention that houses built by the Agency, in association with local authorities, for key workers in new or extending industry should qualify for subsidy at the higher rate.  This step should extend the association of local authorities with industrial development in their areas.</P>
    <P>The accounts of the Agency are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General and are laid before each House of the Oireachtas with his comments.  I have informed the Dáil that I intend to ask the Agency to publish an annual report giving full information about their activities and to arrange that this report will be available to the public.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that by the 30th September, 1969, a total of 751 houses for industry had been completed by the Agency, 109 were then under construction and 378 were being planned.  Further advances amounting to £3 million, will, it is estimated, be required over the next five years or so to finance the Agency's industrial housing activities.  It is for this reason I am asking that the limit of £2 million, specified by section 9 of the 1963 Act, should be increased to £5 million.</P>
    <P>The measure has been welcomed by all parties in Dáil Éireann and I commend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, this is a short Bill, and the view I take of it is that many of us feel as I do&mdash; and I think most members of my party would agree&mdash;that there is an urgent need for housing in this State.  Any of us who feels that way cannot legitimately complain when a Bill is presented to enable further housing development <Col N="41" /> to take place.  The Minister has pointed out in his opening remarks that the purpose of this Bill is to deal with only one aspect of the activities of the National Building Agency, and that is the National Building Agency's activities in connection with industrial housing.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I think it is correct to say that the scope of the activities of the Agency does in fact extend far beyond that.  They have by arrangement with local authorities an interest in the development of housing for local authorities. They also have an interest in housing for State bodies and other such concerns.  But in this Bill we are dealing only with the question of housing for industrial purposes, and the Minister mentioned in his remarks that an increase in the amount of money required for that purpose is now urgently required.  The Bill is for the purpose of extending the amount which may be advanced to the Agency for this purpose from £2 million to £5 million.</P>
      <P>I can say that the Fine Gael Party take the view in relation to housing generally that there is an acute need for more houses in this country.  I do not want to open a general debate on the housing situation.  I am quite sure you would not allow me to do that, but I think I can say in passing that every one of us, no matter from which part of the country we come, no matter what our own particular interest or avocation is, is aware, and we are continually being made aware, of the need for more housing.  That applies not only in the local authority sector and in the private sector but also in a very special way in the industrial sector.  All of us will probably be aware of instances throughout rural Ireland where the advent of an industry or a factory in a particular area in some small town is always welcome but if that particular small town is fortunate enough to get an industry very often we immediately have the problem that there is not sufficient housing accommodation available there to absorb any increase in population which may take place as a result of employment in a particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be wrong in this, although I hope I am not.  I think one of the <Col N="42" /> problems which can be dealt with by the National Building Agency in relation to industrial development is precisely that problem.  So far as I am concerned I think the money which the Minister wants, the authority to increase the amount of money available from £2 million to £5 million, should be made available to him.  In the course of his statement here the Minister referred to this money as being urgently required.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two points I should like the Minister to deal with when he is replying.  As I understand the position the National Building Agency will, so to speak, take on an assignment, when requested by a particular industry, to provide houses in association with that industry in any particular area.  I should like to know from the Minister how is the order of priority established by the Agency?  If there are competing requests from industrialists, different industries or different parts of the country is it the object of the Agency to try to fulfil all demands made on them by the industry regardless of the geographical location of where the houses are required? If that is their position&mdash;and I imagine it would be their desire to fulfil all demands made on them&mdash; nevertheless they are only going to have a limited amount of money made available to them so how do they settle the question of priorities if there is a competition for their services?  I should be glad if the Minister would give us some information about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in the Dáil there was some comment with regard to the information available about the activities of the National Building Agency.  On page 2 of the Minister's statement here today he said:</P>
    <P>I have informed the Dáil that I intend to ask the Agency to publish an annual report giving full information about their activities and to arrange that this report will be available to the public.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is right in adopting that attitude.  Anybody responsible for spending public moneys voted by the Oireachtas should of course make the fullest possible information available <Col N="43" /> to the public.  I believe I am correct in saying that there was also comment in the other House in connection with the date of publication of the National Building Agency's reports and that on one occasion the situation arose where two annual reports became available at the same time.  In addition to the Minister requesting the Agency to make the fullest possible information available in their reports and to have those reports available to the public he should do whatever is open to him to ensure that the reports are made available to the public as soon as possible after the close of each calendar year.</P>
    <P>Apart from that I do not think I have anything else to say on the Bill. I am sure some Senators will have other points of view and will require further information.  So far as I go it is right that this money should be made available.  The establishment of the National Building Agency has the support of all shades of political opinion in this country.  I do not know whether I am being too optimistic in this or not but I think the establishment of the agency certainly promises, if in fact it has not already happened in some instances, that in relation to some aspects of our housing problem in this country we will be able to cut a certain amount of corners and cut out a certain amount of red tape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all the Members of the Seanad are well aware of the great necessity for an expansion in the housing field and we welcome any programmes that can be initiated by the various people who have responsibility for housing.  I may say, as a member of two local authorities, when the National Building Agency was first mooted I had reservations about precisely what their functions would be.  I saw them as a kind of semi-State body intervening between the Government and the local authorities. I had certain reservations about what they might do and what they might not do.  There was an underlying fear that possibly they would eventually take over control of housing and that the purpose of local authorities as housing authorities would begin to be eroded <Col N="44" /> or eventually would disappear.  I must say from my experience in the matter and my knowledge of the great necessity for housing I had to adjust my views.  In spite of my misgivings I must now acknowledge that the National Building Agency have done very valuable work in a field that local authorities would find it very hard to operate in.</P>
      <P>We have in house building, from the local authority point of view, possibly a considerable amount of land purchase or compulsory purchase orders that we have to get through.  The National Building Agency have come between us and what we might describe as red tape for the purpose of facilitating the quick building of acceptable type houses to meet very special purposes, whether they be in the industrial field or in some other field.  Their limit has always been a lack of finance.  I do not wish to say more than is necessary on this Bill but in my opinion the NBA are playing a very important role in the inbetween activities of what they can do and what the local authorities can do. They have facilitated the building of houses for industrial workers and industrial management that the councils could never have aspired to it in the same length of time.</P>
      <P>Having had experience of both sides, it is my opinion that the NBA should be encouraged to go ahead with the work they are doing because they have done very important work and it is only now that they are getting recognition for that work.  The suggestion of giving them increased capital is a very good one and I commend it to the House.</P>
      <P>Having been a member of two local authorities, I have seen the work of the NBA in progress and in spite of my misgivings at the beginning, I am now convinced that they are playing a very important role and deserve the support of anybody who is interested in an extension of the housing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Building Agency have fulfilled the role they were originally intended to fulfil.  They have provided houses both for those engaged in industry and for State employees.  I have known of many occasions on <Col N="45" /> which a factory would be looking for a key man but having found him, he would be reluctant to take up the position if there was not a good house provided for him.  The industry might have used up most of its financial resources in developing and could not be expected to provide money for housing at the particular time.  It is in cases of that kind that the NBA were able to come to their aid and build whatever houses were necessary.  The Agency have been a godsend to industries throughout the country.  They have also meant a great deal to State employees, particularly members of the Garda Síochána for whom houses were provided in different areas.  This meant that if a garda were transferred from a particular place where he had had a house provided for him, he would get the same sort of house in the area to which he was being assigned.</P>
      <P>The National Building Agency have set a headline in cases where the private sector were not making any effort to come in.  Once the Agency get started on a worthwhile project, private builders realise the demand there is for houses in the area and they follow suit.  I am thinking of one place near Leixlip where the NBA were asked to build 60 houses but as soon as the project was started two private builders, realising the demand for housing in the area, went in and built quite a few houses there.  Much the same sort of thing happened in Trim.  The demand for houses there was very great because of the numbers of people who came to work in the town for the Board of Works and on the Boyne Drainage Scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to see local authorities making more use of the NBA in helping their own housing programmes, particularly in towns where there are industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee were set up recently to encourage emigrants to come home from England and other places but we cannot expect them to come back if houses are not readily available for them.  In granting this money to the NBA, we are helping industries to encourage key men to come back when there is a need for them.  Many English-based industries have been set up here <Col N="46" /> and the management of these industries would like to be able to bring over Irish personnel already working for them in England to man the factories here and in these cases, also, the NBA will prove invaluable.</P>
    <P>I suppose the biggest achievement that the NBA have had has been the Ballymun scheme.  This has been described as a satellite town: it is probably one of the biggest prefabricated schemes in Europe.  It was a tremendous undertaking to engage three builders to come together to do that job.  We know what an advantage it has been to Dublin.  It will relieve the housing situation to some extent in providing an efficient, quick system of building.  I could not see an undertaking of that size or a building scheme completed in the time which it took to complete the Ballymun scheme.  The Agency brought in a new idea of prefabrication in that scheme which, as I can see myself, has been followed by other builders both in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As well as encouraging builders to build, they have set a headline in the new techniques in the light of cheapening the cost of production and showing a quick way of building which is, in some cases, a better system.  At least they aim to be leaders in their field. Where they have seen some idea which is worthwhile abroad, they are not afraid to encourage it here.  We all learn easier by example than by having to read or hear about a certain subject. I should like to recommend this Bill to the House in order to allocate extra money and to give the encouragement and the go-ahead to the NBA to continue the good work.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a member of a local authority, I welcome the present Bill.  I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing it. The NBA are engaged in undertaking very big schemes at the present time. Something which impressed me about that Agency was the manner in which they could get work under way.  We in the local authorities failed to do this.  I should like to compliment the NBA on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that <Col N="47" /> he intends to ask the Agency to publish annual reports giving full details of their activities.  I welcome this because too few of our people know all about the NBA and their activities.  I compliment the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>Some members spoke about the provision of houses for members of the Garda Síochána.  This is something which the Garda Síochána would welcome very much.  Moving about from county to county and from station to station, they find it difficult at times to get housing accommodation.  The NBA are serving a very useful purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those who welcomed this Bill and to pay a tribute to the work of the NBA, particularly in the field of industry.  I can speak with knowledge because of my association with the mining industry.  I confirm the fact that the building of houses contiguous to the substantial mining operation in Tipperary has been a significant factor in inducing outside technical personalities to come to live in the area, and without such personnel it would have been impossible to carry on this particular industry which gives employment to 500 or 600 men.</P>
      <P>I hope the work of the Agency will advance in Limerick shortly due to developments which we anticipate in the Shannon Estuary.  I can think of no more appropriate setting for the work of the NBA than that of providing houses for key personnel for major industrial developments, including the establishment of a smelter in that area. It is obvious if we are having major industrial developments in rural areas we must have some agency other than the local authorities or private enterprise to supply much needed houses. Housing has now become a vital factor in the establishment and development of new industrial projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support wholeheartedly the purposes of this Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that in the nonindustrial field the work of the NBA might be extended to include the army, if it does not already do so.  We have <Col N="48" /> the problem in Limerick in regard to the housing of military personnel.  It is unfair to expect local authorities who are already in many cases overburdened in their endeavours to provide houses for their own citizens, to take on the burden of housing military personnel.  I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly and assure the Minister that he can be sure of the support of all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I join in supporting the proposals contained in this Bill.  I have been impressed by what I have heard from all sides of the House.  I personally have no way of forming a subjective judgment on the performance of the Agency except through the sort of information that was made available to us here by the speakers who have spoken from the different sides of the House.  The idea is clearly an excellent one.  It is not to be carping, but helpful, in employing such critical powers as I can bring to bear on this situation to say that there has been a bad situation from the point of view of making an assessment objectively, as distinct from subjectively, as to the efficiency of the operation up to now that, until the Minister had told the Dáil of his intentions for the future, information had not been made available to the public or to Members of the Dáil or of this House which would enable them to judge whether the resources made available to the Agency have been well applied and properly invested.</P>
      <P>I have absolutely no reason to believe they have not been well invested or properly applied.  I have no evidence about the matter.  When the Second Reading of the Bill which it is proposed now to amend was introduced in 1963, at column 618 of the Official Report, the Minister introducing it stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind that from now on the agency will have available valuable and growing assets in the form of mortgages secured on houses for the construction of which it has advanced money.  Indeed, I feel that in due course these assets should constitute acceptable security for the <Col N="49" /> purpose of raising loans even without the backing of a State guarantee.</P>
    <P>Recently, in response to a question asked by a Deputy in the Dáil as to certain aspects of this Agency&mdash;that question being the yield earned on the total capital employed&mdash;the answer given by the Minister to the House was to mean, in the light of the words used by the Minister when introducing the Second Stage of the Bill originally, that the yield is not applicable as this is a non-profit making organisation.</P>
    <P>It may be that this organisation should be a non-profit making organisation if in fact this Agency are merely to provide subsidies where subsidies are needed.  We should not have a limited company&mdash;not a public company&mdash;whose accounts have not been available to the public since the formation of this Agency.  A private company concerned to make profit should be the instrument for administering this subsidy. If it were a profit-making agency and came to any group of financiers with the sense of their duties to the taxpayers whose moneys have alternative uses for them, the moneys would not be forthcoming if the financiers were told that they were not a profit-making organisation, apart from the fact that such a company should in fact be wound up under the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and I am very encouraged indeed to hear it, that he intends&mdash;obviously having become concerned about this&mdash;to give fuller information in the future.  I would have found it easier to be more enthusiastic in supporting the proposals, which in any case I do support, if at this stage the Minister had been able to give the information which is now available as to the performance of this Agency.  From the Minister's statements which I have read with interest, this Agency seems to have a number of different functions.  I share the view that has been expressed, particularly by Senator Russell, that the activities of the Agency should be extended to such matters as efficiently to provide accommodation for soldiers.</P>
    <P>While this is so, I suggest&mdash;I am, I hope, being relevant but I shall have <Col N="50" /> to abide by your ruling on this&mdash;that this might be reorganised so that there would be a company which were concerned to make a profit.  A company which were concerned to administer subsidies and a company concerned to make profit would have different tests applied of their performance.</P>
    <P>It might not be a company properly formed as a limited company at all. Incidentally, on this matter I would have thought that the Minister for Finance would have a considerable interest and indeed a duty here, because under section 7 of the 1963 Act it is provided that all moneys advanced to this Agency must be repaid by this Agency to the Central Fund.  It is surprising to me that for so long public moneys have been made available in this way with less information made available to the public concerning them than a small limited company would be obliged to disclose to the public if this were a company registered in Britain.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give thought to the possible amendment of the Act so as to provide that the returns be made to him by this Agency would be not necessarily in the form complying with the Companies Acts but would contain distinctions between the different types of turnover, whether the money went to the firm or whether it went to the employee by mortgage. There are considerable sums being made available by the taxpayer, sums which have alternative uses for the benefit of the taxpayer, and we must always bear in mind in the interests of the taxpayer that these considerable sums are being provided to assist industry and for the establishment of industry.  I have been an enthusiastic supporter of that policy since its inception and I think that perhaps we might be reaching the stage when a sort of cost benefit analysis might be in the interest of the public to be applied to the sums being invested, and if there are sums being advanced to firms, as it appears from the statements made to us, firms that are already receiving grants, firms already very well capitalised, I should like to see the benefit of skilled financiers being made available to the Agency.  As to the arrangements <Col N="51" /> made with regard to these sums, I do not see why the company should get the benefit of the growth in value of the buildings, built no doubt with great efficiency by this Agency.  I think this interest should go to the community.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill because it shows the sincerity of the Government in trying to provide the necessary finance for the continuation of our expanding housing programme. I welcome it too because local authorities have discovered that the Building Agency are very important to them because due to a lack of contractors for building for local authorities there were many instances where builders undertook the building of houses and were unable to complete the schemes and left the local authority in a mess, but local authorities who use the Building Agency can be assured that their schemes will be completed and at a competitive cost.</P>

      <P>There is not a lot for me to do except to thank Seanad Éireann for its reception of this Bill. I am glad that it has been unanimously agreed that the borrowing power of the National Building Agency should be extended for this purpose from £2 million to £5 million which is expected to be required within the next five years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins asked how the Agency would decide the order of priority if there were a number of competing requests for the building of houses in the context of a limited amount of capital.  So far this has not arisen.  The Agency has been in a position to comply with any requests that were made for its services.  It is, of course, to be hoped that this position will continue in the future.  Of course it is possible to conceive circumstances in which it might be necessary to make a choice as between different proposals.  There are no definite regulations laid down for the exercising of such a choice but I would imagine that the thing to do, if such an eventuality should arise, would be to base one's decision, first <Col N="52" /> of all, on the order in which the requests were received, subject to the advice of a body such as the IDA with regard to the urgency of the different requests.  However, it is something which has not arisen and which we hope will not arise.  We hope it will be possible to comply with all requests that are made as it has been up to now.</P>
    <P>It is true that there was an occasion on which the annual report was not issued at the proper time with the result that two annual reports were made on the same date.  I explained in the other House that this was due to inadvertence.  It was due to the fact that there happened to be a change in personnel in the Building Agency management at the time when this report should have been made.  I am reasonably sure that will not happen again.</P>
    <P>Again with regard to the question of the reports, it is true that the accounts have not been published up to now, but at the same time it is not strictly accurate to say that the information has not been available in regard to money expended.  They have been laid on the Table of the two Houses of the Oireachtas so that they have been at least available to Members of the Oireachtas and of course they have been scrutinised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, with comments. Of course information could have been extracted by means of Dáil Questions, but it is now proposed to request the Agency to publish a report in future.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell asked if it was possible for the Agency to build houses for Army personnel as well as for gardaí.  No such request has been made up to the present, but the Agency are not precluded from providing such houses.  If a request is made the Agency will look into it.  However, the Department of Defence have got their own programme for the building of married quarters for Army personnel.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Senator FitzGerald that the NBA have not been operating as a profit-making company, this is true.  A decision had to be made as to whether to aim at providing houses at the lowest possible cost or with a view to making a profit.  The Agency have <Col N="53" /> been operating on the basis of providing accommodation at the lowest possible cost to the industries concerned and the individuals who are going to work in the industries, and personally I think that this was the correct decision to make.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported <Col N="54" /> without recommendation, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
