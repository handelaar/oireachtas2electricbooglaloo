I suggest to the Seanad that as a protest, unless the Leader of the House gives an indication of withdrawal of his remarks, that we should not accept the Order of Business and we should divide on it.  I do not wish to put the House to that trouble and I feel sure that the Leader of the House would welcome an opportunity of saying a few words in regard to this matter.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Statutory Instruments: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Select Committee be appointed to consider every Statutory Instrument laid, or laid in draft before Seanad Éireann, in pursuance of a statutory requirement with a view to determining whether the special attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to it on any of the following grounds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that it imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains provisions requiring payments to be made to the Exchequer or any Government Department or to any local or public authority in consideration of any licence or consent, or of any services to be rendered, or prescribes the amount of any such charge or payments;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Statute under which it is made;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  that it purports to have retrospective effect where the <Col N="478" /> parent Statute confers no express authority so to provide;</P>
    <P>(iv)  that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay either in the laying of it before Seanad Éireann or in its publication;</P>
    <P>(v)  that for any special reason its form or purport calls for elucidation.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(2)  That the Select Committee consist of nine members of whom three shall form a quorum.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Select Committee have power to report from time to time and to require any Government Department or other instrument making authority concerned to submit a memorandum explaining any Statutory Instrument which may be under their consideration or to depute a representative to appear before them as a witness for the purpose of explaining any such Statutory Instrument.</P>
    <P>(4)  That it be the duty of the Committee before reporting that the special attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to any Statutory Instrument to afford to any Government Department or other instrument making authority concerned therewith an opportunity of furnishing orally or in writing such explanations as the Department or authority may think fit and the Select Committee have power to report to Seanad Éireann from time to time, any memoranda submitted or other evidence given to them in explanation of any Statutory Instrument.</P>
    <P>(5)  That the explanatory memoranda submitted to the Select Committee appointed by Resolution of 7th July, 1965, subsequent to its Report of 19th March, 1969, be referred to the Committee for examination and report.</P>
    <P>This motion proposes the setting up of a Select Committee on Statutory Instruments similar to those which have been functioning since 1948.  The interval of twenty years has established the need for such a Committee and the need grows as statutes tend more and more to call for more delegated legislation.  This being so, it has been customary, in moving the <Col N="479" /> motion, not to make remarks on it. However, as Senators may have noticed the present motion differs from those moved in previous Seanads.  One change is proposed and I feel I should draw attention to this.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, one of the grounds on which the Committee might draw the special attention of the House to an instrument has been the fact that it was made in pursuance of an enactment excluding it from challenge from the courts.  The term of reference was that an order &ldquo;is made in pursuance of an enactment containing specific provision excluding it from challenge in the courts either at all times or after the expiration of a specified period&rdquo;.  In the 20 odd years this Committee has been functioning no such instrument has come to notice.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have been concerned that this particular reference might possibly be in conflict with the Constitution. The essential function of the Statutory Instruments Committee is to draw the attention of the Seanad to anything that might interfere with constitutional rights.  It is a function of the Houses to ensure that a proposed statute does not interfere with people's constitutional rights.  It would be unfortunate if the Committee, whose function it is to protect constitutional rights, were itself found to be in breach of a constitutional position.  There seems to be no necessity for this particular provision and I am sure Senators will realise that the Committee could be in a very invidious position as a watchdog as to whether a Statutory Instrument is within the Constitution if its own terms of reference were in doubt and, therefore, this provision has been excluded from the terms of reference of the present motion.  I commend the proposal, as it stands, to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second this motion and to support Senator Sheldon in everything he has said.  Looking over the works of the last Committee on Statutory Instruments, it is evident that they played a very useful part and if the House accepts the motion before it, it will greatly enchance the work of the Committee <Col N="480" /> in playing a very useful role in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to support this motion and to support what Senator Sheldon has said in relation to dropping some of the terms of reference.  In supporting the motion, I should like to say that this Committee which work silently in the background are, nevertheless, a very important Committee in that they survey with the very able help of the civil servants in this House the Statutory Instruments brought in.</P>
      <P>I have been on this Committee since 1954, under the chairmanship first, of Professor O'Brien and now of Senator Sheldon, and I have been very struck by the power and authority in the background of this Committee, due in no uncertain measure to the Chairman and successive civil servants who have been doing the drudgery work in reading through every Statutory Instrument and making recommendations.</P>
      <P>I have been particularly struck by the way in which the drafters of certain Statutory Instruments give evidence and the effect of this has been very good in relation to the various Departments.  During the years of their existence, this Committee have had a very great effect, with the willing co-operation of the vast majority of civil servants in every Department. They have been very effective in tidying up the phrasing of the various Statutory Instruments and they introduced the habit of having an explanatory memorandum attached to every Statutory Instrument for the benefit of the public.  I therefore support this motion proposed by Senator Sheldon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 19, to delete &ldquo;may from time to time&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall, at the commencement of each financial year or as near as is practicable to such date,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as originally framed, allowed local authorities to decide whether they wished to make schemes to provide for the waiver of rates.  We believe that it would be more appropriate to put an obligation on each local authority to draw up a scheme at the beginning of each financial year, and in the making of that scheme the local authority would naturally prepare an estimate of how much it would cost within that financial year.  If they consider that that cost might be excessive or might be an undue burden on the remainder of the ratepayers, they could appeal to the Minister to allow them Minister and ask for permission to opt <Col N="482" /> to suspend the carrying out of that scheme within that financial year.  This is the purpose of amendment No. 4 and it is for this reason that I should like to have amendment No. 4 taken in conjunction with amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>Already this year, several local authorities have opted out of the making of a scheme because it was feared that it would impose an excessive charge on the remaining ratepayers. Our worry was that these local authorities and perhaps other local authorities might never again attempt to make a scheme at the beginning of any financial year or assess how much such a scheme would be likely to cost them in that year.  We thought it would be better if each local authority were obliged under the Bill to set about making a scheme and, having made it, to assess how much it would cost, and if they thought it would cost too much they could ask the Minister's consent to suspending the carrying out of the scheme for that year.  This would in no way allow them to forget about it and at the beginning of the next year they would be again obliged to make a scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, much to be said in favour of the point of view suggested.  However, it would be destroying what is the real spirit of the Bill and that is that local authorities must be masters of their own affairs. I should much prefer to see a local authority consider their own scheme, consider what it would cost and consider whether they have adequate public supplement to put it into effect. Very often local authorities have the habit of sliding out of their responsibilities by saying that the Minister will not allow them to do such and such or that the Minister insists that they do such and such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, if Senator Boland's amendment is accepted the local authorities must accept this particular course and, having adopted it, it should, of course, be put into effect. But then they may say they cannot afford to do so, thereby, perhaps, falling down on their social obligations, and they might try to make the Minister the keeper of their consciences. They might come to the <Col N="483" /> out.  I do not know if that would be right.  The Minister might say: &ldquo;You cannot opt out&rdquo;, and they could go back to the ratepayers saying that the Minister says such and such.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to give local authorities, even if only in a small way, a sense of responsibility, a sense of responsibility which I should hope to see growing from time to time as more and more power and authority are given to local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is generally realised by all Senators in the House, but as the section stands the local authorities could not implement any scheme without having the consent of the Minister. It can hardly be argued, therefore, that local authorities are completely the masters of their own affairs even as the Bill was originally drafted, because the Minister retained his entitlement to alter any scheme submitted to him by any local authority.  I do not know whether Senator Nash is a member of a local authority but I think I can fairly say, having discussed this with many people who are serving on local authorities at the moment, as I am myself, that they would prefer to see local authorities obliged to set about the task each year of looking at the type of people who might get relief under this scheme, seeing whether they could economically carry it out and if they felt they could not, applying to the Minister for power to suspend it for a year.</P>
      <P>The feeling was that if they made a case to the Minister that it would create a demand of 1/- or 1/6 in the £ on their rates in that year, the Minister would be intelligent enough to say: &ldquo;Very well, I will allow you to suspend that scheme for this year but at the next estimates meeting you must again prepare a costing on the scheme to see if you might be able to prepare a scheme, perhaps not on such a lavish scale&rdquo;.  Every year local authorities must devote themselves to the task and lend themselves to the task of seeing whether they could assist in providing relief for those needy classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Nash said, this piece of legislation is permissive as far as local authorities are concerned.  Each local authority are entitled to have a scheme depending entirely on their circumstances and nobody knows this better than the local authorities themselves. If the local authority are poor this year they will be poor next year, so the idea of making it mandatory at this stage in relation to those schemes would not be satisfactory.  Many of us who are members of local authorities know the resentment there is at the central Government interfering with matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable to us because we are quite satisfied that the local authorities &mdash; quite a large number of them have already drawn up schemes along the lines suggested by the Minister &mdash; will draw up schemes in the knowledge of their own localities and the circumstances of their own areas.  There is nothing in this amendment in my opinion which would help in any way because if we are to force local authorities to make schemes &mdash; this is what the amendment means &mdash; there is nothing to stop them saying: &ldquo;OK, we will keep within the law, we will have a scheme but we will have the minimum amount of relief granted here&rdquo;.  We want local authorities to realise there is an obligation so far as people living within their areas are concerned and they must decide on the type of scheme best suited to their own localities.  As far as the Minister is concerned, this amendment is not acceptable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does local authorities, and local authority members generally, less than justice when he suggests that if they were obliged to make schemes they would consequently rebel and make schemes which would provide for the minimum amount of relief possible. I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary can fairly claim this has been the experience of the Department of Local Government, at least in the recent past.  Their feeling was that this would serve more as a guideline to the local authorities, that they would have to bend themselves to this task every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> The argument has been made, and I do not want to be contentious about this, that in this section as it stands the Minister has seen to it that the local authority members are the ones who must decide whether a scheme is to be made, who is to be included and who is not to be included.  Consequently, any complaints which arise out of the making or non-making of a scheme can be levelled only at local authority members &mdash; that the Minister for Local Government, who is the person bringing in this Bill presumably as one of the measures which are resulting from the many studies on the problems on rates, can fairly wash his hands of the problem and say: &ldquo;I had nothing to do with the scheme or the non-making of the scheme in your local authority area.  If there is any fault that fault is that of each of the members of your own local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We wanted to bring about a situation where those local authority members, responsible or otherwise, would have to draw up a scheme each year. The Parliamentary Secretary might be able to envisage a situation where, at least in the opinion of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary if not in the opinion of all political groups, one particular local authority were irresponsible in the eyes of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Let us consider for a moment such an irresponsible local authority who might decide for reasons of their own, for reasons of laziness, for reasons of popularity to keep the rates as low as possible, not to bother making this scheme.  They might decide not to do so because they did not have the social conscience spoken about by Senator Nash and they might decide they would not bother making such a scheme.  We want to avoid such a situation where such an irresponsible local authority, or indeed a responsible local authority which had not got a proper crusading conscience, might decide not to bother making this scheme, might indeed forget about making this scheme because they had not made it this year and it never again would come before them. We want a situation to be brought about where the making of this scheme must come before each local authority each year and they must consider and examine their own consciences, their <Col N="486" /> collective consciences, to see whether they could fairly implement it in that year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The strange thing is that probably for the same line of argument as Senator Boland has, I am opposed to those amendments.  The whole purpose of any member of a local authority is to serve the public and for that purpose he stands for election and goes to a certain amount of trouble in getting elected.  I must say in most local authorities the members devote their time and service to serving the public to the best of their ability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Senator Boland argues that some of those people may be lacking in social conscience and if so the Minister should be keeper of their consciences.  That rather reminds me of the argument of the British Lord Chancellor always being keeper of the king's conscience and as a result very frequently in England in olden days the State certainly abused the ordinary individual No private individual could sue the State because he could not sue the king.  The king had no conscience &mdash; it was the lord chancellor who kept his conscience.</P>
      <P>I should much prefer to see a local authority which have not a social conscience, or the majority of whose members not having a social conscience, develop it gradually, progressively and, if you like, being shamed into it by other local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already, before this Bill becomes law, and in anticipation of it becoming law, quite a number of local authorities have adopted it and I do not think you will teach anybody by pressurising them or by forcing them. Example is the best form of teacher. I would hope there would be very few, if any, local authorities who would not adopt a scheme and that those few who would be left, ultimately, by reason of the example given by the majority, would be shamed into adopting it.  I would rather have them learn than forced into it. A social conscience is something you cannot force on a person.  It is one <Col N="487" /> which he must develop or which a body must develop within themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is, as we all know, that there is a mandatory obligation on local authorities to collect the rates as far as possible.  That is the current position. What Senator Boland is asking is that each local authority continue to collect their rates, with the exception that rates will not be leviable on certain classes clearly defined and decided on democratically by each local authority.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash has made the point, and I think there is a good deal in what he said, that he would like to leave it to the local authorities responsible to decide whether they want to implement such a scheme.  All those local authorities, if this amendment is accepted, will still have the right to decide the type of scheme they want to bring in, but the uniformity which the Minister declared in his reply on the Second Stage of the Bill to be desirable throughout all local authorities, will not be achieved unless the Minister is prepared to make it mandatory on all local authorities to bring in such a scheme.  In fact this I think is what Senator Boland wishes.</P>
      <P>I do not go with Senator Nash's point about waiting for the social conscience of some local authorities to catch up on the others.  Speaking as a member of a local authority, I think that it would be far better if all the local authorities were placed in the same position, that they would collect their rates as heretofore with the exception of certain classes who would be exempt under a particular scheme drawn up by the local authority according to their own ideas.  The point made by the Minister on the Second Stage is a good one, that there should be uniformity throughout the local authorities.  There is nothing new in this principle, and I would support Senator Boland and ask the House to support him also on this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">

      <P>I do not think that the Minister made the point that the schemes should have uniformity.  Conditions would surely be different in <Col N="488" /> different local authority areas, financially and otherwise.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow a local authority, if they so wish, to draw up a scheme, and this scheme would have certain guidelines.  Each scheme would be drafted and adopted as each local authority decided in their own wisdom, and it is not the intention of the Minister to force them into doing something that they do not want.</P>
      <P>Tributes have been paid to the members of local authorities, and I want to join in those tributes because I think they give great service.  They are best fitted to know the circumstances in their own locality and the vast majority of the members have a social conscience.  During the years they have been helping in other ways. I do not think that this amendment will help in the least.  Rather it will hinder, because I know the resentment that there is in the local authorities to being told to do something.  We have established the precedent of where local authorities have operated permissive legislation of this kind and all of them have come into line after some time because of the example set by their neighbours and their initiative. As I said earlier, as far as we are concerned the principle of this amendment is not acceptable to us.</P>

Whether this is due to a fault in the acoustics or to the present epidemic of laryngitis running through the country I do not know.  Anyway, I would support Senator Boland on this, but I think that the point has not been emphasised sufficiently that if you allow in any particular year a local authority to opt out until the following year and they must make arrangements to carry out the provisions of this Bill, then this is giving them an incentive to adopt the scheme.  I cannot hear very well, but this is what I understand to be the meaning of the amendment: that it would give the local authorities an incentive to adopt this section.  I have no doubt that if this amendment is carried into effect the result aimed at in <Col N="489" /> the Bill will be far better implemented since the incentive will be there for the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Where this was rejected the reason was that there was a financial commitment in it for local authorities and the Minister who prepared the scheme knew that there was a weak section of the community in every local authority who required financial help with regard to rates.  That is why the scheme was prepared and sent to the local authorities in the first instance.  There is bound to be some contribution made from the Central Fund to the local authorities if the Minister for Local Government thinks, as we all know, that there is a weaker section of people clearly specified in the Bill such as people in receipt of old age pensions and non-contributory pensons &mdash; and we have an amendment in to include people with an income of less than £300 &mdash; and that is the reason that we press the amendments and feel that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary should accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in the position of being opposed to the amendment chiefly because I think that the section is bad and that the amendment makes it worse.  The point I should like to make is that granting local authorities the right to provide for the waiver of all or portion of the rates for certain sections or classes of ratepayers is a principle which seems to me to be a bad one.  If rates are due as assessed and if for the moment we accept that there are certain sections unable to pay, this should be a community charge, not a local authority charge.  I believe that to waive <Col N="490" /> portion of their rates is a way of giving a concealed subsidy to such people.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the class or classes of people involved might be in greater or lesser numbers from county to county, and it might well be that they are in greater numbers in the poorer counties; therefore the method of distributing this concealed subsidy to them in relation only to local ratepayers is unjust, because it may well be that the local ratepayers are far less able to stand the burden than the taxpayers, direct or indirect.</P>
      <P>The whole section is aimed at allowing local authorities to transfer portion of what ought to be a national burden on to the local ratepayer.  I believe that the income tax is far more justly levied and the weight falls more evenly, more uniformly, more equitably, than the rates, because the rates are far less well distributed, calculated and assessed. Therefore I think that the section is bad, but the amendment is worse, because the section allows the rating authority from time to time to make such a scheme whereas the amendment demands that they shall do so.  Therefore I will oppose the amendment and also, indeed, the section.</P>

      <P>Táimid i bhfabhair rialtais áitiúil no nílimid i bhfabhair rialtais áitiúil.  The idea of a local authority is, or should be, to give as much authority as possible to the body most competent to judge in their own particular area, in other words, the local authority, and the less interference we have with them, the more power we give to them, the better.  If this amendment were accepted we would be at the stage where we were dictating to the local authority, especially by the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, whenever they go into this matter of the waiver of the rates.  We would be dictating to them on how they would make any necessary changes.  We would be saying to them that at the beginning of each financial year, or as soon as practicable thereafter, they must do something, instead of letting it to their own good sense, their competent and sympathetic study of all the conditions in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of allowing them their own discretion, as we were about to do it <Col N="491" /> in the section, the amendment would say that they shall do it instead of that they may.  That they may from time to time do this as it stands does not preclude them from exercising their discretion every year if they so wish. In other words, if this amendment were accepted we would be doing this little bit more to curb the power of local authorities to carry out their business as they best know how to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Again not wanting to appear contentious, it seems to me to be a remarkable about-face on the part of speakers from the Government side suddenly to be concerned with giving local authorities as much power as possible to decide their own destinies. Have we not during the past ten or 15 years, in nearly every legislative measure relating to local authorities, made specific rulings making local authorities to carry out certain tasks whether they liked carrying them out or not?  If we were to take it that the idea embodied in the first section is indicative of a change of heart, and that in all future legislation which regulates the manner of the operation of local government in this country local authority members would once again be given the power to decide for themselves on virtually every matter relating to their local authority areas, this would be a welcome departure at which we should have to look very carefully.</P>
      <P>However, looking at the various sections in the Bill, we see the old form returning.  Accordingly, I cannot honestly accept that we are now getting a situation, through this Bill, by which the Government want to give more power to local authority members &mdash; to place more power in their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Have we not enshrined in our Constitution, and indeed has it not been used occasionally by one of our political parties, the creed and the demand that we should cherish all the children of the nation equally?  If we are allowing one local authority to make a scheme and allowing another local authority immediately adjoining not to make a scheme.  I fail to see how we are cherishing equally the <Col N="492" /> widow in the area which is allowed to make a scheme and the widow in the area which is not allowed.  Such a situation might well occur as between the city and the county of Dublin.  In County Dublin, non-contributory widows have been included as people eligible to claim waiver of payment or part-payment of rates.</P>

      <P>I think a discussion of this type would be more appropriate on the proposed Schedule to the Bill or, perhaps, on some later amendments rather than that with which we are concerned at the moment. Here we are concerned with the times at which a local authority should address themselves to the question of making schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for including examples at this stage is to try to point out that if each local authority were obliged to make a scheme I am convinced that then at least old people, widows and those at or below subsistence level, would receive waiver of rates in every area because I do not believe there is any local authority which would fail to include these three groups.  At least then we would have something near uniformity.  I am not suggesting we should force a local authority to adopt a scheme where it might impose a crippling charge on the remaining ratepayers.  I did not suggest that in my Second Reading speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my impression then that the cost would not be great, but as Senator Belton has said, the acoustics here are so bad that I was afterwards quoted as having said it.  I did not think there would be a crippling burden on the <Col N="493" /> remaining ratepayers, but after listening to speakers at a later stage, mainly those from rural areas and from the west, it seems to me that in certain counties the charge could be considerable. What we envisage is that in such an area the local authority could go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;The charge will be very great this year but we think that next year we may not have such a great demand for sanitary services that we will not be able to include a scheme of some type next year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For instance, in Dublin city and county this year a large charge may go on to the rates in respect of a major sewerage scheme.  This is not a scheme which is likely to occur every year and it might be a good reason for the local authorities this year to say to the Minister: &ldquo;We will have a greater demand this year and we may not be able to implement our rates scheme.&rdquo; They will be obliged, then, to set about estimating what the cost of such a scheme would be.  I did not understand Senator Nash when he said that every local authority out of shame will end up adopting a scheme.  This is an urgent, pressing problem in all sections of the community, especially those classes who are in straitened circumstances. We cannot wait until local authorities are shamed by the good acts of their neighbours.</P>

There is not a very great difference between the social conscience of an Irishman living in one part of the country and that of an Irishman living in another unless they want to make political gambits when sometimes they can be very cussed.

      <P>Senator Reynolds, if I understand him correctly, said that the reason this was rejected in some areas was because of financial commitments; in other words, that local authorities who rejected it are really an unkind type of people who say: &ldquo;We will be charitable provided it comes out of somebody else's pocket.&rdquo;  That is a very poor standard and I should be sorry to feel that it is the standard of many local authorities in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Boland says that if the amendments are not carried it will mean we are defaulting on something that is enshrined in the Constitution &mdash; that we cherish all our people equally. The amendments mean we would have the same scheme for every local authority &mdash; that they get no discretion whatever, that the Minister prepares a scheme and says to each local authority that they must adopt it whether they like it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back to my first argument &mdash; and nothing I have heard has caused me to change my mind &mdash; that it should be a gradual and progressive growth of social conscience among every section of our community, from the local urban council to the county council, right up to the very top, and that we owe an obligation to those people who are not well-off.  Therefore, because I feel that it would help a growth of this spirit if we leave discretion to the local authorities, I am still unconvinced by <Col N="495" /> the arguments I have heard in favour of these amendments.</P>

      <P>I should like to suggest to Senator Boland and the House that by forcing each local authority to make a scheme for the waiver of a certain proportion of rates and so on we will not ensure uniformity, because the waiver may be for a tiny sum or for a very large proportion. You could have two neighbouring counties giving different treatment to widow pensioners and so on.  The only way of ensuring uniformity would be if such widows and the other underprivileged sections of the community were assured by the State of adequate pensions under present money values. Then you could ensure they would not require this additional subsidy from the ratepayers which might vary from county to county but would be able to pay what the section calls the &ldquo;rates due&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take up Senator Boland's point that there is a change of heart in regard to this side of the House relating to local authorities and their powers.  There has been no change of heart.  I do not know of any legislation passed in this House in the last 15 years, during which time I have been a member of a local authority, where we tried compulsorily to get the local authorities to do anything.  The only matter I can recall is the Planning Act, where we made it compulsory for them to draw up plans but we did not dictate how they should do this.  We are being quite consistent and I might remind Senators that we have a permissive scheme under the Housing Act whereby local authorities can pay supplementary housing grants both in respect of new houses and for the reconstruction of old houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For years some local authorities did not take part but they have been coming into line, I think, because of the example set by progressive local authorities who adopted the scheme in the early stages and kept it up.  I am open to contradiction on this point but some local authorities even have had a graded scheme.  It is up to them to <Col N="496" /> operate it on the basis of the finances they can collect; if a local authority decide to have a scheme, regulations will be made by the Minister and this will lead to uniformity.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland made reference to the fact that Dublin County Council have drawn up a scheme to include contributory widows.  However, you could have a widow who is in receipt of a contributory pension and yet she might have an income of £2,000 a year and that would surely be wrong. It would be right for the local authority to have uniformity in a case where they had an old age pensioner in one house and a contributory pensioner in the next house whose incomes were the same, but I do not think it should be seriously suggested that this uniformity should be applied in blanket form.  I know people in receipt of contributory pensions who are teachers.</P>

      <P>Perhaps that might be going too far.  We should leave it to the discretion of local authorities and I think most of them will come into line; in fact quite a substantial number have come up with schemes. I do not think anything in this amendment would help in any way because as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said you could have the maximum on one side and the minimum on the other.  There could be a great divergence between two local authorities: one might say that to keep within the limit of the law it would only give the absolute minimum relief.  Let us hope that the social consciences of members of local authorities will be such that maximum reliefs will be given to those who need it.</P>

      <P>The scheme as adopted by Dublin County Council provided for widows' pensions, contributory and non-contributory.  When I read it I raised my eyebrows.  I presumed when it was sent to the Minister for sanction that it was outlined in some way as suggesting a contributory widows' pension where the person was not in receipt of an income of any kind and that this was adopted by the county council.  I was glad to hear <Col N="497" /> the Parliamentary Secretary refer to progressive local authorities.  I am sure both he and the Minister will include Dublin County Council prominently in that group because we were one of the first to adopt this scheme.  We believe that the uniformity we have been speaking about was to provide relief to the worst-off classes, to widows who had no income, to old age pensioners with no other income, to people in receipt of home assistance or disablement allowances with no other income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the point to the arguments put forward by Senator Nash that eventually every local authority will come into line as they have done with supplementary grants.  We must, as a matter of urgency, ensure that relief is provided for the worst-off sections, and it is because of this that the amendments were introduced.  If I had realised that I would have been allowed to make the sort of contribution made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggesting that central taxation would be a more appropriate way of financing the whole scheme, I would not have bothered with the amendment.  I would have introduced amendments of that type if <Col N="498" /> I had known they would not be out of order.</P>

Take, for instance, one local authority with a total population of 30,572 people and of these 3,440 are 70 years of age and upwards. That means that 11.2 per cent of these people would be more than 70 years of age.  That is the type of local authority area I was referring to, while bearing in mind that the average for the whole country of people over 70 is only four per cent.  It would mean that there would be a very heavy burden passed on to ratepayers in the area with the high percentage of old people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of subsection (1) &ldquo;or in respect of hereditaments occupied by a class or classes of persons specified in the scheme whether ratepayers or not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on the Second Reading that on reading this subsection I was not altogether clear that the words were apt to achieve the intentions of the Bill.  I am bound to say that if the Parliamentary Secretary were to indicate any resistance to this amendment I should not press it.  It was designed merely to eliminate any doubt about the persons to be considered and so that it would be open to local authorities to consider the circumstances of ratepayers and the circumstances of occupiers who are not ratepayers.  This is the intention of the Bill and I am not absolutely certain that the words of subsection (1) of section 2 are apt to achieve this purpose.  They may be.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to oppose the amendment I will withdraw it.</P>

      <P>This amendment has nothing to do with the Rent Restrictions Act.  If I am reading my Order Paper correctly, the amendment is to add to the end of subsection (1):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or in respect of hereditaments occupied by a class or classes of persons specified in the scheme whether ratepayers or not.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had some doubt as to whether the scheme could be so drawn as to take in persons who are not ratepayers.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said that he is not accepting this amendment and he made some reference to the <Col N="500" /> rent restriction code.  I would like him to reconsider this in the light of my drawing his attention to the fact that the rent restriction code has absolutely nothing to do with amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>I accept that; I was on a different line but we are advised that there need be no doubt in the Senator's mind in relation to this and that the regulations cover the people about whom he is concerned. That is the legal advice that has been given to us.  Therefore, there is no necessity for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>( ) In any scheme as shall be made by a rating authority provision shall be made for the waiver of all or portion of the rates due to it by the classes as set out in the Schedule to this Act.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 26 is consequential on this debate at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 sets out the classes that I should like to see included in any scheme that might be drawn up in consequence of amendment No. 1 not being accepted.  It would not be obligatory on a rating authority to make a scheme.  However, I do not think that that affects the intent or validity of this amendment to a great extent.  It would oblige any rating authority, in drawing up a scheme, to provide for the consideration of non-contributory old age pensioners, non-contributory widow pensioners <Col N="501" /> and people in receipt of home assistance.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain paragraph (c) of the proposed Schedule.  Those in receipt of home assistance at the time of the setting of the rate are more or less based on the categories suggested in the circular sent out from the Department of Local Government to all local authorities.  However, we thought it would be as well to include the additional restrictions in relation to those in receipt of home assistance because a situation could arise where a person would be in receipt of home assistance for a short period, which might happen to be the period during which the scheme was drawn up and that person might improve his income by going back into very lucrative employment so that for the remaining nine or ten months of the year he would earn more money than many people who would not qualify for relief.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are associated with health authorities know that from time to time people get home assistance for a short period and then go back into lucrative employment, and it is because of this that the condition was added providing for the rating authority to be satisfied that a recipient is not likely to improve his income within the financial year for which waiver has been sought to such an extent as to bring his income outside the income limits of the classes set out in the subsection.</P>
      <P>Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the proposed Schedule provide that people in receipt of contributory old age or widows' pensions would also be eligible for relief if they have no other income save the equivalent of &ldquo;disregarded income&rdquo; as laid down by the Social Welfare Acts, if the recipient is living alone and has no other income or is living with others whose income does not exceed the appropriate amount.  Paragraph (g) provides for those</P>
      <P>not in receipt of any other income save the equivalent of &ldquo;disregarded income&rdquo; as laid down by the Social Welfare Acts...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention for the benefit of <Col N="502" /> Senators and, perhaps, for the benefit of some people in the Department of Local Government who might have wondered how we arrived at this figure of 88 per cent in relation to occupational injuries benefit, that it possibly was because of my bad handwriting that the figure appeared as 88 and not 80.  The figure has not been arrived at by any complicated mathematical formula.</P>
    <P>We were concerned about the tenants of local authority houses and we mentioned this during the debate on Second Reading, but we did not receive any satisfactory answer from the Minister. The feeling was that in paying their rents the tenants of local authority houses were also paying the rates by way of the inclusion in the rent of a provision for rates.  The rent paid by a tenant of a local authority house is in almost every instance a differential rent based on income.  According as the income goes down so does the rent drop providing, of course, that the tenant of the local authority house notifies the local authority concerned his income has fallen.</P>
    <P>We imagine that even in the reduced figure a portion of that reduced sum would still be set aside as being some contribution towards what is called by the local authority the equivalent of rates.  When those tenants went below a certain figure of income per week if they had been the rated occupier of a private house they would no longer be eligible to pay rates according to the scheme.</P>
    <P>We felt that by including those people in this scheme the amount provided for by rates would be abolished. I am rather inclined to think that all classes set out in the proposed Schedule are more or less covered by subsection (3), that is a person whose income in the current financial year is not likely to exceed £300, because I do not imagine, unless in very exceptional circumstances, that any of the classes envisaged would receive an income of more than £300 in any one year unless, perhaps, those in receipt of contributory pensions who had some other income which was the equivalent of disregarded income under the Social Welfare Acts as well.</P>

      <P>This amendment is consistent with amendment No. 1 proposed by the Senator.  Instead of leaving it to the discretion of the local authority to decide to which category they would apply this scheme, he wanted it spelt out in the Bill.  We are opposed to this because the House has already rejected the idea of compulsion within the Bill and the same applies as far as this amendment is concerned.  We are quite happy that the local authorities themselves will cover the necessitous people within their areas in a scheme, and if they do, most of the people in the category referred to by the Senator will be included.  I recall the Senator making the point about local authority tenants on the Second Reading because I was here at the time but I do not know whether the Minister replied to this. The proposal set down by the Minister, the yardsticks by which the local authorities shall adopt a scheme, included people who are tenants of local authority houses.  As a matter of fact I think we have already approved of some of the schemes which include local authority tenants, so he or she is covered.  That deals with amendment No. 26.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some confusion which is possibly caused by the fact that I am not so familiar with this, but it seems to me that the amendment proposed is hard to reconcile with section 4 (2) (d).  The section relates to the powers of the Minister &mdash; that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of sections 2 and 3 and then it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> the considerations to be taken into account by a rating authority in determining the classes of persons or the classes of hereditaments to which such a scheme shall apply;</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's point when he said the idea of this is to give the local authority a certain leeway in this matter, but I find it hard to reconcile this amendment with that because this amendment seems to state the classes which should be taken into account and in the proposed Schedule I notice it does not advert to section 4 (2) (d), so I wonder is it purporting to an amendment in that the finding of the classes would not be left entirely to regulation by the Minister but would be left to regulation by the Minister taking into account the Schedule.  Are these to be read together or is the Schedule an amendment of section 4 (2) (d)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention was that the whole business of how much should be included in the actual Bill and how much should be drawn up by regulation or by order of the Minister should be queried at this point.  There is quite a feeling, and it is becoming more and more prevalent, that the Bill merely outlines the proposals and allows a wide scope to the Minister in the matter of regulations and orders; and there is a feeling that the idea now is to allow a far wider scope than many people would like to see.  It was mainly because of this that the Schedule was suggested and amendment No. 4 entered.  I do not know if this clarifies the position for Senator Miss Bourke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, the intention of Senator McDonald in introducing this amendment was to provide relief for those local voluntary bodies throughout the country who are doing such great work and providing such great service for local communities. Very often they are operating on a shoe-string budget and having to pay rates on their parish hall or community hall often imposes a very great hardship on them.  Any small moneys which they manage to raise usually go towards the cost of providing whatever sort of community effort they are involved in.  This additional charge on them can be quite a considerable burden depending on the size of the hall and whichever local authority area they may or may not be fortunate or unfortunate enough to be placed in.  It was because of this that Senator McDonald felt this would be very worthwhile, to provide a rate relief for organisations, non-profit making bodies, such as those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>He had not in mind private enterprises or dancehall owners. What he had in mind, I think, was that rural areas would have a community centre or parish hall which is being squeezed out as far as dances is concerned, and functions held in it in the line of meetings for cultural, sporting and other objectives specified clearly in amendment No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment makes it clear that they must be non-profit making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a difficulty in this. Though the motive in most cases for such rates being taken off would seem <Col N="507" /> to be a very proper one, the effect of this amendment would not be to amend this Bill but to amend the actual Valuation Act itself under which rates are struck by a local authority. Under the Valuation Act a valuation is not fixed at all on any property which is used exclusively for cultural or social purposes.  If any organisation have a hall or property which they think comes within that definition, and the Department of Local Government or the local authority are not prepared to waive the rate valuation on it, then the society or whoever it is who occupy or own the building or the land can apply to the court.  The whole thing is then heard on evidence.  All the details are brought out and the court comes to a decision as to whether the building is used exclusively for cultural, social or educational purposes.</P>
      <P>To leave this amendment here would mean in all these cases, as I read the amendment, that they must be used exclusively for social, cultural or educational purposes, that if a scheme is made by a local authority, if you have any building whatsoever that is used by non-profit making bodies on these particular lines, it could be used only once a year, once a month or once in six months, but it would be obligatory on the local authority to exclude that building from rates.  I think the effect of this amendment would be to amend a different Act altogether.  I doubt if it would be relevant, and I think it would be improper to discuss it under this Bill.  Thirdly, I would prefer the Schedule stating the purposes for which such buildings are used under the Valuation Act rather than a general obligatory clause on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Nash and myself are not on the same wavelength in this matter.  The idea I have in mind is that in rural Ireland there is a grave need for proper social amenities, and in the past ten years many parish halls or halls perhaps of the ICA, Macra na Feirme or hurling clubs were erected.  The valuation on these buildings is usually between £20 and £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one case where a farming <Col N="508" /> organisation, Macra na Feirme, built a hall.  Last year they paid £150 in rates and just a few miles up the road there was a commercial dance hall with which the parochial hall had to compete, and they could not afford to get the top-class bands they needed to run dances.  In rural Ireland, with its declining population, it is difficult to make these centres pay.  Nevertheless, the need for public recreation and social centres is very great if we are serious about trying to keep people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is difficulty in having these places revalued by the Valuation Office and under the present law it is not possible for local authorities to waive the rates.  I know of one parochial hall in my county where we found a loophole in the scheme and by apportioning a corner of the building and by calling the place a museum and by putting in a few relics here and there, we were able to give that committee, in a completely rural parish in my county, relief of £90 a year.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the empowering of local authorities to grant relief where the imposition of rates would be a hardship on a voluntary committee and to give the local authority power to use their discretion in waiving rates.  This is a more direct way of getting at the problem than by merely applying to the Valuation Office, because if the place looks well the valuation officer will invariably put the normal valuation on the building.</P>
    <P>At the present time, when rates are £3 10s and £4 in the £, this can be a substantial amount.  When a function is held in these halls the organisers must pay turnover tax and with the cost of bands <i>et cetera</i> the profit margin is very low.  The methods by which adequate funds can be raised to provide amenities for boys' clubs are limited and it is imperative that proper accommodation be provided for them.  I should like to see local authorities with power to waive rates when they think fit, and it was for this reason I put down my amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very much to support this amendment, which I feel to be worthy of support. <Col N="509" /> This Bill is intended for the relief of rates for a section of the community on whom payment is a considerable hardship.  Through my connection with the GAA, I have been involved in the matter of making social amenities available in rural Ireland and I am very conscious of the difficulties mentioned by Senator McDonald.  It is quite a job for the group concerned to build the hall or community centre and then the valuation officer comes and puts a very high valuation on it. It has been mentioned that this must be got over through the Valuation Office but we have a situation where certain people are on the dividing line, those who might or might not be entitled to relief in the payment of rates and it might be a hardship on them to pay the rates.  On the other hand, we might have a community centre perhaps doing very well who are able to pay their rates and yet they might get a waiver.  We would need to be very careful on this point.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the problem and should like to do what I can for genuine social centres who are carrying out what they were set up to do, but we must remember there may be a number of such centres operating under the guise of social centres and yet they might be commercial propositions at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to address the House on this matter, about which I do not know very much, but I should like to draw the attention of Senators to a problem which arises due to the fact that the Valuation Office has to be operated where properties occupied for charitable purposes come to be transferred to persons who no longer operate them for such purposes.  It may be that the existing machinery with regard to the revision of valuation in these cases means that local authorities will lose rates because, I think, it depends on whether certain authorities become aware that the property is no longer being given over to charitable purposes. This scheme depends on annual information being provided to the authority with regard to the circumstances of the occupiers and if this annual information is not provided <Col N="510" /> these people are not caught into the net of ratepayers for perhaps quite a substantial period of time.  This depends very much on where the property is situated.  For example, in Dublin a property might cease to be a church and yet it would be quite a considerable time before the new occupiers were rated.</P>
      <P>It is open to the Houses of the Oireachtas in a Bill of this kind to amend another code if appropriate, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this amendment in the light of the possibility that under the existing scheme there may be a loss in rates to local authorities, a loss which is benefiting people who ought to pay rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know of cases of genuine hardship involved in the categories mentioned by Senator McDonald, certainly those who live in rural Ireland.  I might mention that an interdepartmental committee have been sitting on this question of local taxation and finance and in their second report on exemptions and remissions of rates they dealt fully with this question.  It is under consideration at the moment and it may mean the amendment of the Valuation Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very different problem; it is to help necessitous people who year in year out have had to pay rates. Formerly when local authorities found they could not collect the amount, they had to write the rates off.  We are now endeavouring to allow local authorities to make a scheme whereby these needy people will not be harassed by getting demand notes and by the rate collector calling on a number of occasions during the year: that is the real purpose of this Bill and it is not appropriate at this stage to extend it to cover people mentioned by Senator McDonald.  This is a big problem, so great that the committee who were sitting on it went into it in the fullest way possible and referred specifically to the whole question of exemption and remission of rates.  Their report has been published and is under consideration, and if the Government decide to do something about it they will consider an amendment of the Valuation <Col N="511" /> Acts rather than the Local Government Act.  Therefore, it is not possible for me to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be happy to see local authorities given power to waive rates; they must strike the rates and if they take it off one sector they must put it on to another.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4).</P>
      <P>It seemed to me that the onus of making or of not making a scheme was being put on the shoulders of members of local authorities and that if the remaining ratepayers who had to bear the cost of providing this waiver to the people who are eligible for relief complained about the additional cost they would be very quickly told that it was their own local authority members who had taken the steps of imposing this additional charge upon them and that it had nothing to do with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should have liked to suggest, as amendment No. 9 would have done had it not been ruled out of order, that in some way after a certain costing there should have been some assessment or reassessment of the situation to see if some part of the cost could have been met in some way other than through the rates.  However, as this might be taken as imposing a potential charge on central funds, we could not be more specific in amendment No. 8. Indeed this was the reason we introduced amendment No. 9.  It might not be a bad idea, however, if amendment <Col N="512" /> No. 8 were accepted.  It would mean that the Minister would order as to how the cost of a scheme was to be met and, indeed, if at some subsequent date the Minister was able to devise some marvellous scheme whereby some of the cost or all of it was met in some way other than by rates, this amendment written into the Act ought to help him to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot find myself in agreement with this because it purports to take powers from Parliament and give them to the Minister.  Thereby it proposes a bad precedent.  Subsection (4) sets out how the cost is to be met:</P>
      <P>The cost of implementing a scheme under this section shall form part of the expenses of a local authority for the purposes of any provision relating to the determining, making, levying and assessment of rates.</P>
      <P>What is suggested to be put in instead of that is that the discretion should be given to the Minister to say whether it should be implemented by the local authority or by somebody else.  The Minister for Local Government surely cannot say that it will be implemented by the central authority.  He has no power or control at all there.  In my view it would reduce the whole purpose of the Bill to an absurdity. It would be taking from Parliament the right of saying where the rates should go, as is set out here.  It would be purporting to give a discretion to the Minister although it is really not giving him any discretion.  It seems to me that, as Euclid would have said, it would be making the Bill <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  I say that without offence to the Senator.</P>

      <P>With due respect to Senator Nash, it strikes me that not alone in this Bill but in other Bills, some of them going through the Dáil, the Minister dispenses his authority and powers to suit himself and he distributes <Col N="513" /> responsibility to local authorities where they may become the object and butt of slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  When it suits him he will give local authorities certain responsibilities but when it suits him to retain the appointments of chairmen and vice-chairmen he will retain this. The validity of Senator Nash's statement may be real but there is validity too &mdash; it does not come out so much in this Bill &mdash; in the assertion that different Ministers retain powers of certain appointments, something from which they will get some kudos.  When kudos is not to be gained it will then devolve on members of local authorities to bear the brunt of all the criticism. This is running through many of the Bills that come before the Dáil and this House.  The more this is examined the better, and for that reason, whether this amendment is pursued or not, it is as well to have this discussed.  I have a feeling that Ministers use their discretion as to what they will retain or release to local authorities according to what they will gain or not gain from that discretion.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to subscribe to the notion that Senators on the other side are devoid of any political intelligence.  They know quite clearly how we feel about the intent of this whole section and the reason for this amendment.  We feel, as Senator Belton has said, that if any embarrassment should arise over the cost of providing this service it will be an embarrassment which will have to be borne by the local authorities and the Minister will have lily-white hands in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, we felt, was not a good thing and was not being fair to local authorities. Obviously the ruling out of order of amendment No. 9 does not help the ideas behind amendments Nos. 7 and 8, which really were leading up to the ideas expressed in amendment No. 9. Because of this, it is not my intention to press amendment No. 7 or amendment No. 8 but merely to say that the Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Nash and others know very well the difficulty which I am in.  I cannot advocate that the cost or part of it should be borne by the Central Fund, much as I should <Col N="514" /> like to.  Consequently, amendment No. 9 is out of order.  Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 would not be capable of carrying out the idea expressed in the three amendments.  Because of that, I withdraw amendments Nos. 7 and 8 but ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the ideas expressed in amendment No. 9, which I think is rather a good one.</P>

      <P>The Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 13:</P>

Where rates or portion thereof are waived in any year or part of a year in accordance with any scheme made and carried out under the Local Government (Rates) (No. 2) Act, 1969, the word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; appearing in section 10 (2) of the Principal Act shall be construed as meaning the rates as reduced by the amount of any such waiver.</P>

      <P>We preserve in the law certain curious practices. One of the most curious is that although we are not allowed to indicate to anyone in any manner that would be straight that we know a bit more about some subjects than anybody else, and this is difficult to understand &mdash; the <Col N="515" /> medical profession have long since found it easy to say: &ldquo;I happen to know about eyes, someone else knows about corns, someone else about other parts of the body&rdquo;&mdash; we are not allowed to say that but we are allowed to tell everybody what we do not know about.  Certainly I should have liked if we could send in alternates to speak for us on certain subjects, this being one of them; but as it is entered it will be necessary for the House to consider the integration of the provisions of this Bill with an existing body of law.  I consider it my duty to do to the best of my ability what, frankly, I thought the Minister and his advisers should have done when they were drafting the Bill.  I would welcome the assistance of the Members of the House, not all present, who would know more about the matters that I am discussing. I would draw the attention of the House to that part of the Title to the Bill which provides for</P>
      <P>other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not provide sufficiently for matters connected with the matters aforesaid and it is for that reason that I must move these amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 proposes the amendment of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, by the insertion of a new section in that Act to be called section 13A.  The Bill before the House does not impose any restrictions on the categories of persons whose circumstances may be considered in relation to the matter of the waiver of rates.  Section 10 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, contemplates a case, which arises very often, when premises are let, and I speak only of facts that I know of, in the city of Dublin &mdash; and there are many such cases &mdash; where the landlord of the dwelling</P>
      <P>pays or allows an injunction or set-off against, or indemnifies the tenant in respect of, the rates or any part thereof, a sum equal to the amount for the time being of the payment, deduction, set-off or indemnity (as the case may be);</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an addition to the rents currently being paid by the tenant to him <Col N="516" /> under the restriction contained in the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  My amendment is designed to protect the position of tenants whose circumstances have been taken into account by the rating authority and to ensure that the rates, which are to be a lawful addition to the rent by the landlord where the tenant's circumstances have determined the amount of waiver of rates by which he can increase the letting, shall be the rates as reduced by the amount of waiver and that no rates save as so reduced shall be a lawful addition.</P>
    <P>My second amendment, No. 11, provides that the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, be amended by the insertion of this section.  I am no expert on these matters: I am not as clear on these matters as the Minister's advisers, but Senator Nash certainly is clear as to why it became necessary to have subsection (9) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the terms of section 6 of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, provided for that matter but those who advised the Minister for Justice in the presentation of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, at least thought that there was doubt about the matter. It is a good principle and, as a practitioner, I recommend to the House that people would be saved a lot of expense and many lawyers would get rich less quickly.  However, the Minister for Justice had not only the advice of his advisers but he also had the benefit of commissions that consulted on the matters and I accept that it was necessary to have in the Act subsection (9) which states:</P>
    <P>In the application of this Chapter to a small dwelling, within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, the following provisions shall have effect:</P>
    <P>(a)  the word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section shall not include a rate made by virtue of the last-mentioned Act on the owner of the small dwelling, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount by which the <Col N="517" /> rent of the small dwelling is increased by virtue of section 6 of the last-mentioned Act shall be taken into account as a lawful addition in calculating the lawful rent of the small dwelling.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that section 6 of the Local Government Act of 1928 provided, in respect of such premises, the owners or the tenants and not the occupiers.  May I remind the House that the valuation figure is no greater than £6 subject to the powers vested in the Minister, and I should like to know if the powers of the Minister to increase that figure to £12 have been exercised?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is still £6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10, subsection (9) provides:</P>
      <P>the amount by which the rent of the small dwellings is increased by virtue of section 6 of the last-mentioned Act shall be taken into account as a lawful addition in calculating the lawful rent of the small dwelling.</P>
      <P>Perhaps they were contemplating some situation in which the parties were taking advantage of this Act and where in fact the tenant was rated under some other arrangement between them for payment of rates.</P>
      <P>There may have been some situation which the Minister has been advised about.  Whatever the reason which led to this amendment, it was interesting enough to be noted for an amendment in an Act introduced by the Minister for Justice, of an Act which was the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  Therefore, one line I would not welcome today would be any suggestion that because this is not the province of the Minister for Local Government we should not be considering matters which are the province of the Minister for Justice, if he could spare the time for such problems.  It is my concern by this amendment to ensure that the amount by which the rent of a small dwelling is increased, by virtue of section 6, shall be only the rates as reduced.  The words I have used in the proposed amendment are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> section 10 (9) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, is hereby amended by the addition to paragraph (b) thereof...</P>
    <P>I think I had better reread paragraph (b) which is:</P>
    <P>the amount by which the rent of the small dwelling is increased by virtue of section 6 of the last-mentioned Act shall be taken into account as a lawful addition in calculating the lawful rent of the small dwelling.</P>
    <P>I add the proposal that there should be added to this:</P>
    <P>save to the extent that the rates or portion thereof are waived in any year or part of a year in accordance with any scheme made and carried out under the Local Government (Rates) (No. 2) Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one comment, which applies as well to the earlier amendments, as indeed to all the other amendments, and that is the circumstances in which you will have &mdash; I am sure these circumstances will arise, though perhaps they will not arise too widely &mdash; the occupation of a house changing, in which during the course of the year someone whose circumstances were taken into account as justifying a waiver of rates will cease to be the occupier and the house will be occupied by someone whose circumstances would not justify a waiver of rates, and where you, will have to deal with the situation arising from those facts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that in so far as it is a small dwelling it may be within the power of the Minister to make provision for this under section 4 (2), but the advisers of the Minister for Justice did not think so when they introduced section 10 (9) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  This House should try to improve this legislation to ensure that any waiver is benefiting only the tenant in respect of whose circumstances the waiver has been made.  That deals with amendment 11.  I am beginning to see a great disadvantage in accepting the treatment of the six amendments together because there is a serious danger you will get lost and if you <Col N="519" /> get lost the probability you will get lost becomes almost a certainty.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 12 again provides for a like matter.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the kind of cases where provisional orders are made.  I have not got the valuation figures at my fingertips but there are cases where provisional orders are made.  The scheme was to provide an expeditious way of getting a rent fixed.  It would be more expeditious and less expensive.  I think that is the basic theory behind the provisional order scheme.  At any rate, section 12 (1) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967, reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  where an order under section 21 of the Principal Act, stood in force immediately before the passing of this Act, it shall have effect as from such passing subject to the following modifications:</P>
    <P>(a)  for the amount specified therein as the basic rent of the dwelling in question there shall be substituted an amount equal to the lawful rent so specified less any amount so specified in respect of rates, and</P>
    <P>(b)  for the amount so specified in respect of lawful additions there shall be substituted an amount equal to any amount so specified in respect of rates.</P>
    <P>I take that to mean the adjustment upwards of rates on which public policy is founded should be recognised and that the rates increases should become lawful additions to the rates to be paid by the tenants.</P>
    <P>We should make it clear by the language we use in this section by an amendment of section 12 (1) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1967, that the increase which will be lawful will be the increase which is the increase reduced by the amount of the waiver in any case which may be, repeating what I said in relation to all those amendments, that there may have to be adjustments made in the scheme designed here for circumstances where there is a change; but those adjustments, mark you, may not be possible under this section.  I would reserve myself very much on this.  I <Col N="520" /> should like here to express the view that no regulation will be open to the Minister which will vary the rights and contract of the tenant or the rights under other statutes unless he is specifically empowered to vary other statutes by this Bill, and it is not proposed he should.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 standing in my name expressly provides for an amendment of section 6 of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, which the Minister for Justice and his advisers thought it was necessary to amend under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960.  May I say that this is the one amendment that I would not press if I were satisfied it had been fully considered, and if I received an undertaking that it would be fully considered, because I think it might be possible under section 6 as it stands to ensure that the rates causing the increase would be only the rates as adjusted.  I am not by any means happy about it.  I should very much prefer to see section 6 amended.  It was designed 41 years ago without this Bill in mind. I should like to see an express amendment making it quite clear that the amount of the increase is only to be the increase in the rates as reduced.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 is the fifth of these amendments, and it is an amendment to section 13 (3) (vii) of the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, which, I have to bore you with the further news, makes it necessary to look at section 23 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  Section 23 of that Act is a very important section because it contemplates that where tenants would be put out of their abodes they shall be provided with compensation. But not everyone is happy about it. It provides for the measure of compensation that would be awarded to them.</P>
    <P>As that section is being operated at present, I am bound to say that the attitude of the courts is reasonable, judges being on the whole reasonable persons affected by awareness of the circumstances.  Here again I should like to be guided by those better informed than I on it, but I believe the judges look at minimum compensation entitlements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> We are concerned with minimum compensation entitlements because the courts could change and judges could change and there might be circumstances which might prejudice them &mdash; I need not dwell on the kind of circumstances. Section 13 (3) applies also to section 23, which simply gives power</P>
    <P>where the court awards to a tenant compensation for disturbance the measure of such compensation shall be the pecuniary loss, damage or expenses which such tenant sustains or incurs or will sustain or incur by reason of his quitting the tenement in respect of which such compensation is awarded and which is the direct consequence of his quitting such tenement.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the extension of the benefits of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, to persons in certain categories.  The section applies to a dwellinghouse or a flat which immediately before the passing of the Act was a controlled dwelling, subject to not being a letting for temporary convenience.  May I explain this to mean that they get the benefits of the Landlord and Tenant Act but the benefits of the rent restrictions code are taken from them?</P>
    <P>One particular subsection, subsection (2), perhaps is the simplest example to give.  This, for some reason I think connected with the time of the day that the Act may have been passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas, contains a provision which I think is outrageous.  If I had been permitted to be articulate by the electorate at the time I would not have let it go by without at least talking about it.  This was an amending Bill of 1966 passed in 1967, I think.  When you get a date on an Act I do not know what that means.  Does it mean the date that it is signed?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking at the Rent Restrictions Act, 1966, but I am informed that it is the Rent <Col N="522" /> Restrictions Act of 1967.  At any rate, that Act directed its attention at attacking bachelors or spinsters over the age of 21 and under the age of 65. I am not a bachelor or a spinster and I am over 21 and under 65.  The persons concerned occupied what could be modest enough premises with a valuation not in excess of £10, particularly if it was a flat or part of an old building or something of that kind that had not been revalued for many years.</P>
      <P>At any rate, they took the benefits of the rent restrictions code from such persons and gave them the benefits of the Landlord and Tenant Act.  In any case where the benefits of the rent restrictions code were taken from these people, I will not exhaust you by telling all of them; I do not understand them and I am concerned to look at only one of them because I think that this is the only one relevant to any application of section 23, that any such dwelling which is a dwelling which has got decontrolled by this Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act:</P>
      <P>In any application of section 23 of that Act to any such dwelling, that section shall have effect as if &ldquo;whichever of the following is the greater, that is to say, such sum, for the purpose of enabling the tenant, without incurring hardship, to secure appropriate alternative accommodation, as the court considers proper, not less than three years rent (including rates, whether or not payable by the tenant) or&rdquo; were inserted after &ldquo;the measure of such compensation shall be&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want us to amend, by passing this Bill, the code relating to and protecting tenants so that a tenant coming in, whose circumstances were such that he would never get the benefit of the rates, is in fact entitled to a similar amount of compensation because of the fact that some time during the three years somebody did get the benefit of this minimum.  I should like to put it further, that perhaps the person most entitled to the protection of this minimum is the person who all the time occupied it. It should be made quite clear that we do not deprive tenants of rights they <Col N="523" /> have under existing codes.  That is the object of amendment No. 14.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 standing in my name provides for an amendment which in fact is not an amendment but the insertion of a new section to avoid the doubt which I definitely feel can be resolved here only by the Houses of the Oireachtas or at great expense by somebody in the courts.  I will have to refer you now to section 17 (1) of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960:</P>
    <P>Where any sum (a) has been paid on account of any rent which has accrued due after the operative date and</P>
    <P>(b)  is a sum declared by section 16 of this Act to be irrecoverable from the tenant, such sum shall, subject to section 18 of this Act, be recoverable from the landlord who received the payment or his legal personal representative by the tenant by whom it was paid or his legal personal representative.</P>
    <P>I want to recommend to this House that we introduce a new section into the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, which would read as follows:</P>
    <P>The Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion of the following section after section 13B:</P>
    <P>13C.  To avoid doubts it is hereby declared that any sum paid by a tenant on account of any rent shall be recoverable from the landlord who received the payment or his legal personal representative by the tenant by whom it was paid or his legal personal representative to the extent that same shall be equal to the amount of any rates waived in accordance with any scheme made and carried out under the Local Government (Rates) (No. 2) Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the situation will be that schemes will be adopted before the issue of demand notes, perhaps demand notes will relate to the circumstances of the tenant, but even if they do I see difficulty in this because you have a system of fresh demand notes when the tenant ceases to occupy the premises.  I do not know how it is proposed that <Col N="524" /> this should work.  We are handling over now to highly accomplished gentlemen in the Department of Local Government the work of drafting regulations approving of schemes that may open up great pitfalls for many people to the benefit of people like Senator Nash and myself.  Perhaps I should include Senator Bourke in this also &mdash; she would benefit more than anyone &mdash; but I do not think that this is a good system.</P>
    <P>There is great doubt where a landlord has served his notice under the terms of the rent restrictions code adding to the rent the rates which are lawfully due by him under the agreement whether a tenant who pays rent based on such a notice will get back as overpayment portion of the rates which represent a waiver of the entire part of the rates in question.  Perhaps others have doubts also on this, so therefore is there any reason why we should not resolve that doubt here and now and make it quite clear that such a tenant is entitled to recover the amount of the waiver if he has paid to the landlord a sum which includes the amount waived?</P>
    <P>That brings me to amendment No. 16 &mdash; I will not talk on this because on further consideration I think it is possible that if amendment No. 15 were accepted it would probably cover the matter.  I shall express my difficulty to you without being able to think out the consequences: I am thinking of a situation where, for example, the Minister may increase the valuation to which the Local Government (Small Dwellings) Act applies from £6 to £12 and thereby push somebody over the £10 valuation and outside the rent restrictions code.  I think this is the intention of my amendment but I shall not say any more about this because my general attitude to these amendments has been expressed to you as well as I can do.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendments appears to be to ensure that the benefits of the rates waiver will be made available to persons who, as tenants of rent controlled dwellings, are indirectly liable for rate although they are not the rated occupiers.  We agree with these sentiments but our legal advisers consider them unnecessary <Col N="525" /> as there is already sufficient power in sections 2 and 4 to cover fully those matters.  In the absence of any clear need for these amendments it would be inappropriate to provide for extensive revision of the Rent Restrictions Act in a Local Government Bill.  I am glad that Senator FitzGerald has gone into such detail on this matter and am grateful for the number of useful points that have been brought out, and I can assure him that I will bring these points to the notice of the local authorities. However, we are opposing the amendments because our legal advisers do not think they are necessary.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect to the legal advisers in the Department of Local Government, whom I know very well, I would be unable to accept that.  It is not my business to advise anyone here but I personally am quite satisfied that there is no section which gives the Minister power to make a regulation that will amend the Landlord and Tenant Act, as the Minister for Justice thought it necessary to introduce a section in the Rent Restrictions (Amendment) Act expressly to amend the Landlord and Tenant Act with regard to the minimum compensation payable to a tenant.  I find the matter inadequately dealt with, I find the response to the proposals inadequate and I would simply have to divide the House.  Hoping the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude might have been different, I was proposing to suggest that the Minister would give consideration to what I have said between now and Report Stage.  Is it the position that the Minister can introduce amendments at the next stage?</P>

      <P>The position is that Government amendments or amendments proposed by two Senators can be introduced on Report Stage provided the matter has not been determined. I think it only proper to point out to the Senator that he is entitled to withdraw these amendments on Committee Stage and re-table them on Report Stage and give the Minister an opportunity to consider what has been said.</P>

      <P>I sympathised with the Parliamentary Secretary when he said that he did not think it appropriate to amend another Act by these means.  Senator FitzGerald has made it clear that this was done in the Landlord and Tenant Act and although I must say I accept entirely the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that he will have the power under section 4 to do these things and to make the allowances which concern Senator FitzGerald in relation to these amendments, nevertheless I personally am not satisfied that he would have the power to behave generously and equitably on these matters.  This does not bind him or any of his successors to do so, whereas the amendments would have this effect.  Therefore, we in this House should not be satisfied merely with the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary saying he will have the power to behave equitably and to treat people equitably, because even his good will is not permanently guaranteed.</P>

      <P>This Bill is an enabling Bill which gives power to local authorities to make the schemes.  While I concede there is a certain amount of misgiving in the mind of Senator FitzGerald, I could not imagine any set of conditions in which a local authority would make a regulation exempting someone from rates and then finding, in fact, that they had exempted the landlord.  The local authorities in their own right make quite a number of regulations with regard to rents and various activities that belong to the county council, and I could not see any county council being so foolish as to make a regulation that would exempt a landlord when in point of fact it was the tenant who should be exempted. I am not a legal person, but I feel that this Bill gives county councils entitlement to make the schemes that they intend to operate under their own jurisdiction.  I would not have any misgivings that county councils and their officials would be so foolish as to put themselves in the situation envisaged by <Col N="527" /> Senator FitzGerald.  I feel we are over-labouring this point.</P>

      <P>Senator Honan has not said that these amendments would be harmful.  He merely contends that they would probably be unnecessary.  The Parliamentary Secretary made the same point, that since he would have the power to act equitably there is no need to place an obligation on him to do so.  I feel, as a Member of this House, that it is necessary, if there is no fundamental objection to the amendments, to enshrine it in the Act so as to ensure that justice will be done.  Unless it can be shown to me that any one of these amendments would be actively harmful I should be inclined to urge Senator FitzGerald to ask leave to withdraw them now and to give the Minister a week or so to think about this and re-introduce them, if necessary, on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree with that proposal wholly.  The one which particularly concerns me is the one which amends the Landlord and Tenant Act which has the effect that it raises doubts about the minimum compensation which a tenant is entitled to under the Landlord and Tenant Act.  With regard to the amendment introduced to the Rent Restrictions Act, 1957, to deal with the whole problem of the ejectment of tenants for the development of property, I will be taking a firm view as to the significance of this amendment but I would adopt Senator Sheehy Skeffington's proposal to give the Minister a further opportunity of considering it.</P>

      <P>I should like to inform the House that we have got legal advice not alone from our own people in the Department of Local Government but from the Department of Justice.  We are told that section 10 (2) of the 1960 Rent Restrictions Act, as amended, applies only to actual payments made by the landlord by way of rates and allows him to pass on such payments by way of a lawful addition.  As Senator Honan said, if it should transpire that under this provision we could not ensure that the <Col N="528" /> tenant would get the benefit of the waiver on rates as intended by the local authority, then under the regulations and the scheme itself the local authority could ensure that this would apply because they are the people who would operate the scheme.  The officials of the local authorities will be in the best position to know whether or not the provisions of their scheme are passed down along the line to the people it was intended for.  We are quite satisfied from the legal advice we have got that we can deal with this matter under the Bill as it is.</P>

I do not claim to be a legal expert myself but I have always found that the legal advice available to me has been of the highest quality and I should be very disappointed in this Bill if the things that Senator FitzGerald fears might happen did, in fact, happen.  However, I am legally advised that the Bill is sufficiently wide in its scope to ensure that it does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand Senator FitzGerald correctly he is now telling us that he is prepared to withdraw the amendments, and possibly, to put them down <Col N="531" /> again on Report Stage.  If that is so, I will have the arguments put forward by him in the debate examined but as matters stand I am informed that these amendments are not necessary and in view of that it would not be advisable to accept them because what they really do is that they purport to amend the Rent Restrictions Act.  If it were to turn out that the advice I have is wrong I would be prepared to amend the Act, as it would be then, but as it stands I must accept the legal advice available to me.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a point I made earlier in so far as the Bill purports to provide for other matters.  In my view, these other matters might include matters not within the province of the Minister for Local Government but within the province of the Minister for Justice, whose legal advisers will no doubt have an opportunity of considering the arguments that I have made in defence of the amendments.  In law, as in politics, there are opportunities for different opinions.  One of the considerations I should like to draw the Minister's attention to is if he would put this question to his advisers and, through his colleague, to his colleague's advisers. Can my amendments, if accepted, do any damage?  Their intention is to prevent litigation and to save unnecessary cost, to provide for a time pending the introduction by the Minister's colleague of other amending legislation which would take in this whole rent restriction code, the whole landlord and tenant code, to provide, I understand, for that interregnum and to prevent injustice being done during that period.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), line 6, to delete &ldquo;belonging to a class to which this section applies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have heard here this afternoon many statements from the Parliamentary Secretary and from Senators on the other side of the House advocating the retention of those subsections in the Bill which allow to members of local authorities the power to decide on schemes for the waiver of rates.  This section provides for allowing certain classes the right to pay their rates by instalment. We felt there was agreement with the Parliamentary Secretary and the Senators from the Government side of the House that it would be as well, with this great new idea of giving back power to the members of local authorities and letting them be masters of their own destiny, as Senator Nash described it, that they should be allowed to decide on the classes which would be entitled to pay their rates by instalment and to make this decision a reserved function of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Senators will notice 8 on page 3, which is part of subsection (1) of section 3, states:</P>
      <P>As may from time to time be specified by the appropriate rating authority, pay rates to that authority by instalments in respect of that hereditament.</P>
      <P>The rating authority in that case were not as might appear on casual reading the members of the local authority but rather would be a managerial function. Subsections (2) and (3) allow the Minister to decide the class of hereditament and to amend his order in relation to this from time to time.  In accordance with the provisions of section 2 (5), which allowed members of local authorities to decide who should qualify in this scheme for the waiver of rates, we felt in this Bill in the next subsection that we should also allow members of local authorities to decide who should be allowed to pay their rates by instalments.</P>

      <P>I do not see anything objectionable in the idea behind those amendments.  I think everybody in the House would agree that the right to pay rates by instalments should be on as wide a basis as is reasonable.  I have indicated that as a minimum I intend to cover all dwellings and agricultural holdings, but there is a practical objection to this amendment and I do not think it should be pressed.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that many local authorities succeed in getting in the full rates from large commercial undertakings quite early in the year.  As a result of that, interest on overdraft is saved and there is a gain to the general body of the ratepayers.  When undertakings such as that are in fact in a position to pay their rates, it should be permissible for the local authorities to take advantage of it and to gain this advantage for the general body of ratepayers.  If we confer by statute the right on all ratepayers to pay their rates by instalments, then obviously those commercial undertakings, however well fitted they are financially to pay their rates in one sum, would not do so because they would be answerable to their own auditors for so doing.  The result would be there would be the loss to the rates that local authorities would find themselves carrying on on overdrafts for quite a considerable time, which would not be necessary.  For that reason I suggest that those amendments should not be pressed on the undertaking that I will be as liberal as possible, keeping in mind the overall interest of the ratepayers as a whole.</P>

      <P>I did not in fact deal with amendment No. 20.  The purpose of section 3 is to give a legal right to the relevant ratepayers to pay rates by instalments.  Amendment No. 20 strikes at the very root of this section because a local authority can nullify a whole section simply by not specifying in the classes or by specifying a very limited number of classes.  This is not a theoretical point because we have been pressing local authorities down the years to do this of their own accord.  Quite a number of them have been unwilling to adopt effective instalment schemes and it is because of that that this part of the Bill is being brought in at all.  If we were to leave it completely to the local authorities themselves they could qualify this by not specifying any particular class or by being very restrictive in the classes they specified, so that I could not accept this amendment either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little bit led astray by the Minister's initial remarks but now that I realise that he had not been dealing with amendment No. 20, which I understood was being taken with amendments Nos. 17 and 19, I realise what he was getting at.  The most important part of the three amendments, and the one out of which the others really arise, is the first paragraph in amendment No. 20 which states that &ldquo;subject to the sanction of the Minister a rating authority may, from time to time, specify the class or classes of hereditament to which this section applies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, what the amendment is doing is giving to the local authority members instead of to the Minister the power to decide who should be allowed to pay their rates by instalments.  The Minister was not with us this afternoon, but a great case was made, and repeatedly made, by his own Senators and his own Parliamentary Secretary that the members of local authorities should be given as much power and responsibility as possible, and this was the reason for having subsection (5) of section 2 in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had complete and utter faith in the responsible attitude which would <Col N="535" /> be adopted by members of local authorities towards the making of any scheme for the provision of waiver of rates or any other activity that members of the local authority might engage in.  For that reason I was very heartened to hear those remarks, even though they were opposed to our amendment to section 2, because I presumed from that that it was the Minister's intention to accept amendments to section 3 which did no more than transfer the onus of deciding who may pay rates by instalments from the Minister to the members of the local authorities, just as the provisions of section 2 put the onus of deciding who may receive waiver of rates on the members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>If we want to be consistent about this, and if those Senators on this side of the House are to accept the remarks of the Government Senators and the Parliamentary Secretary this afternoon as genuine, which I am quite sure they were, then these amendments surely must be acceptable &mdash; certainly amendment No. 20 which allows the rating authority, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to decide on the class or classes to which the section applies, and the second paragraph of amendment No. 20 provides that this would be a reserved function rather than managerial.  This is merely in keeping with the provisions of section 2 and in keeping with the remarks of Senator Nash and the Parliamentary Secretary and others from the Government side of the House this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's undertaking to the people was to give them an effective scheme for paying rates by instalment as of right.  If they are to do this and to leave it to each local authority in effect to decide whether they will adopt an instalment scheme, then we would not be honouring that undertaking.  The point about this is that we have reason to believe from past experience that a number of local authorities would not in fact introduce effective instalment schemes if it were not decided in this way, that is, if the Minister did not specify the classes to be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, as I said, local <Col N="536" /> authorities have in the main in fact resisted promptings from my Department in the past to introduce effective instalment schemes.  Because of that it is my opinion that this is necessary if we are to ensure that there will be effective instalment schemes in the country.  It is certainly necessary to implement the undertaking that was given to people by the Government.  I suppose really the ideal thing to do would be to specify the classes in the Bill but I considered that we have not got sufficient experience of it to do that at present.  After some years of experience I would be prepared to take the opportunity in a suitable Bill to include the classes to which this facility of paying rates by instalment should be given.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the Minister was not here this afternoon to hear some of the Members of his own Party speaking about what they thought about local authorities.  They thought that they were quite competent to do practically everything. The Minister's opinion, or his fear, of the local authorities runs completely counter to the statements uttered on his own side of the House that we heard this afternoon.  I am afraid that there is drifting into the debates from that side of the House a certain amount of inconsistency, a certain amount of the feeling that local authorities are right when it suits the manager or the Minister or the Government and they are wrong when it suits the manager, the Minister or the Government.  This is what one could deduce from the debate this afternoon and on the debate concluded just now on those various amendments.  I am very sorry that the Minister was not here this afternoon to hear his own Party eulogise the councils on various things all over the country, saying that they were highly responsible and that they knew their social responsibility. This came out very clearly in the debate this afternoon.</P>

      <P>When Senator Boland mentions what we were discussing this afternoon, we were discussing different amendments entirely, put up by Senator FitzGerald.  We were not discussing <Col N="537" /> this one at all, but were referring to the amendments that were before the House.  These amendments were not before the House at that time.  I think that nobody who has experience of the work of local authorities would even contemplate amendment No. 20 here, that the council would be required to deal with each single application to pay rates by instalments.</P>
      <P>I feel that the purpose in this is to deal with people who either are on a monthly salary or who would find it convenient to pay their rates quarterly, and I do not visualise that any big commercial concern operating in a particular area would be claiming the same as an ordinary weekly or monthly wage earner.  When I became concerned with this Bill and got to know of it, I could see that the underlying thing was to relieve the great burden of responsibility of the small wage earner, or monthly salaried people, who can make suitable arrangements between themselves and the rate collector to pay rates as they so desire.  I would not for a moment contemplate that these amendments were to be considered whereby a number of big concerns could use themselves as pressure groups against the county council to win for themselves the same right as that which we are proposing to give to what I would not consider under-privileged people but people who are making a very genuine effort to pay their way and to meet their commitments.  We were talking about different things.  We were not talking this afternoon about this particular amendment but about a different one entirely, which has been withdrawn now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan is mistaken about this.  We spoke at length, and Senator FitzGerald also spoke, about the amendment to make it obligatory on the rating authority to have a scheme for the waiver of rates each year but with the right, with the Minister's consent, to suspend the implementation of that scheme in any particular year.  The case was made to us that there was no need to oblige members of the local authority to make a scheme because they were responsible people with social consciences, <Col N="538" /> that they would make that scheme without having any obligation on them.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Senator was here at the time, but Senator Nash spoke at length and repeatedly about it and the Parliamentary Secretary spoke at some length on several occasions on the fact that the members of the local authorities generally, as I agree, are very responsible people who give their time and their services generously and who can be expected to implement any scheme that would be for the benefit of the ratepayers or their constituents; and we noted in particular that the members of the local authority act in nothing other than a responsible fashion.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the remarks of Senator Nash and the Parliamentary Secretary, I was quite happy that these amendments would be accepted, because they are doing no more than asking for a transfer from the Minister to the members of the local authority of the decision as to the class or classes of hereditaments to be included in this scheme.  I think the Minister is very mistaken that it is the intention, or would become the law if our amendment was accepted, that the members of each local authority would have to decide on each individual case.  This is not the intention.  This is something which we would certainly be totally opposed to, having members of local authorities canvass in this way to support the idea of providing to one particular ratepayer the facility of paying his rates in instalments and perhaps refusing it to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was not the intention, and I think the Minister will agree that even if these amendments had been agreed, what they would in effect do would be to allow each local authority to decide which classes should be allowed to pay their rates by instalments &mdash; classes, not individuals &mdash; bearing in mind that before that decision could be implemented it would have had to be sanctioned by the Minister in accordance with the first six words of paragraph 1 of amendment No. 20.  It was merely taking power away from the Minister and giving it as a reserved function to the local authorities, which course has been <Col N="539" /> advocated by Senators on the Government side and by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to section 2.  The one point made by the Minister which I thought had much validity was in relation to the wording of amendment 20:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Subject to the sanction of the Minister a rating authority may, from time to time, specify the class or classes of hereditament to which this section applies.</P>
    <P>Had we entered the amendment more or less on the lines of &ldquo;subject to sanction of the Minister a rating authority shall, at the commencement of each financial year,&rdquo; which would oblige a rating authority to specify the classes in each year and ought to get over the difficulty envisaged by the Minister, the rating authority might not bother to provide this facility at all. I wondered whether the amendment might not have been more acceptable in that fashion and I would ask him to give us some guidelines which would be useful.</P>

      <P>I was here this afternoon although I did not take part in the debate.  I think there is confusion in Senator Boland's mind.  What we were talking about refers to a rating authority waiving an amount of rates but what we are dealing with here, which the Minister has referred to in section 20, is not the waiving of payment: it is the question of payment by instalment.  The point raised by Senator Boland where he quoted Senator Nash related to the principle of giving the power to a local authority to waive rates rather than compelling a local authority to do it, but what the Minister has referred to under this amendment is that some local authorities have not allowed payment of rates by instalments.  They are two different principles and I would side with the Minister here on the giving of power to local authorities to waive payment of rates to certain necessitous classes.  Section 3 (2) gives the Minister power to ensure that local authorities which have not so far been prepared to make the payment of rates by instalment do so.  They are two different principles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Brugha has said is that local authorities should have power to waive rates, or to decide on the people whose rates shall be waived, but the local authority should not have power over the people from whom rates should be collected by instalments, and I think this is the comparison which has been made.  If a local authority are capable on one side they are bound to be capable on the other side.  It is all very well to bring in red herrings and to talk about large businesses who normally pay their rates in one instalment or at the outside in two instalments &mdash; that the local authority would have to pay further interest if they were not collecting these rates.  Who would be better judges of this than the local authority?  Very often one might come across a large business that finds it as difficult to pay its rates as a salaried person and for that reason I think local authorities should have the power.</P>
      <P>However, on the waiving of rates, new industries in the rural part can get exemptions for a period of years.  That is a function of the local authority and it is they who decide which industries get the benefit of the scheme to waive rates.  For that reason I think the Minister should have another look at this because members of local authorities would be better judges of what type of person should pay rates by instalments than an official sitting in the Minister's office or the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here when either Senator Nash or the Parliamentary Secretary spoke with regard to the discretion to be given to local authorities on the rates-waiver scheme, but I am quite sure I would have endorsed everything they said.  The principle involved in the two sections is completely different.  The adoption or otherwise of a rates-waiver scheme is a matter of policy, something that would affect the actual striking of a rate and it will result, if adopted, in the incurring of extra expenditure on the other ratepayers. Therefore, it is quite appropriate that this decision should be left to the rating authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, what is proposed <Col N="541" /> in this section is to confer on certain classes of ratepayers the statutory right to pay their rates by instalment.  It was promised by the Government that those people, in particular householders and farmers, would have a statutory right to pay their rates by instalment.  What is involved so far as the rating authority are concerned is the purely administrative matter as to whether the rates are to be collected in two or ten instalments, and what is proposed in the Bill is to give a right to classes of ratepayers, in particular householders and farmers, to pay their rates in ten instalments rather than in two if they so desire.  The only way in which this can be ensured is by providing in the Bill that it will be done.  We have had the experience that urgings from the Department to adopt instalment schemes have not been responded to by quite a number of local authorities, and even if we substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; by &ldquo;may&rdquo; the intention could still be circumvented by specifying only a very limited class which would make the provisions of the Bill ineffective.  For that reason I think amendment No. 20 as well as amendments Nos. 17 and 19 should not be pressed.</P>

      <P>I do not feel that we have enough experience on it to make a decision so definite now as to include it in the Bill.  I would visualise the gaining of this experience over a number of years and after we have experience of it I would be prepared to specify the classes in legislation and take advantage of some appropriate amending legislation to bring in such a provision.  However, I have not any clear-cut opinion at present as to the exact classes which should be specified. I would certainly hope effectively to exclude <Col N="542" /> such businesses as are in fact in a position to pay their rates in one lump sum or in two lump sums so that ratepayers in general would not lose the advantage that at present rating authorities can get by avoiding a certain amount of interest on overdrafts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in general it would help the local authority to have a steady flow of money coming in in a ten-month period rather than on two occasions during the year?  Would he not also imagine that in the case of a large concern which is capable of paying in either one or two large instalments it is far more likely that they will pay those instalments at the last moment rather than at the first possible moment &mdash; that in fact if they were obliged to pay in ten equal instalments it would almost certainly ensure that we would never have the situation of a local authority becoming almost bankrupt for one or two months of the year?  I cannot see the difficulty for the local authority which in their own local area ought to have the best knowledge of which sections could best benefit and in which way the local authority operation could best benefit by including certain sections in the instalments scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be contentious about this but the remarks of Senators from the Government side of the House this evening about the irresponsible attitude that might be adopted by members of local authorities in this regard are completely out of tune with the type of remarks that were made this afternoon when local authority members were being lauded to the skies and we were being told that not only could they and should they make the scheme for the waiver of rates but in fact that they were capable of doing virtually everything within their own administrative area and that it would be the ideal of the Government that they should be allowed every possible power.  Yet here in a simple section which provides for rates to be paid by instalment by certain sections, the Government Senators and indeed the Minister seem to think that some members or some local authorities would not act in a responsible fashion and might decide to include only a very small number of <Col N="543" /> classes.  I cannot reconcile these two attitudes.  We seem to have had a complete about-face on the part of Senators on the other side of the House simply because we have had a break for tea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt I would have endorsed the sentiments expressed here.  The point is that we have experience of the fact that local authorities in the main have not been prepared to do this.  There is a certain amount of administrative difficulty involved in collecting rates in ten instalments rather than in two and local authorities have not, in the main, been prepared to accept this administrative difficulty.  As well as that, we have given an undertaking to give this statutory right to people to pay their rates by instalment and this is the only way in which we can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Senator's point about the advantage of having a steady flow of money accruing to local authorities, the fact is that at present the first moiety is payable on demand as soon as the rate is struck and the demand notices are sent out.  Some local authorities manage to get them out as early as June, some in July and I think none of them go beyond August.  The experience has been that it has proved quite feasible to collect a substantial amount of the rates due quite early in the financial year.  The result is that local authorities have been getting, I admit from the larger <Col N="544" /> businesses, quite a substantial amount of their revenue early on.  Therefore, they have money in hand with which to carry on their activities without having to work on a bank overdraft.  If every class of ratepayer had a statutory right to pay in ten monthly instalments rather than in two instalments as at present, that would be availed of and local authorities would not have the same amount of money in hand to carry on their activities and they would be involved in paying interest on overdrafts over a longer period.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not desirable to make this change that has been suggested and if the amendment were to be accepted I would not in fact be doing what we set out to do: I would not be conferring this statutory right on classes of ratepayers to pay their rates by instalments.  In fact, this strikes at the whole root of this section.</P>

      <P>The Senator's question was &ldquo;all&rdquo;.  I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>The making of conditions under this section, or an amendment to any such condition, shall be a reserved function for the purposes of the County Management Acts, 1940 to 1955, or the Acts relating to the management of county boroughs, as may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>This refers to the making of conditions. The Bill as it stands at section 3 says:</P>
      <P>subject to compliance with such conditions as may from time to time be specified by the appropriate rating authority...</P>
      <P>and section 4 (3) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>the specifying of conditions (including the specifying of conditions by a rating authority) subject to which a person may pay rates in instalments, and the conditions which may be so specified;</P>
      <P>This allows the Minister apparently to specify these conditions.  Yet in section 3, the rating authority, and in this case it would be a managerial rather than a reserved function, seem to have the power to specify the conditions. I must confess I put down this amendment as much as anything else to seek clarification of this point.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment again is to some extent to enable us to have some clarification.  As Members of the House are aware, rate collectors in certain parts of the country arrange to collect rates at times when the ratepayer is capable of paying and we are a little concerned that if it is specifically laid down by regulation the rate collector might say that he could not accept the rates in three instalments at certain times because of the regulations.</P>

Subsection (2) of section 4, paragraph (c) seems to indicate that the Minister could give his general or particular consent to the making of any scheme for the waiver of rates, and it seemed to us that this would be inconsistent.  Before we heard about the great admiration which Government Senators have for the responsible attitude of members of local authorities, we were aware that members of local authorities are a responsible body of men and it is for that reason that we are concerned about that part of the Bill that provides that members of local authorities might be told to draw up a scheme but that the Minister could give not only his general but his particular consent to such a scheme.</P>

I hope that a situation will eventually be achieved when authorities will be enabled to adopt schemes without referring to me, but there are two practical difficulties in the way of this amendment.  First of all, there is the difficulty that we have no experience in the working of these schemes until such time as we get experience, and until some kind of general consensus has emerged it would be wiser to retain the power to request a specific sanction for each scheme, Secondly, even when the time has come to issue a general sanction, some local authorities may still wish, for some particular reasons of their own, to work in a different direction to suit the particular needs in their own area.  The need for individual consent would have to be retained to permit them to adopt the particular type of scheme that they deemed to be most suitable for their area.  While I have sympathy with the point of view expressed, I am opposed to the amendment because of these difficulties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>( )  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this Act, a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the attitude of the Minister will be on amendment No. 25. Let me assure him that it was tabled by <Col N="550" /> a new and innocent Member of the House with the idea that as much legislation as possible would be drafted for anything which relates to the activities of our everyday life, and where it was unable to give that detail and instead had to allow the relevant Minister the power to make orders or regulations, he should be given the power to make suggested orders and regulations which would be draft orders or draft regulations which would come before each House of the Oireachtas where he could let Members know what he intended to do and receive their support on it, rather than to make the order or make the regulation, then lay it before each House of the Oireachtas and see whether anybody wanted to put down a motion to have it annulled.  This seemed to be asking the Houses of the Oireachtas if they do not agree with the particular move to adopt at all times a negative attitude.  For those reasons we entered this amendment.</P>
    <P>Again, it could even be that the Minister might want to make regulations, not perhaps particularly in relation to this particular Bill but on a matter of principle generally &mdash; that a Minister might want to make regulations or make an order and that Members from all sides of the House might like to rise to lend their voice of support to the move being adopted by the Minister.  Under the subsection as it stands, they would not be afforded the opportunity of so doing.  However, if our amendment were accepted, Members would be allowed to speak better in favour of a regulation or to vote against it before it was actually brought into being.  This is good democracy and good government and I am sure the Minister will agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this question of the making of regulations, there are two procedures.  The normal procedure is the one that is being adopted in this Bill, that is that the regulations to be made under this Bill must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and they may be annulled by either House within 21 sitting days.  As I said, this is the normal procedure.  In the case of a relatively <Col N="551" /> small number of statutory provisions this requirement which Senator Boland has suggested of prior approval by each House of the regulations is used only because some matter of major policy or principle may be involved.</P>
      <P>It has been generally accepted over the years that the purpose of delegating regulation powers to Ministers would be frustrated if this procedure were required in the case of every regulation.  If every regulation to be made had to be debated in the two Houses of the Oireachtas a lot of legislation which has been passed by the Houses would certainly be a lot slower in coming into operation and I think generally would be to the detriment of the community as a whole.  I suggest the issue before the House now is not of such a character as to require this special procedure to be adopted.</P>
      <P>In so far as the regulations relating to waiver of rates are concerned, these will be procedural and the effect of the instrument for the granting of waivers will be the schemes which are made by the councils for their areas, and irrespective of what regulations are made it will be entirely a matter for each council to decide whether to adopt a scheme, and it is the scheme which will regulate what is to be done in that particular area.  In that respect, although I agree it is quite right that in regard to regulations it should be possible for either House of the Oireachtas to move to have the regulations annulled, it is not of such importance as to require this special procedure of insisting on a debate in the House on the regulations, whether there is any objection to them or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the other provision, the one relating to instalments, those will, of course, apply directly but the House has already accepted the principle of instalments and all that is involved in the regulations is the working out of the actual number of instalments and the procedural matters. This will be done in consultation with local authorities.  As well as that, no ratepayer will be compelled to use the system of instalments: it will be entirely up to each individual ratepayer to decide, in the light of the system we produce, whether he wants to avail of <Col N="552" /> it or to adhere to the existing method of paying rates.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to Senator Boland that I am prepared to consider between now and the Report Stage his suggestion with regard to amendment No. 20 which he has withdrawn, that is whether we would be able to meet him there by adopting his amendment in part by substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; and specifying certain minimum classes which will be covered.  I think it may be possible to do that.</P>

      <P>I am not using the legal phraseology now, but I think that will probably be possible.  I do not think it can be seriously suggested that the powers here involve such major matters of principle that we should adopt this special procedure with regard to the making of the regulations. To adopt them in regard to this Bill, which has received a fairly general measure of agreement, would be setting a precedent for other Bills and the ultimate result would be to make the implementation of a lot of legislation passed by the Oireachtas much more cumbersome and much slower.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's long and detailed explanation, and now his kindness in saying that he will consider some form of amendment 20 for the Report Stage, I would be quite happy &mdash; not quite happy, but prepared &mdash; to withdraw amendment No. 25.  I would explain to the Minister that I realised that it would be unusual to deviate from the excepted scheme on this Bill, but he will realise that this is the first opportunity I had of entering an amendment such as this.  I do not think that this is a principle which is worth the consideration of the Government and of each House of the Oireachtas.  It is not providing that in every case there would be a discussion on the draft, but allowing that if a discussion were wanted it could take place.  I think that there was a draft before the House last week on which no discussion took place, but I am not sure.  However, I am quite prepared to withdraw this amendment, but I imagine that Senators <Col N="553" /> might see it appearing in relation to some other Bill at some other time.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on paragraph (d) of subsection (3) of this section and to ask the Minister very seriously to consider deleting this paragraph before the Bill reaches the Report Stage.  I put this particularly as a lawyer.  This is the type of residual catch-all phrase that we should not advocate in our legislation.  It sets a very bad precedent.  The paragraph as it now stands reads:</P>
      <P>The modification or adaptation of any enactment relating to the determining, making, levying, collecting and recovering of rates.</P>
      <P>It covers the general power in subsection (3) of the Minister to make regulations.</P>
      <P>My first point is that it is widely phrased, and it is the type of paragraph one quite often finds at the end of a section set out in this way.  It seems to be the habit of parliamentary draftsmen to have a wide undefined discretion in case something may have been left out from some more specific point further up.  As a lawyer I regret it very much that this is open to the interpretation that the Minister can make recommendaions relating to section 3 which would modify or adapt any enactment relating to the determining, making, levying, collecting and recovering of rates, and could authorise differentiation between one householder and another or one farmer and another, since it is a provision which relates principally to householders and farmers.  I am not suggesting at all the Minister would do this. I do not think he would, but the phrase as it is drafted is very general and gives an unfettered discretion to the Minister which we must be very wary of giving.  I would ask the Minister to delete this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument for deleting it is that I think it does nothing not already done in section 3 and in subsection (3) of section 4.  Section 3 sets out the powers the Minister will have to make regulations.  Subsection (3) of section <Col N="554" /> 4 continues these powers and I think is adequate for the purposes for which the Minister said he has introduced the section.  Under subsection (3) the Minister may, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of the section, make regulations for the purposes of section 3 for a number of matters, and makes provision for conditions in which a person may pay rates by instalments.</P>
    <P>I should like to argue very strongly that the Minister should leave out paragraph (d) of subsection (3) of section 4.  These are very wide powers, more than adequate for the Minister and this is a catch-all residual power which could be abused.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, from a lawyer's point of view, not to adopt legislation of this type, which I do not like to see going through this House.  I ask him if he would be prepared to delete it.  I hope that he will be prepared to do so, and I should also like to mention that if not, I should like to put an amendment at the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I find it hard to resist the request.  This subsection, as Senator Bourke says, provides a reserve power.  It is intended as a reserve power and is probably there merely in the event of some unforeseen circumstances arising.  The warrants issued to rate collectors are the result of some old statutes, and they require the rate collector to collect his rates in a certain way &mdash; to collect them forthwith, the only condition laid down being those two moieties.  There may be some legal difficulties arising in respect of altering those warrants. If we were sure that these difficulties would arise, they would have been dealt with in some particular way.  It is possible, indeed it is more than likely, that these powers may not be needed. The power of annulment of regulations that is there extends over a period of 21 sitting days and that, I think, is really sufficient guarantee against abuse, particularly in the case of the Seanad where 21 sitting days might cover a considerable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The power is not <Col N="555" /> undefined.  It can be exercised only in relation to the purposes of subsection (3), so it is not completely undefined, and I think it is only needed in case those difficulties arise in connection with alteration of the warrant.  It could not be used to differentiate between one ratepayer and another.  It can be used only to modify the wording of some enactment. As I say, if we knew that these difficulties did exist this subsection would not be there at all, and I would be inclined to take a chance that we could do without it.  I will consider withdrawing it on the Report Stage, and if Senator Bourke likes to put down an amendment herself, well and good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Miss Bourke Miss Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attitude.  I think that there is the danger that I have pointed to.  I suggest that the difficulties are adequately met by the powers the Minister has under the other section and the procedural arrangements under subsection (3) of section 4.  I do not suggest that the Minister himself or anybody under the present system would particularise between people, but these powers are terribly wide.  These regulations come before the House in a negative process but at the same time very often attention has not been drawn to them though there is some safeguard in this respect.  Really the point I am making is that this is a bad precedent and I think that the Minister has adequate powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly on the section to what I said on the Second Reading, at column 67 of volume 67 of the Official Report, namely</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the Bill provides for the Minister to make regulations under the Act.  I do not know whether it is a very unusual request to make but it might be useful to the House if the Parliamentary Secretary could give us an outline draft of such regulations or let us know what he <Col N="556" /> envisages might be included in those regulations.</P>
    <P>I wonder if on the Report Stage the Minister might be able to give us some indication of what it is his intention to include in the regulations, which I presume must be almost ready at this stage because these schemes are in operation in many local authority areas at the moment &mdash; to give us a clear indication of what the Bill will involve in all its aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 5, after long deliberation we decided not to introduce an amendment to this section.  Again, perhaps, the Minister can explain to us what is the purpose of subsection (2) of section 5.  The first subsection provides that the Act shall have effect in relation to the local financial year which commenced on 1st day of April, 1969, and to all subsequent financial years.  The second subsection states:</P>
      <P>Anything done by a rating authority, with the consent of the Minister, before and in anticipation of the enactment of this Act shall have and shall be deemed always to have had all such validity and effect as it would have had if this Act had been in force when that thing was done.</P>
      <P>Both these subsections are retrospective and provide that the consequences of the Bill, which indeed it presumes will be passed, will be backdated to 1st April last.  However, there are some dangers contained in subsection (2) in that if an officer of a local authority saw this subsection he might decide to act in a very irresponsible fashion, presuming that his action would be covered by subsection (2).  Perhaps the Minister would explain this.</P>

      <P>I will bite my tongue.  That is quite true.  However, the Minister might explain what subsection (2) of section 5 does that is not provided for in subsection (1) and also tell us whether, in view of the retrospective subsections, this means he will shortly be bringing in a retrospective Act to control developers who had planning permission prior to the appointed day of the 1963 Planning Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave that for the moment.  The purpose of the present legislation is to validate decisions that have been taken by a local authority in connection with the waiver of rates scheme.  Subsection (1) is obviously not sufficient because it only provides that the Act shall cover the financial year commencing 1st April, 1969.  Subsection (2) is necessary to cover decisions taken by the rating authority with consent of the Minister prior to the passing of the Act.  It provides they will all have such validity and effect and, in fact, a number of local authorities have already acted as if this Act were in force on the basis of a circular from my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on constitutional law but I wonder whether either of these subsections would, if challenged, stand up in the courts.  Perhaps it is just as well that we read through the sections before we came in to discuss this Bill; it is fairly clear that it was not particularly the intention or desire of the Minister to accept any amendments because he presumed that the schemes as approved by him would be in conformity with the Bill, which seemed to indicate he did not expect that any amendments would be acceptable to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure whether it is on this section or if I should have referred to it in relation to the draft regulations, but in regard to the waiver of rates is there any closing date after which an applicant could not apply within that financial year?  I mention this because to my astonishment I discovered that one of the local authorities have imposed a closing date and they are now informing applicants who have applied after the closing date that they <Col N="558" /> will not receive relief until the end of this financial year and in the meantime the rate collectors are persisting in demanding money from those who have not got it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is desirable that applications be made as early as possible and local authorities should try to arrange that this is done. Even in the case mentioned by Senator Boland where a closing date has been applied, surely the applications concerned can be dealt with in the same way as those of necessitous people, at the conclusion of the financial year.</P>

      <P>The rate collectors will continue to try to collect but if the people cannot pay they should not have to, and they will be no worse off than at present.  Generally speaking, we should not try to frustrate rating authorities in their efforts to deal with the matter within a reasonable time. The whole purpose of subsection (2) is that subsection (1) on its own did not cover actions already taken in relation to this financial year.</P>
