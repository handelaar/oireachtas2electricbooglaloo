    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested to know from the Minister how much extra he expects to get this year compared with last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has left the rates the same as last year.  Does he expect only the same revenue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect a certain amount of buoyancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the future, or at some time, would it be possible to use this type of increase of earned income allowance to encourage genuine overtime work in some factories?  I am saying genuine overtime not moonlight overtime, moving from one place to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem there and it is something I am considering. There is very definitely a need for more flexibility in relation to smaller incomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am rather vague on this but, perhaps, the Minister would explain to me what is the precise difference between subsection (2) (a) and (2) (b), this business of determination by the Revenue Commissioners. Both appear to be the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  The history of that may be of some interest. As the section was originally put up to me it was more or less in the form of subsection (2), to make everybody claim.  I said that was a bit unrealistic because the majority of people would be known and would be recognised as people who had produced work of artistic or cultural merit. Paragraph (I) is to cope with those&mdash; in other words, they are more or less automatically accepted.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (II) is for people who would not be widely known and established who would have to claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>On page 5, line 2, it says &ldquo;jointly with another individual&rdquo;. This is in two paragraphs.  Does it exclude the third?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  I have gone into that and it includes two or more persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of a point I made on Second Stage, could the Minister say whether educational work would be regarded as creative and would pass a cultural test and be covered by this section?  Take the production of school books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinary school text books would not be covered, but you would get a book which would have an element of scholarship or even a literary work or work of historical criticism.  Works of that nature, which would be used as text books and which had a creative and original content, would certainly qualify.  The original work would qualify.  If somebody came along later on and produces it as a text book, that would not be covered; but, once the original is <Col N="1353" /> creative and has some element of originality, it is covered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume this section refers to conversion to the decimal system?</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate how much expense will be incurred in Government Departments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not able to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister has to provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not be able to quantify that, I am afraid. Various shots have been made at estimating the total cost of decimalisation, but I would not be prepared to rely on any of them.  There will not be a great deal of expense in the Civil Service in this respect in regard to machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>An estimate has been made that it will cost more than £2 million to the nation.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  I know that that estimate was made by a working party, but I should not like to rely on it.  Of course, the ultimate benefits of decimalisation will far outweigh any cost involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume this refers to investment in unit trusts outside this country by Irish assurance companies here.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the general investment outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Until now the provision was that you had to have an illness which, in the case of any one individual member of the family, cost at least £50 in any one year and the allowance was given subject to a maximum of £300.  That, of course, meant that you could have three members of the family each incurring medical expenses of £40 in the year making a total family expense of £120 and they would not be able to claim.  What we intend to do now is to extend the provision by maintaining the £50 in regard to any one individual, but, in addition, if the family as a whole has medical expenses of £100 or more, they can claim.  We are also increasing the upper limit of the claim from £300 to £500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume this is an extension in favour of mentally handicapped <Col N="1355" /> and physically disabled children. It is a very welcome innovation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to disentagle some of this rather complex section which I cannot quite follow.  In the Third Schedule, Part I, there are two rates of duty.  The wording of the section makes it extremely difficult to know what exactly is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section increases, from 8th May, 1969, customs and excise duty on wine to the extent of 5s 10d a gallon or 1s a bottle, allowing for turnover tax, and it provides a special rate of duty for still wine of UK origin to comply with our commitments under the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position with regard to subsection (3) (a) of this section which reads:</P>
      <P>any estate duty payable in respect of a child's benefit shall be abated by the sum of £500;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A widow gets £1,000 and there is a sum of £500 for each child.  It can happen under the way the law is at present that some portions of the £500 can be lost to the family by the way the system operates.  What we are trying to do is to make sure that the family as a whole get the benefit of all the children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is meant by subsection (4) which reads:</P>
      <P>Where the deceased was, at death, a widower or widow, any estate duty payable in respect of a benefit shall be abated by the sum of £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the definition of &ldquo;the deceased&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 45 seems a little odd?  &ldquo;Deceased&rdquo; is defined as meaning &ldquo;a person dying domiciled in the State&rdquo;.  From one point of view, we are all dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same as the provision that has always been there. This is the way it has always been described. I do not think that the Finance Act would ever qualify for exemption <Col N="1358" /> on the ground of artistic or cultural merit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering about the valuation on the artificial basis.  I suppose all valuations are artificial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has not got this right.  This is a very important concession to farmers at the moment. There is a special provision for the valuation of agricultural land for estate duty purposes and it is a very favourable provision.  It means briefly that if one takes a rateable valuation and multiplies it by 25 and if, as a result, the value of the estate does not exceed the figure of £1,000, the land is valued on that basis.  What we are doing is increasing that limit of £1,000 to £2,000.  This will bring in a considerably increased number of holdings which will benefit from this concession in the future.</P>
      <P>This special provision is being made in respect of agricultural land and will benefit holdings.  The effect is to exempt altogether a considerable number of agricultural holdings from estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-five times. We are increasing the limit from £1,000 to £2,000.</P>
      <P>I should have mentioned earlier that we deduct the redemption value of the land annuity.  We take 25 times its rateable valuation and then deduct the redemption value.</P>

      <P>That is right.  This section simply applies to corporation profits tax the same extension that we have already given for income tax earlier in the Bill.  What we are doing in the Bill is extending the existing relief in regard to exports. It was due to terminate on certain dates.  We are extending the terminal dates in relation to general exports and Shannon exports and in regard to income tax and corporation profits tax.  This particular section here is the one that extends the date for corporation profits tax in regard to Shannon exports.</P>

      <P>I do not want to sound patronising but I should like to compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has gone through so many aspects of this Finance Bill and made so many novel changes designed to take away some of the anomalies, and even if they were not anomalies people believed they were anomalies, in relation to taxation.  The Minister, by reason of his knowledge in the accountancy profession, has certainly brought his professional skill to bear on many sections of this Bill by ironing out some of the sections which appeared to be rough on the people affected.  The Minister should be complimented on the fact that he has brought his professional skill to bear in relation to a number of these sections. It will make the administering of the law easier for the Revenue Commissioners who must be guided by the law in their interpretation of it and in their application of the regulations so far as taxation is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks relate to the effect the enactment of this measure has had in the implementation of additional taxation on certain commodities.  It was remarked, forcibly remarked, by a former Taoiseach of the Fianna Fáil Government that we had exhausted the taxation which could be derived from traditional sources of revenue and that we had reached the point of diminishing returns.  There is no doubt that people are now enjoying higher incomes. Equally, there is no doubt that the Government, by taxation, are siphoning off many of the advantages that people expected to gain by increases in their incomes, whether those incomes were derived from increases in salaries and wages or from passing on to the community at large increased prices for goods and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How far have we gone on the road to the point at which we will lose many of the advantages we had heretofore in our competitiveness and how far have the Government contributed to any deterioration that may have occurred in that competitiveness?  I am, I know, unorthodox from the point of view of the opinions held by economists <Col N="1362" /> and others, but I believe the soundest investment this country ever made was the institution and maintenance of food subsidisation.  We have now reached the point&mdash;we are an agricultural country&mdash;at which, in order to meet competition in the disposal of our agricultural produce in other markets, we have heavily to subsidise many of these products.  On the other hand, the prices our own people have to pay have reached such heights that they now have to limit their consumption.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a very important part of our economic development.  There are clear indications of our loss of competitiveness where tourism is concerned and clear indications of the danger of this industry being priced out of existence.  The cost of living here has risen to astronomical heights. Where motoring is concerned we are the third most expensive country in Europe.  There are still advantages from the point of view of relatively traffic free roads and so on but, when it comes down to pounds, shillings and pence, decimalised or not decimalised, travel in this country is very expensive indeed.  One can go into far richer and more highly developed countries and obtain travel at a much lower cost than one can here.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the traditional goods tourists buy, I have been talking with a great many of them from the neighbouring island over the last month and they have pointed out to me that they could not see a single item here which they could not buy cheaper at home.  This sort of thing represents a loss to the economy and the cost of living should not be allowed to reach such a point at this stage of our development.  In his March television appearance the Minister warned the country of the dangers facing the economy.  We had a reversal of that warning subsequently. We would all be glad if that reversal were a faithful reflection of the state of the economy, but our fear is that it was a temporary description of the condition of affairs for a certain period and, that period having passed, we are now forced to revert to the disclosure of a more factural position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> On the last occasion on which I spoke here I posed two questions to the Minister.  He asked me to defer those questions until this Bill was before us because he would then be in a position to answer them.  Since I spoke here a few weeks ago we have had the evidence in black and white of the directives issued to all bank managers with regard to the implementation of a very tight squeeze on lending. The Central Bank have clearly stated that two-thirds of the State credit is being reserved for Government borrowing and one-third will be available for the private sector.  Several times in the last few weeks our local authority have been directed by the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Education, and some other Ministers, to have recourse to our own banks for accommodation.  I have questioned county managers on this, but the only person capable of giving a clear answer to the question is the Minister for Finance: I want to know whether this money which local authorities are compelled to borrow from sources outside the Local Loans Fund will be in competition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want the Minister to confirm that he is satisfied that he has arranged for the collection of <Col N="1364" /> sufficient revenue to meet all Government expenses in the current financial year.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give statutory authority for the change to decimal currency.  This is the first piece of decimal currency legislation. It was originally introduced in the Dáil on 16th April as the Decimal Currency Bill but the Dáil was dissolved before the text was circulated.  It is therefore necessary now to call it the No. 2 Bill.</P>
      <P>In 1962, following consideration of the report of a committee, the Government decided in principle in favour of a change to a decimal system of currency. Subsequently, consideration was given to the manner in which the Government's decision could best be implemented. The opinions of business, industrial and other organisations&mdash;and of the general public&mdash;on the question of the choice of system were sought in 1967.  In my Budget speech on 23rd April, 1968, I announced the Government's decision to introduce the £-new penny system on 15th February, 1971. Preparations for the change are proceeding satisfactorily under the general guidance of the Irish Decimal Currency Board which has been operating since June, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic objective in adopting decimal currency is to simplify money calculations. Under the present £sd system <Col N="1365" /> of currency the reckoning is in twelves, twenties and tens.  Ordinary arithmetic involves enumeration in tens only.  The benefits to be gained from bringing our money reckoning into line with ordinary arithmetic are real and substantial.  They will be felt quickly in shops, in offices and in schools&mdash;to mention but a few of the sectors that will benefit.  The advantages of the new system will greatly outweigh any temporary inconvenience or expense involved in making the change.</P>
    <P>Senators will see from the Explanatory Memorandum which I have circulated with the Bill that most of the sections contain technical provisions relating to coinage.  These follow the lines of provisions in the Coinage Act, 1950, which is to be repealed.  The main new provisions in the Bill are in sections 2, 3, 9, 10 and 16.</P>
    <P>Section 2 establishes the £-new penny system.  The new penny will be equal in value to one-hundredth part of a £, that is, 2.4 of our present pennies. Instead of pounds, shillings and pence we shall have pounds and new pence. As I mentioned already, careful consideration was given by the Government over a number of years to the choice of decimal currency system.  A special booklet which I issued in 1967 compared different systems and invited views.  The weight of opinion favoured the £-new penny system.  Britain will introduce the same system on the same date.</P>
    <P>Section 3 and the First Schedule deal with the provision of the new coins. The denominations and technical specifications of the 6 decimal coins are listed in the First Schedule.  The values of the new coins are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>50 new pence value 10/-</P>
    <P>10 new pence value 2/-</P>
    <P>5 new pence value 1/-</P>
    <P>2 new pence value 4.8d</P>
    <P>1 new penny value 2.4d and</P>
    <P>½ new penny value 1.2d.</P>
    <P>The three bronze coins for ½, 1 and 2-new pence will be lighter and easier to carry and to handle than present bronze coins.  They will also have a weight/value relationship with each other&mdash;the 2-new penny coin will be <Col N="1366" /> twice as heavy as the new penny one and this in turn will be twice as heavy as the ½-new penny.  This relationship will be an added convenience for all those businesses which handle coin in bulk.  The total value of a bag of mixed bronze coins can be found simply by weighing.</P>
    <P>The cupro-nickel 10-new penny and 5-new penny coins will have the same specifications and values as the present florin and shilling coins respectively. The highest value decimal coin will be the 50-new penny coin with value ten shillings.  The issue of a coin, rather than a note, for the 50-new pence denomination was recommended by the Decimal Currency Board.  Before making its recommendation the board had considered carefully the relative merits of the note and the coin and consulted interested trade, commercial and other bodies.  The weight of opinion was in favour of a coin.</P>
    <P>The arguments for a 50-new penny coin are convincing.  It will be of considerable convenience to the general public for shopping.  On economic grounds also there is a strong case for the coin.  It has a life of at least 50 years&mdash;after which the metal is recoverable&mdash;whereas the ten shilling note has a life of only about five months and the costs of distributing new notes and withdrawing worn ones are considerable.  The cost of issuing the 50p coinage&mdash;a once-for-all cost, virtually&mdash;will be only about twice the annually recurring replacement cost of ten shilling notes.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we might have both coin and note but it is obvious that this would create public confusion and impede the changeover. No representative body has argued in favour of such a course.</P>
    <P>In accordance with usual practice the designs of the new coins will be prescribed by regulations.  Senators will, I hope, have seen the leaflet which I published some months ago giving details of the designs.  Copies of the leaflet are available in the Library. Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill authorise the Central Bank to issue the 5, 10 and 50-new penny coins in advance of 15th February, 1971.  These three coins have exact equivalent values in £sd and can <Col N="1367" /> be used in these values until the changeover date.  It is proposed to start the issue of the 5 and 10-new penny coins this autumn and to bring out the 50-new penny coin early next year. Thus the public will be familiar with the three cupro-nickel decimal coins well before the changeover to the new system begins.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prescribe how certain payments involving a halfpenny are to be varied when the ½d coin is demonetised on and from 1 August, 1969.  The payments involved are small premiums under industrial life assurance policies and payments under friendly society contracts.  A large number of these contractual payments involve an odd ½d and it is necessary to have a statutory provision to prescribe how they are to be adapted to the new situation.  Section 16 will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ensure that the total amount payable over a period will be maintained constant in each case.</P>
    <P>A second Decimal Currency Bill will be needed later this year to settle other matters of detail.  These are matters such as the conversion of bank balances, the effect of the change on hire purchase and other contracts, and the legal tender arrangements during the changeover period beginning on 15 February, 1971.  The Decimal Currency Board is at present studying the matters that need to be dealt with in the second Bill, in consultation with the interests concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend for some considerable period has been towards the adoption of the decimal system. With the prospects of entering the Common Market, apart from our close association now with European countries, it seems we have very little choice but to join with the remaining countries in adopting the decimal system. A very good start has been made by setting up the Decimal Currency Board which very carefully went into the various problems which would arise from the adoption of this system.  There are, of course, slight differences between the present system and the decimal <Col N="1368" /> system which is related only to one-tenths or tens.  I should imagine that in the early stages there will be some confusion in regard to the conversion of prices of goods from the present system to the decimal system. It will probably involve a very small margin but in fairness we should try to ensure that the benefit of the doubt will be available to the purchaser rather than the person selling the goods.</P>
      <P>I notice that the ten shilling note is to be abandoned and that instead a coin to the value of ten shillings is to be used.  It strikes me that this is a very high unit for a coin to be carried around by people, particularly in relation to the average weekly wage.  It is easier for a housewife or anybody else to lose a ten shilling coin than a ten shilling note, which is much lighter and will more easily remain in a pocket or a purse than the ten shilling coin. There is going to be a problem there.  I do not think any country in Europe has a coin valued at ten shillings.  In most European countries the coins have a value of less than ten shillings and indeed much less than ten shillings. This new ten shilling coin will apparently have the greatest value now of Common Market country coins.</P>
      <P>I was not in favour of having the ten shilling unit adopted rather than the £-new penny unit which has been adopted in Britain.  If we did this it would be better related to the average weekly earnings of our people, compared with the average weekly earnings of people in Great Britain, for the purpose of sharing out the expenditure of any particular week in relation to domestic needs.</P>
      <P>We could have adopted this 10s unit instead of the £-new penny unit without creating any inconvenience as between this country and Great Britain or for visitors from Great Britain to Ireland or visitors from Ireland to Great Britain.  I do not think it was necessary for us to adopt the £-new penny system because Britain had adopted it or because we decided to have it instead of the 10s unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Europe, paper currency is still used to a very great extent.  From my experience of coins in Europe, I could say that coins were the rubbish and <Col N="1369" /> paper was the usable money but a 10s coin is no rubbish and we are going to use a 10s coin here.  I see the argument which the Minister has offered, that is, that paper currency has to be replaced more frequently, almost twice the number of times, as compared with a copper or nickel coin, which might last for 50 years.</P>
    <P>It is possible that people will be obliged to use a purse more than they have been doing in recent times.  Generally speaking, the housewife uses a purse more than the man-in-the-street who does not have to carry so many coins at present but if he is going to have units up to 10s in coins he will have to return to the old system of carrying a coin purse in addition to his wallet.</P>
    <P>A very valuable contribution has been made by the Irish Decimal Currency Board and all those other organisations which are educating the public in relation to the decimal system and, in particular, decimal currency.</P>
    <P>The decimal system is a simpler method of calculation than the system we have been using.  In business, engineering and the various professions the use of the decimal system will make for greater efficiency and simplification of calculations.  Of course there will be considerable expense involved for those who find it necessary to adapt various types of calculating machines, computers, adding machines, cash registers and so on but, in the long run, the expense will be justified because of the simplicity of the decimal system.  The use of the decimal system is a positive move towards greater efficiency and speedier calculation and will bring great benefits to the community in general.  All classes in the community will be involved in the benefits arising from the changeover to the decimal system because of its greater simplicity than the system we use at present. There are certain types of offices which are involved in continual calculations and, of course, from morning to evening shop assistants and office clerks are involved in calculations.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister intends almost immediately to bring into use some of the coins of lower value such as the 5 penny, 10 penny and 50 new <Col N="1370" /> penny coins.  It would seem that D-day is to be 15th February, 1971.  That leaves exactly 18 months to educate the organisations that will be involved in the application of this new system, who will have to study the implications of the change and prepare for the change.  Eighteen months will probably be found to be a short time, but I think it is a good idea to make a start with the smaller units even at this stage so that people will become accustomed to exchanging the decimal coins and making the appropriate calculations, which will simplify the process for the day when the £-new penny currency becomes available in addition to the 50 new pence denomination which is expected to come at an earlier stage. I am in favour of this new system.  Most of us are looking forward to it because we realise that it will simplify daily problems of calculation, particularly where currency is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all welcome this Bill initiating the changeover to the decimal system, beginning with currency.  This system is the basis of calculation used in Europe and America and, with England moving on, we have no option but to make the change.  In any case, it is a worthwhile change, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>There are some points of detail that we might consider.  First, there is the question of the 10s unit being a coin or a note.  It does seem rather large as a coin.  On the other hand, we can look back to the 1930s when the half-crown was in use and even the 5s piece.  Obviously, the half-crown of the 1930s is the equivalent of the 10s note today.  So, I do not think that should create any real difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do feel, looking at the system proposed, is that there are perhaps a bit too many breakdowns in it.  For instance, the 2 new penny piece seems to be a rather unnecessary coin.  It is also out of line with the general decimal approach.  In the United States, they have the cent, five cents, ten cents, and so on, going up in multiples of five.  If inflation continues, as it probably will, then the halfpenny, which corresponds to the present penny, will probably be withdrawn from circulation some time in the not <Col N="1371" /> too distant future and that would tidy up the system as it is.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of some inflation arising on the introduction of the new system, I feel that, by and large, a blanket order simply knocking off whatever fractions could not be provided in the new money would work all right and that it would certainly be going downwards rather than upwards and should not affect commodities. In most cases where commodities would be likely to be affected, occasionally you have number changes and slight weight changes.  I doubt if it would be desirable to encourage this on a wide scale.  Therefore, I think that the industries concerned should be able to absorb a rubbing-out of all parts that cannot be paid rather than rounding them up to the next available quantity.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no mention of the paper notes for the future.  I take it that the present idea is that the £5 and £10 notes would continue.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that they are both very unwieldy notes and are considerably out of line with the type of smaller and more easily handled paper note in other countries.  The £10 note, especially, is a grotesque effort.  It should be possible to standardise it thus using far less paper which, in turn, would take up less space.</P>
    <P>As far as the education of the public in the use of the new system is concerned, I do not think that that will present any great problem.  If we could get television away from some of its performances sufficiently to give it a little coverage, I am sure a few weeks intensive coverage, especially when some of the new coins are in circulation, would get our people used to it. It would probably be much better for the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; than some of the stuff it has considered worth while putting on in recent times.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure and, in general, I welcome the whole conversion to the decimal system.  It will get rid of many of the absurdities which plague school children as well as much of the bewilderment we now cause to tourists by our systems of weights and measures, currency, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to welcome this Bill.  The introduction of decimalisation was inevitable in view of our efforts to get into the Common Market.  Apart from the fact that the introduction was inevitable, it is most welcome for many reasons.  It makes the process of calculation simpler.  It will remove much of the torture in the teaching of arithmetic in the schools. Children have gone through many painful years&mdash;I mean &ldquo;painful&rdquo; literally&mdash;in learning the tables which we all learned in the past.  There will be a jolt, of course, in the introduction of decimalisation and also in the introduction of metrication later on.</P>
      <P>I should like to make this offer to the Minister.  I mentioned this also to the members of the Decimal Currency Board.  The Irish National Teachers' Organisation are prepared voluntarily to throw their full weight into the conducting of familiarisation courses for adults who may feel that its introduction will upset them and cause them undue worry.  The courses will be conducted in the various national schools throughout the country.  There is a national school in every parish and the school building can be used for this purpose. The services of teachers can be availed of in order to ease the jolt which may be caused to the public who may be unprepared to accept the introduction of decimalisation and, later on, metrication. I offer that service to the Minister. We consider that teachers play and important role in the community and that their function should not cease at the end of the school day.  We feel they should place their services at the disposal of the community, particularly at an important turning-point in the history of our country.</P>
      <P>The introduction of decimalisation and metrication is a turning point in our history.  Our national teachers are prepared to play their part in the introduction of these two systems.  I intend to have further discussions with the officials of the Decimal Currency Board after the summer recess.  I had preliminary talks with them but I was unable to follow them up due to a variety of matters which we had in hand at the time.</P>

      <P>I note that the Seanad generally has welcomed this measure and that a few queries have been raised by individual Senators. First of all, may I particularly welcome the contribution by Senator Brosnahan and the offer which he has made.  It is indeed particularly welcome and it is a matter of very considerable importance. It is very encouraging for me and I know it will be equally encouraging for the board to know that they can count on the wholehearted and expert support of the national teachers in this fairly complicated task of preparing the public for the change-over. Senator Brosnahan's suggestion that the schools could be used for the education of the general public in this decimal currency matter is excellent. I am glad of it.  I hope he will, as early as he can, take the matter further with the Decimal Currency Board because they, too, will be very pleased indeed with what assistance he can offer.  No one group of people in the whole life of the country would be better equipped in this matter of training and teaching the public than a trained professional teacher.</P>
      <P>Senator Rooney talked about the coins.  He asked if I could give him some examples of other countries in which high value coins are in use.  I shall mention just a few.  Germany has a five Deutschemark coin which is equivalent to our 10s; Spain has a 100 peseta coin which is equivalent to about 12s; Belgium has a 100 franc coin which is about 16s 8d and Switzerland has a five Swiss franc coin which is about 10s, so that a coin of this value is very widely known and in use in a considerable number of countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked about the notes.  We have tried to make the change-over as simple and uncomplicated as possible so as not to burden the public with too many complications, not to put too great a strain on the ordinary member of the general public and to reduce the number of changes to which he will be subjected to the minimum.  Following that policy we are retaining all the notes except the ten shilling note.  The £1 and the £5 and so on will be the same and we will not consider changing those for some <Col N="1374" /> time after decimalisation.  In other words, if we are changing the notes in either size or design we will wait until the whole process of decimalisation has got across and everybody is fully familiar with the new system before introducing changes which, while they might be an improvement, would not be regarded as urgent or immediately necessary.  I think they are the main points which were raised but if there are any other matters we can deal with them on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to raise.  The Minister has decided to have the £ note instead of the ten shilling note as the unit.  I think there is an argument in favour of the 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a very strong argument in favour of the 10s.  Indeed the 10s as a basic unit has been adopted by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa and if our circumstances had been different we would probably have opted for the 10s as the basic unit. However, we had to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of any particular system and whereas the 10s unit as a basic denomination would have a considerable number of advantages we decided, on balance, to opt for the other system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Stud Company, which were set up under the National Stud Act, 1945, as a measure to assist and encourage the breeding of thoroughbred horses in Ireland, have been carrying on the business of a stud farm at Tully, County Kildare since 1946.  Up to 1944, when it was transferred to the Irish Government, this extensive property had been used by the British Government as a stud farm. The transfer to the Irish Government, however, included no bloodstock.</P>
      <P>The Irish bloodstock industry has increased progressively in value since the War.  At the more important Irish and English sales international buyers compete for our foals and yearlings and pay excellent prices for them.  The blood lines introduced by Irish-bred sires have enhanced both the quality of the thoroughbred and the image of the Irish hourse throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The net export value of the thoroughbred industry is in the region of £4 million a year including the benefits accruing from the substantial spendings of foreign owners who send horses to Ireland for training and their sires and mares to Irish studs.  Horsebreeding provides both regular and good, as well as interesting, employment in the Irish countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, however, take account of the fact that conditions in the industry, as in many other areas, are changing rapidly.  In other countries&mdash;notably the United States, Great Britain and <Col N="1377" /> France&mdash;with which we have to compete, vast sums are being invested in it.</P>
    <P>The directors of our Irish National Stud Company have been reviewing the Company's position in the light of developments abroad and of the recommendations of the Survey Team on the Horse Breeding Industry which reported in 1965.  Their conclusions are somewhat disquieting.  The National Stud, instead of being the show place that it really ought to be, is not measuring up to the standards set by some of the best privately-owned here or abroad.</P>
    <P>Many of the Stud's inherited buildings are now both old and uneconomic. The number of stallions, presently only four, is inadequate to cater for breeders' demands.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fashion&rdquo; is a highly relevant factor in this business.  It is five years since the Company bought its last new stallion whereas many good young sires have been acquired by private studs in the interval.  Our National Stud should be put in the position of being able to offer at least comparable facilities.  In recognition of their responsibilities to small breeders the Stud's fees are low.  The Stud's &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; basis of charge is not common in the industry generally where high-class sires are concerned. I must stress that this concession is no small boon to the breeder of limited means.</P>
    <P>Additional stallions are also needed by the Company to produce extra income to off-set increasing maintenance and overhead charges.</P>
    <P>Some £300,000 has been spent since 1960 by the Company on bloodstock and on additions and improvements to the Stud's facilities.  The Company's capital resources are now almost exhausted. I am impressed by the case made to me by the Board that a substantial injection of new capital is now urgently needed to purchase additional stallions, to construct new yards for visiting mares and to replace old and uneconomic buildings.  The cost of the Company's programme of necessary developments and improvements would entail an expenditure of the order of £500,000 to £600,000 spread over the next three or four years.</P>
    <P>The Company's authorised share <Col N="1378" /> capital under the National Stud Act, 1953, is £500,000.  The programme I have outlined would require an increase of this capital to at least £1,000,000.  The additional finance required would be provided by the Exchequer by the way of share capital taken up by the Minister for Finance under Section 19 of the original Act of 1945 after statutory consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>So far I have been speaking of objectives calling for a total share capital of about £1 million.  Section 2 of the Bill before the House provides, however, that this capital should be £2m. and this brings me to the matter of the acquisition by the National Stud of what is termed a &ldquo;prestige stallion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In its 1965 report the Survey Team on the Horse Breeding Industry accepted that the National Stud was providing a reasonable service to small breeders.  However, having considered all the available indications of the state of the throughbred industry here and the international standing of Irish horses, the Team recommended (and I quote verbatim) that &ldquo;there should be at all times at least one prestige stallion standing at the National Stud&rdquo;. The Directors of the Irish National Stud Company endorse this recommendation although conscious of the risk inevitably associated with the investment of a good deal of money in a horse which might prove disappointing at stud.</P>
    <P>The addition of this extra £1m. of share capital is, then merely an enabling provision which might be resorted to in the event of there becoming available what the directors of the Company considered to be the right kind of horse at the right price. The special concern of the Minister for Finance in that contingency would be the ability of the Exchequer at the particular moment to provide the Company with the amount of share capital needed to effect a proposed purchase.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the Company's bank borrowings which, under the original Act of 1945, are restricted to £100,000 or to the amount of share capital unissued, whichever <Col N="1379" /> is the less.  An increase of fixed capital as proposed in this Bill would obviously call for some corresponding increase in working capital and temporary borrowing facilities.  The effect of section 3 would be to enable the Company to borrow, as necessary, up to £200,000 without limitation by reference to unissued share capital.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Realising the importance of the horse-breeding and bloodstock industry, we are in favour of this proposal.  Irish horses are world famous and we have had many successes outside the country as owners of these horses which, in most cases, have been sold to other countries.  This country is constantly visited by people from abroad who want to purchase first-class bloodstock.  We have many reputable trainers and breeders engaged in the racehorse industry.  The Bill points out that owing to lack of capital our National Stud buildings and facilities fall far behind buildings and facilities owned by private persons. The idea of having the National Stud is to make a valuable contribution to a very important industry which is considered to be worth £4 million or £5 million net.  That represents a substantial part of our economy.</P>
      <P>I see that in the National Stud there are at present four stallions.  Since it is a national concern it caters more for the small breeder by having a reasonably low fee and also by adopting the principle of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo;. This is very important for small breeders and owners who cannot afford to lose a substantial fee and this is what would happen if they availed of the services of some private concern where famous or well-bred stallions are standing. If the small breeder has to depend on stallions at private studs and risk losing his fee he will be discouraged and, possibly, forced out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>History has shown that many of our world-famous horses were bred by small farmers who were interested in horses&mdash;people who took an interest in horses and always had one about the place because of their love for horses and their love for thoroughbred animals.  These small farmers, by the <Col N="1380" /> manner in which they took care of those animals and by their expertise in breeding them, made a very valuable contribution towards our fame as a country in which bloodstock of a very high class is produced.</P>
    <P>In recent times, because the National Stud was so very restricted as far as capital is concerned, many private studs have brought into this country sires of a prestige nature, with the result that the small farmers who made such a valuable contribution to the bloodstock industry were unable to avail of the services of those prestige stallions of international fame from America and Great Britain.  I am not sure whether there are some famous French stallions in this country but it is quite true that world-famous animals are in the country outside the National Stud.  It is proposed, now and in the future, to have at least one prestige stallion at the National Stud.  I suppose a prestige stallion, to be kept at the National Stud, necessarily need not be an animal from outside the country.  It could be a famous stallion which was bred here and achieved great success both inside and outside the country, such as Sir Ivor.</P>
    <P>The buildings at the National Stud leave much to be desired.  I was interested to see that it is proposed to make finance available so that the premises there&mdash;the boxes and all the facilities which are normally available where these sires are kept&mdash;can be brought up to modern standards.  Recently it was found that many privately-owned studs are far more modern and provide much better facilities than the facilities at present available at the National Stud.  It is desirable that this change should be made quickly and that the premises should be brought up to a very high standard.  This is important to ensure that the small breeder will have all the advantages which would be available to him with the better equipment in private studs.</P>
    <P>The National Stud is engaged mainly in producing racehorses for the horse-racing industry&mdash;mainly the flat racing type of animal and possibly some hurdlers.  I am wondering whether they also cater for steeplechasing stallions at the National Stud, because Irish steeplechasers are world famous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> In the English Grand National, one of the greatest steeplechases in the world, a quota of Irish horses always compete.  I should like to know whether, in fact, the National Stud keeps a stallion of the steeplechasing class to ensure that our world-famous steeplechasing breeds are maintained and expanded.  Many visitors to this country are engaged in the horse-breeding industry and are interested in purchasing steeplechasers, although the real money is associated with flat racing and the horses engaged in it.</P>
    <P>It occurred to me to inquire whether arrangements could be made also for the National Stud to keep a stallion of the show jumping type of hourse, because show jumping has become very popular in Ireland, Europe and America and even in Japan.  The Japanese are very interested in show jumping and they frequently compete here.  They certainly come here to purchase show jumpers, and those show jumpers command a very high price when purchased by those countries&mdash;so high that very often when a good Irish show jumper is on the market here, no one in Ireland can afford to purchase that animal because our show jumping system is not geared to meet that kind of expense.</P>
    <P>The only market which the owner of a good Irish show jumper has is the Irish Army.  Our Army should be in a position to purchase those show jumpers if they seem to offer prospects for international show jumping competition at a later stage.  It is important, because we are so deeply involved in breeding thoroughbred horses in Ireland, that our Army should be provided with the best possible show jumpers and that our show jumping team should be given every facility to compete in international events in order to maintain our good name and to promote the sale of Irish-bred horses.</P>
    <P>We have had successes in the past by our Army riders.  I think it is fair to say that we cannot win in those competitions unless the best show jumping horses are available to us. Many of the best show jumping horses are purchased by outsiders.  The result is that the Irish Army horses competing <Col N="1382" /> in international events are not good enough to win in these competitions and are beaten by Irish horses which have been purchased by outsiders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out to the Senator that this Bill deals with thoroughbreds.  There is a new horse board coming up which will deal with halfbreds, show jumpers and so on. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has a Bill almost ready for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. I did not realise that.  The point I am making is that the encouragement and breeding of show jumpers is very important to this country.  I am very glad to learn that a new Bill is on the stocks which will bring our show jumping fame a step further.  I note that it is five years since the National Stud purchased its last stallion.  That shows, in effect, that they were not in a position to purchase any good stallions that came on the market in the meantime. This Bill gives it the opportunity to go into the market to purchase at least one prestige stallion whenever it wishes to do so, finance permitting.  There is a slight difference between a prestige stallion and one that has a very successful record.  However, from the international point of view it is important that one of these animals should be there apart from the very good ones which are there already that have made a very good name for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all welcome this Bill as an effort to develop further the horse-breeding industry here.  However, I doubt if the approach is big enough.  I should like to see the National Stud Company acting more as a bloodstock development corporation for the country as a whole with the objectives first, of making this country into a training centre for most of Europe and perhaps America, and secondly, of developing very substantially as a breeding centre for thoroughbreds for this area.  In our climate and in our conditions we have a great deal to offer, and from the national point of view horse-breeding is a profitable and worthwhile use of our land.  The return from bloodstock, when scientific, modern methods are <Col N="1383" /> used, is probably the highest return that can be got from agricultural land. With modern transportation means, it has been proved time and time again that horses trained here can be sent to France or America without suffering in the transportation and can compete on equal terms with the locally trained animals.  Of course that has been made possible only in the last few years, and that is a feature which will develop much more.  What Sir Ivor did for the industry last year has shown that there are no limits to the possibilities.</P>
      <P>I commend the enlightened decision by the Government in this year's Finance Bill to exempt from income tax the earnings of stud farms from fees and so on.  That is a positive inducement to owners to send their more valuable animals here, and there should be a great expansion as a result.  It is not sufficient to have only four stallions at the National Stud.  I should like to see the National Stud operate a system of leasing of other Irish studs. If they take a certain amount of the responsibility for proving some animals, get them to a certain stage and have a few crops of progeny racing from them, then it should be deliberate policy to lease such stallions to other Irish studs or even to sell to these studs, provided there is a commitment that they could not be sold to leave the country within a specified number of years.  In that way the influence of the National Stud on the development of the industry would be much greater.</P>
      <P>There should be a much more positive approach by the National Stud to the question of the racing of Irish animals.  At present we have to rely for all our prestige on American owners. The National Stud should enter this sphere of the industry.  It would give tremendous prestige to the industry if his Excellency the President of Ireland were to lead in the winner of the Sweeps Derby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish horses which win the big races in Ireland should also be able to compete abroad.  The English national stud used to do this but I do not think it is doing much of it in recent years. This is part of the prestige build-up. An Irish-trained horse owned by an <Col N="1384" /> American is only half as valuable to our national prestige as an Irish-bred horse owned by the National Stud or owned, as the law requires, by the President of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question raised by Senator Rooney on the development of the other side of the racing industry, that is the steeplechasers and hurdle racers, hunters and so on, I do not think that it is appropriate that what is a prestige flat-racing establishment like the National Stud should be engaged in the other because it would be an opportunity to offer what would be cast-offs from the main flat racing industry.  We should have some type of similar establishment set up to do precisely the same type of job that I have outlined for the hunters, because while our prestige in flat racing has increased enormously over the past five years the prestige of our jumpers has decreased very considerably.  Something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that show jumping is to be catered for and that the type of half-breed horse involved will be catered for by a new Bill to come shortly.  there is something big here too and I would like that we would now approach it in the line of a major industry capable of contributing not the £4 million a year which it contributes at present but that that £4 million could be quadrupled within the next five years.  It certainly would be the most profitable use to which we could put large stretches of our agricultural land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not quite support what the last speaker, Senator Quinlan, has said as regards making this National Stud into a super racing establishment. I feel that this would probably mean taking the rich prizes from the private breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>However, under this Bill it is a prestige proposition.  By buying an expensive stallion and bringing him to this country you feel that you do raise a standard or at least give publicity to Irish bloodstock.  I feel that there is something more, and that if possible in buying that stallion admittedly with prestige we should aim at one with Irish blood history as much <Col N="1385" /> as possible behind him because in that way you will attract the buyer of Irish stock.  A great many breeders who would like to start breeding would and do come to this country for foundation stock.  If the National Stud would encourage solid good foundation stock of mares or fillies it would possibly be a very great asset to the country financially if it could be said that there was no country in the world where you get better foundation stock than in this country.  That could very well be and possibly is to a certain extent now, and that sort of prestige is more valuable to the country than perhaps buying an Italian, French, English or American sire which had proved himself and whose history had no or very little relation to any Irish breeding in the past.  I know that now and again you do bring in some foreign blood, but I would like to see a good foundation of Irish stock supported.  I do not know whether they do it now or not.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see the stud competing in any large way in racing, but I would like to see them making all the educational facilities available to Irish breeders.  They probably do it now.  Certainly I would not like to see them in competition with Irish breeders in any respect.  I remember years ago attending a course there in the winter months on the care and upkeep of mares and foals.  I do not know whether these courses are still going on or not, but then it was quite a considerable job to get a place on one of these courses where they took about 40 people for a week.  They were very valuable, and certainly I appreciated it very much and so did all the people who were there with me. This sort of course for Irish breeders would be very valuable.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see anything in the way of competition, and if they have a reasonable sire at the stud and he becomes popular I would like to see some way either by lot or by some other way of ensuring that the fees of that horse were not raised according as it became popular because they would be going to give an advantage perhaps to the smaller breeders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan was asking about leasing.  In the past they have leased, or certainly horses have stood at other <Col N="1386" /> places in the country.  There again I would not like to see a horse that has been reasonably successful at a certain fee at the National Stud being leased without some tie on the price that the breeders would have to pay, because you could get a horse that perhaps in a few years time had acquired prestige because he was reasonably good as a breeder when he was at the National Stud and when leased to somebody would suddenly become more popular perhaps for steeplechasers which take a longer time to mature and the lessor would be inclined to raise the fees up and up.  We want if possible to keep the National Stud for the advantage of the breeders as well as for horse breeding in general in the country.</P>

      <P>Once again I find myself in the position of expressing my gratitude to the House for the manner in which it has received a piece of legislation which I am sponsoring.  I am glad that the House has expressed interest in the National Stud and has also indicated that generally it would be in favour of a first class national stud and one which would be encouraged to expand its activities, because those are my own views and the views of the Government.  We are anxious that the National Stud should be as near to the ideal as we can get.  It should be a show place for the Irish thoroughbred, it should be as well equipped as possible, and it should play an increasingly important role in our bloodstock industry. I would hope that this piece of legislation will be the first step in a considerable expansion of the role of the National Stud in our bloodstock breeding and indeed in our agriculture generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall carefully consider the points that were put forward by Senators, and it is my intention, indeed, at an early date to have a meeting with the board and discuss with them an expanded programme of activity.  I agree especially with Senator Cole that the stud could and should have a very important role to play educationally in helping the ordinary breeder&mdash;and, indeed, all breeders&mdash;to know more about their business, and to cope with their problems more efficiently.  The stud should <Col N="1387" /> play an increasingly significant role in this area through the organisation of seminars and classes of all sorts.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney spoke about the Irish show jumper and the situation in regard to the half bred generally.  The situation there is that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has on the stocks a piece of legislation which will establish an Irish horse board which will have the responsibility of developing a comprehensive programme for the whole halfbred field.  I hope the establishment of that board will take place soon and that this board will immediately get down to the business of exploiting the full potential of that unique animal, the Irish halfbred horse, because he is unique.  Whatever about others competing with us where the thoroughbred is concerned there is no country in the world which can attempt to come near us as far as the development of the Irish halfbred is concerned.</P>
    <P>In fact, I think he is far too good for us and I do not think we have done enough to deserve him.  In spite of a great deal of neglect down the years he still remains supreme.  I believe the time has come now when we must act to recognise what a wonderful national asset we have in the Irish halfbred. However, that is by the way.  What we are concerned about here is the role of the National Stud and the development of the Irish thoroughbred industry. As I said, I will consider carefully the suggestions and ideas put forward by Senators and discuss them with the board of the National Stud who, I hope, will evolve a sound, practical, but expanding programme of activities for the years immediately ahead.</P>

    <P>This Bill, as a result of which gross expenditure on Social Welfare will be increased by some £17 millions in a full year, represents a worthwhile advance in the field of social security in this country.</P>
    <P>It is necessary with this type of legislation to draft the Bill mainly by way of amendments to existing Acts, and I trust the Senators will find the explanatory memorandum circulated with the text helpful in interpreting the various amendments.</P>
    <P>The Budget proposals for improvements in the field of social assistance provided for in the Bill and due to <Col N="1390" /> come into operation at the beginning of August next will give an extra 10s a week to all existing non-countributory old age, blind, widow and orphan pensioners. This will make the maximum personal rate of old age and blind pension £3 15s a week and the maximum personal rate of widow's pension £3 13s 6d a week.  These increases in the personal rates of pension will enable the scale of means and rates of pension to be extended in each case to give additional rates which will be payable to persons whose means are outside the present limits for pension.</P>
    <P>The rates of unemployment assistance for persons in urban and rural areas are also being increased by 10s a week for the recipient and by a further 10s where there is an adult dependent.  The maximum rate will then be £3 1s 6d for a single person and £5 17s 6d for a married couple resident in an urban area; outside urban areas the corresponding rates will be £2 15s for a single person and £5 9s 6d for a married couple.  These increases of unemployment assistance at the maximum will have the effect of automatically extending the means limit for qualification for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The monthly rate of children's allowance for the second qualified child in each family is being increased by 14s 6d to £1 10s and the rate for the third and subsequent qualified children by 13s 6d to £2, the rate for the first qualified child remaining unchanged at 10s a month.</P>
    <P>Adjustments of the tax-free allowances under the income tax code to be made in respect of the second and subsequent children in families will, to some extent, offset the increase in rates of children's allowances for the children in families which are liable for income tax.  However, the larger families not so liable will gain substantially from the increases in children's allowances&mdash;a four child family will get £6 a month as against £3 18s 6d at present and a six child family will get £10 as against £6 11s 6d at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for a new grant of £100 to be payable on a multiple birth of three children and £150 on a multiple birth of more than three <Col N="1391" /> children.  This grant will be in addition to any monthly children's allowance which the family may receive in respect of those children, the rate of which, in the case of such multiple births, is double the normal rate.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of social insurance benefits and pensions, due to come into operation at the beginning of January next, will provide an extra 10/- a week for recipients of old age (contributory) pension, widows' (contributory) pension, orphans' (contributory) allowance, disability benefit, unemployment benefit and maternity allowance.  There will also be an additional 10/- a week for an adult dependant.  A single old age (contributory) pensioner will get £4 2s 6d a week and a married couple £7 12s 6d a while a widow without children will get £3 15s a week.  The personal rates of unemployment and disability benefit will then be £3 15s a week for a single person and £6 17s 6d for a married couple.  Certain rates of unemployment benefit, which are payable where unemployment continues after 156 days, are the same as the maximum rates of unemployment assistance payable in urban areas and as assistance rates are being increased from the beginning of August next, these particular rates of unemployment benefit are also being increased from then.</P>
    <P>To meet the extra expenditure on the increased rates of benefits and pensions, an increase in the social insurance contributions payable by employers and employees is necessary.  The increase provided for in the rates of social insurance contributions, where all insurance benefits are covered, is 3s 9d a week, with lesser increases where only some of the benefits are covered.  The increase of 3s 9d in the ordinary rate of men's contributions will be shared by the employer paying 1s 11d and employee 1s 10d and the new social insurance contribution will then be 25s 1d a week.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the increases and improvements in the social insurance system generally being provided in the Bill, it is proposed to deal similarly with the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increases <Col N="1392" /> proposed are 10/- in the rates of the main weekly paid benefits and allowances with proportionate increases in other payments.  These changes will not involve any charge on the Exchequer as all benefits under the scheme are met out of the Occupational Injuries Fund which is financed by contributions paid by employers only. An increase of 1d in these contributions will be necessary to meet the cost of the increases.</P>
    <P>The overall weekly employment contribution payable in respect of men in ordinary industrial or commercial employment will, from January, 1970, be 28s 3d made up of 25s 1d in respect of social insurance, 2s 2d in respect of occupational injuries insurance and 1/- in respect of redundancy payments. Of this, the employer will pay 15s 5d and the employee 12s 10d.  In the case of women in such employment, the overall weekly contribution will be 26/-made up of 23s 8d for social insurance, 1s 7d for occupational injuries insurance and 9d for redundancy.  Of this the employer will pay 14s 4d, the employee 11s 8d.</P>
    <P>The rate of voluntary contribution covering widows' and orphans' pensions only will be increased by 8d to 5s 3d and the voluntary contribution which covers also old age (contributory) pension will be increased by 1s 6d to 10s 10d.  A table showing the present and proposed rates of contribution appears in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Last year, a new benefit was introduced for incapacitated old age pensioners, both contributory and non-contributory, and for contributory widow pensioners aged 70 and over.  At present the benefit consists of an increase of pension of £2 5s a week payable where a pensioner requires full-time care and attention and has no other adult living with him capable of looking after him other than a prescribed female relative. The female relative must be a daughter or step-daughter.  The Bill proposes to modify the scheme from the beginning of January, 1970, by removing the existing statutory requirement that the prescribed female relative must have given up insurable employment to look after the pensioner and by providing power for the general conditions of the <Col N="1393" /> scheme to be laid down in regulations. This will supplement the powers already in the scheme to prescribe what female relative can qualify and will make the scheme more flexible. The rate of payment is also being increased to £2 15s a week under the Bill.</P>
    <P>A further provision in the Bill is designed to assist widows and those having the care of orphans in the education of children.  This will raise to 21 years, under both the contributory and non-contributory schemes, the age limit for orphans' pensions and for qualification for the increases in respect of children payable with widows' pensions, where the children continue in full-time education.  The present age limit for qualified children is 16 in the case of these pensions.  The new age limit will also apply in the case of orphans and the children of widows and widowers in the occupational injuries scheme, where the age limit is 18 years at present.</P>
    <P>Up to 1966 a person receiving old age (contributory) pension or widow's (contributory) pension was disqualified for receiving the corresponding non-contributory pension.  In that year statutory provision was made to enable the contributory pensioners mentioned to opt for the appropriate non-contributory pension, if it would be of advantage to them to do so.  From August next when non-contributory pensions are increased until January next when contributory pensions are increased, cases will arise where the non-contributory pension would be temporarily more favourable than the corresponding contributory pension.  It was never the intention that the provisions of the 1966 Act should operate in such circumstances and the Departmental machinery is not geared to handle temporary transfers from one pension to the other and back again. The Bill will, therefore, prevent such temporary switching of pensions but the right of a pensioner to switch where the advantage would be permanent will not be affected.</P>
    <P>A non-contributory old age pensioner who is detained in a mental hospital cannot at present get more than £1 of his pension as pocket money, and then only if the hospital authorities <Col N="1394" /> think he is capable of using money. There is provision in the Bill to remove this limit of £1.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into any greater detail at this stage as I hope that the explanatory memorandum will have given Senators a comprehensive picture of the proposals in the Bill and of their effects.  It may help if I summarise the cost of the various proposals in the Bill.  On the social assistance side there is £3,071,000 for old age and blind pensions, £507,000 for widows' and orphans' pensions, £1,280,000 for unemployment assistance, and £5,278,000 for children's allowances, the total cost being £10,136,000 in a full year, all of which will fall on the Exchequer.  There will, however, be a recovery of some £400,000 of this by way of adjustments in the income tax code in respect of children.  The gross cost of improvements on the social insurance side will be £6,969,000.  Allowing for an increased annual income of £5,255,000 to be raised from the increases in rates of contributions, the cost to be met by the Exchequer will be £1,714,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in recommending the Bill to Seanad Éireann and I would ask for speedy and favourable consideration of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill mainly sets out the new scales for the various classes of persons mentioned.  There are some minor changes in relation to the existing regulations.  The amount allowed in respect of children's allowances forms the greater part of the benefits to be provided under the Bill. It provides for an increase of approximately 50 per cent in the allowances for children.  It has been shown by statistics that in the circumstances of our economy it would be possible to increase children's allowances by 66? per cent.  However, this increase of 50 per cent, although it is long overdue, is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I notice that while the allowances for children are being increased, there is a new regulation whereby these allowances are included <Col N="1395" /> in the income of the parents for the purpose of calculating the amount of income tax payable by these people so that this regulation will, in effect, take back approximately £400,000 from a number of the parents whose earnings are subject to income tax.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there is a change in so far as the payments to old age pensioners in hospital are concerned. For some time now there have been complaints from old age pensioners to the effect that while they were in hospital they were only allowed £1 per week out of their pensions and even less in many cases. Under the new regulation a non-contributory old age pensioner while detained in a mental hospital will in future be allowed more than £1 per week if he is considered fit to use money.  However, the regulation only removes the £1 per week limit; it does not indicate any maximum after that. Apparently, the discretion is to be left to somebody and we do not know if it will be left to the mental hospital authorities or to the health authority for the area concerned, whether it be the Dublin Health Authority or any other health authority, but whoever is to decide will, at some stage, have to reckon how much pocket money is to be allowed to a mental patient.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not refer to the health boards all over the country but it is true that there are complaints from old age pensioners regarding the confiscation of their pensions by these authorities.  I suppose that the reason why this has not been mentioned by the Minister in his statement is because the Minister has not any responsibility for the action of the health authorities in so far as confiscating the pensions of these people is concerned.</P>
    <P>The increases must be reckoned by everybody concerned when we realise that these pensions are subsistence payments.  They are payments to people who are in poor circumstances and who have proved this.  The means test has not been removed.  These people, in order to qualify for payment of their pensions, are still subject to this means <Col N="1396" /> test.  The application of the means test in different parts of the country varies because in some areas it seems that pensioners have a better chance of getting the full pension than in other areas.  Apparently it depends on the pension officer for the district concerned.</P>
    <P>The pensions officer is required by law to comply with the regulations in relation to the means test.  When a report goes to the Department and the incomes of the unfortunate people are actually taken into consideration for the purpose of reducing the pensions payable to them.  I am told that it would cost approximately £17 million per year to abolish the means test altogether, taking into consideration the number of people now reaching the age of 70 years.  The total cost of abolishing the means test would be very much greater in the future, having regard to the possibility of having the age for the pension reduced to 65 years.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is more important to reduce the age limit than to abolish the means test because we know from experience that a number of people, having reached the age of 65 years or over, are not enjoying very good health and are unable to do a week's work to earn a week's wages.  They are often on home assistance, unemployment benefit or some other means of support of a very limited nature.  They have to struggle on until they reach the age of 70 years to become entitled to the contributory or non-contributory old age pension.  There is a good case to be made for reducing the age limit for the claimants of these pensions when we see a number of people in very poor circumstances who have reached the age of 65 years finding it difficult to make ends meet.  Because of their health they are unable to work and unable to earn the wages which would enable them to live more comfortably.</P>
    <P>The Government have not adopted a prices and incomes policy.  The people on small pensions or small weekly payments suffer very much because of the rise in the cost of living and of the increased prices. These are two different things.  Rising prices affect everybody to a very considerable extent.  No attempt is made <Col N="1397" /> to keep prices down, particularly prices of goods which are regarded as normal commodities required by every individual.</P>
    <P>In calculating the cost of living, approximately 200 items are listed and considered and their prices compared so that a calculation of the cost of living can be made.  No attempt is made, among those 200 items, to control the prices of any of them.  The odd halfpenny, penny or shilling is put on to these goods and the pensioners on limited incomes find they are able to purchase less goods with their allowances. Even in the last 12 months the purchasing power of the £ has fallen by 1/-.  If no attempt is made by the Government&mdash;and they have no apparent intention of doing this&mdash;to preserve the value of money it is possible that the pensions we are speaking about will be approximately 1/- weaker this time 12 months which would make the figure 3s 9d in the case of a pension of £3 15s.  If a man is getting £3 15s now it would take £3 18s 9d to purchase the same goods this time next year as he could purchase now with his £3 15s, having regard to the continued fall in the value of money.  The value of money has fallen by 50 per cent since 1948 so in a matter of 20 years the purchasing power of £1 has fallen by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>People on what I call subsistence allowances are the people most affected by the fall in the purchasing power of money and because no effort has been made to keep a check on the prices of the goods they have to purchase in the normal way.  Indeed, most of the goods these people must purchase in the normal process of living are subject to purchase tax and wholesale tax. The Government, therefore, while giving out these weekly payments, do nothing to ensure that prices are kept within a reasonable level and the goods these people must purchase are heavily taxed by the very Government making these social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill provides for an increase of 10s a week under the Occupational Injuries Act.  It appears that this increase of 10s will be paid by the employers.  Most of these benefits are financed in three ways: the employer makes a contribution; the <Col N="1398" /> employee makes a contribution and the State makes a contribution.  Very often the employer is required to make a greater contribution than the employee who will benefit under the scheme.  But the employee also contributes. Indeed, employees make a very substantial contribution towards pensions for which they may never qualify.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of reducing the age limit for the old age pension to 65 years.  Manual workers need to be in a good state of health to earn a living. Manual workers who become unfit for work have no alternative method of earning a living.  Their earning power disappears.  It is for that reason that I suggest the age should be reduced from 70 to 65.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have been able to grant these increases and they will be welcomed by the recipients, who badly need them.  We all know how difficult it must be for an old age pensioner to live on 10s 6d a day.  Even in the cheapest restaurants or cafés one could not possibly live on 10s 6d a day. There is, too, the fact that old age pensioners have to meet rent charges, rates and other expenses.  There is free travel and free electricity but, as far as free electricity is concerned, it is quite difficult for old age pensioners to qualify for free electricity.</P>
    <P>The new rates will come into force in many cases at the beginning of January.  There is a strong case in favour of paying these increases earlier, if possible.  Apparently the increased contributions will not come into operation until January next but, despite that, a number of people are agitating to have the benefits paid sooner than announced.</P>
    <P>The grant for triplets has been increased to £100 and, for more than three children, the grant will be £150.  This may have made a certain impact on the public imagination, but I am quite sure that this will not cost the taxpayers very much.  The maternity grants should be increased.  They should be related to this new scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few misapprehensions I should like to correct. It is not correct to say that a <Col N="1399" /> new arrangement is being made whereby children's allowances are being added for the first time to the income of the parents for income tax purposes.  There is no change being made in this regard.  It is a fact that the Minister for Finance proposes to recover part of the cost of this by a reduction in the amount of tax-free allowances in respect of children so that the benefit from the increases in children's allowances will be less in the case of a family the parent of which is liable to income tax than in the case of those who are not liable for income tax.  That is really a move in the right direction.  Neither is it correct to say that the same standards are not applied in relation to the administration of the means tests in different parts of the country.  The Department take every possible precaution to see that there is uniformity in the administration of the means test and I am satisfied, at any rate, that there are very slight differences, if any, in the administration of the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the case made by Senator Rooney for the reduction of the pensionable age it is not correct to say that a person who is in wage-earning employment must try to continue, even if he is unfit, after the age of 65 until he reaches the age of 70 and that there is no social insurance benefit available to him in the meantime. That is not correct.  Unemployment benefit can be paid continuously between the ages of 65 and 70 and if a person is unfit for work disability benefit is payable.  That, of course, would apply to anybody in wage earning employment.  With regard to the point that the increased benefits under the occupational injuries scheme are to be financed completely by the employers' contributions, this, of course, has always been the position.  Prior to the taking of this scheme into the social insurance scheme generally this was the employer's liability always.  It was a matter between the injured workman and the employer who, naturally, usually covered himself by insuring with some private insurance company but the full cost was borne by the employer.  When the occupational injuries scheme was brought in a few <Col N="1400" /> years ago this arrangement was continued and the scheme was financed completely bp the employers' contributions. I do not see any reason for departing from that.  I do not see any reason why the taxpayer should come into it and I do not imagine that employers would see any advantage in part of the contributions being paid by the employees.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney pointed out that so far as the insurance benefits were concerned the insured workers were making a substantial contribution. This, of course, is quite normal because this is a contributory scheme made available not on the basis of contributions made.  That has always been the position here also and it is a natural essential in the scheme that it is a contributory scheme.  It is a fact that the total cost is compulsorily acquired by the Government from the community as a whole, part by way of general taxation and part by employers' and employees' contributions. That is a feature of all social insurance schemes and again a thoroughly justifiable one.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other point I need reply to.  As I have already pointed out, this year we are making a substantial redistribution of the increased national income that is expected to be available this year.  The estimated increase in national income is expected to be £103 million and in this Bill we are making arrangements which will result in the transferring of something over £17 million of this in a full financial year to the recipients of social welfare generally.  That is an indication that the Government recognise their duty to ensure that the fruits of increased prosperity are made available to those who are dependent on the different social welfare schemes as well as to the rest of the community.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to subsection 2º of section 2 of Article 25 of the Constitution, Seanad Éireann concur with the Government in a request to the President to sign the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1969 on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after the date on which the Bill shall have been presented to him.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad is aware the provisions of section 3 of the Bill, which will give effect to the increases in rates of unemployment assistance, are due to come into operation on 30th July, 1969, and it is necessary that the Bill should become law before that date.  This will enable payments of unemployment assistance at the new rates to be effective from that date.</P>
      <P>Because of the dissolution of the 18th Dáil and the subsequent general election the Bill could not be brought before the Seanad earlier than today in order to ask the President to comply with the regulations of the Constitution in the normal way.  The Government therefore have decided to ask the Seanad in accordance with Article 25. 2. 2º of the Constitution to agree to the President being requested to sign the Bill and thus bring it into effect on a date earlier than that on which he would normally be obliged to sign it.</P>

On many occasions on which we have discussed such matters, it was pointed out that they would have to go back to the Dáil for ratification.  Is there anything unusual in this case which makes it unnecessary to go back to the Dáil before the Bill is signed by the President?</P>

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1969: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1402" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan) Sean Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill relatively free from technical complexities and it should not cause any great difficulties for the House.  The Bill has three purposes which I propose to discuss individually to facilitate consideration by Senators.</P>
      <P>The first purpose as provided for in section 1 is to make a further increase in the total amount of land bonds which may be created and issued by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of making advances and paying purchase moneys in respect of land taken over by the Land Commission for the purposes of the land settlement programme. Senators will be aware that we have had similar increases on two occasions since the original limit of £10 million was imposed by section 6 (1) of the Land Bond Act, 1934.  That limit of £10 million was increased to £15 million by section 7, Land Act, 1953, and to £25 million by section 2, Land Bond Act, 1964.</P>
      <P>Land bonds required to make advances and to meet the cost of land taken over by the Land Commission are created by the Minister for Finance, usually on an annual basis, as they are required by the Land Commission. The latest order made by the Minister for Finance on 23rd June, 1969, creating a series of £100,000 land bonds has brought the total amount created under various Land Bond Orders to £25 million, that is the total amount currently authorised by statute.  It is, therefore, necessary to provide legislative authority for the creation of a further series.  Having regard to experience over the last few years, it is desirable on this occasion to provide authority for the creation of a further series of bonds amounting to £15 million.  It is reckoned that such an amount should provide sufficient bonds for a period of about seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that land prices continue to rise and maintenance of the land settlement programme, even at its existing level, would necessitate an expanded supply of land bonds.  But <Col N="1403" /> this is only part of the increase required. The Government, as announced in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Expansion, are committed to an intensification and acceleration of the work of land acquisition and division, especially in small farming areas.  I know there will be general sympathy with the work of improving the lot of small farmers by providing them with sufficient additional land to put them on a viable basis and I believe the House would not wish to see this work delayed in any way because of lack of land bonds.  I could remind the House, in fact, that the Land Bond Act, 1964, which increased the previous limit by £10 million, proved non-contentious and got a speedy passage in both Houses.</P>
    <P>Apart from land purchased or acquired for land bonds the Land Commission are buying an increasing area of land each year for cash.  Senators will be aware that the Land Act, 1965, removed the restrictive application of section 27 of the Land Act, 1950, and as a consequence purchases for cash may now be made by the Land Commission for all the purposes of the Land Acts.  For the current year, a record sum of £600,000 has been provided for these purchases, representing an increase of no less than £170,000 over the amount provided last year.  In the case of cash also it will be our desire to provide a constantly increasing supply of money so that the Government's policy of speeding up the work of land reform can be implemented as announced in the Third Programme.</P>
    <P>The second purpose of the Bill, as provided for in section 2, is to simplify the land bond system by changing existing and future land bonds from numbered bonds in three denominations to unnumbered bonds in £1 units.  Under the existing system, land bonds have heretofore been issued in numbered denominations of £100, £10 and £1 and these denominations once registered cannot be subdivided.  This system is now becoming very cumbersome and is giving rise to difficulties such as: (i) On transfer forms the numbers of all bonds or groups of bonds for transfer must be shown, and <Col N="1404" /> this can involve considerable work for stockbrokers, solicitors and banks acting as agents for land bond holders; (ii) It is often impossible for a holder to divide a land bond holding as the holder may wish.  For instance a holding of £1,000 in land bonds made up of 10 £100 bonds cannot be equally divided into three or four equal parts; (iii) It is difficult for trustees to acquire a particular amount of bonds owing to a scarcity of £1 or £10 bonds available.</P>
    <P>By changing the bonds into unnumbered bonds of £1 units these difficulties will be removed.  The proposed change has been welcomed by the committees of the various stock exchages in which dealings in land bonds take place.</P>
    <P>The third purpose of the Bill, as provided for in section 3, is to authorise the transfer of registers of land bonds from Chase &amp; Bank of Ireland (International) Limited to the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since the inception of the land bond system the registers have been kept by the former National City Bank, which since 1926 was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland.  Since the reorganisation of the bank by the acquisition by the Chase Manhattan Bank of New York of 50 per cent of the share capital the character and type of work being performed by the bank makes it inappropriate that the work of registration of land bonds should be performed by it.  This work is accordingly being transferred to the Head Office of the Bank of Ireland, where the registers of most other Government stocks are kept.</P>
    <P>This Bill will authorise the provision of funds in the form of land bonds to enable the Land Commission to press ahead with the land reform programme and will also simplify the clerical procedures for registering and transferring the bonds.  I can commend it to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the purpose of this Bill.  I am glad to see that the Minister is bringing in some improvements in relation to dealings in land bonds having regard to the problems <Col N="1405" /> which arose in connection therewith. I am also glad to see that arrangements are being made to pay for land in cash rather than in land bonds.  I assume that all the transactions will not be in cash, that there will still be a certain amount of bonds involved.</P>
      <P>I am reminded of the hardships suffered by persons from whom land was acquired and who were paid in bonds the value of which has fallen in many cases by 30 points.  It was a very unfair system.  Thousands of acres of land were taken at £5 an acre from their owners in the early stages and, in exchange, all they got were bonds even for that small acquisition price. Similarly, land was taken from people and the Land Commission rented the land year after year after year and placed the rent which they received from that land against the cost of acquiring it instead of leaving the land in the possession of the owner until they were ready to take possession of it and divide it.</P>
      <P>The manner in which land acquisition and division was carried out in the past seemed unfair to many of the people from whom the land was taken. I am glad to note that there is approximately £600,000 in cash being provided this year for the purchase of land.  It is a great pity that cash was not made available in the past to pay for land when it was being taken from its owners for half nothing and when all they got was paper script instead of cash for the land.  I presume that this £600,000 will be sufficient to pay for approximately 20,000 acres of land That would be a fair enough programme if we could have an annual division of land of not less than 20,000 acres.  I realise that the Minister was not in a position to make a statement on this Bill on the activities of the Land Commission.  However, when we consider the cash he has mentioned here, we can assume that the pace of land acquisition and division will be somewhere around 20,000 acres per annum.  It would be reasonable enough if this could be done and particularly if the land were made available to deserving applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in the past, land was given to some people who were not able to maintain it, who were not able <Col N="1406" /> to use it, while on the other hand, farmers' sons who were working on farms all their lives and who knew how to manage land and farms did not qualify for the allocation of a farm because they were not uneconomic holders.  The system seemed to favour uneconomic holders and small farmers. I think it is necessary at this stage to take a new look at all these regulations and to ensure that, when land is being distributed by the Land Commission, it will be given to people who are capable of working it in a proper manner and of making a living for themselves out of it as well as making a valuable contribution to the national income.</P>
    <P>In the past, no strings were attached to the distribution of farms.  No minimum output was requested.  In many cases, those who were given land were permitted at a later stage to have the land vested in them and then to go to an auctioneer and to put the taxpayers' money into their pocket&mdash;to put the price of the land into their own pocket&mdash;and go back to a different way of living.  That has been an unfortunate activity associated with our land division scheme.  I cannot understand why a stop was not put to that activity long ago.</P>
    <P>This new Minister in the Department of Lands certainly knows something about land congestion and associated problems.  His professional experience alone would acquaint him with the problems of congestion, land distribution and all the rest.  I hope that, as Minister for Lands, he will ensure that the land will be given out to deserving applicants and not just to people who qualify on paper.  It is essential that the land will be given to people who will be capable of making a contribution to the State in the form of output from that land in addition to getting a living for themselves and their families out of it. Agriculture must be a viable activity so far as these smallholders are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the trend towards paying cash for land instead of bonds.  There are many sad stories to be told about people who had the land taken from them and were given bonds in exchange.  We are aware of the plight of some people by <Col N="1407" /> the time they were finished with the Revenue Commissioners and the Stock Exchange&mdash;not to talk of the fall in value of bonds.  If they came upon hard times and were forced to sell the bonds instead of holding them until maturity then they were really at a sad loss.  All these factors reveal a very sad story so far as the system of acquiring land for distribution is concerned.  It is a pity that only in recent times the Government have adopted an attitude towards the holders of land which will enable the land to be paid for in cash rather than having it taken from the owners and bonds issued in exchange.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that there has been a substantial contribution to the land bonds from people with money to invest who are seeking a secure investment and the income that comes from them.  Those people who are purchasing land bonds are making a valuable contribution, in their own way, towards the subdivision of land and towards the establishment of more economic holdings in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to Senator Rooney for his contribution and for his general attitude towards this Bill.  The fact that the amount of money for cash purchases has greatly increased in recent years does not disguise the fundamental difficulty which this or any other Government faces, namely, that to obtain the full cost of the financing of the programme of land acquisition, distribution and resettlement would involve a strain on the capital budget which could affect other matters of equal or even greater priority such as housing, education and health.  Nevertheless, it is a source of satisfaction that we have been able to spend progressively more on cash purchase. This is a trend which I assure the House I shall endeavour to maintain. With all that, the cost of land, as the Senator is well aware, has increased so dramatically in recent years that, even though a record figure of £600,000 was spent on cash purchase of land in this year, the amount of land bonds actually issued in the same period was 1¾ millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assured the Dáil last night and <Col N="1408" /> should like to assure the Seanad today that where bonds are concerned I shall make every effort to ensure that the objective of enabling the owner to realise his bonds at or as near as possible to par will be realised.  The situation here is that money which was stable for a very long period of years after the creation of the land bond system over 30 years ago is now in a state of flux and money is becoming very rapidly more expensive to buy. This obviously creates serious problems in regard to the statutory obligation of the Government to issue bonds at a price which will enable the owner to realise them at, or as near as possible to, par after a reasonable period and also consequential problems for the allottees of land who have to pay for it over a period of years in such a way that the interest on the bond will be covered and also the administrative costs attendant on the whole process.</P>
    <P>Specifically, I will streamline the procedure so that within a reasonable period from today, say, a year to 15 months, the maximum delay that will occur in land bond cases will be three months and in that way make a significant, practical contribution to the objective of realising for the vendor the full equivalent of cash for his purchase money.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney asked if I would take a new look at all Land Commission regulations.  I shall certainly be doing that and shall be dealing with it on another occasion here.  It is impossible, in my view, to devise a perfect system. Where the vesting of land is concerned it does seem to me desirable that the land should be vested as quickly as possible so that the new owner will have the necessary incentive to invest in the land in such a way as to draw from it its maximum productivity.  As the House knows, when land is let, grazing or conacre, the person who has the temporary use of it rarely puts fertiliser on it or indeed takes a great deal of interest in it but simply takes what he can out of it for the period of 11 months or whatever it is for which he has its use.  Therefore, it is desirable from the point of view of the Land Commission and of the new owner that the land should be vested and not simply let to him for a period <Col N="1409" /> of years to see how he will get on. There is no guarantee, even if he is given the land on a temporary basis for a few years and looks after it well, that on its vesting he would not change his tune and suddenly lose interest in it.</P>
    <P>As a result of such things, human nature being what it is, no system of land division, even one devised by a combination of an earthly seer like Solomon and heavenly seer like the Angel Gabriel, would be absolutely perfect.  All that one can do is to do one's best to select the proper type of people and the proper young men to increase the productivity of the land of our country and realise that there will be a small fall-out rate, a small number of failures, but that this is an occupational hazard.</P>
    <P>As I said, the practical steps I hope we will take to reduce the waiting period between the date of acquisition by the Land Commission and the date of availability of the bonds is the biggest single contribution that I can make to protect the vendor from depreciation.  Any other steps I find it possible to take in this regard I will be very glad to take.  There is no point in trying to disguise the fact that it is, on the face of it, a hardship on any person who is paid in bonds to have to accept less than the par value of these bonds when he goes to cash them.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the various points that were made and again I thank Senator Rooney for his contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In the case of a person who gets a divided farm, gets it vested, sells it, puts the money in his pocket and goes off about his business, would the Minister consider the system which operates under the Department of Local Government in respect of vested cottage plots?  For instance, if a person sells a portion of his vested plot, the county council recover the price secured for that portion of the <Col N="1410" /> plot.  That is a vested cottage site in the same way as this is a vested piece of land, divided up at the expense of the taxpayers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make a distinction here.  In the case of migrants' holdings, which I think is what the Senator is thinking of, as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, the migrant, once the holding is vested in him, is entitled to sell.  Where an addition of land is given to somebody, say in the west of Ireland or in one of the congested areas, he must pay the consolidated annuity, which over a period of 50 or 60 years, whatever it is, returns to the State the investment that the State made in creating that extra holding for him.  However, so far as the migrant is concerned, having given up his own property for the relief of congestion in a particular area&mdash;sometimes at the request of the Land Commission though more often at his own request &mdash;and having been given an exchange, he is obviously in a different position because it is a <i>quid pro quo</i> and he is entitled to be vested in ownership.  So far as I know, in regard to migration generally the number of drop-outs is extremely small, though I also have in mind the migration of people from the west, the south or elsewhere to what could be potential development land in a very short period in the future. This might possibly raise a question and, indeed, it is something that has been agitating my mind recently.  I can certainly undertake to have a look at that although I know that there are certain regulations which may be a help to prevent a migrant from making what would be an enormous profit on a transfer, not from one agricultural holding to another, but from what turned out to be an agricultural holding to development land for building purposes.</P>

      <P>I ask the House to approve of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1969. This order provides for two minor additions to the Garda pensions code, which are explained in the memorandum which has been circulated to Senators.</P>
      <P>In the first place, it provides that gardaí who had previous service in the Taca Síochána are now enabled to reckon such service in full for Garda pension purposes.  Members of the Taca Síochána were recruited in a temporary capacity in 1939, by Emergency Powers Order when the emergency came into being on the outbreak of war, and they eventually were absorbed into the Garda Síochána proper in 1942.</P>
      <P>Until 1965, previous service in the Taca Síochána was not reckonable for ordinary Garda pension purposes.  By a Garda Síochána pensions order made in that year, it was allowed recognition as to one-half for Garda pension purposes, following on the making of a similar arrangement in the public service. The present provision, which will enable Taca Síochána service to be reckoned in full for pension purposes, brings the force into line with a new arrangement made some time ago in the case of the public service.</P>
      <P>In the second place, the order provides for the reduction from six to five years of the qualifying period of service for the payment of marriage gratuities.  This brings the ban-ghardaí into line with the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>This Bill merely seeks authority to enable the Government to accede to a request from the Senate of the National University of Ireland to extend the term of office of the present membership of the Senate.  This request springs from a recognition of the fact that it has already been decided in priciple to dissolve the National University of Ireland and to have separate autonomous universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway, each with its own governing authority.</P>
      <P>The Senate of the National University of Ireland is made up of 35 members some of whom are elected and others whose membership is <i>ex-officio.</i> The 35 members consist of:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> The chancellor of the university, the presidents of the three colleges, four nominees of the Government (including one woman), six persons elected by the Governing Body of UCD of whom three are members of the academic council of the college, four persons elected by the Governing Body of UCC of whom two are members of the academic council of the college, four persons elected by the Governing Body of UCG of whom two are members of the academic council of the college, eight persons elected by convocation, four persons co-opted, and the registrar.</P>
    <P>The current period of office of the members is due to expire on the 31st October next.  The Senate, realising that elections could cater only for a comparatively short period of office on the part of those elected, requested in January last that the term of office of the present membership be extended. The Government decided to accede to this request and in so doing bore in mind that continuity in membership would be a help in resolving the problems involved in terminating existing structures and formulating new ones.  The Government were also anxious that it should be seen that there was no question of putting the framing of new structures on the long finger. In fact, what is awaited now is recommendations in the matter of details from the Higher Education Authority. The framing of detailed recommendations involves on the part of the authority consultation with all the interested parties.  These consultations are proceeding and I understand that a good deal of the ground has been covered.</P>
    <P>Once again I wish to emphasise that this is a Bill which is simply designed to enable the Government to cater in a realistic fashion for an interim position which is likely to be of comparatively short duration.</P>

      <P>We can all welcome the Bill as presented by the Minister.  It is a simple enabling Bill. Before doing so it would be opportune to welcome the Minister to his new office.  We wish him a successful reign in this Ministry which is the most <Col N="1414" /> important Ministry in the Government, after the Minister of Finance.  On my own behalf, and on behalf of the graduates of the National University whom I am proud to represent, I can offer him our sincere co-operation and help in his great task of continuing to modernise and develop our educational system. We will be happy to co-operate and to help at any time and in any place. The Minister has only to ask and we will not be found wanting.</P>
      <P>To return to the Bill, I cannot understand the confusion created in the other House by former colleagues of ours here.  This is a simple measure. It is an enabling measure.  The Government have the power to make the order.  The initiative must come from the Senate of the National University, but the Government have the power to make the order.  That is their prerogative. In point of fact, the order must be laid before both Houses and it can be annulled according to the usual procedure if that is the wish of the Oireachtas.  Deputy FitzGerald seemed to suggest that this was intended in some way to rescue the Senate of the National University from some illegal position into which they had got.  Nothing could be further from the case.</P>
      <P>I speak with full knowledge in this regard because I am happy to say I have been a member of the Senate of the National University for the past ten years.  We took legal advice and we were advised that a Bill would be needed to extend to the National University the same provisions as are available to the colleges of the university, and asked the Government to extend by order the tenure in office for good and sufficient reasons.  In this case the reasons are very clear.  On 31st October, the Senate will have reached the end of its term of office, five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hope and expect that the following year will see the end of the discussions and the introduction of legislation to set up the future structure of the Irish university system.  At this juncture it would not be a service to Irish education to open up an election campaign between the pro and anti mergers, in other words, to seek to polarise the graduate body at a <Col N="1415" /> time when what is needed is study and reflection on the various documents and works which have been executed and published on university affairs over the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>There is the report of the Commission on Higher Education, a momentous document which stands as a credit to the commission which produced it. Reading it is a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  There are the Government's proposals of 6th July last.  Between the two I am confident that a solution will be found which will satisfy the general body of graduate opinion and which will be the most suitable solution of the problem.  I am confident that the solution will not be in the rigid mould of 6th July.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy to know that the Higher Education Authority, while taking the 6th July proposals as one of the possible solutions, are anxious to see alternative proposals, and I do know that at this very time the National University itself is taking the initiative in coming together with Trinity College and producing what we hope will be a worthwhile and feasible alternative to the 6th July proposals. It is obviously not right for any group to be forced into fixed attitudes when we have not got all the information, and when there is a question of planning and getting together and evolving, through co-operation, the system most suited to our future needs.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable to read some speeches by those who have little contact with the working of the Senate of the National University.  Of course, the less contact one has with a body the more one knows about it and the more one knows how wrong it is.  That was my general reaction to the speeches in the other House.  It indicates that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. All the sins of the Irish university system were visited on the latest scapegoat, that is, the Senate of the National University, without the trouble being taken to study what is the real function of a national university.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the Senate has very limited powers in regard to the colleges.  It is mainly concerned with appointments, on which, by and large down the years, it has done an excellent job and with the <Col N="1416" /> approval of courses of study and the conduct of the examinations for the National University.  Those are all the functions it has.  It has no financial or other powers whatsoever over the colleges. The basic weakness of the whole university system is simply lack of resources and lack of planning.  Our nearest neighbour, Queen's University across the Border, have at least twice the resources that we have.</P>

      <P>No, it has no financial powers but it has been accused of faults which are properly attributable to us here, with our successive Governments, and in a measure probably with the university authorities in not being able to get the necessary finances to modernise the system. Nobody in his sane senses would expect a factory to manufacture a product comparable to products being manufactured by competitor firms in other countries at half the cost of the product in other countries; indeed if we could find such a product we would be in the seventh heaven and would have attained the ultimate in economic expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within those limits our university system has done a great job, and I disagree completely with those who feel that the only task for the university should be to turn out revolutionaries. Surely even revolutionaries in planning their heaven on earth visualise using the full fruits of modern technology and therefore must have efficient professional backing for it.  That is precisely what the National University has provided.  We are proud and happy that it has provided all the professional requirements of our nation.  When its members have gone abroad to work, they have given the same distinguished service there.  When we look at the other end of the spectrum, we see that our honours graduates can compare, by and large, with honours graduates <Col N="1417" /> in leading universities in England, America and elsewhere.  We are sending them out every year to those graduate schools there and they are always among the top group in the graduation classes.  They have gone on to the highest honours, and competition for them is very difficult because these universities are trying to keep them while we are trying to attract them back.</P>
    <P>Let us therefore be proud of the National University as we face the task of shaping a much more endowed and much more costly structure for the future.  That structure can only prosper if it appreciates and is shaped out of its past.  Our university structure is based on our past, on respect for our national and religious traditions, and I hope that any system that evolves in the future will be based on that solid foundation.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people outside the university to appreciate the type of work the staff do, the flexibility of hours and so on.  Very often the staff members are working far into the night.  It is this type of freedom which gives some the right to abuse it but gives the majority the right to do much more than they would under trade union regulations.  It is that type of freedom which gets the maximum effort and has made universities what they are, which gives them the creativeness to inspire the community.  I hope that our universities will continue to do that.</P>
    <P>There is little else to say on this measure except to welcome it.  This is an interim measure, for a year at most, and we do hope that the whole shape for the future will emerge before that year is out.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Quinlan agus an Seanadóir Ó Brosnacháin as ucht comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh liom gur cheapadh mé mar Aire Oideachais agus an dea-mhéin a theasbáin siad.  Mar a dúirt siad, níl annseo ach Bille simplí le cead a thabhairt don Rialtas cead a thabhairt do Sheanad na hOilscoile a shaol a fhadú ar feadh bliana eile.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to Senators Quinlan and Ó Brosnacháin for their congratulations on my appointment as Minister and also for the manner in which they have approached this Bill which, in my estimation and obviously in theirs, is a simple measure.  It is a reasonable and practical request made by the Senate of the National University of Ireland to permit them to extend their life for a period of one year.  Taking into consideration the proposed dissolution of the National University there seems to be little point in holding an election for the Senate with the present structure as it would only produce a somewhat similar pattern to the present Senate.</P>
      <P>I may also say that, as I have already mentioned earlier, if we were to hold an election for the Senate now considering the fact that its life would be relatively brief it might give the impression that we were not really in earnest in our approach to providing improved higher educational facilities. Our aim is, as I said earlier, to provide the best possible framework of higher education that our resources permit. We are a small nation and we must take that very particularly into account and because of this examine this whole very complex matter very carefully and in depth, so far as possible leaving aside our own personal involvements and facing up to the difficulties objectively. We cannot afford either educationally or financially to duplicate the very costly services which are now needed.</P>

      <P>Now that we have finished the business of the day, I should like with your permission, a Chathaoirleach, since I understand that you are not resuming your chairmanship of the Seanad, on behalf of all the Members of the Seanad here who served under your chairmanship in the past for many years in which you added dignity to the position, to express our gratification, first of all, at the fact that we had such an excellent Chairman; secondly, our deep regret that you are not any longer going to act in that capacity; and, thirdly, to wish you agus Bean Uí Bhuachalla happy days and every good wish that we can think of.  We realise that it was an onerous position to occupy the Chair of the Seanad during those years in which you did so ably and efficiently, and I am sure that there is not a Member of this House who would not join me in saying that even handed justice was meted out to us all, and if we did on occasions feel the heavy hand, as I did myself on a few occasions for transgressing the rules, we realised that you were carrying out the Standing Orders of the Seanad of which you were guardian and custodian. We accepted it in the proper way in which decisions of that nature should be accepted.  We are very happy, indeed, that we had your services as Chairman here for so long. As I say, every Member of the House will regret your departure from the House and hope that you will not entirely sever your connection with Leinster House where you personally either as a Member or in your capacity as Chairman so well and truly helped all of those who had the happiness and pleasure of making your acquaintance.</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with what the Leader of the House has said.  Indeed, it is more than 20 years since I first took an interest in public life.  At that time you were, Sir, a speaking Member of this House and contributed greatly, honourably and effectively to the proceedings of the House.  Since I have become a Member I have had occasion at close hand to see you acting as Chairman, acting with kindliness, dignity and humour in the various offices that fell to you as Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  We have I think all felt confidence, as Senator Ó Maoláin has said, in you.  When, indeed, we have brushed against your rulings, in cold blood we have realised that it was you who were in the right.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that those of us on this side of the House have never had any reason to doubt your integrity or impartiality in running the business of this House.  I might, perhaps, Sir, also speak not just for myself but for all those who have acted as Leas-Chathaoirleach under you and to say that you have always made our job an extremely easy one.  You have by your advice and by your kindliness made the task of assisting you in the House an extremely easy one indeed.  We all join in wishing you a splendid retirement.</P>

We are happy for the experience of serving under you in this <Col N="1421" /> assembly and of endeavouring to contribute what we could to the work of the Oireachtas.  Indeed, your inspiration and help were invaluable to all of us, especially those of us of the University Panel, who have always been proud and happy to point you out and say that you were one of ourselves, that Professor Ó Buachalla was in the Chair, and we have always felt that your performance has added lustre to the university at all times.</P>
