      <P>Since our last meeting, Senators will have learned with deep regret of the death of our colleague, Senator John B. O'Quigley. Although he had been ill for some time past, his passing came as a shock to most of us.  I bhFlathas Dé go raibh a anam.</P>
      <P>The late Senator, following a brilliant scholastic career, entered the Civil Service in 1945.  Always interested in staff welfare and conditions he was prominent in Civil Service association activities.  In 1950 he was called to the Bar and, following his resignation from the Civil Service, built up an extensive practice in Dublin and in the western circuit.</P>
      <P>The late Senator was first elected in 1957 on the Nominating Bodies Sub-Panel of the Labour Panel.  Following his re-election in 1965 on the Oireachtas Sub-Panel of the Cultural and Educational Panel he was appointed leader of the Fine Gael group in the House. An indefatigable worker and cogent speaker he made many valuable contributions to our deliberations.  In particular his clarity of mind and his training as a barrister made his contributions on legislation stimulating and authoritative.  His passing will be keenly felt by the Members of the House.</P>
      <P>To the widow and children of the late Senator, I shall convey, on your behalf and on my own, our sympathy and appreciation.  Solas Dé lena anam.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, at our last meeting the Leader of the House indicated that he hoped <Col N="1197" /> to clear the Order Paper before the dissolution of the Seanad.  Is he now abandoning that intention in only ordering Nos. 1, 2 and 3?  We have been anxious for some time that some of these motions should be taken.  In particular we consider that the motion in regard to Biafra is a matter of urgency.  Many people indicated rather cynically that this was a problem which would be solved by the passage of time. We in the Seanad now wish it could be solved by the passage of time involving the change of Ministers.</P>

    <Title>Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Bill, 1969    (Certified Money Bill):    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the fifth occasion on which a Collection of Taxes (Confirmation) Bill has been brought before the Oireachtas.  In 1938, 1944, 1951 and 1954, Dáil Éireann dissolved, as it did this year, soon after Budget day and before the Finance Bill giving permanent statutory effect to the Budget proposals could have been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Budget day, 7th May last, 12 financial resolutions were passed unanimously by the Dáil in Committee on Finance.  Eight of these resolutions, namely those relating to income tax and sur-tax, hydrocarbon oils, tobacco, beer, spirits, wine and the sales taxes <Col N="1198" /> were given temporary statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, pending the passing of the Finance Bill, but they automatically lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil.  The remaining four&mdash;relating mainly to stamp duties &mdash; were not due to come into force until 1st August.</P>
    <P>The effect of the measure now proposed is to restore the statutory effect of the eight resolutions mentioned pending the enactment of this year's Finance Bill and to deem them to have had continuous statutory effect since Budget day.</P>
    <P>The Bill passed all Stages in the Dáil yesterday and I should be glad if the Seanad would take all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be assured there will not be either determined opposition or too long a debate in regard to this measure Indeed, I think the Seanad in approaching this measure must consider what is concerned here is essentially unfinished Dáil Business and that but for the dissolution of the Dáil the matter of the Financial Resolutions would never properly be a matter for debate here in the Seanad.  In the normal course of events the Seanad would have been obliged to wait for the Finance Bill in order to discuss the general position in regard to taxation.  Accordingly, there seems little point in a prolonged debate on this measure on matters which might well arise again on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed the Seanad would, I think take the view it would do everything it possibly could to expedite the financial business of the Oireachtas considering that financial business is in as bad a mess as it could be without further adding to it.  In matters of this sort the Seanad definitely feels a sense of grievance.  We had from the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, on his moving here a Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Bill, an assurance that from now on financial business would move smoothly, that the various measures would come forward at an appropriate time, that delays in dealing with Estimates in the Dáil would all be done away with. Indeed, we have seen very little improvement <Col N="1199" /> in this respect.  The Seanad has under this new dispensation still found itself being asked to deal with Financial measures at the end of a term, asked to deal with very important financial measures at a time when the Dáil already adjourned.  Accordingly, I find the Seanad feels somewhat aggrieved at this particular position and certainly would not wish to impede in any way this enabling legislation in case this might add further to the chaos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has forgotten that on 28th June there was a General Election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of the full purpose of this Bill. I understood from what the Minister for Finance said yesterday in the Dáil that he contended that strictly speaking this Bill was not really necessary and that he really had the authority to collect these taxes since the dissolution of the Dáil despite the fact that the 1927 Act provision ceases with that dissolution.  He coupled this contention with the view that this Bill, as he has told us today, is very urgently needed, and we are presented with a Bill that is not necessary but very urgent.</P>
      <P>I feel there is a certain contradiction in this and I cannot help wondering what would be the position if some purchaser of petrol, spirits or tobacco since the dissolution of the Dáil were to take an action either against the retailer for increasing the price arising out of fresh taxation or against the Minister for Finance for collecting taxes which legally he was not entitled to collect.  I understand that this Bill is to put the Minister right, as it were, to give him power retrospectively to do things he has been doing illegally in the name of all of us since the date of the dissolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister, if he would, to clear up the point as to whether he had or had not the legal right to collect those taxes since the dissolution.  I contend he had not and therefore this Bill is not only urgent but necessary.  I understood the Minister to tell the Dáil that the Bill, in his <Col N="1200" /> view, was not really necessary but then he went on to say it was very urgent. I am not quite sure why an unnecessary Bill, giving him power he claims he has already, should be so very urgent.  He quoted several precedents and Senator Dooge has accepted those at their face value and said no doubt matters of this kind will arise again.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister to tell the Dáil he will take steps to see to it in future this situation will not arise, which leads me to think he could have taken steps before the dissolution to see to it that this situation would not arise. With these matters in mind, I suggest to the Seanad that this Bill is unnecessary and does not have to be passed.  I think it would make quite an interesting constitutional point if the Seanad were to reject this because the Minister, I understand, claims he has the necessary powers without the passing of this Bill.  Therefore we are entitled to ask him: &ldquo;Why do you want it?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's exhortation, we in the Labour Party will not oppose this Bill.  This is, as I understand it, an unusual measure and except for the dissolution of the Dáil we would be dealing with the Finance Bill and we would have an opportunity on it of debating taxation policy in general and certain other side issues.  I understand we will have the Finance Bill later on before the Seanad when we will have the usual debate on that Bill and this is simply a temporary measure to confirm the taxation imposed in the Dáil in the Financial Resolutions.  We in the Labour Party did not oppose the Budget because of the way the extra money in the Budget was being distributed to the deserving people and therefore we are not opposing this Bill here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure before us is merely ensuring the taxes as brought in in the Financial Resolutions are fully confirmed.  We all desire the ends to which this money has been applied.  We welcome increased social welfare benefits and increased education facilities.  Consequently we have to be realistic and co-operate in the raising <Col N="1201" /> of this money.  While there may be differences between us on the way taxes should be levied, by and large we have got to realise that taxes must be paid because that is the only way we can ensure our future development.</P>
      <P>Like many other Senators, I feel quite frustrated at the handling of financial business by the Government. With regard to the changes that were made some four years ago in the procedures of the Seanad, I appeal to the Minister that if he cannot do better it would be preferable to revert to the older practice by which we got the Central Fund Bill at the end of March and we then had a very constructive and timely debate on Government policy as revealed from the Estimates then published.</P>
      <P>In other words, we were discussing Government financial policy within a few weeks of its being unveiled in the Estimates.  Now, several months have passed before we have had a chance of discussing it.  The opportunity which we used to have of discussing the Budget and its implications, both administrative and so on, has again been taken from us and it now comes at a very unrealistic time, just before Christmas, when one wonders which Budget exactly one is supposed to be discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should welcome that opportunity here and above all we should try to use the Seanad to its fullest advantage.  Therefore, the Minister might consider reverting to the earlier procedure which brought everything in within a reasonable amount of time of the Government's decision being announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> One final word on the Finance Bill which we hope to have within a couple of weeks.  It will contain many details in respect of taxation, and I should like to make a plea to the Minister to try to continue what we have been pressing for in the Seanad, relief for widows and orphans.</P>

      <P>This Bill affords the House an opportunity, which I intend to avail of as the last opportunity afforded to me as a Member of the Seanad, and consequently I am not open to the jibes of the Leader of the House that I have any electoral motive in making the remarks I intend to make.  I hope, therefore, that they will be accepted as sincere and constructive.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with the Budgetary situation which was accepted by the House in the spirit in which it was presented to the House for the Government at that time by the man who was Minister for Finance at that time and who has been reappointed to that office.  It was indicated that the taxes necessary were designed to be allocated for particular purposes which were quite laudable, but some years ago when Mr. Lemass was at the head of that Party he indicated that he had exhausted the original sources of revenue relevant to taxation and at that time he introduced the turnover tax.</P>

      <P>I have a very tight schedule to adhere to, and I had hoped that the Seanad might agree to do what the Dáil did, in other words to leave over the substance of the Budget to the Second Stage of the Finance Bill and to treat this as merely a technical measure rendered necessary by the dissolution.</P>

      <P>Very well, I will confine my remarks, but I am compelled <Col N="1203" /> by the exigencies of the moment to refer to a specific matter which I should like the Minister to clarify.  On two successive days this week local authorities were confronted with an extremely serious financial situation.  The Minister for Local Government informed us, relative to housing and sanitary allocations for the year, that we would be required to have recourse to borrowing outside the Local Loans Fund and that we were to apply ourselves to sources of revenue other than from the Local Loans Fund.</P>
      <P>Then we had a directive from the Central Bank that two-thirds of the credit available within the country is to be absorbed by State borrowing; and the question which our county manager could not answer, but which I hope the Minister will answer today, is whether the loans of local authorities for housing and sanitation are to be included in the category of the two-thirds or will they have to compete in the commercial banks with the private sector of the economy about which the Minister and his Leader of his Party have made such a song and dance in regard to their respect and admiration of the private sector of the economy.  Are the local authorities obliged now to compete with the private investor in recourse to the local banks?</P>
      <P>On the day succeeding this impasse, I attended another meeting&mdash;I must refrain from identifying that meeting because of negotiations which are still in progress&mdash;in an effort to secure sufficient money to carry on this particular education service.  But the directors of the bank, which had traditionally come to the rescue when the Department had failed, met twice and rejected the application for a loan of £25,000.  All insurance companies which have been approached have refused to accommodate this local authority, and negotiations are in progress at the moment in the vague hope that building societies may come to the rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say that our deliberations were interrupted to make a phone call to the Assistant Secretary of the Department to confirm over the phone whether the Department also were to be written off as an underwriting source <Col N="1204" /> for the loan.  The present negotiations are a last ditch effort to retrieve the situation.  I cannot be more specific about them, but I should like the Minister to inform us whether this direction from his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, to local authorities to have recourse to the private banks will come within the restrictions imposed by the Central Bank in reserving two-thirds of the credit available for Government borrowing or whether local authorities will have to compete in the private sector about which we have heard so much recently.</P>
    <P>The Dáil was dissolved within hours of the Minister's reply on the General Financial Resolution affecting the measure now before this House and this had the effect of denying the Minister for Finance a real opportunity of confirming the undertaking given on television by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Lenihan, that there would be no autumn Budget.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity now for the Minister for Finance to confirm that statement and to confirm that this undertaking will be maintained and that what is presented to us in the Budget for this year is calculated to balance the necessary finances.  The Minister should also confirm that in presenting the Budget he anticipated any expenditure that had not come to light but which is, perhaps, in the offing and that consequently the undertaking that was given on television by the then Minister for Education will be honoured in a firm statement by the Minister for Finance to the effect that the taxpayers of this country have had their impositions for this financial year and that there will not be another Budget in the autumn.</P>

      <P>What I said about this Bill in the Dáil, in fact, was that it was arguable whether this Bill was necessary.  I was asked a question by a Deputy as to what would happen if a taxpayer took an action in the courts and my reply was that the case would be argued in the courts and that it was arguable that this Bill was not, in fact, necessary.  I said that I was bringing it in in order to remove any doubt and I think that that is a perfectly sensible and logical thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> For that reason it is urgent because, if there are any doubts in the situation that require to be removed, they should be removed as quickly as possible. There is no necessity for the Senator to argue himself into an intellectually impossible position.  I also indicated in the Dáil that I propose in the forthcoming Finance Bill to deal with the type of situation that occurred in 1938, 1944, 1951, 1954 and again in 1969 and to provide for a more sensible method of dealing with the situation which arises on the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I must decline the last speaker's invitation to enter into a general type of discussion to deal with the matters which he has raised.  The Senator will have an opportunity of going into all these matters on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill which will be coming before the House shortly.  In the meantime, I hope that the Seanad will facilitate me in a fairly difficult situation by passing this purely technical measure now and postponing a general debate and discussion until we have the Finance Bill before us.</P>

This type of tobacco is consumed practically exclusively by the older people in our society and by road workers and such people.

If we are to have a general agreement to have a full-scale budgetary type of discussion on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill the corollary to that is to pass this Bill formally and treat it purely as a technical measure.  If the Senator wishes to make political debating points on this particular measure he cannot have it both ways.  At any rate, I was asked this particular question in relation to hard-pressed tobacco.  What we have done in relation to this type of tobacco is to maintain the differential in its favour.  The reason why I have not increased the differential on this occasion is because the overwhelming proportion of pipe tobacco is in the form of hard-pressed tobacco.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which I wish to refer crops up in a number of sections and, from one point of view, it does not crop up in this section.  However, I trust you will give me your permission to deal with it now, Sir, because the word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; is involved.  Indeed it occurs 19 times throughout the Bill.  On four occasions it is not qualified by either the definite or the indefinite article, on four occasions it is qualified by the definite article and on 11 occasions by the indefinite article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first line of section 3 there is reference to &ldquo;a permission&rdquo;.  This struck me as being a use of the word which I had not noticed before &mdash; using the word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; in this way, qualified by the &ldquo;a&rdquo; as if it were a permanent thing.  I had the curiosity to look up dictionaries.  The <i>Greater Oxford Dictionary</i> makes a habit of quoting examples of use of words, going away back to medieval times. Oddly enough, under the word &ldquo;permission&rdquo;. none of the examples they <Col N="1208" /> quote includes this type of use; that is, &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; does not occur in any of the examples.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that never in English literature or in Acts of Parliament does this not occur but, oddly enough, the <i>Greater Oxford Dictionary</i> does not refer to any of these, if it does occur.  My first thought was that if it would have been preferable in other sections where &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; is used to use &ldquo;a permit&rdquo; because permission is the act of permitting whereas a permit is a written order giving permission. I realise that, because in section 4 (5), permission may, so to speak, be granted by default.  In other words, if an applicant seeks permission and hears nothing during a period of five weeks he may then assume the permission to have been granted.</P>
    <P>If the word &ldquo;permit&rdquo; were used where &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; is used I can see there would have been a difficulty because somebody who did not get a written permit could under the Act claim to have a permission, but he would have nothing to show for it. While I am quibbling about the unusual use of &ldquo;a permission&rdquo;, I am inclined to agree its use is a very sensible thing because it avoids difficulty over the use of &ldquo;permit&rdquo; which is a written instrument whereas &ldquo;permission&rdquo; is something which may be got by default. I am wondering how much was intentional and how much purely accidental in this usage.  I would have thought it would have been a good idea where &ldquo;permission&rdquo; appears without the article to have used &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; at all times.  In section 2 it looks all right&mdash;it does not affect anything else&mdash;but in section 3 the use is &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; whereas section 4 (1) states:</P>
    <P>(1) Where an application is made to a housing authority in accordance with section 3 for permission for the demolition in whole or in part of any habitable house or the use of any such house otherwise than for human habitation, the authority may grant, subject to or without conditions, or refuse the permission.</P>
    <P>It is not &ldquo;for a permission&rdquo; as in section 3.  Even if it is a departure from normal practice, it would have been <Col N="1209" /> clearer if &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; were used throughout.  This would not rule out &ldquo;the permission&rdquo; because it is quite clear there is nothing unusual in such use, but because &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; is used extensively it would have been better if it were used in section 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <P>Subsection (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>the demolition, either in whole or in part, other than a demolition for the purpose of providing an extension or other improvement or for the purpose of carrying out works of maintenance,</P>
      <P>This paragraph means that permission will not be required if the demolition is for the purpose of providing an extension. I can imagine a situation in which a house is bought beside another house and about which one can say: &ldquo;I bought these two houses.  I want to demolish one of them for the purpose of providing an extension to the other one&rdquo;.  As I read this paragraph, that lets the owner out.  The permission is not required if the demolition is for the purpose of providing an extension. It could seem to be an easy way of getting through the Act simply to buy two or three houses and to say: &ldquo;I am pulling down one or two of these houses for the purpose of building an extension, or for some other improvement and in that case I do not need permission.&rdquo;  I find that unsatisfactory. I should like the Minister's opinion about this point.  Permission is not required under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) which reads:</P>
      <P>the use otherwise than for human habitation, of any habitable house.</P>
      <P>One does not need permission to demolish when he is using a habitable house for some use other than human habitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite right.  I misread that. In that case I have no objection to <Col N="1210" /> this and my criticism on that point falls.  It is related to the definition of habitable house because the definition which we have in section 1 is rather vague.  Section 1 reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Habitable house&rdquo; means a house situate in the functional area of a housing authority other than a house in relation to which a housing authority have made a closing order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>which means a house which, in the opinion of the housing authority, is reasonably fit for human habitation or capable of being rendered so fit at a reasonable expense.  Such a definition could be defended but perhaps it could be improved.  It seems rather vague.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (3) contains the penalties:</P>
      <P>Any person who contravenes subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>
      <P>The sum of £100 in relation to the sums of money involved in demolition and so-called development in the City of Dublin does not seem very much. A continuing clause states:</P>
      <P>(together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding ten pounds for every day on which the offence is continued) or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite sure what a continuing offence is in relation to demolition. Does this mean that every day during which the developer keeps hacking away at the building which he is demolishing? Some buildings are knocked down pretty quickly these days.  Does the offence continue when the building is knocked down?  Does this mean that the developer can be fined £10 each day he is pounding away at the building, but once it is knocked flat he can no longer be fined?  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this point of the continuing offence in relation to demolition.  Often, buildings are knocked flat in a matter of days.  If a man is to be fined £10 per day so <Col N="1211" /> long as the offence is continued, the fine does not seem sufficient.  The penalties, apart from the possibility of six months imprisonment, are not commensurate with the offence, which could mean the demolition of some of our finest buildings not only in Dublin but also in other parts of Ireland.  The penalty mentioned here would not frighten the big developer.  He would pay it and go ahead with the demolition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question which Senator Sheldon raised of &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; it seems that this terminology has been used in other measures.  It is widely used in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act.  The word &ldquo;permission&rdquo; is used in this sense and both definite and indefinite articles are prefixed to it.  There is some difference between sections 2 and 3.  Section 2 refers to permission which &ldquo;shall be required&rdquo; in respect of demolition, whereas section 3 refers to &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; under this Act.  To say that &ldquo;a permission&rdquo; will be required does not seem to be necessary.  There would not be any objection to doing that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <P>Possibly it might be neater there but I do not imagaine it is of any great significance.  It is not of legal significance that &ldquo;a&rdquo; is not there.  It might just as well be there.  The Bill is not in any way adversely affected by the fact that it is not there.  It hardly seems necessary to go through the procedure of amending the Bill in order to put it in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way it has been drafted and I do not think it <Col N="1212" /> weakens the Bill.  The word &ldquo;permit&rdquo; seems to me to have acquired a somewhat different connotation, more or less a licence to do something.  A building permit as it has come to be understood refers to a licence to do something which would normally be unrestricted but is restricted because of some shortage of supply or something like that.  It is possibly for that reason that this usage of the word permission has grown up but it certainly has been used in this way in other Acts.  It seems to me to be well established in regard to usage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question under section 2, subsections (1) (a) that permission is not required for demolition for the purpose of extension.  First of all, I would like to point out that this extension of a habitable house would have to be for the purpose of human habitation.  If the site continues to be used as it is with no change of user there does not seem to be any objection but planning permission would still be required for the erection of the extension itself.  It can only be for the extension of a house as human habitation. The fine of up to £100 is fairly small I agree but this is the maximum fine which can be imposed on summary conviction.  There is also the further fact that planning permission for development cannot be given unless permission under this Act is obtained first so that would appear to me a very substantial reason inhibiting anybody from demolishing a house in contravention of this Bill we are dealing with here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuing offence, as I understand it, refers to the change of user. As long as the premises or site is used for a purpose other than human habitation the offence under this Bill continues. That certainly is my understanding of it and therefore such a person would be liable to this continuing fine for every day on which there is a change of user of the site and building which was illegally demolished.  In any case, as I say, £100 is the maximum fine which can be imposed on summary conviction and the main function under this is the fact that planning permission cannot be given for development of the site unless permission <Col N="1213" /> under this Bill has been obtained in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, first of all, he tells the House under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) permission does not have to be provided if the developer or a demolisher is providing an extension and so on.  He tells us such an extension would have to be only for human habitation.  I do not see that in the section before us.  The section does not deal only with human habitation. It deals with various types of demolition so I do not think the Minister can be correct in this.  It does not apply only to extension for human habitation.  Certainly I do not see anything in this section which suggests that.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the Minister says that this fine in subsection (3) which applies to people who contravene subsection (2), although small, is one which is the highest amount which can be prescribed on summary conviction and he says that this applies only on change of user, change of usage of the house.  I do not think this is so because subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>A person shall not carry out any demolition or cause or permit any change of use of a house in respect of which permission is required under subsection (1).</P>
      <P>So, this implies not only a change of use but also the method of demolition so I do not think the Minister can be correctly informed when he says this applies only to change of use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington on this.  As far as I know the limit of £100 maximum for summary conviction has prevailed for at least 25 or 30 years, in fact since the State was founded.  In fact it is a continuing anomaly which should be adjusted to keep the money values and the penalties in accordance with the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Housing Bill is an enabling measure.  The fact that this limit still operates means that steps should be taken in future legislation to adjust this and make it more flexible.  In the case of penalties here I feel the penalty should bear a relation to the property which is being demolished. After all, if it was only a shanty £100 might be a lot but if it was ultimately paving the way for some type of office block or something else £100 would be just a mere stamp on the transaction.  I feel it would be better in such cases that the penalty should have some relationship to a percentage of the value.</P>

      <P>Of course, also at the discretion of the court a term of imprisonment, not exceeding six months, can be imposed, or both a penalty and a term of imprisonment. So far as the question of demolition being only for the extension for use of human habitation, the section states:</P>

      <P>(a)  the demolition, either in whole or in part, other than a demolition for the purpose of providing an extension or other improvement or for the purpose of carrying out works of maintenance, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the use otherwise than for human habitation of any habitable house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> It seems to me obvious that this would not cover the demolition of a habitable house for the purpose of erecting an extension on anything else or, indeed, for the purpose of erecting the extension of another habitable house and that it must be both the demolition and the extension obviously refer to the same habitable house.</P>

      <P>I think what the Minister says here is quite correct, but I am afraid there is a possibility of ambiguous reading here.  I read the words &ldquo;of any habitable house&rdquo; as applying only to paragraph (b) but I can see now that they are capable of being read as applying to the whole subsection.  In the present layout this could be taken as meaning the end of the sentence in paragraph (b).</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with habitable houses and this is the purpose of the Bill.  It is not dealing with someone knocking down one office block and putting up another one.  It is to control the use of houses that are habitable to ensure that they are not turned to some other use. Senator Sheehy Skeffington talked about an extension which might take in another house, but section 2 is subject to section 9 which clarifies the point that you may not disturb someone else.  There does not appear to be any reason why, if there is an empty house, one may not use it as an extension of one's own house.  The point is that you may not disturb some person and leave him without a house in the process.  This is to preserve as far as possible houses which may continue to be used, and to make sure that they are continued to be used for human habitation.  I do not think the Bill is intended to go any wider than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section involves the amending of permission for the demolition or for the use, other than for habitation, of a habitable house.  Application is made to the housing authority in the area and permission is granted by them.  In other words, there is upward of 30 housing authorities involved.  Naturally, there must be the right of appeal from this and I can sympathise with both the Minister's and the Government's concern to have a certain amount of uniformity in the handling of this; but I think that the provision for appeal that is made here in subsection (6) (b) is totally inadequate because no machinery is set up for the consideration of appeals other than the Minister making a decision as if the application had been made to him in the first instance.</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be any onus on the Minister to hear why the local housing authorities refused to give the permission.  In this case, not alone must justice be done but justice must be seen to be done and when you are dealing with 30 bodies surely there should be some judiciary type of review body set up for the reviewing of these appeals instead of treating the appeals, as the Bill says, as if an application were made to the Minister in the first instance&mdash;as if the housing authority had never come into the picture.</P>
      <P>I feel the housing authority should be present at the appeals to present their side of it, and the Minister likewise or whichever review body you have to hear the appeal and judge on it and subsequently publish all these very serious cases where the Minister has gone over the heads of the local bodies because it undermines confidence in the justice and impartiality of the local bodies.  I feel that the local bodies, being closer to local pressures, would in most instances err on the side of leniency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is need for a review on a national basis the right of the Minister or of the Review Board to query a local decision that had been given positively can be questioned.  As it is <Col N="1218" /> put down here, the section solves noth-in and will leave the whole situation open to the same charges that all planning is open to at the moment&mdash; the charge that political influence can be used to over ride the decision of local authorities.  That is very bad and it is a situation that we wish to get away from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">

      <P>Subsection (2) of this section reads:</P>
      <P>... the housing authority shall have regard to the state of repair of the house to which the application relates and to the adequacy of the supply of housing available in their functional area.</P>
      <P>Under the Definition of &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; in section 1, we read that the</P>
      <P>&ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; means, in the case of a town having commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, the council of the county in which the town is situate.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we find that a town having commissioners would not act separately but that their area goes in with the general county.  I am thinking of the size of my own county, for instance. If, say, I wish to demolish a house in Malin while the housing situation in Ballyshannon were very bad and if the Minister should have power to make regulations dealing with what area might be taken into this entire county, it would seem to be going a bit far.  I suppose this would work all right in cities and larger towns but I cannot see it operating in a rural area and I do not think that it would work fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is rather long and complex but it does say in the first subsection that:</P>
      <P>Where an application is made to a housing authority in accordance with section 3 for permission for the demolition in whole or in part of any habitable house or the use of any such house otherwise than for human habitation, the authority may grant, subject to or without conditions, or refuse the permission.</P>
      <P>Arising out of that we have subsection (6) (a) which reads that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person to whom a permission <Col N="1219" /> under subsection (1) has either been refused or granted subject to conditions may, at any time before the expiration of the period of three weeks beginning on the day on which he is notified of the decision, appeal to the Minister against the decision.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinlan that this is unsatisfactory.  If a housing authority has decided either to impose conditions or to refuse permission for demolition the Minister should not have the right to override the representatives of the people living in the area.  I am a great believer in giving as much autonomy as possible to local authority representatives.  Local representatives and local people are best situated in relation to a demolition decision.  If their local representatives decide to refuse permission for demolition or to impose certain conditions, we should not give the Minister the right to override that decision.  I am not saying that any particular Minister is likely to abuse such power but I do not consider that it would be fair or equitable to grant one man, in this case the Minister, the right to reverse a carefully considered decision by the representatives of the people in the area.  It is one of the points upon which accusations of abuse of power are sometimes levelled against Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying he might let me know whether it will be the county manager who will act as the local authority?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from this section that the Minister is bound to have regard to the same considerations as the housing authority is. With regard to Senator Sheldon's point about the demolition of a house at one end of Donegal, in Malin, for instance, it would hardly be likely to be relevant to a shortage of houses in Ballyshannon. The local authority can be depended upon to take the view that the existence of an empty house in Malin would hardly contribute to the relief of a housing shortage in Ballyshannon. We must assume that they will, in fact, consider the question of the supply of houses in their area in an intelligent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> I expected this reaction with regard to the fact that the appeal is laid down to be the Minister but it is not anticipated that there will be a lot of these appeals and it seems reasonable to have a short and expeditious appeal procedure.  An appeal to the courts or to a legal tribune would be out of proportion to what is required.  With regard to the other point made by Senator Sheldon as to whether the housing authority would be the county manager, the answer is yes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied but I am not that since in paragraph (b) of subsection (6) it says that:</P>
      <P>Where an appeal is taken under this subsection from a decision of a housing authority and is not withdrawn, the Minister shall determine the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance...</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that in this case the Minister of the day is bound to have regard to the same considerations as the local authority.  I am not quite sure of what the Minister means by that.  The mere fact that one man, namely, the Minister, is to be given all this power to reverse a decision of the housing authority is in itself bad no matter now virtuous and well advised and well intentioned that man may be. This is the principle of dictatorship. There is the concept of the benevolent dictator with the good of the community and of the country in his mind, and this might be the case with the Minister concerned, but I am not satisfied that we should give this power to the Minister simply to override the decision of a local authority to refuse demolition permission for what seemed to them a perfectly good reason even if the Minister reviews this request and then decides off his own bat to reverse it.  I think this is giving too much power to one man and that it would be much better to have some kind of tribunal, judicial or not, not just one person.</P>

It seems to me to be desirable to do so, but I do not anticipate that the same need will <Col N="1221" /> exist in respect of this Act.  If it does then it would be as well to have some experience of how the Planning Appeals Tribunal works before we decide if a similar procedure is necessary in regard to appeals under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply I would like to know this: there is no obligation on the Minister to ascertain why a local housing authority refused permission: would the Minister feel that in any investigation he would have to get their reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, the Bill shows a very grandiose concept in referring to the county manager as the local housing authority.  The term &ldquo;local housing authority&rdquo; seems to imply some type of a collective body, not a one-man concept.  I took it on reading this that there was something more than just one man involved. Surely we should either call him the county manager here or if the phrase is to be &ldquo;a local housing authority&rdquo; in general it should be more than one man, which becomes a reversal then even in the present case and more difficult still and more dangerous, because it seems the Minister could actually reverse the decision of the county manager and therefore it could again be something undermining his authority, which is something that should not be done without some type of judicial body.  I welcome the Minister's assurance, and I have already read about this new appeal body which he hopes to set up.  I would urge him at the earliest possible opportunity to see that these and other appeals are brought within the scope of that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the term &ldquo;housing authority&rdquo; is properly used here.  There is a procedure whereby the elected council can override a decision of the manager if they feel that the facts would warrant it. Therefore they can in fact come into it, but this type of decision is obviously not the type of decision a council is fitted to be carrying out in <Col N="1222" /> normal cases, but in particular cases where the elected members feel that the manager's decision is not the right one there is a procedure whereby it can be overuled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be.  This is often very necessary in planning cases. In some particular council areas the elected councillors seem to have fairly scant regard for the development plans and so on, and there are a number of planning appeals from certain areas which come before me as a result of appeals taken by bodies such as Bord Fáilte, An Taisce and so on against decisions which were made by the exercise of this authority by the elected members of the council.</P>

      <P>This is a rather long section, and there are one or two points I would like to make.  Subsection (4) would have been easier to read if in the last few lines there had been an extra couple of commas.  This is one long sentence and it does get complicated towards the end.  In the fourth last line I would suggest a comma after &ldquo;and&rdquo; and again in the second last line after &ldquo;condition&rdquo;.  That is a clause which really stands by itself. It makes it very difficult reading which you have to read it all through in this way.  However that is by the way. <Col N="1223" /> Under subsection (5) there is a question of the five weeks when things come into operation.  I notice that the five weeks may be extended by the housing authority asking for further particulars, and it seems to me that the delay could be much longer than would appear at first sight, by the housing authority continuing to ask for further particulars.  There is no indication how long they may go on asking for further particulars or if they can go on asking.  I take it from the wording that the decision is as to whether or not the notices have been complied with rests entirely with the housing authority.  There does not appear to be any question here of any way of appealing against the decision in the appropriate period.</P>

The first line of the section says &ldquo;where a housing authority are of opinion...&rdquo; and I would infinitely prefer &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;, and &ldquo;its decision&rdquo;, not &ldquo;their decision&rdquo;.

Subsection (2) states that a reinstatement notice shall become operative on the expiration of the period ending 21 days after the date of the service of the notice.  The time which is allowed to run from a date on which the reinstatement notice has not become operative is extremely confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why this provision is inserted about the reinstatement notice becoming operative.  It appears to become operative the moment the notice is given.  To add to the confusion there is a reference at subsection (1) to the <Col N="1225" /> period within which an appeal may be made under section 72 of the Act of 1966.  This is an appeal made by virtue of section 8 as referred to in subsection (2).  I am wondering why this long phrase about section 72 of the Act of 1966 is brought in whereas in subsection (2) there is no more than a reference to the appeal made by virtue of section 8.  That refers to the Act of 1966 and the amendments.  It seems to make confusion more confounded.</P>

      <P>The position as to whether the house is being deliberately made unfit for human habitation would depend on a report from the engineer in charge, and in a secondary way on a report from the medical officer of health.  Therefore it highlights the fact that this euphemous character called the housing authority meaning the county manager making this decision on his own.  It pinpoints a single person too much.  It is a matter in which the county manager, the county engineer and the county medical officer should all have a say.  If an authoriy was to be called a housing authority it should consist at least of the county manager, the county engineer and the county medical officer of health.  Their decision should then be final and should not be capable of being upset by action of the county council.  It should, of course, be subject to appeal to a properly constituted appeals commission.  I am appealing for the restoration to their proper place of the county engineer and the county medical officer of health in the determination of county affairs.  If an authority is mentioned these people should be in it as full members.  Otherwise what is meant should be put down, which is that the county manager acting on his own omniscience either with or without reports as he sees fit.</P>

      <P>This seems to be a very undemocratic section.  It says that the housing authority may compel the owner of a private dwelling to spend his money on that dwellinghouse in order to make it fit for human habitation. The section goes on to say that if he does not do so the housing authority will do it and charge the cost to him.  This clause does not respect the right to private ownership at all.  It says that the council may compel a man to make his private house habitable.  In other words he is not allowed to own a house which may deteriorate because he cannot afford to make it habitable or to maintain it.  I would like to ask the Minister whether at line 28 the word &ldquo;on&rdquo; should read &ldquo;or&rdquo;?  Is it not &ldquo;or any other person having an interest&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>On Senator Sheldon's point, the reference to 28 days in the service of notice is a provision to ensure that a notice served cannot require the work to be done in a period of less than 28 days from the date on which it was issued.  The section provides that a person may appeal within 21 days. If he does appeal, the notice lapses until the appeal is determined.  If he does not appeal within 21 days the notice becomes operative and he must execute the works.  The provision is that there cannot be a requirement to execute the works within a lesser period than 28 days.</P>

      <Col N="1227" /> Senator Quinlan dealt with this question of including engineers and the medical officer of health.  In fact an assistant engineer or a building inspector could have dealt with the matter. I would have to incorporate all these in the Bill.  So far as I can see Professor Quinlan is asking that the elected members should not have any power whatever.  In a prior section he was objecting because the elected members were not given the full duty under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill an owner may be required by a housing authority to put his property into reasonable repair.  I suppose it is possible to look on this as being undemocratic but in fact the primary purpose of the Bill is to deal with the type of disreputable character which some people say exists in quite large numbers.  Others think there are not so many cases but to deal with the type of person who deliberately allows a sound and habitable house to deteriorate into such a condition that permission for re-development is obviously necessary.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to prevent that type of thing happening, to give the housing authority power to prevent that type of thing happening.  Whether it has happened in the past it is obviously something which could very well happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole provisions of a development plan requiring areas which are intended as residential accommodation could be circumvented by deliberately allowing sound property to deteriorate. We have in regard to this to allow housing authorities to take action. We have to assume that housing authorities will act in a reasonably responsible manner and that they will not unreasonably require people to put houses that have obviously gone beyond their period of usefulness into repair at an uneconomic cost.  The power is obviously necessary as I say to deal with cases where the law of the land is circumvented by people allowing or indeed causing their property to deteriorate until it becomes an uneconomic <Col N="1228" /> proposition to restore it.  This in fact is one of the primary purposes of this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one point on section 5 and something similar occurs in section 6.  In this case it is a private person that is involved.  At the end of subsection (1) they are given power to enter on any land.  I take it that that means a neighbour's land.  There is no question of compensation for damage done to some other person's land.  In an earlier section it was taken that anyone making alterations would have to do it in such a way as not to interfere with a neighbour's house or adjoining property but here they are given power to go in on any land which I take it means any surrounding land to carry out any work.  What about the question of compensation? I would take a dim view if somebody with a ladder put it on top of a flower bed in my garden.</P>

      <P>I feel a little unhappy that just before this Bill becomes law the Minister has given this permission.  I think perhaps he might have waited a bit. I notice that one of the reasons for his decision was that other parts of Stephen's Green had already been destroyed and, therefore, the implication was that we might as well go ahead and destroy the lot.  I find this provision unsatisfactory.  I do not like the fact that it is on the very day on which the Seanad is considering this Bill before it becomes law that the Minister has reversed the housing authority decision.  Subsection (3) of this section states:</P>
      <P>This Act shall not apply in relation to the following, namely&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had opened briefly on this topic when our progress was interrupted a little by the General Election.  However, we can now return to the topic and I am very glad to welcome the Minister for Agriculture back again.  I know we have differed in the past and that we probably shall differ again in the future but I am hoping that this committee that the Minister has promised&mdash;the committee on wages and hours of work as relating to agricultural workers&mdash;will serve a very useful purpose in solving the problem of recruiting the proper type of young men into the agriculture of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Bill is designed to improve the lot of those working in agriculture by regulating hours and wages but we all know that the only way in <Col N="1232" /> which to make a really substantial contribution to the earnings of those in agriculture is to retrain them and equip them for modern agriculture which is a very highly specialised and scientific job.  I hope that the Minister in those few months during which he remains in charge of agriculture before going on to higher things, will endeavour to leave his imprint on this problem.  In other words, I hope the Minister will push forward with the farm apprenticeship scheme and that he will state specifically what is the type of recruit who should go into modern agriculture. I suggest that it be someone who has at least three years post primary training and thereafter that we have as carefully planned an apprenticeship as anybody entering any modern industry.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the help that the Minister has given to farm apprenticeship and I know, too, he realises that the future of Irish agriculture depends directly on the quality of the skilled labour force that we get into the industry. I am glad to note that the Minister does not share the pessimism of those who say that we have too many people engaged in agriculture. There are those who take foolish statistics and say that because 22 per cent of our population is engaged in agriculture while the European average level is about twelve or fifteen per cent that we have too many in the industry. The fact is that we are very much part of the British Isle system of agriculture and the fact that they are low in the number engaged in agriculture &mdash;only six per cent of their population &mdash;means that taking the units as a whole we can have a high percentage of our population in the industry.</P>
    <P>The belief that we have a nation of small farmers is only a fallacy.  By comparison with the European situation we have a nation of ranchers.  We have the second largest average sized farms in Europe with an average of 45 acres whereas Denmark has an average of about 38 acres and Holland only 23 to 25 acres.  However, we must realise that if we are to get the output from our agriculture of which it is capable there are three ingredients that go towards that output.  One is capital&mdash;the amount of capital invested per 1,000 acres.  It does not require <Col N="1233" /> figures to convince anybody here that we have less invested per 1,000 acres than any of the highly developed countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>We have been making a great drive forward in this regard, but where we are short now is basically in the quality of the new labour force that we have. These have to be recruited, manned and trained for their craft.  The third point is the number of workers per 1,000 acres.  Again by European standards we have fewer workers per thousand acres of ground that in any other country of Europe, so that we cannot expect to get comparable returns to European returns, or those that our land is capable of if we attended to these three items.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that what we have in this Bill&mdash; an extra day's holiday or an hour or two&mdash;is just trifling with the problem of the conditions of work, and that much more important job suggestions have to be considered.  Again, the question of whether you get another two pence an hour on to the average agricultural wage rate, I am suggesting is irrelevant, in other words that the Bill's provision is largely irrelevant in our context today, because I know from first hand experience that men with proper training who are complying with what this Bill provides can earn some double, some almost treble. the amounts laid down here.  This is what the Minister should be aiming at, and not the mere mediocrity and uniformity that the Bill provides.  I am offering my full co-operation and any help that I can personally give, and I know that many others would be anxious to give help too in at last making this break-through in our re cruitment of a proper labour force.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that with many others I was involved very heavily in the setting up of the farm apprenticeship scheme.  I hope that in furtherance of the objectives of this Bill the Minister will see to it that we can get better quality and therefore that he will be back in a short time though I do not think it will be necessary, with a Bill increasing the amenities and the wage levels and so on.  But I do not think that it would be necessary, because the men concerned will make their own market.  We have few opportunities of speaking generally in this House and I am making a plea addressed to the Minister and to the new Government that in a time when we are all concerned about finding new jobs for our people our first concern should be to protect the old ones.  This is a simple way of finding new jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have 10,000 people a year leaving the land at present and we can find a way to cut that to 7,000, surely this is a net gain of 3,000 jobs.  The Minister can tell us that the Government will be providing the means to secure these 3,000 jobs elsewhere.  Ten <Col N="1235" /> million pounds a year would be a low sum for it.  Therefore we have a job to do and I appeal to the Minister to bend his energies to doing it.  I think that he will get the fullest co-operation of all the organisations concerned, and if he does that then when he leaves Agriculture he will leave with the people pointing to the great advances he has made in the vital problem of the provision of a labour force.  If he does that he will be remembered for this great task long after the sources of friction will have been removed and will have taken a big step forward towards the ideal of full employment for our people.  If we can do that we will have achieved something.</P>
    <P>I am prevented by the Cathaoirleach from developing how this work force could be expanded, but I have written about it, and I will just simply say that there are jobs to be had in Irish agriculture today.  We are told to look forward to foreign industrialists coming in and setting up new industries here, creating new jobs.  I do not think that we should despise this type of development for a second, but there are openings available in agriculture that will pay a far higher return both to the workers and to the community than any job I can foresee in new industry. A combined joint effort between industry and agriculture is needed to get our economy into the 70s, and I appeal to the Minister to exercise his influence with the Cabinet to see that agriculture's contribution is recognised and that this becomes widened by reforming the NIEC and making it include agricultural representation on the board and thus ending the present position which totally distorts the economic picture of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator has just said, this is rather trying to recall to some degree what had already been said in the earlier part of the Second Reading debate.  I have a few notes from that time.  Senator Miss Davidson spoke at some length and raised a number of points which the Labour Party would like to have seen included in the Bill.  These were also adverted to in the Dáil at an earlier stage.  These <Col N="1236" /> points were: standardisation of method of determining policy on pay; secondly, empowering the board to define overtime employment and giving the board power to fix weekly hours of work to which minimum rates of pay would apply; thirdly, empowering the board to prescribe schemes which would permit payment for service worked on retraining courses; fourthly, the abolition of the provision by which the chairman of the board constitutes a quorum and in the absence of the other members can make an order prescribing minimum rates of wages; also, improved methods for determining entitlement to certificates of exemption.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is a further point which I think was suggested by Senator Miss Davidson, about the recovery of wages from members of trade unions. The Committee which I promised in Dáil Éireann to set up has in fact been set up.  The first meeting was held on 30th June.  For the present, it is an inter-departmental committee.  It includes representatives from the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, Labour, Finance, Local Government and Lands, together with the Secretary of the Wages Board.  I have passed on these various points to the committee and I have drawn their attention to the points raised by Senator Miss Davidson. The terms of reference of the committee are to examine the legislation relating to wages and holidays of agricultural workers and to report what changes should be made in the light of changing circumstances.</P>
      <P>The committee have taken these terms of reference.  At their first meeting they have decided to interpret these terms very widely so that the examination may not be restricted.  With that background on these matters, the points raised by Senator Miss Davidson are being referred to the committee for their consideration.  Another meeting will be held within a matter of a few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should perhaps indicate that when the groundwork of the whole situation, as this committee may see it, has been examined it is our intention that further and other interests should then be consulted.  The committee, as an inter-departmental committee, are <Col N="1237" /> really doing the groundwork in preparation for further and wider discussion embracing other allied interests which are perhaps outside the Government service and are conducted by people who are not already on the committee. It is not for me or anyone else to forecast or prophesy the results which the consultations and examinations may throw up.  I would not wish to inhibit the committee or their inquiries.  After the committee have straightened things out to their own way of thinking we may see how the mechanism works and where it may be failing or where it may be needed to be renewed or changed. I should not like to feel that we had restricted them in any way.  I am glad that at the first meeting the terms of reference were interpreted in the widest possible sense.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald raised a number of points.  He asked for a revision of meal allowances for agricultural employees. The Agricultural Wages Board revises the allowances from time to time.  They have the power to do so. It is not necessary to provide any further power in this Bill in order to enable the Board to make such revision.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also raised the matter of the rebate on rates in respect of female workers.  That would be more appropriately transferred to the Department of Local Government for their consideration.  I propose to transfer this matter to the Minister for Local Government for his consideration. A third point raised by the same Senator was that of income tax concessions in respect of agricultural workers. This is appropriate to the agricultural workers' well-being and conditions and is a matter for consideration by the Department of Finance to whom I propose to pass it for their consideration.</P>
    <P>Professor Quinlan resumed the debate on this Bill.  On the last occasion and again today he spoke about the conditions and wages of agricultural workers within the narrow limitation of the Bill, but he also spoke on a much wider scale embracing the training and education of those who will work on the land.  The Chair was perhaps fairly close on the mark in regard to these matters not being entirely relevant <Col N="1238" /> to the Bill and I must tread rather easily here for that reason.</P>
    <P>I said in the Dáil that I had a great deal of sympathy with the view that had been expressed in that House in respect of the need for further education and training facilities being made available for the benefit of those who will live by the land in the future. In addition to the agricultural colleges and classes, and the farm schools and manual classes that have been carried on in the vocational schools to the great benefit of the farming community, we have indicated already that farm centres are to be set up in the near future with a view to helping those who live by the land, whether they are farmers, their sons or those who ultimately may be the employees on the farms throughout the country. There has been gradual extension of our colleges throughout the country.</P>
    <P>These educational facilities must be extended as quickly as possible.  Educational facilities must be improved to try to make agricultural training available as readily to those with an agricultural bent as post-primary education is to those going into other employment. Our farming community are entitled to have this element of education attended to in a specialised sort of way, without going into too much detail at this stage.  Specialised education for farming should be more readily available to the farming community. There is a need for greater and wider specialist knowledge being imparted in a really organised way to all people associated with the land.</P>
    <P>Post-primary education of a nature suitable to those who are to stay on the land is not on a par with the educational facilities and opportunities offered to those who will go into other walks of life in the future.  I am very interested in this and hope we can work in co-operation with the technical colleges which we have throughout the country at the moment.  It may be possible to add on to these technical colleges something that will be of practical help to those who come to them from the farms of the country.</P>
    <P>Even now, these colleges are of real help and young people go back to their farms with further practical education. <Col N="1239" /> In these days of mechanisation we need a very great degree of additional educational facilities in a purely practical way not only for the farmers and their sons but also for the farm workers. They need this practical education to deal with the mechanisation that has developed in this country and is increasing from year to year.  There are two gaps in the farmer's educational needs.  We need to fill them both if we are to have a satisfactory force, whether they be the owners or the employees of the farm.</P>
    <P>If we are to have this in the future I am fully with it that this should and must be done and that it must be done pretty quickly because the draw off that will take place as a result of the opportunities offered by post-primary education in secondary and technical schools may attract to such a degree that we will be even worse off in the future if we do not do something about those who might remain on the land.  This makes it urgent that something should be done about those people, apart from the fact that such educational facilities and better techniques which would be learned will be of immense value to them.</P>
    <P>There is a competitive element which is growing up and if we do not catch up with this quickly it might do damage to those who remain on the land with the result that not enough of the right people will stay on the land.  I am satisfied this is an urgent matter and I am hopeful we can get moving in this direction.  We have been taking stock in this regard for some time.  I hope we can see some concrete evidence in the not too distant future of something worthwhile being done to fill this void which is now there and whether I am still in Agriculture or not by the time this has been reached it is a matter which requires to be done and once done will pay dividends that will know no bounds in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there is much further I wish to say about this particular legislation we have here other than what I said when it was brought in here first. It is to a large degree merely confirming in the law what has been in practice <Col N="1240" /> in a great majority of cases in so far as holidays, conditions, hours and so forth are concerned.  The vast bulk of farmers are already treating their workers at least as good as we are providing for here.  Nevertheless, that does not take away from the necessity to ensure that all of them at least treat their workers as good or as well as we are dictating here.  In no way should it be taken as the most they should get.  If there are farmers who can afford to give them better hours and conditions, more power to them. We are merely laying down the minimum limits which we feel the law must secure.  It is only to a very small minority that this legislation will refer. The vast majority at least practise the conditions we have here and some give better conditions.</P>
    <P>One might say &ldquo;Why do it?&rdquo;  We are doing it because it is being done universally and we feel the small minority should be made to conform with those minimum standards.  No doubt this Bill is not the end either, any more than it would be in regard to the conditions of other categories of workers.  As times change and as times improve, I have no doubt somebody at a later stage will be coming in with a somewhat similar Bill to make improvements on behalf of and in respect of the agricultural workers of this country.  If we are to retain on the land of the country not only the owners, their sons and families to any great degree, but the very necessary agricultural workers, then I feel what we are asking for here is only the bare minimum and that a great deal of further improvement is necessary to keep those people and to make it more attractive for them to remain on the land and not to have more and more taken away by the attraction of other jobs in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as I say, this is only one of perhaps a number of such Bills of improvement which may come along.  We need this Bill now and that is why it is being brought along.  If it appears to fall short in certain respects in regard to some of the ambitions Members of this House might have in regard to conditions of farm workers, all I can say is it is an improvement on what is already there and is not the end of <Col N="1241" /> the line by any means.  It is merely an instalment which will continue to be added to in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I feel the House should look at this measure and should also look at the background to it and the fact that I have already put into operation, as I promised I would do, a committee who are examining this type of legislation and the regulations which go with it.  This committee is not restricted in regard to its terms of reference.  It can go further afield.  If they feel there is cause and need to go further they are free to do so and if I see there is need to indicate to them a widening of the field of examination I would not hesitate to do so.</P>

      <P>This is quite on the cards.  Indeed the committee with the very bare terms of reference they have <Col N="1242" /> interpret this in a pretty wide way. They have actually indicated by their discussions that they would interpret their terms of reference in the widest possible sense.  Even arising from their early examination if it seems to them proper that some things further and wider should be considered I will not offer any objection and if I have reason to believe that there are any ideas which would be appropriate to widen their terms of reference I have no hesitation in putting them forward.</P>
