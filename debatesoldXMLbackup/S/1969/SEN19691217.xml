      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for further capital advances to CIE and for payment to the board of non-repayable grants in respect of the amount by which the board's subvention was inadequate during the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.  I propose, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, to take with the Bill the motion on the Order Paper in relation to the Transport Act, 1964 (Section 6) Order, 1969, the purpose of which is to increase the amount of the annual grant paid to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1964, provided for payment to CIE, from 1st April, 1964 of the annual grant of £2 million, with the aid of which the board were required to break even, taking one year with another.  The Act provided that the amount of the subvention might be varied in the financial year commencing on 1st April, 1969, and in every fifth subsequent financial year, by order made by me with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and subject to prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas.  The Act also made provision for payment to the board by the Exchequer of capital advances not exceeding in the aggregate £6 million.  It <Col N="562" /> was estimated that this sum would, in addition to the moneys available from the board's depreciation provisions and other internal resources, be sufficient to meet CIE's capital requirements for the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.</P>
    <P>The 1964 Act was based on the Government decision, announced by my predecessor during the course of his Second Stage speech on the Transport Bill, 1964, to continue to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might be found practicable and desirable.  The Government recognised that CIE could never become a viable organisation so long as the board were required to provide a widespread rail system.  It was, however, accepted that while a complete changeover to road transport could possibly yield a public transport system which would carry on without operating losses, the enormous capital required and the very heavy staff redundancy would be such as to outweigh the advantages.  The Government also took into account the fact that the railway represents a vast national investment and offers advantages not alone for tourist and peak traffics, but particularly for certain bulk freight traffics.</P>
    <P>The annual subvention of £2 million was intended to be a realistic assessment of the minimum subsidy with which CIE could get by on the basis of effective management and increased efficiency and productivity.  The object was to set a difficult but not discouraging target and to provide an incentive to efficiency and economy.  In the event, CIE's total losses during the five year period exceeded the board's total subvention of £10 million in that period by only £542,460.  In the context of the board's scale of operations &mdash; their turnover in 1968-69 exceeded £31 million &mdash; and of the growing difficulties which beset public transport everywhere, this is a very slight divergence from the target set five years ago.  During the five year period there has been a sharp growth in productivity in CIE and improvement in management throughout the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself <Col N="563" /> and with the order, I propose to review briefly the results of the various sectors of CIE during the past five years. Except for 1968-69, CIE's net losses have been steadily growing, having increased from £1.475 million in 1964-65 to £2.48 million in 1967-68, before dropping to £1.961 million in 1968-69.  An increase in revenue, due to increased fares and rates and additional business, partly offset by an increase in expenditure, was responsible for the reduction of £519,000 in the board's net deficit for 1968-69 compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>The excess of £542,460 during the five year period can be attributed mainly to increases in labour and other costs.  CIE are a labour intensive industry and labour costs account for about 65 per cent of the board's total operating expenditure.  During the past five years, CIE's total operating costs increased by 44 per cent.  During the same period the additional annual cost of wage and salary increases, reductions in working hours and other improvements in conditions of service for CIE employees represented an increase of approximately 54 per cent on the level of the board's labour costs in 1963.  Some of the additional costs incurred during the five year period were offset by additional business secured by the board totalling more than £6½ million and by an increase of about 13 per cent in productivity; the balance had to be met as far as possible by increases in fares and rates.</P>
    <P>Excluding financial charges which, by arrangement with CIE were allocated for the first time to the various working accounts in the board's accounts for 1968-69, losses on railway working rose from £1.229 million in 1964-65 to £2.143 million in 1968-69.  Rising costs absorbed not only increases in fares and rates but also economies and increased productivity achieved by the board.  During the five year period rail passenger traffic was well maintained.  In an effort to increase this traffic, CIE have introduced a wide range of concessionary fares, faster trains and an intensive campaign to attract more <Col N="564" /> commuters to the suburban rail services.  Rail freight tonnage increased by 34 per cent; the increase was due largely to the growth in bulk traffic, such as cement, oil and minerals, which more than trebled over the period.</P>
    <P>Special container terminal installations have been provided at Cork, Limerick and Dublin for use in connection with new fast liner train services for container loads introduced this year between Dublin and Cork, Dublin and Limerick and Dublin and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Since 1964, 126 miles of railway line have been closed by CIE, reducing the railway at 31st March, 1969 to 1,333 miles of first track.  In addition 69 stations and halts were closed.  New railway extensions or sidings have been provided at Silvermines and Foynes to handle new minerals traffic, at Arklow for fertilisers and at Oranmore for oil products.  Another extension railway is at present being provided at Ballina-courty, County Waterford, to serve the new factory which is being established there for the processing of dolomite into magnesite.  The average length of haul of rail freight traffic increased from 88.6 miles in 1964-65 to 101.3 miles in 1968-69, thus reflecting the value of the railway for long distance haulage, particularly of bulk traffics. It is also of interest that the average length of passenger journey by rail increased from 35.8 miles in 1964-65 to 37.1 miles in 1968-69.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant improvement in the operating surpluses on the board's road passenger services taken as a whole, although the Dublin city services are now less remunerative than in former years, the operating surplus on these services having fallen from £389,000 in 1964-65 to £264,000 in 1967-68 before improving to £354,000 in 1968-69.  This is due not only to the impact of increased costs but also to a steady decline in the number of passengers using the Dublin city services.  An adverse factor is the ever increasing problem of traffic congestion, now estimated to cost CIE £250,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the operating surplus on the board's provincial road <Col N="565" /> passenger services, including tours and private hire, increased from £271,000 in 1964-65 to £941,000 in 1968-69. During the same period the total number of passengers carried on these services increased from 60.5 million to 78.4 million; a large part of this increase is attributable to the operation by CIE of the free schools transport scheme and to the increase in the board's coach tour operations.  Revenue from coach tour business increased from £218,000 in 1963-64 to £730,000 in 1968-69 and CIE's target is to achieve a 20 per cent annual increase in this business.</P>
    <P>Despite a decrease in the total tonnage carried by the board's road freight services in the five year period, the operating surplus on road freight working increased from £45,000 in 1964-65 to £227,000 in 1968-69, the impact of rising costs having been offset by increases in rates and by economies in operation.  I understand from CIE that the increased profitability on road freight working can be largely attributed to a reorganisation carried out by the board in 1965 of their road freight organisation.</P>
    <P>The CIE hotels and catering services continue to be profitable, the operating surplus having increased from £145,000 in 1964-65 to £234,000 in 1968-69. There has been an increase in the operating losses on canals and vessels &mdash; from £58,000 in 1964-65 to £100,000 in 1968-69.  At the request of my predecessor, CIE chartered a second vessel, the <i>Galway Bay</i>, to help in coping with peak tourist traffic between Galway and the Aran Islands during the summer months of this year and I am glad to be able to tell you that this traffic increased from 14,795 passengers in 1968 to 18,511 in 1969.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure by CIE during the five year period amounted to £17.785 million, of which £10.94 million was met from the board's depreciation provisions and other internal resources and £6 million by way of capital advances under section 4 (1) of the Transport Act, 1964.  There was a balance of £844,664 which was met by temporary borrowing.  The £6 million provision in the 1964 Act would have been adequate for the five year <Col N="566" /> period were it not for the necessity for CIE to provide additional buses for the free school transport scheme in the two years 1967-68 and 1968-69; in consequence, the £6 million provision was inadequate to the extent of £844,664. In addition to the board's normal capital programme, CIE, at the request of my predecessor, incurred capital expenditure amounting to £237,596 up to 31st March, 1969, on the provision of car ferry facilities at Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>Nothing has happened since 1964 which would suggest that any change is necessary in the Government decision taken at that time to preserve the railway system subject to such further concentration and reorganisation as might prove practicable and desirable. CIE are satisfied that, for the present at any rate, the railway has been pruned to the optimum size and that further concentration would not reduce losses. The problem of the viability of the railway is common to all European countries and has been faced more realistically here than in most other countries.  There is no ready solution but it is quite clear that the railway can never be operated without State assistance.  The problem is to contain losses to the minimum consistent with securing the most economic and efficient overall transport system within the national economy.</P>
    <P>The railway plays an important role in the social and economic life of the country and will continue to do so. Railway operations will be aimed at providing high standards of passenger travel and, by exploiting its advantages for speed, safety and comfort, CIE will aim at expanding rail passenger traffic.  More express passenger services will be introduced between major provincial centres and Dublin.  CIE will continue their campaign to attract more commuters to the suburban rail services with a view to ensuring that these services will be utilised as effectively as possible and to provide the maximum contribution to the relief of traffic congestion in Dublin city.  The board will continue to improve the layout and decor of stations and will provide car parks at stations where necessary and feasible.</P>
    <P>On the rail freight side, the board <Col N="567" /> will equip themselves to take full advantage of the recent development of container traffic.  Railheads will be developed to take advantage of the economies of unit loads and groupage facilities.  In this connection, the board, in conjunction with some of their major customers, the fertiliser manufacturers, have tackled the problem arising from the need to equate all-the-year-round production to seasonal consumption.  Large, mechanically equipped storage areas are being provided at railway stations adjacent to major areas of seasonal fertiliser demand. The fertilisers will be moved in bulk into these storage areas and will then be delivered to local consumers as required.  To keep pace with the growth in container traffic, more liner trains will be provided; the board's ultimate plan is to provide a national network of liner trains.</P>
    <P>The board propose to expand road freight traffic in specialised operational fields and standards of equipment and of service will be improved.  CIE's principal aims with the road passenger services will be to improve standards of comfort and service.  Every effort will be made by the board to improve the Dublin city bus services which are at present operating in very difficult conditions, which have affected not only the cost but also the quality of the services.  Many new buses of the most modern type will replace buses which are at present over age.  The board will continue to use modern devices such as closed circuit television and short-wave radio to try to keep the buses moving in difficult traffic conditions.  More express and limited-stop bus services will be provided throughout the country.  Special efforts will be made to expand coach tour operations, at the moment about 75 per cent of CIE's coach tour business comes from North America and with a view to increasing this business, the board have established sales offices in New York and Los Angeles and propose to open another office in Chicago.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for further Exchequer capital advances of £11 million to CIE, of which £1.08 million is already due to the board in respect of <Col N="568" /> the amount by which the £6 million provision in the 1964 Act was inadequate during the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.  This sum comprises £844,664 in respect of the excess of capital expenditure &mdash; caused by the school bus programme &mdash; over funds available, plus £237,596 in respect of the provision of car ferry facilities at Rosslare Harbour.  The balance of the £11 million (i.e. £9.92 million), together with the board's depreciation provisions, will be available to meet future capital expenditure by the board.  CIE's capital expenditure will be related mainly to the replacement of road and rail vehicles, the provision of school buses, the modernisation and improvement of equipment and premises and the improvement of staff amenities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for payment to CIE of non-repayable grants not exceeding in the aggregate £642,460 in respect of the amount by which the board's subvention was inadequate during the five year period ended 31st March, 1969.  This sum is made up of £542,460 in respect of the amount by which the board's total deficits during the period exceeded the total subvention paid by the Exchequer and £100,000 in respect of provision made by the board in 1964-65 and 1965-66 for redemption of its 2½ per cent and 3 per cent Transport Stocks, which was shown separately in the board's accounts but was not taken into account in arriving at the net deficits for those years.</P>
    <P>The draft order provides for an annual grant of £2,650,000 for CIE commencing 1969-70 which, in accordance with the terms of Section 6 (2) of the Transport Act, 1964, may be varied, if necessary, in the financial year commencing 1st April, 1974.  This represents an increase of £650,000 in the board's existing annual grant.  The new grant has been determined in the light of estimates of the board's revenue deficits for the five year period 1969-70 to 1973-74.</P>
    <P>I should mention that these estimates exclude the profits of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, the CIE hotels subsidiary, as these profits are retained by the company to help to <Col N="569" /> finance their capital expenditure.  The cost of the free transport scheme for school children is settled directly between CIE and the Department of Education and is defrayed from that Department's Vote.  Similarly, the cost of free travel for old age pensioners is borne by the Department of Social Welfare and for Old IRA men by the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the formula adopted in the 1964 Act has worked well and has provided the board with a useful incentive to efficiency and economy.  As in 1964, the annual grant has been fixed at a level which should provide the board, management and staff of CIE with a difficult but realistic target, the achievement of which will call for continued effort and initiative.  I have every confidence that these will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and the draft order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to welcome the Minister back and I am glad to see that he is looking fit and well.  Judging from the Dáil Reports, he had a very able deputy in the person of the Minister for Health who dealt very exhaustively with the many points raised in the Dáil debate. It would be unnecessary for me to cover all the ground again, but when one is presented with a bill of the size mentioned in the draft order it is only right that the Seanad as well as the Dáil should cast a careful eye over the reasons for the Bill and that we should look back over the past five years during which CIE have operated with a subvention of £2 million per year.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to say that Fine Gael will support the Bill, but having regard to the taxpayers' interest we consider it necessary that every item of public expenditure under the subvention heading outlined by the Minister should be scrutinised very carefully and that, where possible, constructive suggestions should be made to ease the burden on the taxpayers during the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is notable for several reasons because it confirms a change <Col N="570" /> in the attitude of the Government towards CIE which was contained in the Transport Act, 1964.  I was a Member of the Dáil from 1957 to 1961 and I recall that, when the 1958 Act was passed, CIE were given a subvention of £1 million a year for four years and they were warned at that time that they would have to break even.  There was then no question of CIE providing a social service as well as a commercial service but we note that during the past five years the emphasis has been laid, and quite rightly so, on the fact that CIE provide many useful and essential social services, particularly to school children, old age pensioners and veterans of the War of Independence.</P>
    <P>If I may, I shall deal as briefly as possible with the past five years.  The Minister has covered the position fairly adequately but there are a few points that I should like to make.  As the Minister has told us, the total subvention paid to CIE during the past five years was a little more than £10.5 million and this resulted in an excess of £543,000 above the total subvention of £10 million for those five years.</P>
    <P>In addition, if one includes the outlay on the ferry jetty at Rosslare, more than £18 million was expended by CIE in capital expenditure.  As the Minister has said the £18 million was subscribed by way of £10.9 million from CIE's depreciation and other sources &mdash; perhaps when the Minister is replying to the debate he will give us some indication of what the other sources are, because they appear to be fairly substantial having regard to the extent of the depreciation during the period &mdash; the State gave £6 million and the excess of £8.45 million was met by temporary borrowing, making a total of just more than £18 million between receipts and over-expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider some of the significant figures of CIE's operations during that five-year period.  Total revenue for the five years amounted to £131 million, of which 1969 accounted for £31 million.  The total deficit is just more than £10.5 million.  The wages and salaries of employees are approximately £20 million and this has <Col N="571" /> not varied very much during the period but a most important point and one of which each one of us would take very serious cognisance is the fact that salaries and wages amounted to £20 million during the five-year period or more than 60 per cent of the total expenditure of CIE.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to labour the point that expenditure of that £20 million in every area of the country has had a significant impact in indirect employment and in making available to shopkeepers, traders and other persons indirectly vast sums of money which they would not otherwise have enjoyed.  Materials purchased by CIE during the five-year period amounted to almost £5½ million and CIE paid in rates and road tax a total of £2.3 million.  In the working account, the railways, as has been the case now for many years, provided of course the heaviest deficit at £3.174 million.  The vessels, that is the service between Galway and the Aran Islands, lost more than £33,000 and the canals had a deficit of almost £73,000, a total deficit on working account of £3,280 million.  As against that, profits were earned in the road passenger service as follows: Dublin, £177,500; provincial bus services, £637,300 and that would suggest that at long last there is an end to the old story that the Dublin passenger services were subsidising the rest of the State.  If anything, now it appears that provincial bus services are providing that subvention.</P>
    <P>Tourist and private hire earned £196,000, road freight almost £123,000 and hotels <i>et cetera</i> earned almost £186,000, bringing the total profit in these various sections up to £1.319 million leaving an overall deficit of almost £2 million.  I should have emphasised that those are the 1969 results.  The subvention in fact, therefore, was very close to the estimate made in 1964 and, as the Minister has pointed out, were it not for certain unanticipated expenditure CIE would have operated inside their subvention of £2 million.</P>
    <P>CIE now provide essential social services.  Reference has been made to the schools free transport scheme <Col N="572" /> which is more likely to increase than decrease during the years.  There is free transport for old and blind pensioners and veterans of the War of Independence and the subsidisation of school children's fares.</P>
    <P>The number of passengers carried during the five years, at 1.548 million, will also give some indication of the vast size of the CIE transport undertaking. Rail freight ton miles which showed a very substantial increase of over 53 per cent and up to 111 million ton miles were a most encouraging feature of the accounts.</P>
    <P>The Dublin bus passengers went up by a very modest 3.7 per cent to 8.2 million while the number of provincial bus passengers went up by more than 50 per cent to 26.5 million.  As the Minister outlined in his speech, the provincial bus services are expanding whereas the Dublin bus services seem to be contracting.  Whether that pattern will alter in the five years ahead I cannot say.</P>
    <P>Another very welcome feature of the CIE policy with which we would all agree has been the modernisation of the railway stations throughout the country.  I should like to pay tribute to those responsible for the design and implementation of the various schemes. The Minister mentioned that some new railway lines were opened, a spur line to the Silvermines mining operations and, also in conjunction with the same operation, the reopening of the railway to Foynes and certain installations there.  I hope the Minister when he is replying will be able to indicate if the shipping facilities at Foynes which were provided by CIE jointly with the mining company, Mogul of Ireland, and which featured recently on a television programme, will continue to be operated in the event of the new ore smelter being located at Little Island in Cork.  It was suggested in the programme that when the ore smelter was completed no further use would be found for the export handling facilities at Foynes, County Limerick.  It would be a great loss not only to Foynes but also to the port of Galway if shipping to those two ports were to cease on the completion of the erection of the ore smelter.  Of course a different picture <Col N="573" /> would emerge if the ore smelter were located in the Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that special container terminals had been installed at Dublin, Cork and Limerick in January, 1969, to attract to the rail much of the long haul road freight traffic.  The pattern of container traffic now seems to be emerging as a link between the rail or roads and the east coast ports to the loss of the western ports especially Limerick, Sligo and Galway.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that the traffic lost to the port of Limerick, in which I am vitally interested, has not been lost as a result of a subsidised rail service from Limerick and other centres to Dublin or Rosslare.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that although we accept that CIE, like any other rail service in other countries, cannot operate without a very substantial subsidy from the taxpayers, that subsidy should not be used to deprive other forms of transport, such as sea or river transport, of their goods.  That is a factor I should like the Minister to look into very carefully.  None of us can get away from the rapidly changing face of all forms of surface transport, sea, rail and road, but we must ensure that through no action of ours will heavy subsidies be used to injure trade at the western ports.  Some years ago this position was accepted by the Government and a 15 per cent differential or subsidy was payable to western ports but that has disappeared for some years now, leaving the western ports completely at the mercy of modern economic transport complexes.</P>
    <P>CIE are to be complimented on their efforts to develop bus tours to the United States and to Britain.  They have issued a little booklet which I am sure every Senator has got which is an indication of the improved marketing techniques which have been employed by CIE during the past five years and the very encouraging response which their campaign has realised.  CIE have made most encouraging progress under various headings which I shall not read out and it is obvious that the people at the top and further down the ranks are thinking in a very progressive manner.  Productivity <Col N="574" /> and efficiency schemes have obviously paid off.  Judging by the international table which appears in this booklet, CIE compare more than favourably in the proportion of the GNP which is taken up in subsidising their operations.</P>
    <P>This little booklet indicates that the staff numbers have decreased between 1964 and 1969 from 20,148 to 19,836. CIE in their own accounts give a somewhat different picture and in fact it would appear that during the five years the number of employees has remained fairly static at around 20,000.  One of the most welcome features of the report has been the success of the hotels programme and the increase in the gross receipts from 1964 to 1965 of some £898,000, that is just under £1 million, to £1.4 million which is an indication that the CIE hotels are popular.  We would all wish them greater success in the coming five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his statement that the basic purpose of the Transport Bill, 1969, is to give CIE an annual subvention at the increased rate of £2,650,000 per year during the next five years, or an increase of £650,000 on the annual subvention of the past five years.  At first sight the increase looks a very substantial one but as the Minister for Health, deputising for the Minister for Transport and Power, stated in the Dáil, having regard to the depreciation in the value of money during the next five-year period, the sum is not excessive.  It is, of course, a very large sum by our modest standards in a small country, but having regard to the size of the operation I do not think anybody could cavil at the taxpayers being asked to provide that amount.  Quite frankly, I question whether £2,650,000 annually during the next five years will be adequate to provide CIE with the necessary finance to keep their operations going, but perhaps the Minister may have more encouraging news to give when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained already the non-repayable grant by the excess of the £10 million during the five years plus the £100,000 for the cost of redeeming certain transport stock in 1964 to 1966.  A point I should like to dwell <Col N="575" /> on for a little is the subsidy payable to CIE for capital purposes.  As I read it, that has been increased from £6 million paid in 1964 to 1969 to £11 million or a total of £17 million maximum for capital purposes during the coming five years.  More than £1 million of that sum, as the Minister pointed out, will be required to repay to the board the sum by which they exceeded the sum of £6 million provided in the 1964 Transport Act.  This means the board will have approximately £10 million, plus their depreciation provisions, and from other sources say another £10 million.  This sum may be substantially more, but assuming they can provide the same sum as the previous five years from their depreciation provisions and other resources, CIE will have a total sum of £20 million capital expenditure during the next five years.  The Minister might have given the House more detailed information as to how CIE propose to spend that sum of £20 million, or whatever is the correct sum.  I have made only an assumption based on the same depreciation as for the previous five years, and other resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given certain headings with which we would all agree, but when we are talking of a sum of £20 million the House is entitled to a little more detailed information than the Minister gave.  In the course of his statement he said that the railways had been pruned to optimum size &mdash; I wonder is the word optimum correct &mdash; that further compensation would not reduce losses.  This again would appear to be a departure from the policy of ten years ago when we were told the only way to reduce CIE losses and to put the company on at least a break-even position would be the chopping of the branch railways, right, left and centre.  In this regard, I can recall the late Deputy Bill Murphy of West Clare and myself protesting vehemently but alas, unsuccessfully, against the closure of the West Clare railway.  I cannot help feeling that if the West Clare railway were in action today it would prove a tremendous tourist draw.  I think now, as I thought then, it was a disastrous decision to close that down <Col N="576" /> for the sake of saving a comparatively small sum of money.  I do not recall the actual sum now but I think it was somewhere between £25,000 and £30,000.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Senator Honan is nearer the mark.  Anyway, considering the fact that we are now giving CIE £2.6 million to carry on, I think retention of the West Clare railway would have been a correct decision and its tourist potential would have justified that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Clare merchants?  As a commercial proposition I accept completely the Minister's point at the time that it was obviously a non-paying proposition, but I suggest that from a tourist viewpoint the West Clare railway &mdash; which I knew very well, and I think Senator Honan will probably agree, during 50 years and even longer &mdash; would be a wonderful attraction today.</P>
      <P>The Minister touched on the question of non-commercial services.  This is a new jargon: I suppose it is some of the terminology which is now creeping into all statements.  I assume that means social services.  He said, quite rightly, it should be clearly demonstrated to the public how those expenses are incurred and that they are charged to the proper Government Department.  I quite agree with that.  I do not think the public appreciate fully enough the type of social services or the number of social services CIE provide. They possibly could do a better public relations job in regard to that aspect of their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that by this amount of subsidy we are supporting today, and I presume all sides of the House will support it, CIE assist other industries and businesses to pay their way and to prosper.  There is no question about that.  The mere spending, as I said <Col N="577" /> earlier, of £20 million in almost every area in the country must have an important impact on the trading and other activities in those centres.  There is also a question which was not mentioned by the Minister &mdash; maybe it is good economics &mdash; but the taxation collected directly and indirectly from the spending of salaries and wages of some £20 million must be giving back to the Government a very large slice of what they give out.</P>
    <P>We would all agree that in recent years CIE have taken on a new image. Younger men have been placed in top management positions, and reorganisation has resulted in the appointment of very keen and competent young men in the position of area managers.  I have had some contact, as I am sure we all have had in our own areas, with those young men, and I should like to pay tribute to them.  They are first-class businessmen, keen, efficient, and certainly imbued with a great desire to give the best possible service to the commercial community and to the public at large.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay them tribute and I should like to say, with considerable experience of railway travel during a long number of years, that right down from the top to the bottom there appears to me to be a better and more progressive spirit among all ranks of CIE employees.  There seems to be a more efficient and co-ordinated system of running the various departments, and the public now realise that instead of being a sort of giant weight on the public economy, CIE are a vibrant, living and progressive organisation.</P>
    <P>We would all agree that the board must always be alert to take advantage of changes in economic activity in the country and of opportunities that arise from the exploitation of natural resources such as mining and agriculture. The Minister mentioned in his statement the tremendous increase in traffic from mining and exporting of ores.  The same would apply, and will apply, I think, if and when &mdash; and it is when rather than if &mdash; we join the Common Market countries.  One of the things we are looking forward to with the greatest expectation is a very substantial increase <Col N="578" /> in agricultural development and agricultural exports of all kinds.  In that, CIE have a very important part to play in moving agricultural produce from this country to the furthest corners of Europe.</P>
    <P>At all times, the Board of CIE would want it to be their first care that their tremendous resources in men and materials and in State subsidy are not used to compete unfairly with smaller private enterprise concerns.  During the past few years, as I have already stated, developments in all forms of surface transport, rail, road and sea, have posed many problems, particularly to the small countries like ourselves with widely dispersed populations.  These can only be tackled in a co-ordinated manner under the aegis of a national transport authority.  Such an authority would ensure that the best and most efficient use is made of our various transport systems, road, rail and sea, so that wasteful duplication or competition is avoided.  By this means the taxpayers' contribution would be utilised to the best effect and kept at the lowest possible figure.  In other words I favour the setting-up of a national transport authority that would be charged with the duty of co-ordinating all forms of transport, public and private, to ensure the elimination of duplication and overlapping and to ensure also that our national objectives would be utilised through an effective and co-ordinated transport system.</P>
    <P>All of us at one time or another have shed tears on the decline of the west.  At every election, speeches are made on the old theme of saving the west, but I sometimes think that the saving of the west and the smaller country towns and villages in rural Ireland could be better achieved if large public services such as CIE were directed towards ensuring that the transport systems from these centres would be viable and cheap, to enable factories and industries located in the west of Ireland to get their goods to the market in the United Kingdom or on the Continent at the cheapest possible cost.</P>
    <P>That is probably the best contribution our public transport system could be giving, and the necessary assistance should be forthcoming from the <Col N="579" /> Exchequer to enable them to do that. We would all agree, whatever our political differences, that it is no good locating factories or industries in the west or in isolated places unless they have one essential service, and that is a cheap transport service to bring the finished products to the ultimate market.  Our entry into the EEC is bound to bring further problems to many industries in this country, and almost certainly to CIE.  Without being over-optimistic it is very likely that during the five-year period for which we now are providing finances to CIE this country may very well find itself a member of the Common Market.  If and when it is, it may be necessary for the Minister for Transport and Power, whoever he may be, to come back to this House with another Transport Bill in the light of these major developments.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute not only as a public representative but also as a trader to the courtesy of the staffs in all grades of CIE, and in particular I should like to pay tribute to the drivers of school buses and the drivers who bring children on various outings throughout the year.  These are now one-man buses, as we all know, and I should like to pay tribute to the humane, kindly and careful way these men look after their charges.</P>
    <P>Finally we can admire the wonderful record which CIE drivers have had during the years.  Any of us who attended the presentation of the annual awards to drivers of commercial vehicles will have remarked on the very big proportion of CIE drivers getting five-year, ten-year or 25-year awards with the gold medal, as the case may be.  This does seem to confirm the opinion of the public with regard to the skill, care and courtesy of the drivers, and most of us would substantiate that statement.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I should like to refer to a statement made by the General Manager of CIE, Mr. Frank Lemass, which appeared in yesterday's newspapers, in which he referred to developments which CIE are to undertake during the coming year.  He talked of the 13-day tour of Britain and Ireland <Col N="580" /> and referred to the Golden Holiday Tours based on Tramore, Ballybunion and Skerries, in addition to existing centres, Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Salthill, Killarney, Portmarnock and Warren-point. What has happened to Kilkee and Lahinch, not to mention the city of Limerick?  Is there any good reason why these important tourist areas should not have been included in the Golden Holidays?  I conclude by assuring Fine Gael support for this Bill, and I wish every future success to CIE in their operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, the Government are to be congratulated on coming, in 1964, to the view that there is a social content in the railways which is valuable in itself apart from the commercial profit.  We all realise the need for such subventions as are proposed in this Bill.  We also appreciate their merit.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell mentioned a point which should be stressed in relation to the West Clare Railway.  The desirability of regarding some of these subventions as being, in part, tourist subventions is obvious.  It is quite obvious that railways like the West Clare Railway, or the railway between Woodenbridge and Shillelagh, or the railway serving Bantry in West Cork, merit consideration as concerns which might not necessarily bring in a commercial profit but which would have been worth keeping for their social content and for the tourist attractions they provided. I had the same opinion about the old Howth tram which was a very picturesque feature in relation to tourist amenities around Dublin.  Years ago in Douglas, Isle of Man, there was a horse tram running along the sea front for a couple of miles.  I believe it is still running as a tourist attraction there.  CIE, in trying to cut down, have perhaps cut down too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the whole question of the Harcourt Street line. CIE committed a major blunder there. They were very eager to destroy the bridges and stations and to pull up the tracks in order to make it impossible to reverse the decision about the line. If we had that line now it could be developed and used.  It passed through <Col N="581" /> places like Carrickmines and Shankill, Foxrock, Milltown and Dundrum. It was a major error to close down this line.  The Minister has spoken of the efforts to increase traffic and to have faster trains.  He has spoken of the intensive campaign to attract more commuters to the suburban railway services.  They could be attracted if the tracks existed.  It was a bad error on the part of CIE to pull up the tracks and to destroy the bridges.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the board made an effort to improve the Dublin city services which have been notable for making a profit pretty consistently. Many buses of the most modern type will replace the original buses.  I regret that green is no longer the colour of the buses.  There was a slogan in 1922-23, promoted by Fianna Fáil and whitewashed on walls which read: &ldquo;Green pillarboxes for green Irishmen&rdquo;.  The implication was that green paint was not enough and we should go forward to the Republic and not be content with the Free State. Green is almost banned now as a colour for buses.  The buses are blue or red or some other colour.  Could the Minister tell us why the handsome green buses which were admired by tourists have been changed to more workaday colours?  The new colours are less inspiring.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that in this Bill he excludes the profits of Ostlanna Éireann.  In Glengarriff, which is one of the most beautiful places in this country, CIE committed an enormous blunder in relation to hotels. Roche's Hotel was built on the best site in the whole area.  CIE purchased it and pulled it down.  Having pulled it down they found they were not able to rebuild it.  They sold the whole site, including the garden, to one of their biggest rival hotels in the area, thereby ensuring that no hotel would be built on this wonderful site.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on this even though he admits that profits from Ostlanna Éireann are excluded from this Bill.</P>
    <P>CIE have a garage in the middle of Glengarriff village.  This is a most attractive village but we now find this monstrosity and eyesore of a garage <Col N="582" /> of corrugated iron, some of which is painted and much unpainted.  The painted portion is rusty.  I wrote to the Minister's predecessor on this question last year and suggested it was bad example for CIE to have such a monstrosity in the middle of the village. It has been said it is private property. I suggested to the Minister's predecessor that it should be removed.  The Minister's reply was that it did not belong to CIE but to someone else who had rented it to them.  I believe CIE could exert pressure on the owner to see that the garage is painted.  When there is a question of destroying part of our heritage of beauty in one of Ireland's most famous beauty spots we should be concerned to see that those from whom we rent such garages make them conform to certain aesthetic standards.</P>
    <P>The money being sought in this Bill is fully justified.  As I have indicated, there are certain matters in relation to CIE towards which increased thought should be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister back and to convey my good wishes to him.  I welcome the Bill providing for further capital advances to CIE.  I was looking at the <i>Third Programme for Economic and Social Development</i> and on page 124 there is comment on the board's capital expenditure.  That refers to 1969 and would include replacements and minor additions and normal obsolescence. The Third Programme made this comment:</P>
      <P>These are expenditures which a commercial undertaking would aim to meet from revenue or depreciation reserves.  Consideration is being given to the desirability of bringing these within the subsidy provision so as to extend the incentive to economy and efficiency and to settle on a broader basis and for a longer period the full costs of maintaining the undertaking.  Capital expenditure, financed by Exchequer advances, could then be confined to specific new projects which could be shown to be either remunerative or essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know what progress <Col N="583" /> has been made.  The Minister has told us in his opening statement that the funds will be spent mainly on replacement of road and rail vehicles and on school buses.  The school bus service is a new service which is enormously welcome throughout the country. The Minister stated the money would be spent on the modernisation and improvement of equipment and premises and on the improvement of staff amenities.  I welcome this decision to spend money on the improvement of staff amenities.  I believe good staff amenities help the morale of employees in a firm and thus improve industrial relations.  The Minister for Finance realised this when he made certain tax reliefs available in his Budget for the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts and sport facilities for employees.  The reliefs were similar to those available for extension of industrial buildings.</P>
    <P>I hope that the money we are voting, particularly that devoted to staff amenities, will be further increased by the merits of this Budget provision.  Many of the developments which the Minister has outlined are connected with improvements in the speed and service provided by our road and rail transport. I should like to underline the necessity, particularly when there is increasing speed on railways, to pay due regard to safety factors because there is no doubt that a crash at high speed on an express line can be extremely serious.  One point on which I am particularly interested is the provision of radio-telephone communications in the cab of every main line train so that in the event of any breakdawn or mishap the driver can communicate and get help.  Otherwise you increase the danger for railway passengers on trains in times of trouble and I suggest that this type of sensible safety device should take precedence over the kind of developments referred to in the CIE Annual Report where it was stated a start was made with the provision of a public address system with facilities for background music.  I should be much more interested to know that provision was being made for my safety by the instalation of radio-telephone communications in the <Col N="584" /> driver's cab than in the provision of pop music.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements in suburban traffic and I suggest that when some of these funds are being spent on the replacement of rail rolling, particular attention be given to suburban rolling stock.  I am a regular suburban train traveller and I find it extremely odd that every morning I travel on rolling stock which looks more suitable for a journey from Dublin to Cork.  I do not think it is economic to utilise it for short suburban journeys where we should have special rolling stock which would be easier to clear and maintain than the transport now used.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one other plea in connection with suburban rail traffic.  In the development of the railways, the non-smoker seems to have been forgotten; it is very difficult to find non-smoking accommodation on our trains and this at a time when the Minister for Health is endeavouring to carry out a campaign to reduce smoking and when many people prefer to use bus transport when they can travel in a non-smoking area.  Surely the train traveller is entitled to the provision of a non-smoking area on suburban rail lines.</P>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister referred to the extensions which have been made in the use of concessionary fares on our rail lines.  There has been an enormous advance here and weekly and monthly suburban fares are tremendous value.  I found recently that the price of a ticket which I purchased at a railway station had decreased and in these days of rising prices this is indeed a spectacular achievement.  I should like, however, that it would be possible to use the return section of the rail ticket on buses at any time of the day.  Very often people are delayed in town for one reason or another and they find they must pay the ordinary bus fare.  I suggest a concession could be introduced to ensure that people might use their rail tickets on buses because we should do our best to encourage people to use suburban rail services rather than buses or private transport in view of the growing congestion of traffic in <Col N="585" /> Dublin.  Considerable reference has been made to the modernised buses. On routes Nos. 7 and 8, which serve the areas of Dún Laoghaire and Dalkey&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Sallynoggin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>The No. 7A bus travels to Sallynoggin.  On the No. 8 bus route we have not yet seen these modernised buses for the simple reason that one section of the road is too narrow for buses of this size and this difficulty has recently led to an unfortunate accident on the Ulverton Road.  Perhaps CIE could look into the possibility of running the route on a one-way basis; I should like to see this coming from CIE rather than the gardaí or the public when it is too late and an accident has occurred.  In the case of the No. 8 bus route there is an alternative one-way route available and CIE might consider the possibility of using this.  The local development organisation have pointed out the possibilities on a number of occasions but so far without success.</P>
      <P>On a final point, the canals cost CIE £72,919 each year.  There have been rather confusing reports in the papers recently that perhaps responsibility for the canals &mdash; this applies particularly to the Grand Canal &mdash; may be transferred to the Office of Public Works.  I should be interested to know if there are any plans in this direction, particularly as I am one of the people who hope that the canal will be retained as an amenity.  Under the control of the Office of Public Works, which have an interest in the preservation of monuments and amenities, it might have a better chance than it had under CIE.  I should be glad if the Minister could let us know what is happening in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are the detail points I wish to make.  There have been tremendous improvements in the attitude and image of CIE and I hope this will continue.  The theme I would stress is that they should resist the temptation to run away with gimmicks and pop music on trains and decorations at railway stations.  I believe that a transport <Col N="586" /> system wins on service alone and I think additional suburban train services to Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey and Bray would be worth much more than the provision of pop music, tinsel and decorations in the railway stations.  I wholeheartedly recommend this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted that a community needs a public transport service with the emphasis on the needs of the community rather than on the economics of the operation of the service.  I hope I will be forgiven if I refer to the staff of CIE, I being a CIE man myself.  I should like to pay a tribute to the staff. They deserve the greatest praise because they work in bad conditions and I often wonder if the great service they have given has been recognised by the board.</P>
      <P>There are many men employed by CIE whose wages do not exceed £15. Drivers of one-man buses get only £15 or £16 per week.  I wonder if that is recognition of the service they are giving.  There is a lot of talk about this subvention.  It has been criticised by many people who often think that it is the workers of CIE on whom most of the money is spent but the manual workers of CIE are not well paid.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1967, CIE operated more social services than they are now doing. At least since 1967 the Department of Education have made some contribution to their funds, but prior to then the board operated a service for schoolchildren that was uneconomic. Parents could not afford to pay any more with the result that the company were operating at an uneconomic rate. We recently had experience of the bad conditions in the coaching department at Heuston Station.  One hundred and thirty men were employed during 12 months but 93 left because of the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this discussion it was mentioned that the closing of branch lines was a bad idea.  Senator Russell spoke about the closing of the lines but I thought it was strange that as a Clareman he did not emphasise that it was a mistake because West Clare has a great tourist potential and <Col N="587" /> the discontinuance of the branch lines has an adverse effect in West Clare. With regard to the railways the question of national percentage is concerned. It is not possible to have a modern European state if we do not have a railway.  It was a mistake to discontinue the rail services in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to existing train service, the service offered leaves nothing to be desired.  For example, a train leaves Limerick at 8.20 every morning and arrives at Kingsbridge Station at 10.45 a.m.  We can be proud of that service. It is a service that is run by a very efficient staff and if those people who do not avail of the service would only realise what they are missing I am sure that they would use the service much more often.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to pay tribute to the board in general.  They have handled a difficult job.  A staff of 20,000 people probably means that the board are looking after 50,000 people when children are taken into account. For that reason and because CIE are the second largest employers in the State I consider the subvention to be not at all too great.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what most of the other people have said with regard to the service that is provided by CIE.  I have availed of that service and I must say that I see considerable improvements every year.  Senator Russell mentioned that the managerial staff have become more forward in their outlook and that they are coming to grips with the problem that exists in providing the service required.  Of course, legislation to provide for a subvention is not the sort of legislation about which anybody would go into ecstasies, but CIE probably have compensatory factors and they are providing a service that would probably be difficult to provide in any set circumstances.  I do not wish to go into any details but I was attracted to the suggestion of Senator Russell for a national consultative transport group who would come together occasionally to discuss transport tendencies in the country.  I do not know if Senator <Col N="588" /> Russell was thinking on exactly the same lines as I am.</P>
      <P>Something that alarms me at times is the tremendous amount of money that must be provided out of capital resources for codes and the general regulation of traffic problems as they apply to the country as a whole.  Our main arterial highways are designed in the most part for private traffic but we now find that they are being clogged by heavy transport, very often big lorries with as many as two trailers in tow.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider that a number of the main transport people, people who have transport problems and people who are involved in solving these problems, might be brought together at some stage to see whether the services could be utilised to a greater extent.  An effort must be made to get some of these larger lorries off the road thereby making the roads more viable for the purpose for which they were intended in the first instance. On the road from Limerick to here one may find a mile of the road impassable because of these huge lorries. This traffic might well be carried by the railways.  It would serve the national transport very considerably and it would save a great deal of money that is being presently wasted on the roads if people who have goods to transport together with the people who have the means of transporting them could come together to consider how this could best be done because it is quite possible that in five or six years time the main arterial roads will be practically denied to private users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that CIE have really got their teeth into the transport problem, perhaps with the help of outside people, people who have problems in the transportation field, if they were brought together and had some kind of consultations, they might, if they could not solve the whole problem, certainly alleviate it.  Most of the railways that I know of now are equipped for handling container traffic.  When people talk of container traffic they are usually speaking in terms of export, but we have a container problem within the country also.  By using these methods, <Col N="589" /> much of this heavy traffic could be kept off the roads and the massive amounts of money that are spent on our arterial roads might be used with greater benefit if we split the burden and shifted some of the big stuff on to the rail and left the roads available for the people for whom they were intended. If that is what Senator Russell had in mind I think it is a good idea. The roads cannot be allowed to become completely choked up with these heavy lorries when this could be given over to CIE remuneratively for both the sender and the haulier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill.  It has taken some people some time to come around to the view that providing trains and buses is a service.  The idea that was in some people's minds a few years ago that a service of this nature should be self-supporting is no longer tenable. This is a service and if this view were held seven years ago perhaps some of the branch lines that were closed would not have been closed.  Senators have adverted to the West Clare Railway. Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke of the Harcourt Street line and also referred to the Bantry line in West Cork.  If at that stage people had a conception of the whole transport system as a service those branch lines might not have been annihilated.  In the future they may be a necessity for the tourist trade and possibly for industry in those places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta.  He said that the Estimates exclude the profits of Ostlanna Éireann, the CIE hotels subsidiary, as these profits are retained by the company to finance their capital expenditure.  Other Members of this House may know exactly what the relationship is between CIE and Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta.  I am not clear on it.  Conflicting reports come out which make me believe that I do not understand it.  Is there a financial link between Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta and CIE? If so, the trend here shows that the future holds a prospect of the hotels section of CIE being capable of subsidising to some extent the future costs of CIE.  If there is no financial arrangement <Col N="590" /> between them or if statutorily they are separate, why go to the trouble of calling them Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta?  Why not call them Ryans?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The State has involved itself in the development of hotels in that it subsidises Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus have invested in hotels.  It seems to me that having Ostlanna Éireann Teoranta and Aer Lingus investing in hotels is a duplication of services.  If the State is to involve itself in the provision of hotels this does not seem to me to be the correct way to go about it.</P>
      <P>Traffic is becoming a very serious problem.  To enjoy the services of CIE we need good, comfortable vehicles but we also need to get from place to place.  In any Transport Bill the question of traffic should come up.  It would reduce bus fares if a bus could get from one point to another at a greater speed.  The turnover would be greater and would thereby if not reduce fares at least prevent them from rising at the enormous rate at which they have been rising.</P>
      <P>I am not as conversant with Cork as I am with Dublin but I know it reasonably well.  This problem will arise in Cork and also in Limerick.  In Dublin, traffic is at a standstill at certain times of the day.  The Minister, I am sure, knows this and is trying to find a way to solve it.  There are certain solutions to this, for instance to ban all parking in the centre of the city and to allow only through traffic. That is to make the centre of the city a clearway especially at certain times. This brings me to the question of parking meters.  I wonder if the Minister knows that this system has been tried out in many cities throughout the world and is now being taken away.</P>

      <P>Another aspect of this matter which the Department of Local Government could look into which would expedite traffic is the installation of an underground or subway pedestrian crossing in certain places in the city.  At least this is being entertained although it is not known whether it will be proceeded with.  It might be some solution to the traffic problem.  I am not an expert on engineering matters but I have been speaking to some of those people and they have different ideas on it.  The most progressive ones might think it would be good but others would ask where is the money to come from.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Keery emphasised the importance of the commuter services.  They were referring to train services in particular. I agree with both of them and that is why I query the advisability of closing the Harcourt Street line.  It is a pity that more people do not avail of those services.  Too many people today are using cars to come into town and to go home later in the day.  This is causing some of the traffic congestion I referred to before.  Only one person occupies most of those cars.  I wonder if it would be feasible for all local authorities to put a daily tax on each vacant seat in those cars coming into town of 10s.  It would certainly reduce the number of cars travelling if a fee of 10s had to be paid for every vacant seat in the car. If there was any way of administering that it might be a way to subsidise CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke about the colour of the buses.  I think the reason for the colour is mainly one of safety in that buses run not only in the city but throughout the country and the green colour did not contrast sufficiently with the scenery around. I may be wrong in this but I think <Col N="592" /> this was the main reason for changing the colour.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of this matter which might relieve traffic congestion in Dublin, that is the erection of this bridge we have been hearing so much about on the seaward side of Butt Bridge.  We might get some information on this when the Minister is winding up the debate. I do not know at what stage this stands now, but it would certainly relieve the flow of traffic if there was another bridge across the Liffey.  Delays on buses were mentioned by Senator Keery who spoke especially about the Dalkey, Dún Laoghaire and Sallynoggin routes.  There are great delays on those routes and then afterwards three and four buses arrive together.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to get CIE to provide a service more quickly than they have been doing to new estates.  They never provide a service to those new estates until representations are made to them from residents' associations and other bodies interested.  They never think of this themselves.  In fact they have to be forced into providing a serivce to people in new estates.  As everybody knows, most new houses today are situated in very inconvenient places to work.  They are situated at great distances from places of employment, whether it be a business or an office, from shops or even from where they get their hair done.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom ar an gcéad dul síos a rá go bhfuil áthas orm féin, agus gan dabht, ar gach Seanadóir eile an tAire Iompair agus Cumhacht a fheicheál annso in ár measc arís. Guimíd fad saol dó san obair atá á dhéanamh aige.  Practically every <Col N="593" /> speaker this afternoon had something very nice to say about CIE.  I add my voice to their's.  I say from my own experience of travelling here and abroad that first of all, as far as trains are concerned, we have a service which is more than comparable with that in existence in Great Britain and on the Continent.</P>
      <P>When we speak of a transport service we have in mind first of all safety. Thanks be to God we have a magnificent record of safety in our transport system in this country, due to divine Providence without doubt, but to a large extent due to the efficiency and care of the splendid body of men we have working in our transport system. The maintenance crews, the drivers, fitters, workers of all kinds, all work with a will to ensure the safety of the passengers.  Safety then is number one and punctuality is probably number two.  There was a time when punctuality was not a decided characteristic of either our transport system or indeed of ourselves generally, but those things are changing and we are becoming more punctual as time goes on.  Certainly our transport system has reached a very high standard in this regard.  If you leave Cork and travel to Dublin by train you may be sure you will arrive on the mark with a variation of no more than one minute too early or a half a minute too late, but never more than that.</P>
      <P>Along with safety and punctuality we have the question of comfort.  Certainly our trains are as comfortable, if not more comfortable, than most of the trains you will travel on in Great Britain or the Continent.  Furthermore, especially on long journeys, when one requires meals or drinks we have on CIE trains an excellent meal service. It is nothing short of magnificent.  The food is excellent and very well served with politeness and courtesy.</P>
      <P>I have just one small criticism in passing.  I am not a drinking man myself but I do like a bottle of stout now and again before a meal and I notice that the price of a bottle of stout in the trains is 2/2d.  This is rather high, and I have heard quite a number of complaints from travellers who may prefer a number of bottles of stout rather than my one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> As far as trains go, there is bound to be a loss for various reasons.  Train services in all the countries of Europe as far as I know run at a loss, and we are in the position here through being an island of not having any great through traffic through our island as compared with a country like Switzerland where you have trains going through at all hours of the day and night back and forward from Paris to Rome, Rome to Paris, <i>et cetera.</i>  I understand that the greatest costs in running a railway service are what they call terminal costs, which far exceed haulage costs.  Our longest haulage distance would be from Dublin to Cork which is 166 miles.  It would be something longer, of course, from Dublin to Killarney or Tralee; but if we had longer haulage I have no doubt that we would break even, almost, in this day and age, which would be almost a miracle.</P>
    <P>That being so, the subvention of £2 million a year for the past five years was a very accurate estimate by CIE, and if it was exceeded by £642,460 it does not take from the fact that it was a very accurate estimate, because meantime we had inflation.  I suppose we have not any cure for inflation and we must accept these things, and what would have been £2,000 five years ago could gradually work up to a much higher figure now.  We will be lucky if in view of the fact that prices will still probably go up in the next five years and if and when we get into the Common Market &mdash; goodness knows when that will be &mdash; we will be very lucky if the cost of running our railway system does not exceed an annual subsidy of £2,650,000.</P>
    <P>Our bus transport &mdash; again, of human beings, excellent; services very punctual, very clean, drivers and conductors excellent as far as courtesy, politeness, accuracy in giving change <i>et cetera.</i>  All these things mean that they make a very favourable impression on tourists.  May I specially commend CIE for their educational tours. Speaking as a teacher I can say that the big event in any school in the country is the day of the educational tour.  Children who may have never been outside their own village can for a very reasonable fare come along to <Col N="595" /> Dublin, visit the zoo, visit and inspect various other buildings, and not alone can the children come but their parents can come too.  This I think is a magnificent idea from CIE, this running of these educational tours at a very reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Speaking of schools I have a little criticism to offer regarding the school services.  You may think that I am attempting to run off the rails in as much as school transport services, especially for national schools, is a matter mostly for CIE and Education, but in my own area children come to their parish national school by CIE buses from two miles, 2½ miles or three miles away.  There is no bus service in the evening, and quite a number of them if they do not get a lift from somebody have to walk home in all weathers.  I wonder would the Minister agree that there is to some extent I would not say an obligation but maybe a partial obligation on CIE to help to resolve that problem?  I am sure that this problem exists in other areas than mine.</P>
    <P>One of the little things we should beware of, and one of the things that could spoil our splendid transport service, would be the development of a careless attitude as far as details were concerned &mdash; little irritations.  Tourists are coming every year, and will continue to come.  This is one of our greatest industries, and we must leave no stone unturned to see that there are no irritations.  I had an experience of an irritation some time ago.  I went into a big bus station.  I wanted the latest bus timetable.  I knocked at inquiries and a very obliging lad put out his head.  I told him what I wanted and he said: &ldquo;Yes, there is an office down there where you can get the timetables.  You won't have any bother. The timetables cost sixpence and they give details of everything.&rdquo;&ldquo;Very good&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;That is very satisfactory&rdquo;. I was going down to get one and I was just a little away from the office when he called back and said &ldquo;You won't be able to get them.  The office is closed since 5.45.&rdquo;  It did not matter a great deal to me, because I was able to come back the following day and get one, but little things like <Col N="596" /> that are irritations, and had it been a tourist it would be a thing that would have irritated him.  Why not have a number of these timetables at the inquiries office when the other office would close?  That is one example of irritation which could cause a great deal of damage over a length of time.</P>
    <P>That is about all I have to say except to commend CIE on its record of which every one of us should be very proud.  It is one of our greatest industries.  Any industry that will pay £20 million into the pockets of wage earners is no small industry.  Furthermore, it has the advantage that that £20 million is being given not in any particular area but right through the country, and contributes a great deal to the contentment and prosperity of our people.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides us after five years with a rather brief opportunity to have another look at CIE.  We can see that good strides have been made in the intervening period.  Obviously the system looks more efficient and businesslike.  It has got injections of capital and these have put it into a reasonably good position. Above all there is an acceptance that it is more a social service, or at least a service to the community, a type of service that should be maintained, and that we have to pay the price for maintaining this service.  Of course we should use every opportunity possible and every method possible to get as much efficiency as can be got into such a system and for that we must pay the price.  Far gone are the ideas of the wild-eyed economists who eight or ten years ago thought that by lopping off branch lines you were suddenly going to make CIE run without a subsidy. That was the 1958 Act in effect. At that time on this side we went on record that this was going to do irreparable damage by closing those lines, even if foresight had prevailed to keep the permanent way intact for the better future which we all knew should come and would come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been worthwhile to leave the railways in West Cork especially.  There is great expense on road works.  Both rail and road services are complementary.  I agree with Senator Russell and others who drew attention to the rapidly deteriorating condition of roads because of heavy lorry traffic on them. Use of heavy lorries is the greatest single contributory factor to traffic holdups in both cities and elsewhere. Road works are responsible for constant demands on local authorities.  The amounts given for road improvements are very high.  The amount of damage caused by the heavy lorries is great. Looking to the future with its problems of increased traffic, we should try and plan to get as much heavy traffic as possible back on to the railways.</P>
      <P>This has been done successfully in the USA.  Many of the US methods can be copied here even though their operations are on a much larger scale.  CIE should pioneer this type of shuttleservice. They should see that their own traffic service uses the railroads as much as possible.  CIE should pioneer container traffic within the country. They should set a headline for private enterprise by showing how rail and road transport can be combined.  In five years' time I hope we will be able to record that some progress has been made in this respect.  I would like to see more stringent traffic regulations imposed on large lorries.  Minimum distances between such lorries should be prescribed.  There should be regulations about such lorries so that fast-moving passenger traffic may pass them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A minimum speed limit is necessary also.  Lorries travel at 30 miles an hour where they could quite easily travel at 50 miles an hour.  CIE should set an example in this by giving suitable instructions to their road freight drivers. <Col N="598" /> On some occasions they offend as much as others against the regulations. Traffic congestion is building up by 8 or 9 per cent per annum.  Road traffic could double in the next eight or nine years.  Our present traffic difficulties will be greatly increased.  It was not very wise to have the beet lorries passing through Cork when they could have been handled through the rail links.  Lorries such as these should be kept out from the centre of the city. Private car traffic may have to be kept out of city centres or may have to be restricted to certain zones in cities.  We have an acute traffic problem in Cork, second only to that of Dublin.  A great contribution to solving this problem could be made if the through-traffic through Cork could be diverted.</P>
    <P>We welcome very much the decision of the Government to take the control of the canals away from CIE and to make them the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  This should have been done long ago.  At all times the canals were just a poor relation of the CIE system.  A loss was shown which did not really amount to much considering the amenity which was being preserved.  In 20 years time canals and waterways will play a large part in catering for the leisure time of the people.  We must preserve the amenities we have.  I congratulate the Government on taking this step and on deciding not to close the canals.</P>
    <P>We take an increase of £2 million to £2.6 million rather lightly.  It is approximately an increase of one-third. That is a very sizeable increase on any Estimate, especially when the deficit over the past five years was £650,000, or about 5 per cent on average.  Target figures were set and we all know what target figures mean.  In a big concern like CIE they mean that the firm cannot go above a certain figure in their spending.  This figure represents generosity on the part of the Government. I hope they will extend such generosity to some universities and educational institutions in the country. If we produced a budget running well over the figure agreed because of increases in wages, for instance, we would be told to put up with it, but the State would not give us permission to write <Col N="599" /> off the deficit.  There is an advantage in being a State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>With regard to the computer service I wish to state that if CIE had taken my money the deficit would be lower by £22 10s.  I had booked a half hour's time on the computer to demonstrate the proportional representation count in October, 1968.  The time was cancelled.</P>

If there are any such influences in operation I hope they will cease but in my judgment it was a definite political influence and nothing else that prevented the running of that half-hour programme. Running a national transport system, which is a major service industry, should be completely free and above any suggestion of party influence or pressure either in employment or in the day-to-day activities of the company.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with the many specialist sections in CIE that have been built up in the last five, six or seven years; they are the economic section, work study and the many specialist sections within the operation of the enterprise itself involving specialists in their abilities and their specialist knowledge on the coordination of road and rail transport. It is excellent that we have these sections and I believe they could be, if they are not already, brought into participation in the scheme which the Minister for Industry and Commerce had here in the last 12 months when there was a Bill proposed to enable Córas Tráchtála to encourage our people to engage in consultation to outside countries.  There is great potential for this in CIE because many countries in the world have similar traffic problems.  We have valuable specialists and it could be a useful sideline for CIE to develop a practice of consultation with other nations regarding their transport problems.  I commend this to the Minister who might ask the CIE board whether, in fact, they can participate more fully in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the question of bus fares which, I think, have gone up in the last five years much more rapidly than has the cost of living or the rate of wage increases. Perhaps the Minister could give me some figures to see what is the percentage increase in bus charges during the past five years.  I know of one case where five years ago a 3d fare covered a distance of one and a half miles; this same distance now costs 6d. There may be many other cases where fares have doubled also and I think <Col N="601" /> the rate of 4d a mile for travel on buses is rather expensive and hits all sections in the city.</P>
    <P>CIE have made commendable improvements and the Government have made a commendable improvement also in taking a more realistic attitude that they can neither legisate CIE into solvency or force them into solvency but we must face the fact if we want a public service we have got to pay for it and this is what this Bill is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to hear Senator Quinlan complimenting the Government.  I shall be brief on the matter of CIE, which provide an excellent national service.  From time to time I manage to get away from Dublin to a remote part of the country and certainly from the point of view of people living in west Kerry the fact that there is a bus available at least twice a week is a great social service for them.  I do not know how far any community should go in providing a social service of this kind at a cost to the ordinary taxpayer but I think we should maintain it.</P>
      <P>A point which interested me is the increase in income from coach tours which showed an increase of £218,000 to £730,000 in the years from 1963 to 1968.  This is an interesting figure because up to five years ago there was resistance to allowing outside coach services to come in here.  It is significant to know despite the fact that outside coach services have to a large extent been allowed in here during the summer CIE have succeeded in increasing their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of communication down the line in CIE I should like to ask the Minister if this is being done. Some years ago during a series of week-end bus strikes I asked an inspector, who has since died, whether he or anyone at his level had been called in to advise the management on how the drivers and conductors in Dublin were feeling and he said they had not been asked.  I have been involved myself at management level communications with workers for more than 25 years and I consider if there is anything in this story that it is a <Col N="602" /> matter that needs to be looked into. It is absolutely essential that not alone should those who are working in a public service know what the management are thinking and have clearly explained to them the reasons for various decisions but it is even more important that management have a good idea how their workers are thinking and feeling and know their problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to the question of traffic in Dublin and I should like to relate this to the economics of CIE.  A recent estimate given by one of the engineers of Dublin Corporation estimated that the loss to the community and to the economy arising out of increasing traffic in the next five years in Dublin, over and above the possible loss of the present day, would be in the region of £12 to £14 million per annum and this loss was due to a slowing down of the services. One of the main problems with which CIE have to contend in Dublin is, as Senator Belton mentioned, the large number of cars coming into the city in the morning with just one person, the driver, who leaves his car in town all day and drives home at night thereby contributing to congestion and to the cost in time and money to CIE.</P>
    <P>A speaker on the opposite side of the House referred to the question of parking meters and said that they were being removed in other cities.  I should like to know which other cities he had in mind.  It seems to me that the idea of parking meters is a very good one. If those people who drive into the city in the morning have to go out every hour or half-hour to put a shilling in the meter they will soon stop bringing in their cars and CIE will benefit in fare-paying passengers.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the facilities that CIE make available for the parking of cars in a few areas.  If they are not thinking of doing so they should look to the question of plotting a fairly large number of parking areas around the perimeter of the city, particularly now that parking meters are being introduced. They might also use the radio service which they are using sometimes in the mornings and sometimes in the evenings to pinpoint these areas so that a driver caught in traffic will be <Col N="603" /> reminded that he can leave his car at Conyngham Road, Clontarf, Dollymount or wherever it may be.  Through the use of the medium of radio, CIE could do a lot to encourage the parking of cars on the perimeter of the city.</P>
    <P>Another way in which radio communication could be used would be to inform people of when trains are delayed. Very often there are delays at suburban rail stations for very good reasons but I have been informed by quite a few people that there is no way of knowing that the train will not come and this can be very difficult for people who must reach their work on time.</P>
    <P>Finally, as one who has been driving all my life in Dublin, I should like to compliment the drivers and conductors of the buses on the extraordinary patience displayed by them.  Naturally, there is the odd one who loses his temper and there may be the odd driver who will pull out into traffic, but one tends to notice only the one who breaks the rules.  The great majority of them are very patient and courteous.  They work frequently in very difficult conditions because of traffic congestion and so on but I have the greatest respect for them.  Indeed, I also have great sympathy for them.  We support this Bill and in doing so we can be proud of the transport service.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a few words to those which have been spoken from my side in regard to our support for this Bill.  I am far from being an expert on transport matters and if I display ignorance I apologise to the House in advance for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Brugha has just said in regard to the kind of people that we are lucky enough to have working in our transport system. I should like to go on record, as others have done, in saying that in my experience I have never come across anything but courtesy, helpfulness and efficiency from CIE.  The people who operate the train service are particularly to be commended.  There are many instances in which an Irish man who travels abroad has to draw the sad conclusion that things here are not as <Col N="604" /> good as they are in other countries, but the rail system is not one of these things.  We have nothing to learn from British Transport in so far as punctuality, courtesy and helpfulness are concerned. I wish to add that genuine tribute to the tributes already paid from both sides of the House to the people who operate the train services. The same goes for our bus services and I should like to repeat, almost in the same words, what Senator Brugha said about the people who operate the Dublin city services.  At this moment&mdash; 5.25 p.m. &mdash; there are a couple of hundred men sitting in small cabins driving buses across the city in very bad weather conditions and it is very difficult for them to manage to keep their self-control.

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the closing of the Harcourt Street line but of course the suburbs that were served by that line are for the most part thinly populated and most of the inhabitants would use the rail service only occasionally because most of them are in the private car owning category.  I agree with the general idea of Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the closing of lines was premature and that leads me to the reflection that the existing great lines are not properly used and are possibly not sufficiently operated for the purpose of serving the city.  Going by train to Galway or to Limerick, one is out of Dublin and into the green fields within minutes and I wonder if the authority in CIE would represent to the planning authorities that any further suburban or corporation development in this city should take account of transport facilities.  It seems to me incorrigible that any man, whether he be a one-car or a three-car owner, would refuse to avail himself of speedy facilities into the city and in that way to get to the centre of the city much faster and so to acquiesce while living in Lucan, Hazelhatch or even Sallins which are totally unbuilt-up areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not advocating the spoliation <Col N="605" /> of the countryside, but any further development should take transport facilities into account.  CIE have much leeway to make up in attracting passengers to the rail services.  I feel we should consider closing, even if on an experimental basis and for a limited period, the centre of the city altogether to ordinary private traffic.  I realise that if that is ever done there will have to be exceptions to the generality of the closure.  It is perfectly clear that doctors, ambulances and fire brigades will still need to go through, that there will have to be a couple of throughway arteries to enable people to cross the river and, of course, old and handicapped people cannot be asked to leave their cars on the perimeter, as Senator Burgha suggests, but so far as the ordinary motorist is concerned I believe we should experiment.  It might be a disaster, of course, and if it is we can drop the experiment, but we might experiment by closing the centre part of the city and supplying instead large fleets of small buses, perhaps the size of school buses, with multiple destinations and perhaps allowing a much larger number of taxis to operate at, of course, correspondingly cheaper rates to see whether this will ease the traffic situation in general and the position of the CIE bus services in particular.</P>
    <P>I believe it would ease it.  The question is whether it would be an inconvenience to the public in other respects. I can see that trade interests would feel it and so on, but it is something that the transport authority ought to consider and if they are in favour of it the transport authority ought to bring their feelings to bear on the planning authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in regard to the catering services of CIE which, I am glad to see, have been extremely successful.  The standards in the CIE hotels&mdash;and in the course of my periegesis of the island during the election campaign I visited nearly all of them&mdash;are extremely high. The people who run those hotels deserve congratulations for maintaining such high standards.  However, I must observe that in the high season the prices in these hotels are very high: indeed they are so high that I <Col N="606" /> have to suppose that the ordinary Irish citizen is not intended to use them.  In Galway in July I discovered that the cost of a single room in the Great Southern Hotel was £4, not counting breakfast.  I realise that we must cater for the luxury international trade and that there are people who will pay these prices, but I cannot conceal a certain sense of resentment that the ordinary Irish citizen cannot use a CIE hotel without spending this, to him, very large amount of money.  It is a good development that the CIE hotels division are now apparently concentrating on the cheap tourist hotel.  One is being or has been built in Rosslare. This is a development which deserves to succeed and I hope it will succeed.</P>
    <P>I have one suggestion to make which I hope the Minister will think is helpful. CIE have been less than adventurous in developing the terminal stations as restaurants and bars.  There are, of course, bars in all the terminal stations and in many of the stations in the midlands and a couple of stations have got refreshment rooms, but I observe, travelling on the Continent, that in several countries, Germany in particular and also Austria and Italy, the railway company lease out a concession to some private enterprise caterer to run restaurants and bars on the station premises.  It may be that CIE would make more money by doing this, but if they do not wish to overexpand in this way they might consider adopting this Continental system whereby space is made available on the station premises and is rented out to somebody who undertakes, subject, of course, to reasonable supervision, to provide the restaurant services.  I look for example at the station in Dún Laoghaire which is in a beautiful situation, in a most favoured neighbourhood, a very thickly populated tourist area.  Unless it has changed a good deal since I was there, the refreshment facilities it provides are fairly limited.  What I ask myself is whether space might be made available and a restaurant operated there either by CIE or by a concessionaire who would provide the facilities for tourists and for ordinary citizens and which would provide additional income for the company.</P>

They are not a joke any longer and the credit for lifting the company out of the joke category goes to the people who have worked there so hard over the years.  We all sincerely wish them success.

      <P>I wish to say a few words about the closing of branch lines. It was mentioned here that this put a burden on the rates which had to provide roads.  My recollection of the closing of the branch lines is that the Government made substantial grants, wherever, a branch line was closed, to improve and reconstruct the roads in those areas.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is in regard to school transport.  One of the most hopeful signs in the country is the the yellow school buses which one sees in rural Ireland.  They are an augury for the future of our country, they are a sign of progress and they have made a tremendous difference to rural Ireland.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us what are the powers of the drivers of these buses to enforce discipline.  From time to time one hears complaints about the behaviour of children on school buses.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us what is the position of operators of mini-buses where they are being forced out of business by the extension of the CIE bus service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that the canals are still running at a loss.  I welcome the proposal that the Dublin section of the Grand Canal is to be kept open and that a tunnel will be used instead of the horrible proposal to put a sewer along the bottom of the canal.  Many people are clapping themselves on the backs <Col N="608" /> and claiming credit for this.  One would imagine, to hear those people, that the Fianna Fáil Party are a party of philistines, people who are bent on destruction. I should like it to be recorded as saying that as far back as 1963 at the Ard Fheis of my party, I made a proposal that the canal be kept open.</P>
    <P>At that time I was actuated, I must say, far more by the economic needs and necessities of the part of Ireland from which I come, that is the Leitrim and Roscommon areas, than by aesthetic considerations in the city of Dublin. We were afraid that the closure of the canal would militate against the development of boating on the Shannon. We are glad to see the canal kept open. Senator Quinlan mentioned that possibly in the next ten or 15 years we would see a growth of traffic on the canals and rivers.  I can say that in my own town of Carrick-on-Shannon we have had a Government investment of £100,000 for the provision of jetties and so on on the Shannon.  There is a capital investment of the order of £250,000 and that is just in one town for this cruiser development.  That is why I am glad to see the canal being kept open.</P>

      <P>In welcoming this Bill I welcome also the opportunity to join with other Senators in the rightful tribute they have paid to CIE employees. As an ex-railwayman, I can testify that the tradition of the service which has always distinguished the railway service in this country continues with the present employees in the rail section of CIE.</P>
      <P>There has not been very much reference to the employees in the road freight section of CIE.  Here again, and perhaps through my own experience as a trade union official on the docks, I can testify to the very hard and dedicated work of the men in that section of CIE.  It is essential in the proper operation of a port, particularly, if I may say so, of the size of the port of Dublin, that time-keeping schedules be fairly strictly adhered to. In this connection we have certainly no quarrel, indeed quite the opposite, with our worker-colleagues in the road freight section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enough has been said about our bus <Col N="609" /> crews.  I have always felt, and I say this very genuinely, that two of the most difficult tasks today are those performed by bus drivers and bus conductors. As Senator Kelly said, if we picture at this moment the many hundreds of men huddled in the very small cabs of their buses wrestling with the very severe traffic problems they have to face, one does not know whether their state is worse than that of the conductors who are dealing with those humans who make very little allowance for their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am in the very unique position, too, that I am an ex-member of the board of CIE.  I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on something that I understand has been said in another place with regard to the alleged political flavour of Government appointees to such boards.  I can speak only from my own limited knowledge of trade union representation on the board of CIE but certainly so far as I was concerned when the present Minister's predecessor approached me and discussed my possible membership on the board of CIE, no mention whatsoever was made of my political affiliations, and those, of course, were well known to the Minister as being to the Labour Party; nor were any restrictions sought to be imposed on me in any way.  I know enough of the integrity of my trade union colleagues on the board for the time I was on it, and from my successor on that board, to feel sure the same considerations apply to those gentlemen as did to myself.</P>
    <P>I have but a few questions, and perhaps comments, which the Minister might like to take note of.  I should like to know if both the capital advance and the annual subvention which are before us this evening are to the order of the recommendations of the boards of CIE or whether in fact that board sought greater sums under one or both headings.  It seems to me that there is in this debate an acceptance of the social importance of CIE, and perhaps that was not always present, but it seems to me also that while glowing tributes have been paid, and rightly paid, to certain aspects of CIE administration, that is not to overlook the fact that there are certain difficulties <Col N="610" /> in that enterprise, particularly in the past I am glad to say, in the matter of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that a major contributory factor to many of the difficulties of CIE is that we have this peculiar animal of a publicly-owned enterprise being operated in a private enterprise mentality.  For that reason the board of CIE and, indeed, all employees of CIE, have been obliged to work very strictly, within the concept of profit and loss and the limitations of State aid.  This has particularly reflected itself in the matter of the salaries and wages paid to their employees. I mean no disrespect to my colleague Senators when I say that the employees, to whom we have rightly paid tribute this afternoon, would prefer to see those tributes being more concretely expressed in the matter of better salaries and wages and would not give you, my colleagues or myself much thanks for words.</P>
    <P>I feel the present policy of the Government in respect of CIE, as a result of which the Oireachtas were asked on occasions to inject capital into CIE, will not for too long suffice to deal with the problems inherent in a national transport enterprise and that sooner or later, and I would hope sooner, the Government would give very serious consideration to the whole question of where the national transport company stand in the national administration.</P>
    <P>However generous the Government may be in injections of capital into CIE, it still remains true as far as I can judge that there is still pressure on the board and the administration of CIE to raise very big sums of money from their customers.  This, in the profit and loss concept of capitalist economics, may seem justified, but we have to remember&mdash;and I speak here particularly of the passengers both rail and bus&mdash;that they are placed in the position where they in fact are making a dual contribution towards CIE.  The majority of them, I would say, particularly today under PAYE, are contributing towards the upkeep and administration of CIE as taxpayers, and they are at the same time being obliged to make a contribution by way of fares and other payments of that kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> I would suggest to the Government that if not now perhaps in the future they would examine the socialist concept of national transport whereby in the socialist countries today such fares are not alone by our standards but by the standards of their own continent very low, and indeed consideration is being given to their total abolition&mdash; in other words a concept whereby it will be accepted in full, not in part, that the national transport is a national service and must be met by a complete national subvention.  This may seem somewhat of a revolutionary policy at the moment, but I do not think so.  I think that the day the State went into this field, the day that the national transport company were conceived and brought into being, we set ourselves on that road, and I repeat that perhaps some of our difficulties arise from the fact that we have only travelled half of that road.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about containerisation, referred to, and very rightly so, in the Minister's speech.  It would seem that CIE have&mdash;again I say rightly so&mdash;gone into this field of containerisation.  I can assume from the Minister's speech that very heavy capital expenditure is considered under that heading.  I do not claim to be an expert in transport, but I would suggest to the Minister and to the board that some care should be taken in this matter of containerisation, and it should not be too lightly accepted that containerisation represents the be-all and end-all of modern development in transport.</P>
    <P>I have in a modest way some connections with transport, particularly sea transport, and I am aware that already and in advance, as it were, of containerisation, ships are now being built which will eliminate the need for containers as we have only recently come to know and live with them. Massive ships are on the stocks in the shipyards of the world, and particularly of Japan, which will carry not containers as we know them but lighters which at selected ports can be put overboard from these ships and travel by coastal seas to other ports in safety.  There are other developments <Col N="612" /> and new concepts, and although I acknowledge that containerisation will develop and will be with us a long time I repeat a word of warning that it would be unwise if CIE were too lightly to take it that there will be no further developments along those particular lines.</P>
    <P>On the question of buses, I should not like to introduce anything in the nature of a petty note here, but I like to think that we live in a Republic where all the citizens of this country are treated equally, and not alone that, but that the citizens of this country are treated equally with citizens of other countries; and although I appreciate the importance of the tourist industry, at the same time I think that a little more care could be given in the matter of the provision of buses.  Too many of our people, I feel, are obliged to travel in buses which, to quote the Minister's statement, are over-aged, as it were.  At the same time we see our tourists and indeed certain citizens on apparently favoured routes travelling in coaches second to none in luxury.  It has been stated rightly that CIE, thanks to the dedication and perseverence of all concerned in the enterprise, have gone away from being a music hall joke.  I would suggest that if they want to go along that road, and not suggest that they are not the national concern that they really are, they should avoid any semblance of giving more favourable treatment to one group of people than to another.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am not clear about the canals.  It has been stated that these have now been taken over by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I should like either CIE or the Office of Public Works to make a very strong point in regard to the serious loss of life in so far as people are drowned in the canal, particularly as this is the cause of loss of lives of children.  I hope that nobody will quote statistics and say that it was <Col N="613" /> only one last year and one the year before. One is too much.  Not the least of the contributory factors to that unforunate loss of life, particularly of children, are the footbridges which here and there span the canals.  They are footbridges with planks, I suppose six to eight inches wide.  It is true that notice boards have been erected drawing attention to the danger, but children, if they do read those notices at all, will naturally, humanly enough, pay little attention to them.  I would repeat that I should like if CIE or the Office of Public Works both would pay a little more attention to the safety factor of the canals than has previously been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the very constructive discussion on this matter.  It concerns the financing of CIE during the next five years.  It is a straightforward measure to ensure that CIE are equipped financially, both on the capital and current sides, to carry on their various operations during the next five years.  The planning and thought behind this are best exemplified by the fact that five years ago when the Transport Act, 1964, was introduced it was estimated that £2 million a year would be sufficient to carry the CIE railway deficit.  It is a very fair tribute to the estimators of that time that the deficit was in excess of the figure planned by only half a million pounds.</P>
      <P>The planned deficit of £10 million was only in the region of £10.5 million after five years.  Having regard to the varied economic developments, the wage and salary claims and the other unforeseen factors, this figure demonstrates the reliability of the assessment made at that time.  On this occasion we have carried on a similar detailed examination with CIE and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have examined the figures in great detail and have come down on the side of the figure mentioned here in the motion of an annual subvention of £2,650,000 in the next five years. This figure practically approximates to <Col N="614" /> the figure of £2 million five years ago, having regard to the falling value of money.  I agree with Senator Russell when he says that we may not have charged enough in this respect.  The important thing is to try to pitch a figure which, although relieving CIE of the social obligation of maintaining a railway system, will ensure they will have an incentive.  I do not agree with Senator Dunne when he says the profit and loss aspect is a matter for capitalist economies.  In every economy, no matter what sort of economy it is, or whether it is styled socialistic or capitalistic, fundamentally all things come down to profit and loss, to plus and minus.</P>
    <P>In speaking of CIE rail operations it is important to assess a figure which will strike a balance between maintaining what the community requires in regard to a basic rail system and to equate that with ensuring that it will be carried on as efficiently as possible. The only way to do that is to get a sum which will ensure that CIE management and staff generally will try to keep within such target set by the community through an Act of the Oireachtas and to be able to carry out the essential social service.</P>
    <P>We struck a reasonable balance in the five-year period up to now.  The figure now set will strike a reasonable balance for the next five years.  It will set an incentive which CIE could keep within.  That figure will ensure that the basic service will be maintained from the point of view of the community. What I said in my opening speech can be summed up pretty well in giving to the Seanad the figures for 1968-69 for CIE.  Including financial charges, the principal losses were as follows: loss on railways, £3,174,130; loss on canals and vessels, £106,412; total loss, £3,280,542.  That is a loss of £3 million odd.  The surplus on other services came to £1,319,703, the net deficit came to £1,960,839.  We have here the picture of CIE: making money on passenger services, making money on freight services and on hotels and losing money on the railways.  This is something we as a community are committed to&mdash;to maintain the railways as a basic social and community asset, and this is precisely what this <Col N="615" /> Bill and the motion before us are concerned with.</P>
    <P>In addition to the organisation of the deficit on current account during the next five years, as this House is aware we propose in the Bill to increase the level up to £17 million within which CIE can derive capital for further investment.  Senator Russell, in a very constructive speech, mentioned the aspect of a national transport authority.  Although at first sight this appears a very desirable approach, on second thought it is not so because I feel, in the transportation business particularly, the more competition you have the better.  It is a business, particularly on the freight side, that is especially suited to competition.</P>
    <P>On the passenger side we have provided a basic service but on the freight side I shall be bringing in legislation to liberalise the whole road transport system, to ensure there is total freedom for anyone to carry agricultural livestock and also to ensure that so far as existing plate-holders are concerned the existing restrictions will be relaxed to ensure that existing holders will have a 26-County licence without restriction as regards weight, commodity or area. In this field, liberalisation rather than nationalisation should be the order of the day.  There are many fields of State activity in which nationalisation and socialisation are the proper things but in this sphere, particularly in the field of freight transportation, because of the intimate nature of the business deals involved and the various times and schedules involved, it is particularly suited to the competitive area.</P>
    <P>I think that the more liberalisation we have in this field rather than nationalisation, the better.  Indeed it is significant that the British Labour Party before the last general election had in mind the nationalisation of the road transport, but they rapidly forgot that after the election.  I believe in being pragmatic about these things; if matters have to be done in that way, then let them be done but there is no point in socialising or nationalising merely for the sake of nationalising. The transportation field is particularly suited to private enterprise and to competition to keep down rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> The question of Óstlanna Éireann Teoranta was mentioned by Senators Russell and Belton.  I would emphasise that the reason the hotel subsidiary is a separate organisation is that it is in its own right a highly-profitable organisation having little in common with transport problems.  Their net operating profit for last year amounted to almost £200,000; in their own right also they have got substantial loan capital from outside CIE in addition to the loan from CIE and their assets in the form of hotels.  The rest of the financing is by way of bank overdraft and Bord Fáilte grants.  The proposed very rapid expansion in the coming years of the new type of motel operation may entail financing from abroad, it may entail equity investment on the part of people who wish to invest in a profit-making organisation and for these reasons it is important to have Óstlanna Éireann Teoranta as an independent body in a position to raise what finances they can in whatever money markets they can in order to expand this highly profitable organisation.</P>
    <P>I will take up immediately the points by Senator Russell regarding the question of including Kilkee and Lahinch &mdash;two places very dear to me&mdash;in the Golden Holiday Scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan raised the question of the increase in bus fares in the past five years.  It is interesting to read into this the relationship to other increases in our society.  Fares may have increased by 43 per cent in the past five years but in the same period the national income has increased by 48 per cent and the weekly earnings for everybody in the transport goods industry has increased by 50 per cent. Therefore, these increases are of a higher percentage than the increased fares.</P>
    <P>I will certainly pass on the point made by Senator Kelly in paying tribute to CIE staff.  I have much sympathy with the point of view he expressed in regard to traffic congestion in the centre of the city.  He advocated the very radical solution of closing the centre of the city to private motorists, and although we may not go so far at the present time, there is a committee studying this problem in <Col N="617" /> great detail.  In my view this is the most important problem in the whole transportation field and Senator Kelly's radical solution may yet have to be adopted.  However, this committee are examining ways and means of trying to solve this problem, which I agree urgently needs solution.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made by various Senators concerning the question of surburban rail facilities for areas around Dublin.  This matter has become rather emotive when linked with the Harcourt Street closure.  As far as the Harcourt Street closure is concerned, the facts are inescapable; even if we had the chance at this present moment it would not be economic and this is the advice CIE have given to me.  CIE are engaging consultants to study the suburban railways in the Dublin area with a view to determining their existing capacity and the future capacity for different levels of capital investment.  This study will also establish the future likely role of suburban railways in the Dublin conurbation.</P>
    <P>We should forget what is past and decide on which type of rail service might be adequate to fit in with the new developments that have taken place in our capital city as CIE have done in meeting the problem created by developments such as the Silvermines development in the Tipperary-Limerick and in other areas where it was necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The question of the canal has been mentioned.  I can state categorically that as far as CIE are concerned as soon as we have finalised matters with the Dublin Corporation and the Office of Public Works, I will introduce the appropriate legislation to divest CIE of any involvement in the Grand Canal because this is a matter that we consider to be outside their particular ambit.  CIE are concerned with presenting a commercial transport organisation outside the railways and our concern is to preserve a system from the point of view of social obligation to the community.  As far as the Canal is concerned it is a matter for the community. The obligations of CIE under existing legislation arose because of CIE being a commercial carrier on the Canal but this is no longer so in the <Col N="618" /> realistic sense but the Canal should be retained and will be retained by divesting the responsibility on to the Office of Public Works who can maintain the link between Dublin and the Shannon system so that we will have a waterway system that will serve as a tourist attraction into the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As far as CIE are concerned, we are very happy to participate in that divesting of responsibility and I am certain that nothing but good will come of it. It is a proper definition of responsibility to have control and management of a particular service where it properly belongs, and in this case it does not belong to CIE but to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There was not very much that arose in the course of the debate that I have not referred to but I would like to emphasise one particular point that was raised and I hope I will be forgiven if I appear to be harping back on an old problem.  It is said that you cannot have your cake and eat it, but it was mentioned here that there was some change of policy with regard to maintaining the railway system of CIE in a viable situation.  This is not so, because what we have done is to rationalise the railway system of CIE and we have taken a sensible attitude in doing this. Had we retained the branch lines that we closed down, the Bill I would be seeking here would be for a million pounds more in round terms, but we took the middle course and a sensible one.</P>
    <P>We did not take the attitude that was taken in Northern Ireland where they went the whole hog and liquidated the rail system.  We took the middle course between liquidating the rail system and, at the same time, maintaining totally inefficient branch lines.  We decided on what was a minimum rail system from the point of view of the community and we decided to ask the community to pay for that.  This has worked out reasonably well and I am glad that from the attitude shown both in the other House and here this approach is now appreciated and it can be dealt with on an all-Party basis.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Dunne that the commercial criteria should not be applied to the other operations of <Col N="619" /> CIE.  It should be applied.  This is the only way that we can ensure that management and staff are involved in doing a good job.  We have reduced the rail system to a certain level and we have told CIE that as far as the rest are concerned they must make their way, and they are doing that in their hotels and in relation to the Dublin and provincial services, as Senator Russell says&mdash;more so on the provincial services and on the hotel side.  They are making their way in a vigorous commercial manner and this is the proper criteria to apply once the community faces up to the responsibility. The accounts of CIE for the current year show this quite clearly and we are saying here that on behalf of the people we are allocating this amount of money to the rail system. We are saying that this is to keep the rail system going as a community obligation, but as far as the rest are concerned CIE are paying their way. This is the only approach in this age.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the reception given to the Bill and I welcome the various points of view that were made.  Because of the fact that the Seanad do not get the opportunity of having a debate on Estimates as happens in the Dáil, some of the points of view raised might be more appropriate to an Estimate debate but they were interesting and helpful and I will have a note taken of them.

      <P>Before I call on speakers, it might help the House if I point out what the procedure will be.  Motion No. 5 has been formally moved by Senator Ó Maoláin.  I shall call, firstly, on the Minister to make an explanatory speech on behalf of the Government.  Following that, amendment No. 1 will be moved by Senator Miss Bourke.  The seconder of that motion is at liberty to speak at that point or to reserve the speech until later.  No further amendments will be moved but it is in order for all speakers, including the Minister, to refer to all the amendments of which notice has been given.  At the conclusion of the debate amendment No. 1 will be put to the House.  Following this, the further amendments will be put before the House in succession and finally the substantive motion, either amended or unamended, will be put to the House.

      <P>The Radio Telefís Éireann programme mentioned in the motion suggested that unlicensed moneylending, backed by strong-arm tactics, existed on a substantial scale in the Dublin area.  The Radio Telefís Éireann Authority subsequently stated that the programme was authentic and did not present a distorted or exaggerated picture of the social problems of illegal moneylending in Dublin.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Minister for Justice stated in Dáil Éireann on the 26th November, 1969, in answer to questions, as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The allegation that strong-arm methods are being used by unlicensed moneylenders is, in the opinion of the Garda Síochána, without any foundation in fact.</P>
      <P>(2)  While the Gardaí know that some unlicensed moneylenders operate, their number or scale of operations is nothing like that suggested by the programme.</P>
      <P>(3)  The statements purporting to be confessions by moneylenders about moneylending and strong-arm methods can be dismissed as wholly valueless.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said on the 2nd December, 1969, in Dáil Éireann, the Government, because of this conflict, decided that a judicial inquiry ought to be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the passing of this motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it is the intention to appoint a Tribunal of Inquiry pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  The tribunal, consisting of three members of the judiciary, will have the powers of the High Court in enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath and in compelling the production of documents.  The proceedings will be public unless in the opinion of the tribunal it is expedient in the public interest to bar the public for reasons connected with the inquiry regarding <Col N="623" /> the nature of the evidence to be given.</P>
    <P>The motion which has just been moved by the Leader of the House sets out the definite matters of public importance into which it is proposed that the tribunal should inquire&mdash;in other words, the tribunal's terms of reference.  They are before the House for discussion and I do not wish to say anything about them at this stage except to make the point that while the Taoiseach and I are satisfied that the original terms were drawn in such a way as not to preclude the tribunal from considering the standard of care required of a journalist in his work, the Taoiseach last night, in allaying the fears which were expressed in Dáil Éireann, saw virtue in accepting, with minor modifications, Deputy Cosgrave's amendment which specifically mentioned &ldquo;reasonable journalistic care&rdquo;.  No one can now be under any misapprehension about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraphs (1) and (2) and substitute:</P>
      <P>(1)  The authenticity of the recent television programme on illegal moneylending, that is to say, that part of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; feature broadcast on television by Radio Telefís Éireann on the 11th November, 1969, which related to unlicensed moneylenders and their activities; and, in particular, the adequacy of the information on which the programme as journalism was based and whether or not the statements, comments and implications of the programme as to the number of unlicensed moneylenders operating in the city and county of Dublin and the scope of their operations, and the use of violence, or threats of violence, to secure repayments of moneys illegally lent, amount to a correct and fair representation of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment primarily as a lawyer and as an independent Senator without any party political affiliations. I listened last night to the extent that <Col N="624" /> anyone can listen to a six hour debate in the Dáil.  I think I was there as faithfully as anybody else.  There was a great deal of political comment in what was voiced there and I think insufficient attention was placed on what I would like the Seanad to focus on, the terms of reference of this Inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we advert to the fact that as a Parliament we are setting the basis of jurisdiction of a judicial inquiry and that the judicial inquiry will confine itself within those terms and will not look beyond them.  I speak principally as a lawyer and as such I welcome this motion to set up the inquiry.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has seen fit to try to clear up a great deal of public disquiet on the matter and I think that this can best be done by the method of a judicial inquiry with the power of obtaining sworn evidence. I welcome it but I want us to be very precise about the terms of reference which we give as the Parliament of this nation to this judicial inquiry so that it concentrates on the problem and so that it takes the matters into account that we wish it to take into account in order to produce findings that would best justify setting up such an inquiry.  The reason I want to concentrate on the terms of reference is because from my admittedly fairly limited and yet in an academic way fairly extensive experience of judicial inquiries the method by which they approach their job is to examine with legalistic care the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>If I might refer to the official motion the terms of reference are set down at points 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Points 1 and 2 are terms of reference which refer to substantive matters.  The first of those refers to the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of this &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme. The second refers to</P>
    <P>The authenticity of the programme and, in particular, the adequacy of the information on which the programme was based, and whether or not the statements, comments and implications of the programme as to the number of unlicensed moneylenders operating in the city and county of Dublin and the scope of <Col N="625" /> their operations, and the use of violence, or threats of violence, to secure repayments of moneys illegally lent, amounted to a correct and fair representation of the facts.</P>
    <P>These are two different subject matters and they are listed in order 1 and 2. It is my experience of judicial tribunals, and I think it is the way in which they would approach this, that they will examine the first term of reference put to them and they will look to the subject matter of the first point.  I should like the House to look with me at this first point because it is with the first point here that I take grave issue.</P>
    <P>My amendment makes a very necessary modification.  It takes out what I think is the essential danger of the terms of reference under section 1, the terms of reference which refer to the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of the recent television programme, the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, on the particular date in November.  My contention is that it would be a dangerous precedent for this Parliament to set as terms of reference to a judicial inquiry, an isolated television programme, which forms part of a series of a current affairs type programme on social issues, on particular news issues in this country.  Not only would it be a dangerous precedent but I submit very forcefully that the proper person to take responsibility for what is in section 1, for the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of this isolated television programme, is the independent television authority.</P>
    <P>This authority are responsible for the internal procedural mechanisms of a television programme.  They have jurisdiction under the Broadcasting Act.  There is a chain of responsibility to the Director General, from the executive arm of the independent authority down to the heads of the various divisions. In the case of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, it would be the head of the news division.  He could have instituted an inquiry or the Director General could have sent a memo to do so. This is a matter which is their responsibility, which is within their terms of reference.  If we allow this motion to <Col N="626" /> go forward unamended we shall be asking a judicial inquiry, a sworn inquiry, to look into a single television programme in isolation and to take sworn evidence on it and to judge it.</P>
    <P>The Minister this evening made reference to the standard to be applied. I understand there is an amendment and that I am entitled to speak on this amendment in proposing my own amendment.  Again it goes only to the second part only of this official statement&mdash;you will note in paragraph 2 and adds to it the words &ldquo;and whether or not the statements, comments and implications,&rdquo; reflected reasonable journalistic care on the part of those responsible for the programme.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 1, which I think is the dangerous one, we are giving the judicial tribunal the duty of inquiring into the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation, the procedural elements, of a single television programme in isolation.  We are also not setting that it be a journalistic standard of care but that it be presumably, possibly require the judicial standard of care relating to the burden of proof, in other words no programme ought to be produced unless there was proof of its truth beyond reasonable doubt or whatever the judicial standard might be.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>As I said I listened to the debate in the Dáil yesterday.  I think there were some references to this in some of the speeches but not to the specific wording and to how terribly important this wording is because the judges who will sit on this inquiry live by words.  It is their function as judges to examine with extreme care the various points of reference.  They will confine themselves in a rather, narrow, legalistic way because that is how the balance of judicial independence is maintained in this country.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as I said, the danger is then that the tribunal will look at the two paragraphs one after the other. In the amendment that I have put forward, if looked at in conjunction with the formal motion, it will be seen that what I have done in fact is only to delete the first two lines of the first paragraph, to begin with the first words of the second paragraph, in other words, it would require the <Col N="627" /> tribunal from the very beginning to inquire into the authenticity of the particular programme and in particular the adequacy of the information on which the programme was based in the light of whether there is a social evil of moneylending in this country.</P>
    <P>The reason I do this is because if that is the term of reference we should give this judicial committee they will look at the authenticity of the programme, and I think it is fair they should, because that has been part of the conflict, but they will do so in the light of and in the context of the existence or non-existence of the social evil of moneylending.  The inquiry will proceed on two grounds, on the ground, first of all, whether a fair standard of journalism was maintained by this team in their probe into what is described as a possible social evil in Dublin.  That will be the standard of care required of them.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the judicial inquiry can from the beginning take into account what I think is one of the innate factors in this, that the programme must be judged in the context straight away of whether or not there was adequate information for it or whether it was a fabrication, a fiction and a valueless programme.  Under the existing terms of reference I submit this may not happen.  What will happen is that the narrow procedural terms in section 1 which are properly the business of the independent authority, for which they ought to be accountable, will be inquired into by a sworn inquiry and then they will inquire into the substantive issue of whether there was adequate information about illegal moneylending in the country.</P>
    <P>This is the position which gives me grave concern as a lawyer for two reasons.  The first reason is because we are setting a precedent for possible future inquiries of this nature into isolated television programmes and anybody who has read the account of the debate in the Dáil yesterday will know, and I reiterate here, that there is a possibility under the Broadcasting Act for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make known in writing his disapproval of a programme <Col N="628" /> and there are adequate checks and adequate controls within that Act.  If we set this dangerous precedent of allowing a television programme to be examined in its procedural aspects I do not think any journalistic programme compiled with a shortage of time, with the type of materials and the type of projection they wish to put forward, can stand up to a cold, judicial inquiry at a judicial standard.  I do not think that is possible.  That is not the standard which ought to be required. That is one of the reasons why as a lawyer I cannot accept the terms of reference of this motion, although I accept the purpose behind the motion.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that even if it is unlikely that a problem like this would arise again, that there would be another conflict of this nature and the necessity for a judicial inquiry, I hope this will be rare, a far greater evil is contained in giving the terms of reference we seem prepared to give by this motion, unless this amendment is accepted, because of the shadow this will cast over any independent investigation by a team in the future in this country.  I do not even mean just the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme in question but that this type of programme will be done under the shadow of the threat of the possibility that we, the Parliament of the country, will set up a judicial inquiry into the procedural aspects of this particular isolated programme for which in fact the true blame or the true responsibility lies with the independent television authority for that particular item.</P>
    <P>I do not want to use emotive terms like witch hunting, but we are using too broad terms here and I can see a great danger for the future of television in this country.  As a young person going to continue to live here, I see it as a possible danger to freedom of expression in this country.  I have a number of contemporaries from college days who have taken jobs&mdash;I think a number of graduates did go into television&mdash;in Radio/Telefís Éireann, and I cannot see them continuing to work there under the threat of this type of background censorship, this shadow of a threat of a judicial inquiry into the actual mechanisms of an individual <Col N="629" /> programme.  It is this point that is very important.  It is not a political point, it is a legal point on the terms of reference that we are prepared to give to this inquiry.</P>
    <P>As regards the wording of the amendment I have submitted, in the light of the fact that I understand that Senator Ó Maoláin is going to move the amendment that was accepted last night, I would be prepared to delete the words &ldquo;as journalism&rdquo; in the sixth line of the amendment.  In fact these would not be necessary if that amendment were carried.</P>
    <P>I still say&mdash;to sum up again as I do not want to go on too long&mdash;that the point I am making is that we are setting legal terms of reference for a judicial inquiry and that the substantial terms of reference (1) and (2) will be taken in that order, and that the first term of reference is one that I would not lay down for a judicial inquiry in this country, because if we do we are then negating one of the basic principles of freedom of expression and by-passing the independent television authority set up to deal with domestic matters such as the way in which a particular programme was organised, produced, planned, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the amendment which I have put forward will allow the judicial inquiry to focus on what I think are the proper terms of reference without interfering in any way with the subject of this motion to set up an inquiry.  The inquiry will look into basic fundamentals.  It will look into the authenticity of the recent television programme.  Authenticity is a very wide word.  The judges will look at this in sufficient depth.  They will have the right to films, tapes, transcripts, <i>et cetera</i>, and to take sworn evidence.  Secondly, they will look in particular at the adequacy of the information on which this programme was based.  In other words, they will take into account straight away, as part of the terms of reference, the vital element which cannot be ruled out of this inquiry as to whether there was a basis for it, whether there was a social evil of illegal moneylending on a fairly wide scale in the city and county of Dublin. <Col N="630" /> Therefore I beg leave to propose this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was one of those who before the announcement was made of the proposal to set up a tribunal urged that there should be an inquiry into this matter, and I did so on the ground that it seemed to me that the stands taken by the Government as represented by statements of the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach and some other Ministers, on the one hand, and the statement from the Telefís Éireann Authority on the other, simply could not be reconciled, and that the gulf between the two points of view was far too wide for anyone to attempt to reconcile.  For that reason I am glad that it has been decided that this matter should be the subject of an inquiry.  I think that there might be legitimate differences of opinion as to the particular type of inquiry which would be most suited to deal with this particular problem.</P>
      <P>While I was in favour, and still am in favour, of the idea of an inquiry, so far as I am concerned I regard the terms of reference suggested as being quite unacceptable.  Senator Bourke has moved an amendment and she has, as she made it quite clear herself, addressed herself to this problem as an independent Member of this House, as a lawyer and not as a politician.  I must say that the case which she made for the amendment appeals to me very strongly.  I think she made a very strong case as to why the terms of reference as proposed by the Government should be regarded as not being acceptable.  I agree with the reasons which she gave, some of which I had intended to refer to and will refer to later, but I think that this matter must be considered not merely from the standpoint of a lawyer but it must be considered from the general point of view of what we want to achieve by the setting up of this tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I regard the terms of reference as being unacceptable.  I make no apology for saying this, that it seems to me that the terms of reference <Col N="631" /> as proposed put one side of the two sides involved in this argument in the dark from the very beginning. I think that Senator Bourke is entirely correct in stressing the point that when a judicial inquiry of this nature is established the judges who form the inquiry will look very carefully at the terms of reference that they are given.  That is their job, and Senator Bourke certainly, I am quite sure, did not intend to be in any way critical of the judges&mdash;we do not know who they will be&mdash;who will form this inquiry, when she referred to a judicial inquiry looking at the terms of inquiry in a narrow legalistic way.</P>
    <P>I believe that that is what they will do, and I do not intend any criticism when I say that.  That is their job. If we give terms of reference from this Parliament to the judicial tribunal set up, the first thing they must do is to look very carefully at every word in every paragraph of the terms of reference we give to them.  As Senator Bourke has pointed out, the first paragraph in this proposal from the Government is concerned with matters which are largely irrelevant to the main issue in dispute as between the Government on the one hand and the RTE Authority on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving my view and the Minister will have to take it and listen to it, whether he accepts it or not.  To my mind, the subject matter of the first paragraph as proposed by the Government is entirely irrelevant to the main issue of the dispute.  Surely the question of the authenticity of this programme is the main point of dispute between the Government and the television authority. The tribunal should be concerned to inquire into that.  They should be put into a position where they could examine and report broadly on whether the Government or the television authority are right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposed terms of reference, there is no doubt that the searchlight is being put on the television authority.  They will be put under the microscope, but there is no suggestion <Col N="632" /> of an inquiry into the statements made by the various Government Ministers and by the Taoiseach himself.  If there is any technical, procedural or Constitutional difficulty about having the statements of Members of Parliament reviewed by an outside body, such difficulty could be overcome.  Perhaps such difficulties exist.  I suggest that if they do exist the way to deal with them is to set up a Select Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into the statements, allegations or assertions made by the Ministers for Justice, Agriculture and Local Government and by the Taoiseach in reference to this particular matter.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference will not permit the tribunal to consider the statements made on behalf of the Government. These statements brought about this dispute between the Government and the television authority.  I am not suggesting that the Government, or whoever drafted these proposals, were being unfair deliberately, but the final result is that a situation has emerged where certain statements were made on behalf of the Government and other statements were made on behalf of the television authority.  One aspect of that situation will be inquired into, but only one.  Even though it may be a political point, it is relevant to point out that the question of the setting up of a tribunal was considered by the Government&mdash;and certainly by the Minister for Justice, judging by his remarks&mdash; if people continued to &ldquo;defend the indefensible&rdquo;, as the Minister for Justice said.</P>
    <P>It appears to me from the way in which the terms of reference are worded that they were drawn up with the idea in mind that the indefensible was being defended and that this tribunal would show that that would not be allowed by the Government.  Under the proposals in this notice of motion the minds of the members of the tribunal are to be directed to the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of this particular programme.</P>
    <P>I believe those matters are totally irrelevant, but the Minister for Transport and Power does not accept that Surely he will accept the word of the Taoiseach himself because when the <Col N="633" /> Taoiseach intervened in the discussion in the Dáil he said that he did not see the programme but he gathered &ldquo;that this programme reached a very high technical level and that it was much praised for that&rdquo;.  This is a programme which, according to the belief of the Taoiseach himself, reached a very high technical level.  We will waste the time of three highly paid judges to inquire into the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the Minister's view.  I am concerned about the taxpayers' money.  I am concerned with the precise wording of the terms of reference which will be given to the tribunal.  Two suggestions have been made about these matters.  It was not sufficient under the terms of reference for the tribunal to have a general look at what took place in the general arrangement or planning of the programme. They must look at it closely under each of these various headings of planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of the programme.</P>
      <P>As Senator Bourke pointed out, these are matters which are the responsibility of the television authority. They are not matters which are the direct responsibility of any of the employees of that authority concerned with the particular production into which the tribunal is inquiring.  They are certainly not matters which relate to the main point at issue.  The main point at issue is the question of the authenticity of the programme.</P>
      <P>A number of statements were made in the course of discussions which took place in the Dáil before the motion to set up the tribunal was brought in.  The tribunal should be entitled and encouraged to inquire into those various statements.  The essential thing is&mdash;and this is where the real cleavage between the Government and the authority occurred&mdash; whether the programme was authentic. The terms of reference as proposed in the notice of motion give adequate authority to the tribunal to inquire into that question.</P>

      <Col N="634" /> Senator Bourke makes it quite clear that this is one of the principal matters that should be inquired into. There will be general agreement that that is the case.  The tribunal should also be entitled to inquire into whether the characters and scenes portrayed in this particular programme were fictitious, because the Taoiseach, referring to this matter in the Dáil, said that all the controversy could have been avoided if RTE had said at the outset of the programme that the characters and scenes to be portrayed were fictitious.  To put it at its mildest, there is a suggestion&mdash;I would imagine it is not unfair to describe it as an allegation&mdash;that the characters and scenes were, in fact, fictitious.  That is a charge made against the programme.  Surely the tribunal should be encouraged to state their views with regard to the statement of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The minds of the tribunal should be directed to whether those appearing on the programme were told what to say when they appeared on the programme. I read very carefully more than once the references made by the Minister for Justice to this particular matter.  While it seemed to me that the references made by the Minister for Justice implied that the participants in the programme said what they said because they were paid for saying it, I could see from the way in which the particular references were phrased by the Minister for Justice that that interpretation might be incorrect.  In his Parliamentary reply on this matter, the Minister for Justice referred to statements given to the gardaí.  He said statements given to the gardaí set out details of the way the people concerned were approached and how they were told they would be paid to say these things.</P>

      <P>The reason I avoided doing this was that I was not sure if it was proper to refer by reference to the proceedings of the other House.  At column 1265 of the Official Report dated 19th November, 1969, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> Statements given to the gardaí set out details of the way the people concerned were approached and of how they were told they would be paid to say these things.</P>
    <P>When I read that I took it that it was a suggestion that there was a definite implication in that that these people were being paid to say what those in charge of the programme wanted them to say, but I could see it was possible that the other interpretation was there; that all the Minister intended to say was that these people were told if they appeared on the programme and told their stories without trying to influence them they would be paid for doing that.  This was all right until taken in the context of an interruption by the Minister for Agriculture, recorded at column 1267 of the Official Report dated 19th November, 1969, when a Deputy asked the following question:</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not aware that it is perfectly normal journalistic practice in any medium&mdash;television, press or other&mdash;to pay people for information which one gets from them or services they render?</P>
    <P>Mr. Blaney: One does not tell them what to say.</P>
    <P>Is it not clear that that statement taken in conjunction with the statement of the Minister for Justice of how they were told they would be paid to say these things that the interpretation which the Minister for Agriculture put on it was that they were being told what to say and were paid for saying it.  If we look at column 1268 of the same Dáil debate we see a reference by the Minister for Justice&mdash;I think it is only fair to him to read it out in its entirety:</P>
    <P>Mr. Moran: I have stated that these alleged moneylenders and so on who were produced for the public edification on this programme have stated that they were paid sums of up to £20 and also given drink for their performance.</P>
    <P>When this matter was raised further in the Dáil on 26th November, 1969, the Minister for Local Government <Col N="636" /> entered into the fray.  A Question was put down by a Deputy in which he asked if the Minister would withdraw the original character imputations which he made without qualification in respect of certain of the staff in RTE&mdash;in particular when he alleged that certain of the RTE staff had bribed people with money and free booze&mdash; and the Minister for Local Government stepped in and said &ldquo;It is established that they did&rdquo;.  Therefore, we have support for the theory that the charge being made is that these statements were obtained by free booze and that people were told what to say. As far as I am concerned I think the tribunal should be entitled to establish the basis of these charges and to investigate them fully.  If there is to be a tribunal people are entitled to know what inquiries were made by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Local Government, by the Minister for Agriculture, in addition to the Minister for Justice, to support these statements. I do not care whether they are called statements or charges&mdash;they are on the record.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the tribunal having the authority to quiz the gardaí as regards the statements they took and what steps they took but it is entirely wrong that the onus of proof in this matter, and particularly in the first paragraph of the terms of reference, should be thrown entirely on the RTE or those concerned with the preparation of the programme.  We should all recognise that there are certain standards which journalists should adhere to, and I am convinced that journalists in this country do so adhere.  They have certain definite obligations to the public but they have certain rights as well and we should be careful, particularly in the context of ensuring freedom of speech and freedom of expression, that the rights of journalists, whether on TV or on the papers, should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in the opening paragraph we have a suggestion in the terms of reference that the onus of proof should be put on those concerned with the particular programme in RTE.  Notwithstanding the later amendment which will be moved by Senator Ó Maoláin, this is not merely a question of the onus of proof in the context of the authenticity of journalistic standards.  It will be a question of the onus of proof in a court of law before a judicial tribunal: it will be a question of the legal onus of proof and that being done in the knowledge that <Col N="638" /> the Minister for Justice at the outset of his first reply in the Dáil when dealing with this matter referred to the difficulty of obtaining evidence and at columns 1263 to 1264 of the Dáil debates of the 19th November last when this matter was first raised the Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>It is, of course, well known that some unlicensed moneylending goes on, not only in Dublin but in other urban areas.  It is also well known to charitable organisations and social workers as well as to the Garda Síochána that it is invariably difficult and usually almost impossible to get evidence to support a prosecution.</P>
    <P>He then dealt with the difficulties but RTE will be put in the dock and they will be told under these terms of reference to establish by discharging proof before a judicial tribunal that the comments and implications of the programme as to the number of unlicensed moneylenders operating in the city and county of Dublin were authentic.</P>
    <P>They will be asked to prove that by proof that would be acceptable to judges sitting on a judicial tribunal notwithstanding the recorded words of the Minister that it is invariably difficult and usually almost impossible to get evidence to support a prosecution.  I am not happy about the terms of reference as proposed.  The amendment proposed by Senator Bourke and seconded by Senator Horgan would improve the position somewhat and if the Minister can indicate that that amendment will be acceptable to him and to the Government I would consider that the Seanad had achieved something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>However, I still would not be entirely happy about the terms of reference but if the Minister could give me any indication that the amendment might be accepted, I would be prepared to accept the position.  We must be very careful in framing the terms of reference.  We must recognise&mdash;Senator Nash will bear me out on this&mdash; that what will concern the tribunal will be the precise wording set out in the terms of reference and that there is no point in any of us saying that maybe this might be brought in under that or <Col N="639" /> anything else.  That will not happen. The judges sitting on the tribunal will analyse every word set out in the terms of reference.  That is their job and that is what they will be bound by.  When considering this motion we must consider the whole picture that is known &mdash;the different standpoints and the different views expressed by the Government on the one hand and by RTE on the other whether these terms of reference will enable the tribunal to decide adequately on the fundamental question involved.  I believe they will do that but it is a question of whether the programme was authentic but also as to whether the statements made in relation to the programme by the Taoiseach and by his colleagues in the Cabinet based on inquiries made and on the information available to them were sufficient to warrant these statements being made.  Those matters should be inquired into also.  The scale should be evenly balanced between the Government on the one hand and RTE on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator O'Higgins has said in that a tribunal cannot go outside the terms of reference and that is why if I were the young man who produced the programme I would be very upset if the terms of reference were not as wide as they are here.  Senator O'Higgins has asked what the inquiry proposes to achieve.  What it proposes to achieve is whether the programme was substantially and genuinely truthful in what it depicted, and (6) whether it depicted an accurate state of the affairs in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that there are some leeches&mdash;vampires&mdash;who live on the misfortune of their neighbours.  As the Garda authorities have said, there may be ten or 12 unlicensed moneylenders in Dublin but RTE have said that, perhaps, there are five or six hundred. It is a matter of the utmost importance when we have two Government bodies, RTE on the one side and the Garda authorities on the other side giving us such a completely different account that there should be the fullest possible investigation as to which is correct, as to whether either is correct or as to <Col N="640" /> whether the truth lies somewhere between the two.  These are matters of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>If the investigation be limited to the narrow word &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo;, the producer of this programme may find himself in a very embarrassing position.  I would find no fault whatever with the truthfulness of this programme even if actors were used instead of moneylenders, even if actors were used instead of borrowers, if the programme described things as they really are.  Likewise, I would find no fault with the producer of this programme if he went to an unfortunate woman who owed £5 to one of those unlicensed moneylenders, who feared to tell her story while she was still in the hands of this vampire and who could tell her story only if she were free of his clutches and got the £5 to pay him off.  I would find no fault with the producer of this programme if, in order to get somebody to tell his story, he had to meet him on a social occasion and stand him a few drinks. That does not in any way detract from the veracity of the programme if the programme be really truthful.  Because the judicial tribunal must have the widest powers to investigate, I would feel that the delimiting of the terms of inquiry would be most unfair to RTV on the one hand or to the Garda Síochana on the other hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  It seems to me from the speeches of Senator Bourke and Senator O'Higgins that they are starting off on the basis that there is something understand, something wrong with the production of this programme.  I do not suggest that for one moment.  The Government do not suggest it for one moment.  However, it is a matter of urgent public importance that it should be discovered whether this is the state of affairs in our capital city.  Are there up to 600 unlicensed moneylenders bleeding the unfortunate poor of this city?  Have they got strong-arm men who go so far as to break the limbs and bones of <Col N="641" /> people who refuse to pay, to set fire to their motor cars, perhaps to burn their houses if the occasion arose? Surely that is a matter of the utmost public importance?</P>
      <P>It is also a matter of the utmost public importance that if this programme is not true, if it is unfounded, if instead of having 500 or 600 moneylenders there are what one may expect anywhere, ten, 12 or 20 people without consciences, we should not endeavour to show that our body politic is dead and that our social conscience is dead and that the whole social community is being preyed upon by these leeches.  Surely that too is a matter of the utmost public importance?</P>
      <P>I feel that this word &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; is far too narrow.  The tribunal might find the programme was not within the strict definition of &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; simply because one person in the programme was an actor taking the place of a moneylender who could not be found or because one person in the programme was taking the place of some unfortunate woman who got herself into the hands of these people if the terms of reference were not wide.</P>
      <P>Surely it is a matter of the utmost public importance if unfortunate women have to hand over their children's allowance books and that these are held and not parted with, or if an unfortunate worker has to hand over his trade union card?  This is an imputation not only on the Garda Síochána but on the trade unions.  I doubt if any self-respecting trade union would permit a thing like this to happen. Surely a trade unionist who was caught in the clutches of such a vicious system could go and confidentially report to the secretary of his trade union what had happened to him and with the co-operation of the members help to put a stop to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know which story is true. I do not know whether the story of the Garda Síochána is true nor do I know whether the story of RTE is true but certainly this should be established because one can cry &ldquo;Wolf, Wolf&rdquo; too often until no one pays heed to it and some day when there is something really radically wrong that everyone fears to discuss when the truth is told it will not be believed. <Col N="642" /> If this presentation is correct and what RTE say is correct I would, as the producer of this programme, welcome this tribunal.  I would welcome this examination in the broadest possible terms.  I would welcome my right to produce before this tribunal, if I so desired, how I planned and prepared this programme, how I arranged it, how I produced it, how I presented it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was satisfied that that programme was correct and represented the true state of affairs and if I am confined to &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; only as a term of reference I cannot do any of these things.  This is a matter which has been stressed by Senator O'Higgins.  It has been mentioned by Senator Bourke I agree with them and it is because the word &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; would be so narrow that these other words are mentioned in paragraph 1. Both Senator O'Higgins and Senator Bourke know, as lawyers, that if one goes before any court on any simple issue, for instance if one was negligent in the driving of one's car and thereby caused injury to somebody in the statement of claim one cannot get off with just two lines.  The statement of claim will probably run to two or three pages, and the defence likewise, because the court cannot consider any matter that is not referred to and covered in some way either by the statement of claim or by the defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the terms of reference in this are made as narrow as is suggested here it would be grossly unfair to RTE. I see no reason why this defeatist attitude should be adopted.  I see no reason why it should be presupposed here in advance that RTE are wrong.  They have stated they are correct.  If so, we will welcome their proving it.  If they are correct there is something radically wrong elsewhere, in some other Government Department, and we will all welcome setting that right. There is no use papering over cracks or sweeping the dust under the carpet. Let it come out into the open.  If, on the other hand, that is not correct, let us have the courage to say: &ldquo;This was a wonderful presentation.  It was very emotive but it drew our attention to something which at the moment is <Col N="643" /> small but might grow&rdquo;.  That is the worst that can happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Bourke's suggestion that, because this is put as paragraph 1, it therefore will take precedence over anything else amazes me.  One might as well suggest that what is put down in paragraph 1 of the statement of claim or in paragraph 1 of a defence in court takes priority over paragraphs 2, 3, 4 or 5.  These are all terms of reference.  All the paragraphs are matters within whose limits the tribunal will consider before they start. These are the matters which either the Garda Siochána on the one hand or RTE on the other can produce evidence to show which side is correct.</P>
    <P>We come to paragraph 2 of the terms of reference, the authenticity of the programme and, in particular, the adequacy of the information on which the programme was based.  Perhaps a young man, through enthusiasm or otherwise, jumped to conclusions. Perhaps through inexperience, and through a high feeling of purpose he let his emotions run away with himself. If so, no grave harm has been done and no particular blemish would be on his character because he permitted himself to fall into such a trap. Everybody learns from experience and it is only through the enthusiasm, and sometimes the wild enthusiasm, of the young that any country can hope to progress.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the terms of reference&mdash;whether or not the statements, comments and implications of the programme as to the number of unlicensed moneylenders operating in the city and county of Dublin and the scope of their operations&mdash;is correct.  Surely that is a matter of the utmost fundamental importance.  It was suggested in the course of the programme that the law as it stands at the moment was not sufficient to enable the Garda Síochána to do their job.  Surely we want to know that and if it is not sufficient then each and every one of us in both Houses of Parliament here are failing in our duty if we do not give the Garda Síochána the requisite powers and if we do not put a stop to this abuse by moneylenders if it does exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> An inquiry into the scope of the operations of those people and the use of violence or threats of violence, to secure repayments of moneys illegally lent, whether that mounts to a correct and fair representation of the facts is a further term of reference.  Surely if this sort of violence exists in this city of ours we are getting well nigh to what is happening in Chicago and in the City of New York where you have protection gangs.  Is it possible?  I do not know, nobody knows and nobody will know until this inquiry is over but it is nearly time we knew.  If it does not exist it is also a matter of the utmost importance that radio programmes or television programmes should not be such as to show us as a sick society.</P>
    <P>Very many people will find fault with us when we do not deserve it. Surely we should not show that we ourselves in our body politics have a rampant disease of which we should be ashamed and with which we should be disgusted if that be not the case. That too is a matter of the utmost importance.  Therefore I feel that paragraph 2 is essential in those terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The third paragraph refers to &ldquo;the inquiries on behalf of Radio Telefís Éireann and the films, tapes, statements, scripts, records, and notes in their possession&rdquo;.  No tribunal could hope to come to an accurate decision on those matters without knowing also what were the inquiries made on behalf of Radio Telefís Éireann, without having access to the films, tapes, statements, scripts, records and notes.  Every lawyer knows that truth is a jewel of many facets and that any story can be distorted and twisted.  I am not saying that was done in this case.  I am not prejudging the case.  I am not suggesting, as has been done here, that RTE were wrong or that their statements were wrong.</P>
    <P>The fourth paragraph of the terms of reference states:</P>
    <P>The inquiries on behalf of the Garda Síochána, and the statements, taken by the Garda Síochána, which relate to the programme.</P>
    <P>Surely also it is a matter of the utmost importance as to whether the <Col N="645" /> Garda Síochána before they inform the Minister for Justice of their findings have made adequate inquiries, whether they had right down from the Chief Superintendent to the garda below him got files on those matters, whether their files were reliable, whether they were lazy about the matter, whether the statements they took were again statements of people who were afraid to tell the truth.  I cannot picture an illegal moneylender going to the Garda Síochána and making a statement: &ldquo;Mea culpa I have been wrong but please do not prosecute me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel if justice is to be done to everybody in this case whether to RTE, whether to the producer of the programme, whose expertise I admire, whose courage I admire if his story be true, if justice is to be done to him and to them and if justice also is to be done to the Garda Síochána I feel the terms of reference should be not less wide than they are here set out and to have them contracted in any manner would inevitably end in injustice being done to one or to the other to the public detriment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of the sentiments which underlay the words of Senator Nash, and like him I have formed no view of my own whatever on the outcome of this inquiry. I realise it would not be proper for me to express it if I had one, but I have got an open mind about it.  On the other hand, while I accept a great number of the criteria which he sets up as being proper ones in an inquiry of this kind, I am unhappy with the way these terms of reference are drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of things which are conspicuous in this regard.  This row is not a row between Radio Telefís Éireann and the Garda Síochána.  This row arose because of something which happened in Dáil Éireann.  It arose through a long, detailed and carefully prepared reply by the Minister for Justice to a question asked by Deputy Corish.  That is the reason why we are debating this motion this evening.  We are not debating anything which has arisen through anything said by the gardaí.  If you like, the information coming from the gardaí underlay what the Minister for Justice, and subsequently <Col N="646" /> the Taoiseach, may have said, but in fact the public look at this whole episode as the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; row.  If you were to ask the public who were the partisans or the protagonists in the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; row they would say, and they would be right, Radio Telefís Éireann on the one hand, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice on the other.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with this briefly and uncontentiously, as far as I can. It seems to me, and it has always seemed to me, even before I became active in politics, that the attitude of the Government towards Radio Telefís Éireann was over-cautious, to put it at its best.  It would be unfair of me to make any kind of wild allegations about inroads made on the right of free speech by the Government.  The Government have not been guilty of such a thing in a general way.  They have very often reacted truculently and in an unseemly manner to criticism both in and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas but I admit that that stops a good distance short of trying to suppress free speech.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that my remarks are not intended to underpin any such allegation.  The Government's attitude towards the Telefís Éireann Authority became very plain towards the end of 1966 during the row which was caused by the juxtaposition of a statement between the then Minister for Agriculture with a reply by the NFA.  In the Dáil in reply to a Question on this matter, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, said, as reported in Volume 224 at column 1045:</P>
    <P>Radio Telefís Éireann was set up by legislation as an instrument of public policy and as such is responsible to the Government.  The Government have overall responsibility for its conduct and especially the obligation to ensure that its programmes do not offend against the public interest or conflict with national policy as defined in legislation.</P>
    <P>I have to observe, as I have done before in print in this regard, that the wording of the Act passed through the Dáil and Seanad which set up the <Col N="647" /> Broadcasting Authority does not contain any of these propositions, nor does it contain any material from which they can be derived.  Radio Telefís Éireann is not an instrument of public policy.  You can describe it whatever way you like, but it is not anybody's instrument.  It may not be so defined or so described.  While I concede that the Government must have some power to make sure that it shall not put out things which are seditious or liable to cause disorder or to undermine public morals, it is entirely wrong to regard Radio Telefís Éireann as an instrument of public policy or as anybody's instrument.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to make more capital out of those words of Deputy Lemass than the words offer, it seems to me that they are a reflection of an attitude towards the Broadcasting Authority which has informed this Government since the authority was created.  The Government's reaction to everything the authority does seems to me to have been extremely sensitive&mdash; too sensitive.  We all know&mdash;there is no point in mincing words&mdash;of the terrific power of television.  I can well sympathise with the Government which feel that they are in danger of incurring unpopularity from public opinion because of a series of political programmes.  I am not asking the Government to go to the lengths to which the Tory Government in England went before 1964 when they allowed themselves to be pilloried by satirical programmes week in week out and which in the opinion of many observers in England largely contributed to their defeat.  The Conservative Government showed in those days heroic charity, to put it at the lowest.</P>

      <P>I am not expecting a Fianna Fáil Government to go to those extremes.  At the same time, I would say that this Government have shown undue sensitivity to television programmes, and this episode is only one such instance.  I will not worry the House over other instances, but this is of importance as the background when we come to look at these terms <Col N="648" /> of reference, and find that the people put in the dock, so to speak, are only one protagonist, namely, the people who made the programme.</P>
      <P>I have formed no opinion as to whether the programme is genuine or bogus, but I do observe that the only people upon whom judgment of genuineness or bogusness can be passed in relation to this are the people who made the programme.  The other side, who are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice who spoke in unfriendly terms about the television programme &mdash;and other Members of the Government did likewise&mdash;are not placed in the dock and the judicial tribunal are not being asked to express any view on the propriety or seemliness of their reaction.  That is something that I believe to be wrong.</P>
      <P>I can entirely understand that when these terms of reference were being drafted care was taken to avoid their being in the dock also.  This is natural, but it is equally natural that the Opposition should regard it as unsatisfactory. If the decision of this tribunal goes against Telefís Éireann the people who will get the black eye, so to speak, are the people who made this programme.  If the decision goes in favour of Telefís Éireann, undoubtedly there will be an implicit condemnation of the Government but what we want is an explicit condemnation of the reaction which they produced to this television feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say, in case it should be afterwards said that it is no part of the judicial tribunal's business to pass any comment on the Government, that although it is right that the Constitution protects with absolute privilege from civil or criminal proceedings anything said in either House, that does not amount to saying that words said in either House are immune from comment at the hands of the tribunal.  It does mean that the only thing from which Deputies and Senators are protected is individual proceedings in the courts, civil and criminal.  There is no protection from comment, and we all know that they are commented on very much in newspapers and by individuals. They are equally not protected from comment by a judicial tribunal. <Col N="649" /> I hope that the Government were not under the impression that it would have been for some constitutional reason improper to subject their own behaviour to judicial examination.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I want to say is a couple of words in relation to the amendment which was put down yesterday by Deputy Cosgrave and which the Government were good enough to accept in regard to the standard of journalistic care.  I have only been able to see the newspaper reports of the debate.  I did not hear the debate, and it may be that the newspaper report is inadequate, but to make it clear I should like to emphasise that the purpose of the amendment was to make sure that if some trivial inaccuracy were found in fact underlying the making of that programme that inaccuracy would not be sufficient to condemn out of hand those who made it.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash spoke of what he had in mind as a gross inaccuracy, that instead perhaps of 500 unlicensed moneylenders we should discover that there were ten, 15 or 20.  That would be a gross enough discrepancy to warrant an unfavourable conclusion being drawn in regard to this programme, but suppose that the discrepancy were nothing like of that order&mdash;suppose it turned out that there were perhaps 350 unlicensed&mdash;of course that would reflect inaccuracy in the programme but it does not seem to be an inaccuracy substantial enough to warrant the programme's good faith being impugned or the impugning of the journalistic care which went into its making. That is the reason for that amendment, and I hope that it is understood by the Government and the spirit behind it accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the setting up of this tribunal.  I think that it is extremely important that we should have somebody to investigate the authenticity of the programme in question and to adjudicate between the clash of opinion on the number of unlicensed moneylenders in Dublin&mdash;between the Garda authorities and the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; investigators supported by the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> We have just had in Senator Kelly's contribution one demonstration of why it is so important to have this tribunal. He has gone back to the old allegation about the situation arising when there was a juxtaposition of an announcement by the Minister for Agriculture and a press release from the National Farmers Association on a Radio Telefís Éireann news bulletin.  This allegation will be all the time hanging in the air because there was no investigation at the time and we do not know what exactly happened.  There is a very distinct possibility that that dispute arose quite simply because of some administrative inefficiency or professional inexperience in the news room in Radio Telefís Éireann.  I do not know the facts, but it is a possibility. But as long as it is still a matter which is uninvestigated allegations of ministerial interference can remain.  Happily this dispute regarding the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on unlicensed moneylending will not be left hanging in the air because on this matter we will have the report of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it quite clear that I do not see the setting up of this tribunal as in any way an attack on the freedom of the Press or as a witch-hunt on any individuals in Radio Telefís Éireann.  That was a point of view expressed during the Dáil debate on the matter and repeated here, I think, by Senator O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>If I could refer to my own experience as a young journalist in the North of England, all the time the first thing that I was aware of and that in my training the first thing that was made clear to me by my editor was that you always had to be prepared for the possibility that your words might land you in court.  It seems to me that any journalist conscious of his position as a journalist and of his responsibility is always aware that at some stage some part of his work may bring him before a court or an inquiry of some kind or other.</P>
    <P>I do not see that the setting-up of this tribunal is any new form of threat to a professional journalist.  Neither do I feel it is witch-hunt of any kind.  The people involved in the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme <Col N="651" /> have been supported by their employers, the RTE Authority.  Employees and employer stand firm on this issue.  In these circumstances it is not possible to say that there is any threat to the position of the members of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team.</P>
    <P>This issue has become a big one. There was a long debate in the Dáil last night and some emotional words have been used here.  I should like to put the matter into perspective by quoting from a book which was referred to in the Dáil debate last night and has been constantly in the minds of people when discussing matters affecting RTE.  It is the book <i>Sit Down and Be Counted.</i>  At page 367 it reads:</P>
    <P>It well may be that most Governments like most people overestimate or misunderstand the effects of this media on the public mind.  Professional broadcasters enjoy no particular privilege in this matter.  They are as likely to be wrong as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that Deputies and Senators are as likely to be wrong as anybody else.  This matter has become something of a storm in a teacup.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>It reads:</P>
      <P>Having said these necessary things, one might reasonably ask whether an omnibus power of prohibition on broadcasting any particular matter or matters of a particular class is a wise and prudent power to give to a Minister of State in this vital area of public information.</P>
      <P>This is quite another matter referring to the power in the Broadcasting Act. I am talking about the general context in which the issue before us arises.  It arises in an area of fallible human behaviour. A discussion of the television and broadcasting Acts is another matter.  We must look at this matter in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Miss Bourke invited me to look ahead in the book.  She also invited <Col N="652" /> us to look into the future and suggested that the setting up of this tribunal now might be a precedent for the future and that young graduates might not be prepared to work in a situation where they felt under the threat of a judicial tribunal.</P>
    <P>I should now like to comment on this.  This type of situation will arise again.  One of the jobs of television is to do depth reporting on social problems. In these circumstances that sort of investigation is never popular and I support Senator Bourke in saying that disputed issues will arise.</P>
    <P>They will arise in relation to RTE rather than to the newspapers because RTE has more money at its disposal than the newspapers.  One of the problems of depth reporting on social problems is that one may face the possibility of a court case.  Another possible expense is that a newspaper has to put a substantial number of its staff working on the particular issue for a period of time.  Such staff would not then be available for routine work.  A newspaper running on a tight economic budget might not be able to do this very frequently but RTE is in a position to do it, so the problems of hackles raised by this type of depth reporting is more likely to arise with the television authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to deal specically with Senator Bourke's amendment when I have tried to put the matter into general perspective.  In this situation, when disputes are likely to arise between RTE and officialdom, we must also remember that ordinary private individuals may be aggrieved by interference in their privacy or by comment to which they have little opportunity of replying.  This arises in the newspaper world as well as in the area of television.  Members of the public may feel they are being excluded from correspondence in a newspaper, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to look to the future, the Government should consider setting up a press council which could adjudicate on matters of this kind. We must have this investigation now <Col N="653" /> on this particular issue.  Looking to the future, to overcome the sort of problem raised by Senator Miss Bourke I would suggest that a press council would provide an answer.  As Senator Miss Bourke will know, a press council is part of the establishment in Britain.  It is operated there with the full co-operation of the newspaper proprietors.  We could possibly have a body of this kind here and the initiative for it could come from voluntary co-operation between RTE and the newspapers.  As far as I know, the Dublin Branch of the NUJ favours setting up a press council.  The Government could perhaps consider setting it up if voluntary effort is not forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the setting up of this tribunal as a means of dealing with this specific matter immediately. I suggest that a press council could be a useful way of dealing with this sort of dispute in the future.  In the Dáil some contributors brought the whole question of communications generally into the discussion and said that they thought this was a very important area to discuss.  I am tempted to agree with this.  A press council, apart from being there to look into matters of professional integrity and standards, could look into questions of advertising and newspaper financing and the financing of communications media generally. It could be an extremely valuable part of our democracy.  I hope it will not become too much of a hobby-horse of mine&mdash;I raised this point on the Appropriation Bill debate.  It might be a more economic way of dealing with situations like the one before us.  I looked back to the last judicial tribunal set up in 1967 to report on the death of Liam O'Mahony.  That tribunal cost £13,000.  Such a figure might keep a press council going for a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When looking into the question of the last judicial tribunal, I was interested <Col N="654" /> at the way in which the members of that tribunal worked and the way in which they formulated their report.  I am not a lawyer and I do not want to take on the many lawyers here, but it has been my experience that whenever anybody says &ldquo;Speaking as a lawyer&rdquo; or &ldquo;Speaking as a doctor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Speaking as a specialist&rdquo; one becomes very suspicious that they are trying to add a bit of infallibility to what they have to say.</P>
    <P>My reading of the tribunal report on the death of Liam O'Mahony would lead me to doubt one of the main arguments Senator Miss Bourke used in proposing her amendment.  This is the argument that the tribunal will stick closely to the wording of the terms of reference, parse and analyse them and hang on to every word.  As I understand it, and I may be wrong, in the previous tribunal the questions which the members examined were questions which they raised at the end of the report.  After they had heard the evidence and listened to counsel they then raised the questions they thought should be clarified and they concentrated on reporting on the facts of the situation&mdash;not on analysis of the words.</P>
    <P>I may be stumbling around on a legal point here but I feel that the members of the tribunal may take a pretty open view of their work.  In this case I maintain they are there to examine the facts and it seems to me from reading the previous tribunal report that this is quite different from the form of procedure in the normal court of law.</P>

      <P>If I could move on to some of the other points raised by Senators Bourke and O'Higgins, in the course of their contributions, they <Col N="655" /> spoke about why this tribunal had been set up and they referred to the public disquiet.  This was the actual phrase used by Deputy Cosgrave who was the first person to call for the setting up of this tribunal.  At column 1858, volume 242, of the Official Report dated 26th November, 1969, Deputy Cosgrave called for the setting up, or at least asked the Minister for Justice &ldquo;in order to allay public uneasiness he will consider holding a full public inquiry into the whole matter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest that some of the public uneasiness has arisen because of the disclosures or allegations in the Dáil &mdash;whether true or false&mdash;by the Minister for Justice that some people who took part in the programme were paid substantial sums, given money and so on.  It appears to me that some public unease has arisen because of these allegations.  The allegations refer to the planning, preparation, arranging and production of the programme and the public unease must focus to some extent on these matters.  There are obviously other matters on which public unease might be focussed but I do not feel that examination of this aspect of the allegations about the preparation of the programme can be avoided if the tribunal are to allay public unease.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Bourke with an open mind but this is one point on which I do not follow her reasoning.  There is public disquiet here and it should be investigated.  I approve of the setting up of this tribunal because once there is a point in dispute the matter must be resolved and not be allowed to hang on as yet another matter to be trotted out in some mysterious way at by-elections. My suggestion is that in dealing with these matters we could in future save ourselves trouble and expense by the establishment of a press council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern was to raise some points regarding the amendment before us and to suggest there is genuine public unease about these allegations, about the giving of drink and payment to participants in the programme.  There also is public unease about the preparation and arrangement of the programme, <Col N="656" /> and for that reason I support the terms of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this step has been taken to set up this tribunal in an attempt to try to get to the root of this rather unedifying affair.  We should be grateful to Senator Bourke for putting forward her amendment in which she has raised a point which was not apparently noticed in the other House.  Having said that, I do not know how much further I can go.  The important thing is the authenticity of the programme and what we really want to know is the extent to which the material in that programme gave a true picture of the situation in the country.  This is very much more important than the machinery of RTE for presenting the programme but I am not convinced that the planning and the arrangements used to acquire the information are entirely without interest.</P>
      <P>Senator Keery mentioned one point, which I think is a material one, which leads me to think that this aspect of the matter should be inquired into also.  If this tribunal inquire into the authenticity of the programme and find, for instance, that it was substantially wrong, then this situation may have arisen in either of two different ways. The machinery and the arrangements for getting the information and presenting it may have been quite satisfactory but the people who were questioned may have been telling lies.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there may have been some fault in this machinery and if we are to get to the root of the matter we must really inquire into both aspects.  A fault in the machinery could easily arise through some defect which had crept in and to which RTE might be glad to have their attention drawn.  On the other hand, if the arrangements were all right&mdash;and I think Senator Nash was quite correct in making this point&mdash;then surely nobody would be more glad to hear this than RTE, and it would reassure the public in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not greatly impressed by the argument that the precedent of a tribunal will so frighten RTE that we will never get a good production from <Col N="657" /> them again on a matter of public interest.  We should not be afraid to look at RTE or any other State-sponsored body at any time that it appears to be desirable that we should do so.</P>
    <P>I say this with full acknowledgment of the absolute need for freedom of the press, but RTE are in a rather special position.  Their position is different from that of a newspaper in many respects.  They are a State-sponsored body and have more money at their disposal.  If a newspaper prints a story every other newspaper will be interested in seeking that story and immediately one is telephoned within minutes after the story appearing to know if any other angle could be given to the story.  In so far as I know this does not happen and could not happen in RTE so that it is all the more necessary in an organisation such as that to have some sort of check from time to time if any question has been raised about the authenticity of the way in which it has been done so that the public may be reassured.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any real danger of the tribunal becoming so bogged down in the first paragraph of the terms of reference that they will never get down to the main point at issue, which is the authenticity of the programme.  Of course, I have no wide experience of legal tribunals and machinery involved in them but I have read a number of their reports and I have always been impressed by their pertinacity and by the way in which they go through everything they are asked to go through.  I am quite certain that this tribunal, whatever its constitution, will go right through these four paragraphs.  The only hope I have, and in this I agree with Senator Bourke, is that the procedure will not hold up the issue for too long.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should be grateful to Senator Bourke for having drawn our attention to these alternative terms of reference, but I am inclined to agree with Senator Keery that the motion as originally drawn is a reasonably satisfactory one.  I should not like to make up my mind until I have heard the debate right through but at the moment this is my reaction.</P>

      <P>Senator Kelly in discussing this tribunal was somewhat superficial in stating that this arose out of what might be described as a row involving the Minister for Justice in the Dáil and the allegations he made against RTE.  It must be remembered that from the time RTE was established there have been comments made about programmes produced by the station and on a number of occasions, if I recall rightly, RTE replied in various terms.  The reason why it is considered necessary to set up a tribunal on this occasion is because Radio Telefís Éireann on the one hand and the Garda Síochána on the other dug in their heels and RTE said quite flatly that the programme was authentic and that the facts presented were factual while the police said just as positively that they had investigated the facts and they found these not to be as stated in the programme.</P>
      <P>In a situation in which two public bodies make opposite statements about a matter of some public interest there is very little alternative for the Government but to set up some kind of tribunal and, while the Government had come to that decision themselves, the Opposition parties made it quite clear that in their opinion some kind of inquiry should be held.  Allegations have been made time and again in the Dáil and in this House that such and such a programme presented by RTE fell short of accuracy in some respect.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly was treading on dangerous ground when he suggested that the Members of the Dáil and certain members of the Government should be also involved in this inquiry in the sense that they should be criticised in certain circumstances.  While I agree with him that it would not be contrary to the Constitution, it would certainly be a rather dangerous precedent to suggest that comments by Members of the Oireachtas about RTE programmes or about any activity of public interest should be subjected to a public inquiry at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> In his speech, Senator O'Higgins mentioned the onus of proof in relation to this inquiry and he dwelled at some length on the basis that the onus on RTE would be to prove that they were innocent and that the facts as stated were correct.  That does not arise in this kind of inquiry.  There is an onus of proof in certain proceedings in the courts where a person is accused, and in certain civil proceedings when a plaintiff alleges that he has been injured in some way, but these proceedings are quite different.  This motion states that a tribunal will inquire into certain circumstances and there is no question of an onus of proof in this case.  There is no question of an accused in this case and it would be quite out of place and would certainly be giving a very wrong picture to talk in terms of an onus of proof in this kind of tribunal or inquiry.  Senator Bourke is concerned, as I understand it, that the inquiry should consider paragraph 1 of the terms of reference in isolation from the remainder of the terms of reference, and in particular from paragraph 2.  If I thought that there was any validity in this suggestion, then I would <Col N="660" /> be very concerned also and would indeed have to reconsider whether this was the best way of approaching this inquiry.</P>
