    <Title>RTE Programme: Establishment of Tribunal: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Ó Maoláin:</P>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    <P>1.  The planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation of the recent television programme on illegal moneylending, that is to say, that part of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; feature broadcast on television by Radio Telefís Éireann on the 11th November, 1969, which related to unlicensed moneylenders and their activities.</P>
    <P>2.  The authenticity of the programme and, in particular, the adequacy of the information on which the programme was based, and whether or not the statements, comments and implications of the programme as to the number of unlicensed moneylenders operating in the city and county of Dublin and the scope of their operations, and the use of violence, or threats of violence, to secure repayments of moneys illegally lent, amounted to a correct and fair representation of the facts.</P>
    <P>3.  The inquiries on behalf of Radio Telefís Éireann, and the films, tapes, statements, scripts, records, notes and other material <Col N="662" /> in their possession, which relate to the programme.</P>
    <P>4.  The inquiries on behalf of the Garda Síochána, and the statements, taken by the Garda Síochána, which relate to the programme.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete paragraphs (1) and (2) and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  The authenticity of the recent television programme on illegal moneylending, that is to say, that part of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; feature broadcast on television by Radio Telefís Éireann on the 11th November, 1969, which related to unlicensed moneylenders and their activities; and, in particular, the adequacy of the information on which the programme as journalism was based and whether or not the statements, comments and implications of the programme as to the number of unlicensed moneylenders operating in the city and county of Dublin and the scope of their operations, and the use of violence, or threats of violence to secure repayments of moneys illegally lent, amount to a correct and fair representation of the facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash; (Senator Mary T.W. Bourke.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was dealing with the amendment put down by Senator Bourke and with the apprehension which she expressed as to the way in which the paragraphs were set out.  Apparently her concern was that the inquiry might proceed to consider paragraph 1 first, to consider it in isolation and apparently make its findings on that paragraph before it went on to consider paragraph 2.  It seems to me this is not a realistic apprehension.  If I thought there was any validity in this point of view I certainly would consider it because I agree it is necessary to look at the picture as a whole; but undoubtedly the tribunal would look at the whole picture and would not make any findings on that particular paragraph without having considered all the paragraphs which form the basis for inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> I am not aware of any legal procedure or any legal precedent which would lead the tribunal to approach their problem in that way.  Although inquiries of this nature are not very frequent, nevertheless I think they would approach this problem in the same way as a judge would approach any proceedings which would come before him.  In normal proceedings there are usually many paragraphs in the statement of claim, or whichever way the legal proceedings are set out, and it certainly would be most unusual to consider any particular paragraph in isolation without having looked at the problem as a whole.</P>
    <P>It would be quite impractical to expect the tribunal to take one paragraph in isolation because it would mean, for instance, that the witnesses coming before them would be called and examined on paragraph 1 and a few days or a few weeks later they would be called back and examined on paragraph 2 and possibly on paragraphs 3 and 4.  From a practical point of view, it seems to me quite unrealistic to expect a tribunal to approach their problem in this way.</P>
    <P>The principal reason why the tribunal have been asked to consider this matter under various headings is that they will be asked to make findings under each one of the headings.  The importance of the four paragraphs is that there would have to be, in the normal course of events, a specific finding under each paragraph.  That, to my mind, is the reason for the paragraphs and not any question of approaching the problem under paragraph 1 first, making a finding, and then moving on to the second paragraph.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have paragraph 1 as it stands because it is not the important part of the inquiry.  Obviously the real gist of the inquiry is paragraph 2: paragraph 1 to my mind is merely the lead-in to the inquiry.  It is necessary that the tribunal should, first of all, have a look at the programme and having worked out the programme, having planned, prepared, arranged and produced it so as to get the background, to get the structure and context <Col N="664" /> of the programme, then to go on to consider whether it was authentic and to consider whether the information was sufficient to enable an authentic programme to be produced.</P>
    <P>But it is not merely desirable that the inquiry should first of all be familiar with the kind of programme it is but it is also only fair to the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; producers that they should get an idea of the context in which this programme was made.  It would be unfair if the tribunal were merely to approach the problem on the authenticity of the programme and the adequacy of the information without thoroughly familiarising themselves with the kind of programme it is, with the kind of preparation that goes into it, with the extent to which the producers associate themselves with the statements that are made, with the views that are expressed, and certainly I agree that it is unlikely that the tribunal would approach the inquiry without familiarising themselves with the kind of programme it is, but this is merely one thing that makes sure that they will do that, and on the other hand, in case any question should arise, it authorises them to get all the information and to do all which is necessary to enable them to understand exactly what kind of programme it is.</P>
    <P>I feel therefore that there is no validity in the concern which Senator Bourke has expressed as to the way in which these paragraphs are set out, and in fact the way they are set out will achieve the most desirable result and the fairest result to all concerned. It is true, I suppose, that every Member of the Seanad could draft these paragraphs in a different way, and probably there are a dozen other ways in which they could be drafted which would be equally good, so that we could go on arguing all day as to changes in the way the paragraphs are set out, changes in the wording and so on.  This is not the only way in which it could be done, but to my mind it is well set out and it will enable the tribunal to make a fair and thorough examination of this programme and will enable the tribunal to bring in findings which will get to the roots of this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say at the outset that I have the gravest doubts about the validity, the propriety, the wisdom or even the constitutionality of what is proposed to the House, by implication, in this motion.  I should like to say as a preliminary to that that Senator Keery referred to Senator Bourke in introducing her amendment yesterday as a lawyer.  I understand and I think that most Members of the House understood what she meant by that.  She was emphasising her independence of any party connection in addressing herself to this motion, a proper moment, I think, for university representatives in this House to emphasise their independence; and a graver issue, graver even than the future existence of this House, is there for consideration &mdash; the question of the continued vitality of academic freedom.  I do not propose to address this House either now or at any time as a person practising the profession I do, nor do I think that this is something which any Senator will wish to do.  He will be speaking here as a Senator, and if as a Member of the Seanad he draws some inspiration or ideas from any training he may have received, he does so merely making it available for the benefit of this House in the consideration of whatever matter is being debated.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should say immediately that of course I do not question the ability of this House to pass this resolution either in the form proposed or in an amended form, but I will question with great seriousness whether it will be open, within the ambit of our Constitution, to appoint or to apply the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 to this motion as proposed.  I speak as one &mdash; I wish to emphasise this because I may have some reservations to express later in the context of the times in which we live &mdash; who regards the freedom of the press as necessary to restrain the political power whose jealousy of criticism is a source so often of mischief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening the argument, which I hope will not be too tedious for Senators to hear but which I feel it is my duty to offer, I have to refer to and to read fully the provisions of Article <Col N="666" /> 40, Clause 6, subsection 1 (1) of the Constitution which reads:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, subject to public order and morality:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>It can be said of that Article that at least it strengthens the prior existing rights of the free expression of public opinion.  These rights were then, and remain still, hedged in by various safeguards well known to everyone who is practising the profession of journalism or engaged in the utilisation of any of the media of communication &mdash; hedged in by safeguards such as the rights of citizens whose activity comes within the range of the expression of opinion in question, the right to protect himself by actions in the courts for slander in the case of oral communications, and, in the case of the press and television, to libel.</P>
    <P>Every journalist receives his information, writes his articles and expresses his views knowing this.  It is also possible that he may be criminally liable if the language he uses is an incitement to a breach of the public peace.  I submit to this House that the only restrictions on the free exercise of citizens' convictions and opinions are the safeguards of the individual to preserve his own reputation and the safeguards of society to protect itself against breaches of public order such as would result from incitements to breaches of the public peace, and such safeguards as the State is entitled to impose by law under this Article, when it is required by the Constitution enacted by the people, that the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs <Col N="667" /> of opinion shall not be used to undermine public order or morality.</P>
    <P>I look at the text of this motion. I do not find in this motion any reference whatever, or any suggestion whatever, that the organs of opinion have been used to undermine public order or morality.  If the Government decide, as they have indicated publicly by the Taoiseach in the Dáil and, I think, by the Minister in opening these proceedings and as is now implied by the language used, which is taken from the Act, that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into definite matters of public importance, I suggest that it will set in motion a proceeding which is calculated to interefere with the rights of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might note that I am endeavouring to make a serious contribution to this debate, which will be no less in aid of the Minister and the Government than anyone else.  I might be listened to patiently because it is still possibly open to the Government to amend it and it may be open to them to adopt a proper proceeding.  If a tribunal are appointed to pursue an investigation into opinions which have been expressed on television, with all the powers of the High Court to compel, perhaps Members of the House would like to be told what was enacted by &ldquo;The King's Most Excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Lords of the Temple and Commons&rdquo; on 24th March, 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was enacted that the Court Tribunal would have power in &ldquo;enforcing the attendance of witnesses and examining them on oath, affirmation, or otherwise&rdquo;, and of compelling &ldquo;the production of documents,&rdquo; and if any person &ldquo;being duly summoned as a witness before a tribunal makes default in attending&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;being in attendance as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required by the tribunal to be taken or to produce any document <Col N="668" /> in his power or legally required by the tribunal to be produced by him&rdquo; the chairman may certify the offence and the unfortunate witness may be sent to jail.</P>
    <P>How can one be sent to jail if his right to express his opinions freely is enshrined in the Constitution, subject to the restriction that he complies with the law requiring him not to express opinions which undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State?  I am not seeking to argue more than to the limited extent to which I am arguing that the law enforced in 1937, the date of the enactment of the Constitution, in Article 50 is as follows:</P>
    <P>Laws enacted before, but expressed to come into force after, the coming into operation of this Constitution, shall, unless otherwise enacted by the Oireachtas, come into force in accordance with the terms thereof.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to argue that the Act of 1921, as applied to a proper matter, is inconsistent with the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that it was introduced in a war situation is entirely irrelevant to the case I am making as I am sure the Leader of the House is well aware.  I do not want to pursue this at the moment because it might have the effect that the argument which I shall put to the House, to be conveyed through the Minister here to the Government, might be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have grave doubts, based on the provisions of the Article of the Constitution I have read out, when it is directed at an inquiry concerning the question of free expression of opinion, whether that Act would be held to be properly applied under the Constitution to such matters.  My doubt is increased very considerably by the fact that the Oireachtas has already directed itself very thoroughly to the question <Col N="670" /> of regulation of broadcasting.  It was contemplated in the Constitution that this might be so.  It had already been done in relation to radio broadcasting in the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926. We had the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and I suggest that there is a law, the only law enacted which is constitutional, which deals with this matter of ensuring that organs of public opinion such as radio shall not be used to undermine public order or morality, and that is the Broadcasting Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of that Act which, I imagine, is well known to members of the Government, states that it casts the duty of impartiality on the authority: it shall be the duty of the authority that when it broadcasts any information, news or feature which relates to a matter of public controversy or is the subject of current public debate, the information, news or feature is expressed objectively and impartially and without any expression of the authority's own views.  Section 16 gives the authority all the powers necessary for or incidental to the establishment and maintenance of a national television and sound broadcasting service. I cannot see how these two sections, read together and read with section 31, could be seen as doing anything other than regulating under the Constitution how broadcasting &mdash; by television in this case &mdash; is to be conducted without undermining public order, morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>There is a series of provisions in subsection (2) of section 16 which is worth looking at.  They show that the Oireachtas contemplated that the authority might require sanctions appropriate to achieving this purpose. The authority is empowered to originate and to procure programmes from any source, to make contracts, agreements and arrangements incidental or conducive to the objects of the authority, to collect news, information and so on.  I am not familiar with their procedures except in an incidental way arising out of an occasional case, but I doubt very much if an authority given such a heavy responsibility has not elaborated procedures whereby it <Col N="671" /> may secure protection for itself in the matter of impartiality by contract.  I should be very surprised if it has not this, and if this is so it is not the fault of the Oireachtas.  It is, or ought to be provided that this extraordinarily powerful medium &mdash; and here I differ from Senator Keery &mdash; would not be used to undermine public order, morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>There were a number of courses open to the Government when faced with this situation.  I am capable of saying the hard word as well as the soft word, but I have some sympathy with those members of the Government who are obviously hard-working and dedicated men and who must have been extremely disturbed with this conflict which arose recently between one of their colleages and the RTE Authority. The Government could have adopted any one of a number of courses which would have avoided much of the trouble that followed.</P>
    <P>The first course might have been that the Minister might have exercised his power, which is quite an extraordinary power.  We see that he may direct the authority in writing to allocate broadcasting time for any announcements by or on behalf of any Minister of State in connection with the functions of that Minister of State and the authority must comply with this direction.  There is no limitation on the time which shall be made available; we could have a weekly programme on the activities of the Minister for Justice, on the code of moneylenders, how it is enforced, the difficulties of enforcing it, and the information available.  Appeals could have been made to the citizens to cooperate and so on.  If the present Minister for Justice had been the Minister concerned, I am sure he would have gone on television, merry as a bee, and would have gained more votes for his party than he would have lost. But for some reason the Minister for Justice did not choose to exercise that power.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, when the Government found themselves faced with a conflict between a Minister of State and the <Col N="672" /> authority, if they decided they had lost confidence in the authority, in its impartiality and in its wisdom in the administration of its affairs, they might have removed the authority.  But they did not do that.  I do not see how they could have made that choice but it was a way of operating which would have at least faced us squarely with the whole question of the relationship of the Government with the authority.</P>
    <P>Another method might have been to have made an inquiry, not into the manner in which these gentlemen collected the information which led them to form the opinions they expressed &mdash; which seems to me to strike at the root of the free expression of public opinion: people being possessed of their ordinary rights in law to protect themselves and the duty of the authority being there to require that these expressions should be impartial &mdash; but into the impartiality of the authority, and this would seem to be a legitimate constitutional inquiry.  Such an inquiry would appear to be possible without striking at the confidence of those people who had to prepare that programme and other programmes.</P>
    <P>The Leader of my party used good and wise words which I adopt in referring to this whole affair.  He referred to the state of public uneasiness.  This is true because great public uneasiness was caused by that programme.  People whose judgment I greatly respect came to me the following day and expressed utter shock at what they saw. Some of them said there must be awful people in RTE because they were horrified at the possibility that a social evil of the kind alleged could exist. The Government could have taken a course which I and Members of my party would have supported.  They could have had an inquiry into the social evils alleged and this would have been a very appropriate step to take when one has regard to the terms of the Preamble to the Constitution, of which some of the language is very ennobling.  I quote:</P>
    <P>And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the <Col N="673" /> individual may be assured, true social order attained,</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>True social order shall not be attained while any substantial segment of opinion believes there are practices directed against the poorest of our people which are not being tackled. There was some indication from the remarks made by the Minister in Dáil Éireann that it was difficult to get proof.  We understand this but there may be a case for strengthening the powers in relation to matters of this kind.  There are strange and strong powers in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  If one is caught with a salmon he starts off with the onus of proof as to where he got it from.  There could be a strengthening of the moneylending code which, may I remind Members of the House, apart from a minor amendment in 1929, is precisely the same as it was in 1900.</P>
    <P>We have been busy these past 69 years, have we not?  There is a social evil and why do Governments not see to it that fresh powers are enacted to tackle this evil?  Each of the other parties in the House would be with them on that.</P>
    <P>There was another action possibly open, depending on the information available to the Minister and to the gardaí.  If the producers of this programme behaved as the Minister alleged they did, it would seem that they could be prosecuted for corrupt practices.  It cannot be in accordance with public policy that, as the Minister alleged, people were paid to tell lies to the public.</P>
    <P>The gravest consequences seem to follow from pursuance of this line, that is to say, the line that it seems to be proposed to pursue.  If this line of inquiry as to the preparation of the programme and the opinions expressed on it is applied and constitutionally permitted, which I doubt, it strikes at the authority of the authority and henceforth their ability to maintain impartiality. The extraordinary thing is that the inquiry is not directed at the authority. It is directed at a programme.  It is directed at the people employed by the authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> I have not thought this out any further but I invite the Minister and Members of the House to open their minds to the dangers of this.  Here is an inquiry into the activities of particular employees of one State body running right through the representatives of the authority, ignoring them and rejecting their statement that the programme was impartial, correct and authentic.  What are employees of other State bodies to think on any matter? What precedent are we setting for similar inquiries?</P>
    <P>Not in the slightest degree to protect myself from anything that anyone may care to say about me in relation to what remains to be said, I should like to say that I am not one of those people who think that his particular party carry some extraordinary virtue which other parties do not carry.  I do not think that virtue is divided in this Assembly in any particular way, and if one of my friends were sitting where the Minister is I should like to think that he would consider himself as free as I do to say what I am not going to say.  Obviously, there are Deputies, Senators and Ministers with at least as high a view of what should be done for the country as have any of the Opposition, but we must look at the order of events which preceded this inquiry proposal.</P>
    <P>I am shocked at the implications of the extraordinary political skill shown by the Minister in this matter.  I take it that we are discussing this resolution to prevent us discussing another one, but let us have a look at the events.</P>
    <P>On 19th November, Deputy Corish put down a question to the Minister for Justice and he received &mdash; I am now paraphrasing &mdash; a long and highly emotionally charged reply.  The following day RTE made their statement and I do not consider it necessary to bore anybody with that now.  On 25th November, which was the beginning of a hot atmosphere, a number of charges of the gravest kind were made against the Minister.  I do not propose to deal with them here.  Personally, I should prefer if I never had to deal with them, but they should be dealt with.  They had considerable significance for the Government if not, in the short term, <Col N="675" /> in the long term.  They had great significance for the long term standing and authority of the Government and of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Five days later, I was told &mdash; others may have known it earlier &mdash; by the <i>Sunday Press</i> that the Government might decide on Tuesday to establish an inquiry, not into any of the charges against the Minister but into the behaviour of a programme which had been declared authentic and impartial by RTE and which had been the subject of a highly emotional reply by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister I have read all the debates and I know of the various requests for an inquiry that were made.  There were various requests for an inquiry of one kind or another.  The terms of reference were not spelt out.  When the Taoiseach announced that the Government had decided to have this inquiry, which he did on 2nd December, the Member of my Party who took part in the debate stated, at column 50 of volume 243 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>What will be the terms of reference? We should establish that before we welcome the inquiry.</P>

      <P>There were various options open but the option which has been so brilliantly chosen, from the point of view of the short-term interests of the Government, has put on one side all of this.  Incidentally, it also managed to exclude further debate on the RTE affair during the course of the Department of Justice Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the House that there are more important things than the survival of any Government.  An executive &mdash; any executive, not the present executive &mdash; is, particularly if it has been as long in office as this executive has, fearful of criticism.  Its fear of criticism is a source of fatal mischief. <Col N="676" /> I feel it has been led, as it would not have been led by the Leader who led it 25 years ago, into adopting a course with grave implications.  The course I am saying it has adopted is in not facing the real charges which have been made against a Minister of that Government.  I know a lot about these events.  I know of the three inquiries that took place which I am prepared to say undoubtedly led to the downfall of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not press me for dates but I assure the Senator I know about those things.  I sat through one of them with great interest as a very young person.  I knew all about the first in a professional way before it was published and I acted for the much-maligned Member of the Fianna Fáil Party who was the subject of the third inquiry and whose sole executor I was subsequently.</P>
      <P>I know a lot about those affairs. The point I want to make is that the then Taoiseach did not count the cost in terms of the interests of his own party.  He saw the long-term dangers of having Ministers of Government subjected to charges which were not being investigated in a manner which would satisfy the public.</P>
      <P>I think I belong in a tradition which would naturally be sympathetic with the right to dissent but not unaware of the necessity to have that right to dissent subject to some sort of restraints or controls.  I find it difficult to find the language appropriate for what I want to say.  I think it was Lord Justice Holmes who said that the test should be that it should not be right to cry &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in a crowded theatre.  It is a sharp phrase.  It indicates the sort of thing I am getting at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that we are living in a time when there is taking place a revolution of rising expectation everywhere. This is associated with the matter of economic growth which tends sometimes to separate classes, to create classes, to create divisions.  Even the classes of persons or economic groups who are far better off than they were ten years ago &mdash; and let us face it, <Col N="677" /> this is true of the great mass of people here &mdash; are still wanting more.  This tends to make them more critical, I think, than perhaps they ought to be. I feel the word &ldquo;complacent&rdquo; is too quickly used when a Minister gives an account of an achievement that he is perfectly entitled to be proud of or to have been associated with.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;complacent&rdquo; is too easy to say.  We are a new State.  I do not think I am wrong in saying that we are the only State that emerged out of the 1914-18 War that still sticks it in Europe.  That is a remarkable fact and I adopt the remark of my colleague, Professor Kelly, here yesterday when he objected to the bad manners of some Ministers, the general attitude of others and so on, but said that it cannot be said, that it is impossible to say, there has been any persistent effort by the Fianna Fáil Government to deny free speech up to this.  However, this could have consequences that perhaps are not even being contemplated by the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery referred to the desirability of a press council.  I know little enough about it.  I have no complaint about the way the press go on but I feel that there is insufficient disagreement among the papers: they all too readily adopt the same point of view. I feel they are of accord and that they tend to be interested in what is exciting, interesting, in what is news.  If a man murders his wife with a hatchet, that is news.  If he sits down comfortably with her for the afternoon that is not news, and does not appear at all. The balance gets disturbed accordingly.</P>
    <P>I feel we should be trying to nurture in our people pride in our past and in our own achievement in self government, while being aware of the necessity to criticise very vitally, strongly, unrestrainedly.  There should be a deliberate policy to appreciate what has been handed down to us.  There are people here who know much more about education than I do but I have taken in a simple way the following phrase as being what education is about.  Education is much more about understanding the achievement of the past than it is about criticising it and criticising its defects.  Criticism is appropriate but an understanding of <Col N="678" /> achievement is also appropriate.  I think the achievements all over the world of the reformed capitalism, of capitalism reformed by Lord Keynes, have made that system one which has utterly belied the prophesying elements in Marx.  There is a lot of truth in Marx.  Those truths remain in the social insights more than anything else.</P>
    <P>To summarise my position, it would be this: I emphasise the importance of liberty which I would extend to include the dissipation of want.  I cannot accept any theory of liberty which does not demand strong efforts to help the poor, whose interests are sacred. The phrase in the Preamble to the Constitution is good and I am happy to adopt it: &ldquo;True social order attained&rdquo;.  True social order will not be attained unless, when allegations of the kind recently made are not received with suspicion as if they had come from Maoists or Trotskyites or anyone else who represent a long trend of wise discontent with modern civilisation, even if some of them may constitute a security risk to be coped with on its proper level, those people's interests should be of first concern.  Their interests will not be served when liberty is endangered.  It will be endangered unless the right to free expression of opinion is guaranteed, recognised, preserved and energetically protected.</P>
    <P>I see great danger in the course proposed here.  The Government cannot expect the people here to have continued confidence in them or in the Oireachtas which permits it, if they allow charges of the kind which have been made in Dáil Éireann by people of standing, former Ministers, men engaged in professions which make them aware of what they are entitled to say or what they are not entitled to say, go without reproach. I will end with a phrase taken from a man, who is frequently quoted, but whose name is rarely given, Lord Acton.  His phrase is about power corrupting.  It does not always corrupt. It has improved a few people.  I can think of a few in the early 1930s who were improved by it anyhow.  The phrase is: &ldquo;Democracy without a moral standard can no more stand than a republic governed by Marat,&rdquo;<Col N="679" /> the French revolutionary who, I think, died in his bath like I hope no member of the present Government dies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make just a few brief observations on the inquiry as suggested.  I have listened with great attention to Senator Alexis FitzGerald's excellent contribution and I think the Government would be very wise, even at this late stage, to take full cognisance of what he has said. It was given, as we would have expected from him, in the highest tradition of his profession and certainly, listening to it, it fell very much in with many of my own reactions to what has been suggested of this inquiry, because I think the whole point of it is wrongly planned.</P>
      <P>There are three issues, to my mind, that have arisen.  One partially comes into this proposed inquiry but is of relatively long standing, that is, how are the RTE Authority discharging the duties we committed to them under the Broadcasting Act, 1960?  Having taken a considerable part in the framing of that Act, or at least in the discussion on it in Seanad Éireann, I have had many moments of unease since then and it would seem that a look into RTE should be on a much broader front.  Indeed it is setting a very dangerous precedent that the Government should claim on the one hand when we put up a semi-State authority that it has been endowed with all power, that we cannot question it, and we get the reply: &ldquo;It was enshrined in the Act, you were a party to that Act setting that body up and its terms are to act in accordance with that&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Government will be able to go through that Act and actually have a go at an individual team of employees of that body.  That is against every ideal we have had about the relationship between a Government and a semi-State body.  Surely the authority of any semi-State body is fully responsible for the activities of the employees within the body.  If anybody is to take a rap for a breach of the Act it is the authority and the authority alone.  If the authority in any semi-State body is found to have acted <Col N="680" /><i>ultra vires</i> then it is time for the Government to remove that authority, and a new one, on being taken on, has a duty as the first task to investigate whatever went wrong down the line and to take appropriate action in regard to it.  Surely that is the ordinary procedure in regard to this.</P>
    <P>The part of the Broadcasting Act quoted by Senator FitzGerald is the one of course which we are all concerned about, that is the question of this mighty powerful medium and that it should be impartial &mdash; that it should be seen to be impartial in accordance with the terms of the Act.  A broad inquiry on that basis would probably be not of this type but a study preparatory to amending the Broadcasting Act or setting our course for the next ten years based on our present experience. That would be highly opportune.</P>
    <P>To my mind the first task suggested here in the proposed tribunal, the planning, preparation, arrangement, presentation of the recent television programme <i>et cetera</i> in accordance with the 1960 Act is something which should be committed to the authority. If their planning was too little or too skimpy it is not for us here to criticise it.  It was intended it would be able to carry criticism in any particular sector, so I cannot see that paragraph 1 of the motion is important.  In fact I cannot see that the authority have anything to answer in regard to this. That is their job, and provided that they have not contravened the section of the Act then I do not see what they have to answer.</P>
    <P>But what they are interested in, I take it, is the broad question I have mentioned about impartiality in newstalks, features <i>et cetera</i>, and doing nothing to undermine public order, morality or the authority of the State. But an inquiry into that could not be based on a particular programme. Many of us have been very disturbed by many programmes we have seen but that is a judgment on the authority and can only be a judgment based on action over a much wider front than what is contemplated here.</P>
    <P>The public have a right to be disturbed by the revelations in the programme about the activities of illegal moneylenders.  We want to know is <Col N="681" /> that so, but we do not want to know in accordance with section 2 whether this amounts to a correct and fair representation of the facts.  &ldquo;Fair representation&rdquo; to my mind is a rather loaded phrase in this context.  What does fair representation mean?  If it is established that there are 200 illegal moneylenders, and if only ten of those can be in court found to be guilty of some of the charges here, there may be many others who cannot be proved guilty.  It is a difficult task to find these illegal moneylenders and to convict them of what is set out here &mdash; the use of violence or threats of violence to secure repayments of moneys illegally lent.  It bristles with difficulties.</P>
    <P>Here you are asking for a criminal conviction on those charges.  Then if you succeeded in establishing this only for ten out of an estimated 200 illegal moneylenders, are the crimes of the ten &ldquo;a fair representation of the facts&rdquo;?  I do not think that the court would hold that that was correct because the other 190 were being accused in the same way and therefore it is not fair to them, and therefore that was not a fair representation of the facts of the operations of this group of 200 people.</P>
    <P>Yet as a nation we would welcome getting a programme if they were to find five out of 200 who were employing these tactics, even if a court did not have absolute information sufficient to convict those five, yet they would have reasonable proof that some few of them were engaged in this; then a good job would have been done in awakening our national conscience to the fact that those existed and in the inquiry.  I do not see how paragraph 2 can be carried out fully without this inquiry going fully into the position of illegal moneylenders in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>But an inquiry of that sort would not be nearly enough, because we inquire simply so that we may produce remedies and the remedies have to follow from any inquiry that is worth while.  The remedies here are of course in the fuller development of the credit union movement. What is in issue here and what the <Col N="682" /> Government and we all should be concerned about is the fact that it costs so much more to certain sections of our community, due to their lack of worldly goods, to borrow than it costs those with goods.  Surely that is social inequality and a thing that we should be making much greater efforts to remedy, which can only be remedied by first of all wiping out completely those illegal moneylenders &mdash; and indeed much of the licensed moneylending should come into it too &mdash; and secondly, to develop the modern answer to that, that is the credit union movement.</P>

      <P>I am making the point that this is what should be inquired into and that what is proposed will be only doing one-third of the job, and one-third of the job is not nearly enough.  That is the important problem that we should be concerned about. The third problem is, of course, the disgraceful exhibition and the disgraceful conduct that has gone on in the language used by the Minister concerned in the Dáil and so on.  Obviously that action is a matter for authority, and the authority in this matter is the authority of the Taoiseach to remove such a Minister.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 4 of the motion states: &ldquo;The inquiries on behalf of the Garda Síochána and the statements taken by the Garda Síochána which relate to the programme.&rdquo; Are the Garda Síochána to be made the scapegoat in this?  If we find that Radio Telefís Éireann is right, then, under paragraph 4, are the Garda the scapegoats?  The Minister for Justice who is responsible for the <Col N="683" /> Garda would have fallen down on his job and obviously this Minister must take the responsibility and take the rap for it just the same as if the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team fell down in their job it is the Radio Telefís Éireann authority who would have to take responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>Looking at it I cannot see what the inquiry can solve.  One problem we are interested in certainly, is establishing paragraph 2, but I do not see that the tribunal as set up it can really establish that.  As for the other, No. 1, I think that Senator Bourke's amendment quite rightly shifts the inquiry, and the whole goes away from that.  At least if the tribunal are to take it in its present form, the inquiry would be much better for this amendment, but I think that the Government would be wiser, even at this late stage to withdraw it, think about it again over Christmas and come back with something that would be much fairer and much more comprehensive after Christmas.</P>

      <P>After all that has been said, maybe it is time for us to come down to earth and take a short, incisive, searching look at what is before us.  In order to do that, let us go back for a moment and see what caused all this rumpus, what gave rise to this dispute, disagreement or disquiet, and what led up to the need for this inquiry in the first instance.  All we need do is to go back to the night of the 11th November.  On that night an excellently produced feature was screened on Telefís Éireann which proposed to expose the disgraceful behaviour of unlicensed moneylenders in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public were given the impression that many of these unlicensed moneylenders actually operated in Dublin and that the methods used by them were a disgrace in any Christian country.  Some of those who saw that feature told me about it in Cork the next morning.  People all over the country saw this programme and accepted it as a portrayal of something that actually existed.  Nobody seemed to have any doubt about it.  People said to me that they saw on the screen <Col N="684" /> a portrayal of a state of affairs which should not be allowed to exist.</P>
    <P>What is to be done about it?  It never occurred to me that there was something missing from that programme, which shows how much we are under the influence of the screen. Television is the most potential developer of our line of thought in this country at the moment.  It comes into our homes and we are subject to the presentations and slants it wishes to convey.  The greatest danger of all television or radio programmes is their selectivity.  It cannot be said that certain things portrayed on the screen or given to us in newspaper articles are false but, by presenting certain facets and viewpoints, impressions can be given and the overall effect will be that a false image or picture is given.</P>
    <P>Let us refer now to the feature on the 11th November.  It would appear from the statement made by the Minister for Justice in Dáil Éireann that something was wrong with that feature, that something was missing and that the situation was not as bad as we thought it was.  The Minister for Justice had made inquiries, because he is responsible for the men whose duty it is to see that such things do not happen. The Garda Síochána are as fine a force as any police force in the world.  They are aware of anything wrong which is going on.  That is generally accepted throughout the whole country.  They are definitely well-informed.  I will not go into the allegations and counter-allegations mentioned in the Dáil.  It appears to me that the people who were most vocal in demanding that an inquiry should be set up were not the Members of the Government or the Members of the Fianna Fáil Party but the Members of the Labour and the Fine Gael Parties.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the freedom and liberty of the press, radio and television.  We are all for freedom in these media.  Freedom of expression and of speech is a thing which is very dear to Irish hearts but liberty should not be allowed to degenerate into licence.  We can twist the truth by over-selectivity in our presentation.  If we want freedom of expression we must <Col N="685" /> have a very high standard of integrity. We must present not only our own viewpoint but the viewpoint of men who disagree with us.</P>
    <P>From time to time we can find fault with many of our TV presentations on this account.  On many of the regular features of RTE, viewpoints have been expressed which alarm us and which are not in keeping with our standards. Unfortunately, viewers come away from their screens with the impression that there is no answer to the points raised.  A television authority must be careful to see, when allegations are made against a State service or against businesses or people or movements and especially against national movements, that somebody must be there who is competent, able and willing to refute these statements.  There is a great danger in the media of television, radio and newspapers that there could be distortion of the truth inasmuch as the two sides of the story are not presented.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the proposed terms of reference.  Some of the speakers on the other side of the House want to have it both ways. Some of them say the terms are too wide and others say they are not wide enough.  A particular programme started all this discussion.  Let us examine that programme under the four headings of the motion, which include everything that is required to examine that particular programme fairly, honestly and quickly.  Suppose that a Senator on the other side were taken seriously and it was proposed to have an inquiry into the television authority.  I can see that perhaps six months or 12 months would elapse before we got anywhere.  The TV authority would have to be inquired into and, in turn, the tribunal would have to inquire into those programmemakers with special reference to the programme of 11th November last.</P>
    <P>It may be years before they get finality.  It is extremely urgent that this tribunal be set up as quickly as possible and get down to work as expeditiously as possible.  This affair has indeed captured the imagination of the public; for many it is a godsend because there seems to be nothing <Col N="686" /> exciting in the newspapers at the moment.  Others are worried about freedom of the press, television and radio and the sooner these doubts are settled the better.  For that reason I am very glad that the Government have decided to set up this tribunal.  I commend the terms of reference and I hope we will have results as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are supporting the amendment of Senator Bourke and we do so for the excellent reasons she gave in putting forward the amendment.  We believe if this tribunal is to inquire, as is set out in paragraph 1, into the preparation and planning of this programme, we shall be setting a very undesirable precedent of such a tribunal entering a field where initiative is very necessary. If the tribunal are to keep on these lines we shall not alone inhibit the young men and women of RTE, who to date have shown commendable initiative, but we may succeed in intimidating them.</P>
      <P>Much has already been said both in this and the other House on this matter.  We should be proud that such a debate could take place in our national Parliament because this is proof that we are a free country.  In countries that are not free there can be no quarrel between the Government and the national radio and television service because they all speak with one voice.  I would suggest that we tread very carefully unless we want to bring about that situation here, and I do not think that anyone wants that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are faced with here is yet another problem of democracy; democracy, excellent form of Government though it is, presents problems not the least of which is the constant attempt to reconcile the interest of one or a group of individuals with the interests of the majority.  These are the classic problems of a democracy and in the field of communications we have been successful to a large extent in solving these problems in relation to the older forms of communication, for instance, the newspapers.  Our newspapers indulge in a fair amount of speculation and much of this speculation is often <Col N="687" /> covered in anonymity.  In the comparatively new field of television it may be that we have yet to establish a correct relationship between the Government, the community and that service.</P>
    <P>It has been obvious for some time that there are problems or at least the Government seem to think so between them and RTE.  It might have been better if the Government had taken another way of examining these relationships, how they exist and how they should exist rather than the course of action they took.  It honestly seems to us that the Government have literally seized on the opportunity given to them by this programme on 11th November, 1969, and it must remain a matter of very wide regret that the greater social issues involved or implied in that programme are now apparently being swept aside.  The terms of reference have been examined in this House by lawyers and I do not propose to try to cover the ground they have so adequately covered, but it seems to me, as a layman, that these terms of reference are directed in a relatively narrow way against this programme and the people who planned it.</P>
    <P>We must state that the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team did not create this problem of illegal moneylending and its abuses, nor did they discover it.  They merely did what to their credit they have done on other occasions &mdash; they brought the problem to our attention.  It was a problem, like many others in our community, whose existence we are conscious of but we shrug our shoulders, we say it does not concern us and we hope it will be forgotten.  A similar problem in this connection was that of itinerancy and how much we owe to the workers in RTE for the situation we now have where itinerancy is recognised as a national problem.</P>
    <P>Public reaction to the programme we are now discussing was tremendous and I think was unequalled by any other similar programme ever put out by our broadcasting service.  There is now public uneasiness but I do not think it is with regard to the planning and presentation of the programme nor with the manner and means in which interviews were obtained, or alleged to have <Col N="688" /> been obtained.  There is uneasiness that this controversy, this debate and this inquiry may shunt this problem on to the sidelines.  It would be a pity and a tragedy if the crusading spirit that so distinguished this programme were to stand in danger, as I think it does in this inquiry.  These remarks are not directed to the eminent gentlemen who no doubt will form this tribunal but it must be accepted that if the tribunal go ahead and, however charitable they may be in their findings, that if in the future the men and women of RTE think of a similar programme concerned with a social problem they will have to think twice before they embark upon such a programme.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience of their colleagues who handled this particular programme, they may not go ahead with this crusading spirit on television. We must acknowledge that we have been embarrassed at times when the spotlight of television has been turned on our activities; at least this is true in so far as my own trade union movement is concerned.  Very often RTE have carried out searching and probing examinations of our activities and however embarrassed and, indeed, hurt we may have been on occasions, we have not complained; to use an American term, &ldquo;We have got to learn to live with it&rdquo;.  There are many complaints about what are described as canned programmes on Telefís Éireann but, of course, the answer to this particular problem would be to have an extension of home produced programmes but these must and should include programmes of a social nature and in this respect great credit is due to RTE.</P>
    <P>Unlike the cinema where a particular production may run for many months, the people who plan and prepare these television programmes must work not on a weekly or a daily schedule but on an hourly schedule. To the extent that I have had experience of RTE, either as a participant or as a viewer, I have often been impressed by the obvious depth of research and homework that has been done by those in charge of such programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Bourke has emphasised, <Col N="689" /> and I have already accepted, that her amendment is so designed as to highlight the importance of the tribunal examining the authenticity and accuracy of the programme and its information.  In so far as I can make out from the welter of statements and counter-statments, charges and counter-charges that have distinguished as well as doing the opposite to this debate in the House, the real issue in this whole controversy is whether the programme was genuine.  I did not see the programme but it seems to me now, as to many others, that it is not important as to whether the participants were genuine.  I suggest that if they were not genuine this would not be the first and certainly will not be the last occasion on which fiction and fictitious characters have been used to draw attention to social problems which are nevertheless real.  To what extent did this happen in the novels of Charles Dickens and who can measure the contribution that our own Brendan Behan made to the case against capital punishment?  What remains of this particular programme in the public mind is the uneasiness caused by the programme as to whether such an evil exists within our community.</P>
    <P>It has been stated elsewhere that there are not more than 12, 15 or maybe 25 unlicensed moneylenders in the city of Dublin.  As a native of this city I should like to accept that in a city of almost three-quarters of a million people there are not more than 25 unlicensed moneylenders.  If we could believe this I would be proposing that we change the name of our capital city to Utopia.  There are streets in Dublin in which there are more than 25 unlicensed moneylenders and for anybody to suggest otherwise is to show lamentable ignorance of our city.</P>
    <P>There has been doubt if not denial that violence or threats of violence are used in the collection of these illegally lent moneys.  We are dealing with illegal moneylending and there are no legal sanctions to those illegal moneylenders if there is a default in repayment and, therefore, it surely is obvious that not merely at this despicable level but even at a higher level when there are no legal means open <Col N="690" /> to certain people there will be recourse to violence or some such tactics.</P>
    <P>I am proud of this city and of the people of the city, but I do not deny that there is a very small group of people engaged in illegal moneylending and that at least some of these are prepared to use violence when there is default of payment.  We have not here a lasting city and we certainly have not a heavenly city.  We have a metropolis and, as in every other metropolis, there will inevitably be cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>As bad as illegal moneylending, as a Dubliner will tell one, is the practice in regard to dockets where vouchers are purchased from firms and sold and resold at an enhanced value.  We know, too, that there is an illegal, but thank God, very small trade in children's allowance books.  We would all like to think that these practices are not carried on but they are and we have always known that they have been carried on and the merit of this particular programme is that it reminded us of these evils and pricked our consciences so that we knew something must be done about them.</P>
    <P>The implications of this programme are not critical of and do not cast any reflection on the Garda Síochána. They cannot be expected to know everything.  Indeed the Minister for Justice rightly stressed the peculiar difficulties concerning a true and accurate assessment of the extent of this particular problem.  This is obvious when one pictures the two main characters involved.  The lender, if that is the correct term, will certainly not report this matter to the gardaí and the unfortunate debtor, for very many reasons, will not repair to the gardaí. I believe this is a chronic habit, almost like alcoholism.  They get into this web and they cannot get out of it for many reasons, not the least of which may be the threat of violence.</P>
    <P>I repeat that there is no criticism or reflection on the gardaí in this matter. There should be, in fact, no resentment of the gardaí, because it is the duty of each and every citizen to assist the authorities.  It is not the first time, and one would hope it will not be the last time, that the communications media, television, press or radio, have <Col N="691" /> drawn attention to and highlighted social problems and inadequacies and brought them to the attention of the authorities.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the evils, and they are evils, highlighted in this programme are real, are present in our city and are probably as extensive as the programme indicated.  It is a matter of regret that all the events which have flowed since the 11th November are apparently tending to obliterate, if not entirely, to a great extent, the issue rightly and properly raised by RTE.  All of us have been shaken out of our complacency and our sometimes unconscious acceptance of things as they are.</P>
      <P>I hold, with Senator Cranitch, that freedom of expression must not deteriorate into licence.  I do not go along with those who hold that freedom of expression should be completely unqualified. If this is the voice of the minority it is also the voice of the majority which holds that such freedoms must be qualified not least by the moral law as we understand it and will continue to hold dear in this country. However, in this case I believe that RTE and the planners and practitioners of this &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme deserve not the censure which is implied by a tribunal but the thanks of all who wish well to our country, the thanks of all who are pledged to the elimination of our existing social evils. However much we would like to think that these evils do not exist they do exist and the best thanks of the community are due to RTE for highlighting them.</P>
      <P>I shall not, obviously the tribunal will do that, pass judgment on whether the participants in the programme were genuine.  There can be no doubt, however, that the evil highlighted by that programme and brought to the attention of every citizen is real.  We should not attack the possible shadow of the participants and lose the substance of the real problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>We have our professors too.  This motion is concerned with whether the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme screened on November 11th was genuine.  In &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, like the news, we accept what we are told as true and we expect that the characters we see are the real people concerned. We have been led to believe by reports from the Garda authorities that people were paid to be interviewed on this programme who were not involved in this problem.</P>
      <P>It is a very dangerous precedent to pay a person for an interview on a programme like &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; or the news because there is the danger that if certain people are paid enough they will give one the report one wants. If we had been told at the beginning of this programme that some of the characters were fictitious I do not think we would be debating this motion today.  Since the Opposition have called for an inquiry and the RTE Authority has claimed that everything in the programme was genuine it is amazing to hear so much discussion on it.  It is strange that the people who asked for the inquiry are trying so hard to change the terms of reference.  The terms of reference set out provide for a public inquiry in the fairest possible manner before the judiciary.  From that inquiry we will find out whether the programme was genuine and whether those who gave interviews were genuine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard people speak today of books and films.  It is accepted in films and in story-books that you have a poetic licence and even in the case of an autobiography, but in a programme where you are given the news or in a programme which is taken as genuine and of the same quality as the news we expect what we see is reality.  It has been known in radio programmes where a person wants to highlight some grievance that they have to take somebody from the other <Col N="693" /> side or from the body responsible for the grievance so that they can give their views on it.  I have even seen people who wanted to air a grievance not too long ago receiving cheques afterwards for this, but there was never any mention of the other side giving their views on the particular point.</P>
    <P>Programmes like &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; should be able to stand up to an inquiry if the case arises.  If what they said, and what came through from the authority, is true they should have nothing to fear.  At least we must guard the public in seeing that programmes like this are of a genuine nature.  I suppose one of the first programmes on what we might call an awakening of public conscience was the Hospitals Trust programme. I was amazed at the slant which was put on that programme by the team producing it.  They never interviewed any of the people concerned in Hospitals Trust but they tried to make them guilty in the public eye when there was nobody there to defend them and to show what had been done by the Hospitals Trust since they were set up more than 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to take facts and figures and to portray them, but I feel every side should be heard on a programme like that.  If we are going to screen something which will awaken the public conscience, all sides must see it, all sides must be heard because it is very easy to give a biased account.</P>
    <P>When the Hospitals Trust programme was on I was thoroughly disgusted with what they did.  They never said anything about the good which was done down through the years by the amount of money that was put into the hospitals service which the ordinary taxpayer would have had to pay otherwise.  Now we have this illegal moneylending.  If those people found there was so much illegal moneylending as they maintained was going on, at least they should have brought in people from the other side on the programme, those responsible for law and order, so that they could give their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the least but when the Senator interrupted me I mentioned the programme last night had all sides on it.  In the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on moneylending only one side was represented.  I heard Senator Dunne mention that unions were probed in a particular programme by Telefís Éireann.  I am not sure which programme he had in mind but I would imagine that some members from the union involved were on the programme as well as the ordinary members who had a grouse or the general public who were objecting to it.  Those people were able to answer their case on the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this motion we are asking that a particular programme, about which we have doubts from what we have heard, should be the subject of an inquiry to decide whether the programme was genuine, whether it portrayed the truth and whether the people who were on the programme were the actual people involved.  If that is the case, and if as they say it is genuine, they should have no worries.  In programmes such as this, and in the future, as has been mentioned, people should be free to go and portray something if they feel they should.  I do not think that the public or people in this House would ever object, if any aspect that should be portrayed was done provided that all the people concerned or all sections of any particular item were represented <Col N="695" /> on the programme and had their say. In that way the public would be able to judge for themselves.</P>
    <P>To go back to the programme last night, everybody there, when the programme was over, had heard the different sections involved in it.  They had got their views and they could judge for themselves, but when you highlight and go for a one-sided slant or a one-sided report on any programme you are going into very dangerous territory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe, but it is amusing the way the Opposition hate to hear; when you have to go through a public inquiry into any particular programme they must be very much afraid of what will come out of it. That is what we are asking, that we will have a fair report on that particular programme.  For my own feeling it was, after seeing what had happened in the Hospitals Trust and other programmes done by this particular team, that they were taking their leads particularly from some programmes from abroad and that it was fair game whatever they could say without giving all sides a chance to air their particular views.</P>
      <P>Here we are asking to see how bad this moneylending is.  We have heard different reports on it, but in this House all sides will get their say in alternating one after the other across the House.  The &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme is like that.  It is an open discussion on any particular item, but the way it has been heading, particularly in this particular programme, you could feel that the producers of the programme had their minds more or less made up what would be the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  In the four items, we are asking that in a <Col N="696" /> public sworn inquiry of this nature all the facts relating to that particular programme will be discussed, with all the records and scripts and even notes that the reports and directors made before the programme was screened, and the actual script, the tapes and films of the programme will be all made available to the inquiry.  The people who made them will be giving their evidence so that the public can see in what manner the programme or programmes were devised, produced and what they had in mind before they started filming the programme. As we see here in paragraph 4, the statements that the Garda Síochána made as a result of the particular inquiry &mdash; because they were awakened and they knew quite a number of the people concerned and interviewed them immediately after the programme.  All those statements will be brought to life and are brought forward on oath before the tribunal.</P>
      <P>It will give the public an awareness of what is happening.  It will also give them a feeling of how programmes such as &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; are produced and whether they can rely or not on what they are seeing on the screen or in those particular programmes.  In that manner we will know in future whether we can take it as if it is being portrayed as being more or less a news or a genuine programme, whether we are getting what we are expecting from a programme like this.  On that account I commend this Resolution as put down by the Government to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment.  I thought that Senator Bourke made a very strong point when she said that unless the opening paragraph be rephrased &mdash; and I do not think that her amendment alters the phrasing very much, it coalesces two paragraphs into one &mdash; the point she made was that unless that were done there would be at least a tendency on the part of the tribunal to concentrate primarily on the paragraph which related to the &ldquo;planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation&rdquo; of the programme rather than on the major questions which are really of concern.  We ought to remember in this House that the <Col N="697" /> Radio Telefís Éireann Authority has already under its own authority inquired into the whole programme and has publicly pronounced itself as being satisfied with the way in which it was produced, which, after all, is ultimately its responsibility, and has publicly stood over the planning, arrangement, preparation presentation and so on. Therefore by asking another tribunal to go into all this again, it is in fact the very basic authority and competence of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority that is being challenged.</P>
      <P>I would like to look at the balance of the terms of reference of this motion as put before us in the name of Senator Ó Maoláin on behalf of the Government.  There are four terms of reference.  The first one deals with planning, preparation, etc.  The second one deals at some length with the &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; of the programme, which is what we want to find out. Then very briefly there are three and four relating to the &ldquo;inquiries&rdquo; on the part of Radio Telefís Éireann and the &ldquo;inquiries&rdquo; on behalf of the Garda Síochána.  Now I feel that it is not enough just to say that the tribunal should look into the inquiries on the part of the Garda Síochána and the statements taken by the Garda Síochána, because it is quite clear that the Garda Síochána not only took statements, but made statements, and furnished the Minister with information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would feel happier if, in relation to this fourth point, there were to be, in the minds of the tribunal, an obligation to examine the thoroughness of the inquiries by the Gardaí into the actual scope or extent of the unlicensed moneylending in the city and county of Dublin.  The Minister informed the Dáil that the number of such unlicensed moneylenders is &ldquo;undoubtedly below 25&rdquo;.  This figure should be incorporated in the terms of reference in relation to what was inquired into by the Gardaí.  The Gardaí should not have merely inquired into the statements made on the programme, but should have inquired also into all the implications thereof.  It is a pity that the tribunal is not asked to find out what the Gardaí know of the scope of unlicensed moneylending.  Senator Dunne has told us, in a very good <Col N="698" /> speech, that in his opinion the extent of unlicensed moneylending is much greater than the Minister stated.  The Minister stated that the number is below 25 in the whole area of Dublin city and county.  Senator Dunne feels there were as many as 20 moneylenders in a single street in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a point made in support of her amendment by Senator Bourke that if every such survey programme or journalistic survey in any of our newspapers had to be prepared and a case presented which would, if necessary, satisfy a court, the amount of news items and survey results that could legitimately be printed in newspapers would be practically nil.  Few items would be presented, if every item were to be subjected to such stringent tests to ensure that it would be capable of satisfying a court.  Sampling techniques are perfectly legitimate.  Sometimes implications or deductions therefrom are not satisfactory.  If they were ruled out, and if every item had to be proved before saying anything, this would deprive newspapers, television and the radio of a very useful function in drawing public attention to things which the public should further examine.</P>
    <P>I want to say clearly now that the Government amendment which was brought in, in answer to opposition suggestions in the Dáil, by Senator Ó Maoláin, constitutes a considerable improvement.  It suggests the addition, in paragraph 2, of the words:</P>
    <P>and whether or not these statements, comments and implications reflected reasonable journalistic care on the part of those responsible for the programme.</P>
    <P>This makes a clear improvement on the original wording.  We should consequently say something to welcome this Government amendment, which will of course be passed.</P>
    <P>I return now to the question of what I would call the procedural approach. The tribunal is being asked to examine the procedural aspects.  It is at least conceivable that the conclusions of this, or any such programme, might be correct on evidence which a court would consider insufficient.  We should reflect on that point.  The conclusions <Col N="699" /> might be based on evidence which a court would be bound to deem insufficient. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that such conclusions might be correct. Indeed, I recall with horror one case of a man being executed in this country in those conditions.  There was a temporary suspension by Government Order of the rules of evidence, which rules came into being again, after the execution.  It is possible, then, to act on a conclusion based on evidence which a court would not consider sufficient.  The conclusions might be true, though it might be difficult to establish their truth in court.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has made many statements.  We know, from our own personal experience, that this particular Minister for Justice is not overloaded with scruple in his statements. He quite boldly and brashly says things which turn out to be quite groundless.  I mentioned before the fact that he stated, publicly, confidently and persistently that I visited a prisoner of his in Mountjoy Jail.  The Minister was so ignorant about his own jail, over which he is supposed to have correct information, as to state unchecked what had been told to him, unless he just invented it.  He persisted in that statement that I had visited the prisoner.  He withdrew it only after I had denied it three or four times.  The statement was clearly improper and totally untrue.</P>

      <P>Speaking of certain TDs who have worked for RTE, the Minister referred in the Dáil to &ldquo;ex-inmates of that institution.&rdquo;<Col N="700" /> I should like to feel in relation to this particular motion that there will be some concern not only about the accuracy of the programme in its conclusions, but about the accuracy of the Minister for Justice in his public statements.  He speaks with presumed authority when he says that it is &ldquo;clear beyond question that the evidence presented in the programme is valueless&rdquo;. I feel that not to examine the validity of the evidence on the arrangements for the planning, preparation, arrangement, production and presentation, of such Ministerial statements, is to fail to follow all the implications which ought to arise in connection with a tribunal like this.  The very definite official view expressed officially in the Dáil has been mentioned by others. At column 1265, number 8 of volume 242 the Minister says:</P>
      <P>What is a certainty, however, is that if people like this are paid fees for making statements on television, these statements are, at best, quite valueless as evidence and, as I have explained, are according to themselves now, nothing more than a tissue of lies.</P>
      <P>The Minister had said a number of these people had agreed that the statements were not true.  The Minister says at column 1266 that he trusted the authorities in RTE would appreciate that:</P>
      <P>they have incurred certain obligations, including the obligation to disclose honestly whether the programme was deliberately contrived for television.</P>
      <P>Was there any such programme about which this could not be said?  What does the Minister think programmes are?  Does he think they are made for the home cinema?  I find it disturbing that having mentioned that the gardaí found &ldquo;one man&rdquo; who went back on his statements, the Minister felt justified at column 1267 in saying &ldquo;all these people&rdquo;, with reference to the statements they had got from &ldquo;all these people&rdquo; supposed to be described in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of fictitious characters.  I feel that some of the Front Bench of the Government &mdash; and I <Col N="701" /> do not include the Minister at present before us in this observation &mdash; appear to me to be fictitious.

      <P>I was speaking before the interval apropos the phrase &ldquo;fictitious characters&rdquo;, and it has sometimes seemed to me that some members of the Front Bench of the Government are fictitious characters. I find it hard to believe in their existence or that when their doings and sayings are reported that they must be programmed from afar.  However, I am assured that the Minister for Justice does, in fact, exist and indeed we have had occasional evidence of this in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that although he made some strong, affirmative and categorical statements in the Dáil the validity of the Minister's statements was not to be questioned by the tribunal; it is only RTE that is being indicted before this tribunal. I refer to column 1745, Volume 242, when the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> The fact is, there is no such thing as a strong-arm racket as suggested.</P>
    <P>and at column 1746 of the same volume the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The people who appeared on the show were &ldquo;phonies&rdquo; and we proved they were &ldquo;phonies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At column 1748 the Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>There are approximately 12 to 15 unlicensed moneylenders.  There is no strong-arm protection racket, as alleged in the show.  All that is &ldquo;phoney&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I find it disturbing that this kind of thing can be said, apparently, not only with impunity but without any necessity for the information behind it being examined by the tribunal we are being asked to set up.  My disquiet is increased by the statement at column 1859, Volume 242, when the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The presentation of such a programme is of direct interest to me as Minister for Justice, because if the evidence was genuine, and if this criminal activity was in fact going on on the scale suggested, and going on openly at that, there could be no avoiding the conclusion that the Garda Síochána would stand indicted as hopelessly incompetent.</P>
    <P>I find this disquieting, and I feel that this statement should be examined by the tribunal.  The Minister went on to say in column 1861 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>...objectively speaking, the evidence was worthless.  And when I say worthless I do not mean just that the witnesses exaggerated &mdash; I mean that nobody could rely on a word they said on that programme.</P>
    <P>This is an extreme statement which one would like to assume to be based on evidence at the Minister's command, but in the terms of reference before us we are not asked to have the evidence on which the Minister based such statements placed before the tribunal.  At column 1866 of the same volume the Minister is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> It is clear, beyond question, that the evidence presented in the programme was, as I have said, valueless.</P>
    <P>At column 1867 he said about the Garda Síochána:</P>
    <P>Their answer is that they neither know of nor suspect the existence of anything in the nature of a moneylending racket backed up by strong-arm tactics of any shape or form.</P>
    <P>The Minister further said:</P>
    <P>The Garda estimate &mdash; and I emphasise that this relates to the number of people suspected of probably being in the business and not just people who could be proved to be in it &mdash; is something of the order of 12 or 15.  Giving themselves adequate margin for error they say the figure is undoubtedly below 25.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I just draw attention to the fact that the Minister in this passage recognises that he might conceivably say something which is true, and even the Gardaí might say something that is true, without being able to prove it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I consider the terms of reference not to be wide enough and that they do not cover the whole question of the extent to which this unlicensed moneylending goes on.  It is quite clear that there is on this a strong disparity of opinion, considering what the Minister says, what appeared on the programme and from what Senator Dunne told us today.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to one or two of the interruptions made by the Leader of the House.  I, too, frequently engage in the same kind of very orderly and useful interruption as the Leader of the House, but occasionally he indulges not only in interruptions but in eruptions, which is less helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The question that he asked today rather surprised me.  Before, however, coming to that specifically I should like to ask him and, indeed, to ask the House, if we should be satisfied with a moneylending <Col N="705" /> Act which as Senator Alexis FitzGerald has told us, has been little changed, apart from some minor amendments in 1929, since it came into being in 1900 &mdash; a moneylending Act which allows the lending of money at 39 per cent?  Do we consider that to be a legitimate rate?</P>
      <P>Now, arising out of the question put by Senator Ó Maoláin about the 1921 Act, I refer him again to the preamble to this Act which, as I said, was passed by the British House of Commons on the 24th March, 1921:</P>
      <P>Be it enacted by the King's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advise and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows....</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin seemed inspired to ask if it was not true that this Act was passed in a war situation.  I would grant him that.  This was a war situation in relation to England and Ireland. We were fighting for independence, and I pay tribute to those, including Senator Ó Maoláin, who risked a lot during that period.  However, Senator Alexis FitzGerald is justified in saying that although there was then a war situation, this Act was not introduced in order to meet that.  It was not introduced specifically for Ireland by reason of the war situation or for that particular war, but for a situation which they thought they were improving in all of the then United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be so that Senator Alexis FitzGerald is justified in contending that under the 1937 Constitution this Act was rendered invalid in certain contexts.  This may be so, but I consider it legitimate to remind Senator Ó Maoláin that this is the very Act, with all its references to &ldquo;the King's Most Excellent Majesty&rdquo; and so on, under which the Taoiseach purports to be setting up this tribunal, and under which Senator Ó Maoláin proposes here that we set it up.  I ask Senator Ó Maoláin what he is talking about.  Does he not want anything to do with it because it mentions the &ldquo;King's Most Excellent Majesty&rdquo;, or is he simply bowing down before this Act and the King's Most Excellent <Col N="706" /> Majesty and accepting it and using it as an acceptable device&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was made clear of course by Senator Alexis FitzGerald that appearing before a tribunal set up under this very Act with all the references to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, in 24th March, 1921, if any person, and I am quoting from section 1 (2) of the Act:</P>
      <P>If any person (a) on being duly summoned as a witness before a tribunal makes default in attending; or (b) being in attendance as a witness refuses to take an oath legally required by the tribunal to be taken, or to produce any document in his power or control legally required by the tribunal to be produced by him, or to answer any question to which the tribunal may legally require an answer; or (c) does any other thing which would, if the tribunal had been a court of law having power to commit for contempt, have been contempt of that court;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He can be punished for contempt of court.  This means one can be jailed if one refuses to produce documents, refuses to reveal the source of one's information, or refuses to produce all one's tapes, documents and so on.

      <P>I never do that, but when they come I try to deal with them.  As I was saying, unknown to a certain person or persons, certain things will be possible before such a tribunal which I think would horrify anybody who is concerned with the freedom of journalistic inquiry and journalism.  What is being done in this kind of programme is of course an operation in free inquiry, and I feel that what is implied by such a tribunal in the original Act, with which certain people have not up till now been very fully informed, implied in the 1921 Act, give to the tribunal powers which we must really realise before we pass this Motion.  It would be absurd for us to set up a tribunal and to say afterwards: &ldquo;We did not know that it <Col N="709" /> would have these powers.&rdquo;  This I am afraid is what is suggested.  We must realise that we are setting up a tribunal which will have the power not only to require that all the sources of information and all the documents and tapes shall be brought before it, but have the power also to jail for contempt any journalist, or inquirer, or research worker, of RTE who, on professional grounds, insists on protecting his sources of information.  I do not know whether it is sincerely claimed by some Senators that they did not realise that, but I feel it my duty if there were any others than those who have said that they were ignorant about such tribunals, to inform them of the facts.</P>
      <P>It is possible of course that if, as Senator Alexis FitzGerald seems to suggest, the way in which this Act is being used should contravene certain basic principles of our Constitution and that somebody who considers himself wronged under this tribunal, and under the Motion we are now passing, might have recourse to the courts to have the tribunal declared unconstitutional under the 1937 Constitution. However, one thing we cannot contend, is that (a) this British Act of March, 1921 is invalid because it was produced &ldquo;in a war situation&rdquo;, and (b) it is perfectly valid because we are going to use it now to set up this tribunal.</P>
      <P>I wonder, consequent on the inquiry of Senator Ó Maoláin, whether he will, in the light of the knowledge that has been placed before him by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and by myself, he will ask leave to withdraw the motion on the grounds that the war situation of 1921 was such, and the wording of the original Act was such, that we as free Irishmen could not possibly accept it with all its references to the majesty of the King and so on.  I take it this is not his intention.  I remain, therefore, a bit puzzled about his intentions.  He should, unless he intends to ask leave to withdraw the motion, publicly and most emphatically proclaim that this British Act of March, 1921, is a good Act, and that it is upon this Act that he and we are still perfectly satisfied in 1969 to rely, for the setting up of this tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House <Col N="710" /> very much more but I thought it necessary just to indicate that this talk about the &ldquo;war situation&rdquo; in 1921 unless the people using this argument are prepared to condemn the Act, is simply eye-wash and hypocritical eye-wash at that.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of reference then which it is proposed to amend, and I am supporting all three amendments, the effect of these amendments would be to prevent the focus of this tribunal from being too narrow, on mere procedures, arrangements and so on and not, as the amendments require, sufficiently on the broad question of the major social problems involved in the whole matter of this television show on moneylenders, and of the way in which it was contemptuously dealt with in the Dáil by the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>To take this debate from the academic attitude that has prevailed and bring it down to the actual facts as to what has happened and why we are debating this, I as a country Senator beg to speak on behalf of the plain, ordinary country people who are still the majority in this country. Moneylending is the subject of this motion.  Moneylending is as old as money and if I wanted to take it from the sublime to the ridiculous I would go so far as to say that I also am an illegal moneylender because I will give money to my friends.  But the point in question is that the television programme showed a certain type of moneylender who used the strong-arm stuff.  Following that there was a question in the Dáil by the Leader of the Labour Party on the whole question of moneylending and when the Minister made his reply he told the House, and in particular the Opposition, that this had been investigated by the Garda Síochána and that they could not find an iota of truth to the extent that was suggested by that programme.  Following that, the Leader of the Labour Party and also the Fine Gael Party in the House jumped to their feet and demanded this tribunal.</P>

      <P>The plain people of Ireland, and I talk about the majority again, would like to know the simple answer of whether it is RTE or the Garda Síochána who are right.  That to me is the logical thing about this. It is a funny thing that right down through the years anything which has been said through the medium of the press has more or less been believed by the plain people of Ireland.  I would go so far as to say most things said on RTE are believed by the plain people of Ireland.  I feel I am quite right in saying that and I think that is one reason why the plain people of Ireland should be given the truth now. I am not afraid, and never have been afraid of the truth.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House, as I know the Minister is coming in at 4.30, but there is just one thing I should like to talk about and that is something which was said by Senator Dunne.  I am a young fellow who has always admired men like Senator Dunne, and particularly Senator Dunne himself, but I fail to see how he could stand up in this House, after knowing him for so long and reading contributions by him, and say that in one street in this city there were more than 20 illegal moneylenders.  God knows, if that is true Senator Dunne should have at least mentioned it a long time ago.</P>

      <P>As a new Senator in this House I am really appalled at this. I thought that when a Senator was making a maiden speech he was allowed do so without interruption. However, I have learned something today and I will know what to do the next time.  I will give back as good as I get.  Now, coming back to Senator Dunne, I thought he was leaning on the left, if you know what I mean, when he said he is delighted with the performance of RTE.  So am I.  I am not against it.  They have come up very well and they are really satisfying most of the people, but on this motion I fail to see why Senator Dunne said that he believes RTE were right.  I cannot understand why he has spoken at all on this motion because if he goes in with his mind fully made up that RTE or the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme in question were perfectly right, what is the point in standing up here and speaking on this motion? I say, as a rural chap speaking for the plain people in the country, I welcome this.  The truth will come out and we will welcome it.  When the truth comes out we will be delighted with it.  Whatever way it may go, that is the important thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>As another countryman, like my friend the Senator on the other side of the House, I should like to make a countryman's contribution to this debate as well.  The legalistic <Col N="714" /> end of it has been very well put by Senator Bourke and the other people who have intervened in the debate but to me this thing is not just as simple as even the legalistic people have made it.</P>
      <P>A new departure is about to come &mdash; that the Government, on the evidence and on the results of the tribunal to be set up, will be in a position to say to RTE: &ldquo;This you shall do, and this you shall not do&rdquo;.  Up to the present time nobody has laid down strict lines of procedure for RTE and said: &ldquo;You must not tread on this fellow's toes or you must not tread on my toes&rdquo;.  The Government, having said that, are saying in effect: &ldquo;You must not tread on our political toes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The kernel of the nut is the attitude of the Minister for Justice in Dáil Éireann when he came in and said that the programme as set out by RTE was wrong in concept, was wrong in presentation, was wrong in the matters it portrayed for the general public. Nobody said to RTE before this: &ldquo;You must not dramatise a situation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>RTE sell their viewing to the public purely on the basis of dramatisation, let it be entertainment or otherwise, and nobody will sit and listen to a programme unless it is dramatised to suit that person's mind.  It does not matter what the concept is, it does not matter what the message is.  Everybody realises you cannot and will not get people to listen to a programme unless you make this programme appeal to them.  Everybody in the country knows, whether the RTE people were justified in their approach to it, that there is an illegal moneylending problem.  Perhaps it is as great as was stated by RTE and if it is found that it is not as great, to bring home the facts to the public mind that such illegal activity exists is part of the duty of RTE, and the tribunal's eventual findings I think will justify RTE in their attitude towards it.  What I am worried about is that a Government, even though RTE is, to some extent, State-sponsored, should have the right to muzzle anybody in RTE whether at the production end or at any other stage.  I do not want to see a situation in which any Government would have that right.</P>

      <P>It was proved, I think, that in the first paragraph of the motion there was a limitation of the scope of section 2 of the Act.  I think that Senator Bourke said that her amendment would not narrow the scope but it would give it a broader perspective and that that is the way to look at it.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that a lot of people down the country are alarmed at the whole situation, though not alarmed at the business of moneylending which has been well known over many years, and it is known that there are racketeers involved in this thing, and have been as far down as the West of Ireland.  This thing is known, but they are alarmed that any body, any Government or any party, should intervene to attempt to muzzle RTE.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice definitely stated in the House that RTE's findings were wrong according to the gardaí, and that is prejudging the situation, and the day that the members of the tribunal, whoever selects them, come to deal with this situation they will definitely have the records of both Houses before them and they will be swayed by the things that have been said here.  I think that this is something that is quite wrong. I do not think that it is right that we in this House and the people in the Dáil should have spoken of the situation, because this is prejudging it, and this necessarily means that the tribunal will be taking into account all the things that have been said here and in the other House, which I think is wrong, though there is nothing that can be done about that now.</P>

      <P>There is an old axiom in television that when people stop talking about you you had better watch out because you are losing your grip.  Certainly, judging by the last couple of days there is no doubt about it that television is alive, and very much alive.  It is possibly because of that that this motion has come before this House from the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many other Senators, including Senator Dunne, I personally welcome the very thorough examinations television has made from time to time into many aspects of the life of our community. I am reminded of a remark that was passed to me some years ago <Col N="718" /> by somebody from the country, unlike myself, when there had been a very interesting feature on the Late Late Show and a reference to a member of our hierarchy.  I said: &ldquo;What do you think of that sort of thing?&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are only saying on television what we have been saying around the pubs.&rdquo;  As I see it, the object in setting up this tribunal is to try to define the difference between the information available to the gardaí and the information available to the production team of &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; who put on this programme.  The most important thing here is, it seems to me, that we should not devote so much time to whether there are moneylenders and how many there are, as to trying to ascertain how the differences arise in the information available apparently to the Garda Síochána on the one hand and to all of us seeing the programme on Telefis Éireann on the other hand.</P>
    <P>RTE should not have any objection to demonstrating how they secured the information available which they put on the screen.  They should not be afraid to show how this programme was planned, prepared and arranged.  So long as there is nothing to hide I do not see any cause for anxiety.  There is probably a certain difference in the sense that we all know that information would not not be as easily available to the gardaí as it would be to any ordinary member of the public.  The divergencies here are so great that it seems to be worthwhile trying to ascertain what valid evidence there is.</P>
    <P>I listened with great care to Senator Bourke who said she was putting her point of view as a lawyer.  She put it sincerely and effectively.  I myself am not a lawyer.  She stressed that the amendment she was putting forward is less restrictive.  It would seem to me to be more restrictive.  She suggested that friends of hers in RTE would not continue to work there if these procedures and methods were adopted.  I would be sorry to think this because the object of setting up this tribunal is to ascertain the truth.  It is not set up in order to organise a witch-hunt. The programme made such an impact on people in general that it would be <Col N="719" /> a good thing to be able to satisfy the public as to whether it is entirely true. I am not competent to follow Senator Bourke in her references to the precedent that is being established.  I would have said that any work done by any organisation such as RTE, and the manner in which it is being done, should be satisfactory.  Senator Kelly referred in passing to the statement made in 1966 by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass.  I would have interpreted the statement to which Senator Kelly referred in reference to the responsibility which the Government have under the Act to direct RTE if it should be going wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">

The reaction of all other organisations in the country when they are subjected to criticism is also sensitive as have been the reactions of both Opposition parties and members of them.  Reactions of institutions such as the Catholic Church and the trade unions when under criticism have also been sensitive.</P>

      <P>I was impressed by Senator Jessop speaking in relation to this motion and in relation to the amendment, because where the amendment refers in general to authenticity, which is incidentally referred to under paragraph 2, paragraph 1 refers to the planning, preparation, arrangement and production.  Surely in the examination by this tribunal the methods of securing information are also important. The Senator referred to the possibility of the machinery being faulty in RTE.  I hope I am not going away from the discussion.  It is important that this aspect should be examined.  Paragraph 1 enables the tribunal to examine this aspect.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald doubts the wisdom and constitutionality of the motion.  Not being legally informed I do not know what the Constitution side is but I presume that our Constitution would enable the Oireachtas to set up a tribunal to examine any matter which is described here as &ldquo;a definite matter of urgent public importance&rdquo;.  I do not think there is any curtailment of the rights of any individual in the setting up of such a tribunal.  Senator FitzGerald suggests also that the Act should not be directed against the free expression of opinion, but this is not intended in the setting up of this tribunal.  What we want to find out is the truth and I do not think anybody on the Government side would wish to restrict the free expression of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to how the Authority is carrying out its duty and he seemed to think that it should be dismissed if the Government thought it was not carrying out its duty.  I believe that the RTE Authority and the executives in RTE are doing their very best in handling this extremely important medium.  I do not think it should be assumed that the Broadcasting Act, 1960, which comes up for review next year is a perfect instrument but it was the only instrument available in order to make way for this new medium &mdash; an extremely powerful medium as many members of the Seanad have mentioned &mdash; and I hope Senator Quinlan will keep in mind if <Col N="722" /> we are discussing possible amendments to the Broadcasting Act that one should try and learn from the experience of the past.  I think the Act has worked reasonably well in itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Dunne spoke of the great social service which RTE is performing and I agree with him on this.  It is very necessary in a free society and I am inclined to go along with him &mdash; despite what Senator Killilea said &mdash; that there are probably many more moneylenders than the numbers we have evidence of at the moment.  As Senator Killilea said, from the time money was created there were moneylenders but we know there are moneylenders and moneylenders and it is important to distinguish one from the other.  Senator Killilea said he might lend a £ to somebody; many of us have done this but not in order to make a tremendous profit, merely to help a friend.</P>
    <P>Senator Dunne also said that we should be prepared to face criticism and to learn to live with it and here again I agree with him.  It is very important that we should be able to face any criticism because this is how society survives and improves.  Senator Dunne agreed with Senator Cranitch that freedom of expression must not deteriorate into licence.  This to me is also important: freedom is not something you can do what you like with but it carries a considerable degree of responsibility.  There is no need for me to speak about the people who have made sacrifices for freedom, but there are in many countries at the present time people who would sacrifice their lives for the freedom we have here and for the freedom we are insisting that organs such as RTE should continue to have.</P>
    <P>RTE is a national medium which should be prepared to show in this instance, where a difference exists between the evidence produced by them and the gardaí, how it operates.  The people own RTE; neither we nor the Opposition own it, it is owned by the people and administered under an Act for the people.  It is not a privately-owned newspaper that can read or write any personal or private views anybody may have because under the <Col N="723" /> Act it must adhere to impartiality. Regarding Senator Sheehy Skeffington's reference I am glad that it has been made clear in the Dáil that the inquiry may be held in public or private as may seem necessary or desirable.  I welcome this because it will enable any of those who may have to give evidence to do so in private.  It is well known that journalists from time to time must protect their sources of information and indeed that some journalists have elected to go to prison rather than disclose information given to them in confidence.  This is something I support and I presume that when this matter comes before the tribunal this principle will be upheld.</P>

One Senator mentioned that it was a reflection on the Government that they were not in communication with RTE, that the methods of communication were bad and as a result there were problems.  I should like to know one simple answer. How if you are fulfilling responsibility as a Minister or as a Government, can you communicate with a body, when every time you do so a whisper goes around and before you know where you are responsible Opposition members in the different Houses are saying that the Government are interfering with RTE.</P>

      <P>I maintain that the Government have never abused their power under the Act but I hope I will be allowed to say that there is always the possibility that anybody in Telefís Éireann who is given an instruction by an executive may draw the conclusion that this instruction was coming from the Government when in fact it is merely an ordinary internal discipline. This is worth keeping in mind because there is a lot of confusion with regard to RTE and a good deal of this confusion is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the question rightly raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington in relation to contempt of court cannot arise and that any journalist will be entitled to claim the privilege of giving evidence in private.  One other point which I should like to make in relation to the amendments is that if any Member of this House was a member of a research team in an organisation such as RTE and if he were instructed to go out and investigate a particular matter while, at the same time, being told that there was one area that should not be examined, I know what the reaction of any Senator would be to that and I know even better what the reaction of anybody in RTE would be.  Yet, it seems to me that the amendment was intended to wipe out that side of things in paragraph 1 which deals with the planning, preparation and production of the recent programme.  If that is the purpose of the amendment, I could not support it because in this case the tribunal should be entitled, above all else, to examine all aspects and our own people in RTE should be prepared <Col N="725" /> to place all the relevant data at the disposal of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that the freedom which RTE have is healthy for our society, but where any serious doubt is cast either on their programmes or, as in this case, on the gardaí, then as far as possible these doubts should be resolved and that is the purpose of setting up this tribunal. We must not forget that whereas freedom of speech is essential there should not be any danger of abuse of this privilege.  I hope this inquiry will result in resolving this matter and that it will throw light on the entire subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I have only a few minutes in which to speak on account of the agreement to wind up the debate, I shall just make one point and that is that, like most people who have spoken here today, I am anxious that the truth should be established. Shortly before this &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme was screened there was a similar programme on the smuggling of pigs and, as a farmer, I was very interested in that programme.  An indication that that programme portrayed the truth was that the price of pigs shot up on the home market by 10s per cwt. dead weight, during the following week, presumably because the customs officials had become a little active, which resulted in the supply from the North being cut off or at least greatly reduced.  Members of the farming community can at least be grateful to the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; team for highlighting this problem with which we have had to contend all summer and for many months back.  There must be some organ in the country to highlight such rackets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If RTE embark on this policy we would all like to be assured that the programmes screened were 100 per cent truthful, as I believe they have been up to now.  The debate has been eminently successful but most people spoke without going too close to the real problem, which is moneylending. This is what we should be investigating. We should be endeavouring to cut out the bad apple in our society and the Government would be much better employed in endeavouring to launch <Col N="726" /> small loans to help the people who avail of these illegal moneylenders to get out of the grips of the moneylenders in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to treat the amendments before the House in order, starting with the one in the name of Senator Ó Maoláin.  Together with Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I welcome this amendment.  A similar amendment which I put down in my own name and that of Senator Bourke still finds expression in a major amendment in the fifth line of the text on the Order Paper.  I must add that neither of us has the slightest objection to the elimination of these two words if the amendment as proposed by Senator Ó Maoláin is subsequently to be added to this as the House goes through its procedure.  Even at this, I do not consider that Senator Ó Maoláin's amendment does any more than patch up what is essentially a bad job.</P>
      <P>The second amendment which is in my name is also part of an attempt to patch up what I consider to be a bad job.  It will be noted that relatively few people have spoken on this amendment during the course of the debate.  I am glad to say that Senator Sheehy Skeffington welcomed it and I know that I am supported in the amendment by Senator Bourke.  I do not know if I should be gladdened by the fact that none of the Senators who spoke on the other side of the House has spoken against the amendment.  It seems to be a rather obvious amendment but I should like to explain why I consider it to be necessary.  As I understand the tribunal of inquiry, it will not be possible for persons with experience of or knowledge of or information about the habits and practices of illegal moneylending to offer evidence to the tribunal unless they are called to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this could be a very limiting qualification on the tribunal and on their activities.  I may be wrong about this.  If so, I should be very glad to have an assurance from the Minister to the effect that the tribunal will welcome submissions under oath, which they consider relevant, <Col N="727" /> from persons and organisations who may be so involved and who may be in possession of such or similar information.  I shall give very briefly one or two examples of the type of person covered by this amendment.</P>
    <P>There are, for example, a considerable number in the city of Dublin, in Cork, and I am not sure about Limerick, of licensed moneylenders.  I do not stand here as their representative but I can conceive it as quite possible that they, too, would like to give evidence under oath to this tribunal about their own practice of their business, about the methods they employ and indeed, as good businessmen, about any unauthorised competition which they feel may be damaging their business. I in no way consider myself as their representative or as holding a brief for them, but I can see that in a democratic tribunal these people should be heard.</P>
    <P>Then there are the people who are perhaps most closely involved in picking up the wreckage that is left from the activities of unlicensed moneylenders. I am talking about the organisers, officials and members of credit unions all over the country. These people have a very real interest in swearing evidence to this tribunal. I should hate to think that because of the terms of reference they would not be allowed to do so because somebody did not see fit to call them to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a third category of people whose interest in this is very real.  I am speaking about the great number of religious and welfare organisations who are very active in that part of the community's life which is at or below the subsistence level.  It may be presumed that they would have evidence, often first hand, of the kind of activities which this tribunal will examine. Again, I should like my amendment passed to make it absolutely clear that people in this kind of position, public-spirited people, will have every opportunity, if the tribunal consider it relevant, to offer evidence on the subject which is very close to their normal lives and to the normal activities of their organisations.  Indeed, as I understand <Col N="728" /> the terms of reference at the moment, they should act even to exclude, unless he were expressly called by the tribunal itself to give evidence, Senator Dunne, one of whose more remarkable statements here this morning was that there were streets in Dublin with more than 25 unlicensed moneylenders in them.  I want this position cleared up.</P>
    <P>We have been assured by the Government that this tribunal will go fully into the facts of moneylending. There is a reference at paragraph 2 of the Government's motion and at No. 1 in the motion as amended to a correct and fair representation of the facts.  If one is to find out whether a television programme amounted to a correct and fair representation of the facts, it follows as night follows day that one must find out what the facts are.  I am concerned to widen the scope of the inquiry in this way to ensure that every possible way of finding out what the facts are is available to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with these two amendments, I should like to move to the substantive amendment in the name of Senator Miss Bourke and myself which I am now seconding.  I do so with some sadness and in a very real sense, also together with Senator Miss Bourke, as a person who is not a member of a political party.  I do so as a journalist and as a parliamentarian who has never been convinced and who has never asked for the institution of an inquiry of the kind that is envisaged in the Government's proposed terms of reference.  I shall not get tremendously rhetorical and worked up about freedom of speech but I am sickened and disgusted that the Government should have seen fit to bring in a motion proposing these terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I am also saddened by the fact that it took the many members of the other two parties a considerable time to realise exactly what were the implications of asking for an inquiry without making clear, except I believe in the case of the Labour Party, what exactly they wanted to inquire into.  We have even had from the Opposition side in this House and in the other House the <Col N="729" /> statement that the Minister for Justice had &ldquo;ambushed&rdquo; the situation.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald this morning complimented this Minister on his cleverness in acting in the way that he had done.  As somebody who likes to approach this from a reasonably independent point of view, I think it is a very poor defence for one's lack of foresight to complain that the other fellow was more clever than you were. I am glad to see that there has been a distinct hardening of attitude on this side of the House and indeed on the Opposition side in Dáil Éireann on this matter and I would urge the Government to give it more consideration than they have given to it up to now.</P>
    <P>The first main point I must deal with as a reason for this amendment in our names is that it creates a precedent of extraordinary gravity.  I do not know whether Members of the House are aware precisely of the kind of precedent that is involved.  It may be urged from the other side of the House, indeed I am surprised it has not already been urged, that this House does not create precedents, that this House does not bind itself, that the Oireachtas is a sovereign assembly.  So it is, but to speak about precedents in this way is altogether too abstract, too unreal and, dare I suggest it, too academic.  It is quite in order for this House to say in the morning that black is white, but because for years this House has acted on the assumption that black is black it is very unlikely that it will do so. This is what is meant by precedents. Precedents are established not only, and in some cases not at all, in the dry pages of legal textbooks but in the sweat and battle of political and social encounter, and this is the kind of precedent that we are running the risk of establishing here.</P>
    <P>May I refer briefly to something Senator Keery said.  He implied in his speech that no precedent was involved. He is reported in this morning's paper &mdash; which does not give the full text but is reasonably accurate &mdash; as saying that any journalist is always aware that at some stage some part of his work might bring him before a court of inquiry.  So he did not see that this was <Col N="730" /> any new form of threat.  If Senator Keery does not see that the terms of reference of this inquiry do not post some new form of threat to journalists as a whole, and not only to those in Radio Telefís Éireann, I am very sorry because I believe passionately that they do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>To take one very simple question, to say that there are 500 unlicensed moneylenders in Dublin, whether this statement be true or false, or partially true, is not actionable we have now created a situation in which a person by virtue of making a statement that is not actionable in any court of law is hauled before a tribunal of inquiry with powers of the High Court.  This can have and will have a most intimidating effect on freedom of expression, not only in the station but indeed outside it.  Again, I wonder, and I should be glad if the Minister can enlighten me on this, to what extent procedure as adopted in other countries has been followed or even examined in the drawing up of these terms of reference by the Government.</P>
      <P>I would bring three specific instances to the Minister's attention, all of which imply very clearly that the terms of reference put forward to us by the Government give to the inquiry powers which no Government have ever sought to give to an inquiry <i>per se</i> and create a situation which no Government have ever sought to create, with respect to the median.  I am thinking of two cases for instance in Holland, where admittedly the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act does not apply.  I will deal with them very briefly because they are very relevant.  Dutch television have in the past created nation-wide scandal with two programmes.  One was about the activities of Holland and of Dutch administrators in the Dutch East Indies.  The second was a programme exposing, or at least commenting in a very critical way, on the activities of a gentleman well known to us here, Mr. Cornelius Verolme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the reaction of the Dutch Government to those two television <Col N="731" /> problems, which had an effect, in the country in which they were produced, at least as sensational as the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme which is to be the subject of this tribunal?  The Government set up two inquiries &mdash; I cannot remember at what level they were set up but I think the second one was on a Parliamentary level &mdash; to inquire not into the television programmes, but into the affairs of the administration of the Dutch East Indies and of the affairs of Mr. Cornelius Verolme, as part of which, needless to say, the relevant journalists and the relevant people they criticized were called to give evidence under oath.</P>
    <P>This is an obvious precedent and I am surprised to see why the Government have not followed it by setting up an inquiry into the problem of illegal moneylending, to which would be summoned, quite naturally, the journalists who had made the programme and, also quite naturally, people who had made statements about it, such as the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, but the more recent affair of Dr. Verolme shows if anything the continuity of a tradition in which, whoever is put in the dock it is not the people who make television programmes, who in conscience attempt to expose what they seem to think is something wrong and in need of being exposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third case, and this is much nearer to home, is the case of the Vassall Tribunal, which has already been mentioned in several newspapers. In the case of the Vassall Tribunal, which was set up under the very same Act which I presume will apply to the tribunal to be set up as a result of this motion, it was set up to examine questions affecting public security, far and away more serious than the <Col N="732" /> question of illegal moneylending, to be investigated here, although I am in no way agreeing that the question of moneylending is not in itself serious. The British Government of that time did not see fit, and saw no necessity, to give to the tribunal powers to investigate the articles written by the journalists, as a result of which, in the words of R. Denning, the tribunal was set up.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, and in spite of the fact that the Government had not given the tribunal those terms of reference, within the limitations of the Act, the tribunal were able to send three journalists to prison for varying lengths of time.  This shows that in framing the terms of reference in the way they have, the Government have been ignorant not only of the precedent which they are establishing but also of the terms and of the powers given to any tribunal under this Act, the powers which I consider are quite wide enough to allow us to dispense not only with paragraph 1, but also with paragraphs 3 and 4 of the original motion.</P>
    <P>Now, to come back for one final comment on this question of precedent: if, for example, the Irish Medical Association were to commission a team to produce a report on the danger of lung cancer arising from smoking, one does not immediately assail the team after it has brought in a report, which it is fully qualified to bring in, and over which it has spent a great deal of time and presumably a great deal of money.  This is almost an exact parallel with the situation we are discussing here.  Quite frankly, I am now, I have always been and I think I always will be against any inquiry into a television programme, a radio programme or a piece of journalism as a piece of television, radio or journalism or whatever it is.  The only form of inquiry I would be prepared to welcome would be an inquiry into the authenticity of the material between the programmes.</P>
    <P>We must take into consideration, when we are deciding whether to accept or reject the Government's motion &mdash; the reasons were which caused the Government to bring this motion before us.  Part of the reasons <Col N="733" /> clearly is the fact that the Fine Gael and Labour Parties asked for an inquiry, although in one or two instances they were not careful enough about specifying the kind of inquiry they wanted.  The Taoiseach has stated that the inquiry had to be set up after the RTE Authority issued their statement. If I may quote him on this, he said &mdash; this is an indirect speech &mdash; it was after RTE issued a statement that the Government decided a public inquiry was necessary.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this implies to me that &ldquo;after&rdquo; is almost as good as &ldquo;because&rdquo;.  I will not equate them precisely but I think this is fairly adequate.</P>
      <P>We have the position in which RTE issued a statement.  The Government, we in this House, and every Member of the Oireachtas would be perfectly justified in criticising severely the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority if they had not made the investigation as a result of which and on which they based their subsequent statement.  If they had failed to make this inquiry, whatever about issuing a statement, which they so obviously made, they would have been in grave dereliction of their duty under the Broadcasting Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the situation in which the Government are not satisfied with the activity which is carried on by one <Col N="734" /> of their statutory authorities in a statutory manner and are setting up another organisation to do the same thing by other means.  It looks to the plain people of Ireland, as indeed it looks to me, as if the Government, unsatisfied, are trying to have a second bite at the cherry, and I do not think that this should be allowed.</P>
    <P>To me, though I may be wrong about this but I doubt it very much, the source and origin of this inquiry were the statements made by various persons in a privileged position in Dáil Éireann, and I feel that if, for example, the Minister for Justice had taken the Labour Party's original questions in the sense in which they were intended, and instead of attempting to refute the suggestions made in the programme, had offered to investigate them in an ordinary and democratic kind of way, none of this would have happened.  But it has happened and I am very sorry that it has happened in this way.</P>
    <P>Again, there is a whole history of matters into which I will not go in any great detail because they have been gone into in both Houses, which leads one to suspect that the attitude of the Government to broadcasting in general is not at all a healthy one.  It is an attitude which influences me very much when I am trying to decide what kind of attitude to take to this motion and what form of amendment to put to it.</P>
    <P>We have had the statement by Deputy Lemass which has been reported already.  We have had the statement by the Leader of this House in the very recent past.  We have had the almost complete failure of the Government to exercise the orthodox machinery of communication with the broadcasting authority as laid down in the Broadcasting Act.  All these things have been gone into in some detail, but there is a final one which I think is just as important, and this is the almost Pavlovian reaction &mdash; and I regret this &mdash; evidenced by members of the Government and of the Government Party in the Dáil and Seanad when any question about television comes up.</P>
    <P>To show how Pavlovian this is, and how much a conditioned reflex it is, I <Col N="735" /> would ask Senators, and Members of the other House, how many of them even know of, much less heard, a programme on the radio about moneylending in the past?  How many of them heard the broadcasting of a letter from a social worker in Mr. John O'Donovan's programme, the name of which I cannot remember, within, as far as I remember, the last fortnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in which this social worker stated that religious orders were keeping the family allowance books of persons to whom they had made cash advances?  We have had no reaction in the Dáil or Seanad to this kind of statement, while we have this extraordinary reaction on the part of Deputies, I am afraid of all parties, to the question of television.  At column 450 in the debate on the Appropriation Bill on 4th December, 1969, the Leas-Chathaoirleach said that &ldquo;references to people outside the House are to be deprecated.&rdquo;  This is a very simple, obvious rule, and a very valid and important one.  I would not go so far as to teach my grandmother to suck eggs, and I am including the Leader of the House in that category, but I would suggest that the fear of broadcasting has been responsible for more breaches of Parliamentary decorum and tradition in each of these Houses than any other subject since the end of the Civil War. This has created a situation, a consciousness and an attitude, especially on the part of the Government, which has been directly responsible for the present inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Government are determined that there should be an inquiry.  Very well.  What sort of inquiry should there be?  The amendment in the names of Senator Bourke and myself does does certain very specific things.  In the first place it seeks to cut out completely No. 1 of the terms of the Government motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It cuts out the first <Col N="736" /> two lines and incorporates the rest of it with No. 2.  The legal reasons for this have been explained very adequately by Senator Bourke.  Senator Ryan, in an attempt to pour oil on troubled waters, said that the tribunal would not be confined in dealing with the points of the reference to the order in which they appear.  That is to say, that they would not have to deal with No. 1 first and No. 2 secondly.  On the other hand he did say that the whole point of having these in a particular order and with particular numbers after them was so that the tribunal could report by numbers.  I submit that if they are going to report specifically on it as it is done here most of the legal problems envisaged by Senator Miss Bourke will arise very considerably indeed.  We object to this for this reason and also because we think that this is the proper prerogative of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority and we believe that the authority have exercised their prerogative in a most responsible way.  We believe that to the extent to which any investigation into this planning, preparation, arrangement and presentation is necessary it is covered, and more than covered, by the terms of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act which will apply to the working of the tribunal.  From my reading of that Act it appears that not only No. 1 but Nos. 3 and 4 are irrelevant as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have this very important question about proof.  Senator Ryan said &mdash; and I took a note of what he was saying because I thought it was very important &mdash; that the onus of proof does not arise in this tribunal.  I should very much like to believe Senator Ryan but he finds himself in a minority of one in his own party. May I read again what the Taoiseach said, as reported in the newspapers.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The issue of the conflict of evidence between these two important bodies could only be resolved in the manner proposed.&rdquo;  I give another quotation, from Senator Killilea: &ldquo;That plain people of Ireland would like to know the simple answer &mdash; is it Radio Telefís Éireann or the Garda Síochána that is right?&rdquo;  In a more muted way, Senator Brugha pointed out that the task of the tribunal was, and I quote: &ldquo;to try to define <Col N="737" /> the difference between the information available to the Garda Síochána and the information available to the production team of this programme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So there you have the extraordinary situation that on the one hand you have Senator Ryan saying that the onus of proof is not in question and on the other hand you have almost every other speaker on the Government side turning this whole situation into an absurd and dangerous game of cops and robbers.  I think that the tribunal are entitled to more positive and distinct guidance on this than they will receive from reading the debates and the speeches of Government Deputies and Senators in these debates, and this is why we have tried to make such guidance explicit in our amendment.</P>
    <P>What is the point of the whole thing?  There are, I think, three very important things here.  The first is the question of free speech <i>per se.</i>  The second is the function of journalism in society.  The third is the question of the relationship between journalism and Parliament.  We must make the point if we are interested in freedom of speech that no one is in the dock in this tribunal, and that is a point that I suggest is made with far more clarity in our amendment than has been made in the Government's muddled and confused version of the same thing.  We must also make the point that if people of conscience and integrity and professional training and skill go to the lengths of making statements about this in good conscience, then I submit we should examine, not their consciences, but the statements they make. The terms of reference of the motion as presented by the Government do that. They try to examine the consciences of people in full possession of their faculties and who are honest, intelligent and skilled members of a profession at least as old as politics, and the statements which they have made in good faith.  In today's paper it is reported that Senator Nash said:</P>
    <P>that it was of the utmost importance where there was a difference of opinion between two State bodies &mdash; RTE and the Garda Síochána &mdash; on the question of the number of unlicensed moneylenders in the city <Col N="738" /> that there should be the fullest possible investigation.  It was also important to discover if these moneylenders had strong-armed men who would go so far as to break the limbs and bones of people and burn their cars or even, perhaps, burn their houses.</P>
    <P>This statement might have been made by any public-spirited citizen.  It is in fact almost a paraphrase of the programme under discussion.  But Senator Nash also says: &ldquo;It is important to establish which story was true&rdquo;.  We are back at the cops and robbers game again.  We must not allow ourselves to examine people's consciences like this when we should be examining the facts which their consciences led them to reveal.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that the journalistic profession is a law unto itself.  It is subject not only to the normal checks and processes of law but to a very high standard of professional ethics which at times amounts almost to an obsession.  Among the temptations to which the journalist is subject are the two temptations of laziness and trivialisation.  Journalists are more likely to be lazy and trivial than to stick their necks out in a programme which will create difficulties and start a controversy.</P>
      <P>There is something known as &ldquo;muck-raking&rdquo;.  I do not mean the sordid business of interfering with the private lives of people.  I am talking about the necessary business of stirring up the sediment of society and looking at the dirt lying at the bottom of the bottle.  When this is done it is quite unethical, and extraordinary to examine the people who happen to be wielding the rake instead of the dirt they have stirred up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to my last point, which is the relationship between journalism <Col N="739" /> and Parliament.  This is a fundamental point.  Journalists are not in competition with Parliament.  Parliament is not in competition with journalists.  In so far as each acts as a check on the kind of situation which was dealt with in this programme they can be described as fulfilling complementary roles.  This is a very simple truth which needs to be stated with great clarity because, to me, the terms of the motion convey the distinct impression of a Parliament in which the emphasis has passed from being one of service to the community, to being one of power over the community. I feel there is an obsession with power in Parliament and I am terrified of it.  As a journalist and a Parliamentarian I say the only valid foundation for these two vocations is that of service to the community.</P>

It is for that reason that I urge the acceptance of the terms of the amendment in this House.</P>

      <P>As a former Member of this House and to put everything back into perspective I want to say that there is no question of terror involved on the part of the executive <i>vis-a-vis</i> the communications world of the people at large.  This sort of introspective, self-engendered terrorism that comes from people like Senator Horgan and other people who look inwards instead of outwards is quite nauseating.  That is my personal view, having gone through the cut-and-thrust of many years here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in the Dáil and Seanad, and in the newspaper world as well, who know what matters so far as the people of the country are concerned. <Col N="740" /> So far as I and the present Government are concerned, there is no question whatever of any interference with what I would regard as absolutely sacred in any democratic society: that is the freedom of the press and the freedom of communications generally.  I would resign my seat and get out of politics generally if I thought there was any attempt by anybody in Government or in authority in any executive capacity to interfere with what I would regard as a sacred right, the right of people on television, on &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; and in the newspapers through their editorial comment or other comment to make what comment they like on the affairs of the community in which they live.  That right is sacred and independent. It is guaranteed under the Broadcasting Authority Act of 1960 so far as RTE is concerned and has been there by right for many years so far as the newspapers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Let us get this into perspective.  First of all, what has happened here is that there is a conflict between two organisations which are important so far as the community is concerned, the Garda Síochána and RTE.  There is conflict in regard to the presentation of a particular programme.  Because of the proper and democratic pressure exercised on the Government by public representatives, the Government have seen fit, in response to that pressure properly exercised, to establish the tribunal which we are seeking to establish here this evening.  I want to go into this point because it is germane to what was said by Senator Horgan to discount the whole motion of establishing a tribunal at all.  Senator Miss Bourke bent her mind towards the details of the actual terms of reference. The Government are establishing a tribunal in order to allay public unease and in order to ensure that the public, to whom we are all responsible, would get the facts and truths that we had to establish the tribunal.  The doubts were initially raised by Deputy Barry Desmond and I quote from column 1570, Volume 242, of the Official Dáil Report dated 20th November, 1969:</P>
    <P>I submit to you that the matter is of serious public importance and is very urgent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Furthermore, Deputy Desmond on the same day, following further remarks which are not germane to our debate here, said:</P>
    <P>On a point of order, the question I addressed to the Taoiseach has now I note been referred to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs by the Taoiseach.  I would point out I asked the Taoiseach if he would hold a public inquiry.  Now that question has been referred to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who presumably will deal with it next week. Frankly, this kind of shuffling off of Ministerial responsibility is a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was the first to request the holding of a public inquiry.</P>

      <P>At column 1644, volume 242, of the Official Dáil Report dated 21st November, 1969, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael thought that this matter should be dealt with by way of public inquiry.  I shall not go into details, but he and Deputy Desmond thought that a public inquiry should be held.  On 26th November, at column 1858 of the same volume, Deputy Liam Cosgrave asked the Minister for Justice the following question:</P>
      <P>If, in view of the terms of his reply of Wednesday, 19th November, concerning a recent RTE &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme regarding unlicensed moneylending and in order to allay public uneasiness, he will consider holding a full public inquiry into the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot prejudge the issue but the facts are that responsible Deputies of various political parties in the Dáil thought this matter warranted a public inquiry, and the Government, having regard to their representations and to the general public unease referred to by Deputy Cosgrave, acceded to their request.  The matter is quite plain and simple: it concerns the truth as to whether the allegations made on this programme were right or wrong or whether the Garda Síochána in the <Col N="742" /> information furnished by them to the Minister for Justice were right or wrong.  It is as simple as that and I do not think there is any need for the clouding of the issue which has been made here today.</P>
    <P>I come to a point made by Senator Horgan, and also I think by Deputy Thornley in the other House, and I wish to say that so far as the Government are concerned there is no question of any investigation into the independence of journalists in the ascertainment of information by them, in the pursuit of information or data they feel may be in the interest of the public.  This does not arise and I want to make it clear because it has been used to cloud the issue.  I also want to put a stop to another kind of what I might call counter witch-hunt raised by Senator Horgan, Senator Sheehy Skeffington and others.  As far as I and my colleagues are concerned we want to see the fullest possible expression of opinion in our newspapers.  I think the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme is an excellent one; I think RTE are doing an excellent job.  The Government view is that the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme is doing an excellent job.  I wish to put on record that the various organs of public opinion here, newspapers, magazines, radio etc. have total freedom of expression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the points raised in the other House by <Col N="743" /> Labour and Fine Gael spokesmen, we in the Government felt it incumbent on us first of all to have this out in the open, to have a full public inquiry on the matter so that there would be no doubt about where the truth lay. If the truth lies against the Garda Síochána or against the Minister for Justice or the Government then let it lie there but let us have some attempt to ascertain where it does lie.  If it lies against RTE or particular people concerned with the management or reporting of this programme then let it lie there.</P>
      <P>Frankly I was rather disappointed by the wording of the amendment.  In my view on a reading of the amendment it appears to be unduly restrictive rather than open and the nub of the issue between the amendment and what the Government propose is that in effect the amendment proposes to delete the first three lines of paragraph 1 of the motion, which is the planning, preparation, arranging, production and presentation of the recent RTE programme on illegal money-lending. That is fundamental to the whole investigation; unless one investigates thoroughly the entire background in regard to the planning, preparation, arranging and production of the programme one is tilting at windmills. Paragraph 2 which is more or less the gist of the amendment &mdash; investigation into the authenticity of the programme &mdash; is not a practical investigation without giving precise terms of reference as outlined in the first three lines of paragraph 1.  If one deletes the first three lines the rest is superfluous verbiage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we must have this thing out in the open, let it be out in the open and let everybody's rights be protected.  The truth may not eventuate, as often the truth does not eventuate, but at least as far as the public are concerned it will be seen that the gulf that exists at the present time in regard to the case made by the RTE Authority and the producers of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme as against the case made by the Garda Síochána as presented to the Minister for Justice and as given to the Dáil in answer to a question put down by <Col N="744" /> Deputy Corish, might be bridged by investigation on the part of trained minds who are geared to assess the truth in so far as it can be assessed so that this tribunal which will be established &mdash; and the motion which I am moving here to establish it is in my view the best that can be done in the circumstances &mdash; will be enabled to ascertain the truth.  After all, it is the public about whom we are concerned. All of us, whether Members of the Dáil or Seanad, are here as tribunes of the public and we must accede to the request from the Labour and Fine Gael Parties to bring this matter out into the open.</P>
    <P>There is not very much more I wish to say because, in my view, this fundamentally is a matter that can be resolved by impartial people hearing evidence in a proper way.  An attempt has been made to escalate this debate into something sinister or something that would involve a contretemps between the Government and the free press, between the Government and RTE and between the Government and the people.  This does not arise.</P>
    <P>What is concerned here is that we as the Government appointed by the people are concerned in ascertaining the truth for the people and this motion is concerned with having as broad as possible an investigation within limitations without going to the extent of Senator Horgan's and Senator Bourke's second amendment of having everybody and anybody come in before the tribunal, a tribunal that would be established with reasonably precise terms of reference.  On that basis, we can have elucidation for the public mind.  I would welcome this sort of investigation in general in the hope that as a result of it, apart from the precise investigation involved dealing with a particular subject, that it will in general emphasise again the fundamental freedoms that exist in this country &mdash; the freedom to investigate on the part of radio and television or newspapers and the freedom to investigate within reason.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is public unease in regard to this and if matters are raised in the Parliament of the people which cause unease in the public mind <Col N="745" /> as between two institutions of the State they must be resolved through a properly instituted legal tribunal where evidence can be called and properly assessed by trained people.  This investigation will not only re-emphasise the fundamental rights of our various institutions but it seems to me that we will preserve what is all important from the public point of view, that is, <Col N="746" /> that the truth is ascertained in any particular situation where the public have cause for unease and want to know what is the truth in a particular matter.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1969    (Certified Money Bill):    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>An explanatory Memorandum has been circulated for the information of Senators.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm eight orders made during 1968, under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, and the Finance Act, 1962.  It is a statutory requirement that such orders must be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made if they are not to cease to have statutory effect at the expiration of that period.</P>
      <P>The first of these orders, No. 169, provided for the remission of the customs duty on imports from Canada of certain conifer wood.  The order also provided for an increase in the rate of customs duty for imports of certain motor-cars of Canadian origin.  Under the terms of the 1932 Trade Agreement between Ireland and Canada, Canada was entitled to the special preferential rates of duty enjoyed by the United Kingdom.  If this Agreement was left unamended, Ireland would have been required to extend to Canada the reduced rates of duty applicable to the United Kingdom when the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement came into operation. The Canadian Government agreed to the amendment of the Agreement to provide that the special preferential rates of duty which had applied to Canadian imports before the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement came into operation should continue to apply, subject, among other things, to the remission of the duty on conifer wood.</P>
      <P>The reduction in duty on imports of this wood from the United Kingdom and other countries was necessary in order to comply with the provisions of the Free Trade Area Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  It was also provided that the special preferential rate enjoyed by Canada in respect of certain motor cars should be eliminated.  This was desirable in connection with the scheme for ensuring the continuation of the Irish motor assembly industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> The next order, No. 171, restored protection for certain solid fuel stove-type boilers and for certain shaped pieces of polyurethane material.  These goods had inadvertently become free of duty as a result of the introduction of the new Brussels Nomenclature form of tariff classification.  During the negotiation of the Free Trade Area Agreement an understanding was reached with the British Government about the restoration of protection in such cases.</P>
    <P>The third order, No. 172, enables the rates of duty at which fully built-up motor vehicles may be imported under licence to be varied, in accordance with the scheme for the motor assembly industry.  The purpose of this scheme, which was agreed with the manufacturers and assemblers of British motor vehicles, is to ensure the continuation of the Irish motor assembly industry on a long term basis.</P>
    <P>Order No. 173 provided for a reduction in the minimum specific duty on stockings of silk or man-made fibres of United Kingdom origin. Before the Free Trade Area Agreement was negotiated, all stockings of silk or man-made fibres were subject to import quota restrictions and to ad valorem duties.  It was originally intended that when the Agreement came into force these quota restrictions would be abolished.  Following representations by the Irish stocking manufacturers, British agreement was, however, secured to a proposal to make stockings of a value not exceeding 50s per dozen pairs subject to a quota arrangement and a minimum specific duty, in addition to the existing ad valorem duty.  The British Government later requested the abolition of the minimum specific duty on the grounds that it prevented British manufacturers from availing of the import quota to which they were entitled under this arrangement.  Following further negotiations with the British Government and consultations with the Irish industry, the minimum specific duty was reduced from 16s to 12s per dozen pairs, this rate to stand still until overtaken by the normal reductions under the Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> Order No. 174 was made by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance.  It provided for the third tariff reduction on goods of United Kingdom origin in accordance with the terms of the Free Trade Area Agreement.  In addition, the Order provided for the maintenance of the special tariff concessions in favour of certain goods of Northern Ireland origin and gave new tariff concessions on cellulose tape and tyre valves of Northern Ireland origin; reduced import duties on rose bushes and certain bulbs, tubers, <i>et cetera</i>, and certain rubberised textile fabrics, in accordance with commitments made by the Government in the Kennedy Round of Trade negotiations; raised from 2,000 to 3,000 copies the average circulation limit for exemption from the import duty on daily newspapers and made a number of editorial changes in the form of customs tariff.</P>
    <P>Order No. 175 imposed a duty on imports of tufted material.  In 1965, the Government imposed a minimum specific duty of 15s per article on tufted bedspreads, in addition to the existing <i>ad valorem</i> duty, in order to protect the Irish manufacturers against imports of tufted bedspreads made from low-cost cotton.  Subsequently, a new trade developed in the export from Northern Ireland of tufted material in the piece, made from low-cost cottons, which was not itself liable to duty. This material could be converted into bedspreads at a minimal cost, thereby circumventing the duty on tufted bedspreads. Following representations from the Irish Manufacturers and negotiations with the British Government, it was decided to impose a duty on imports of the tufted material.</P>
    <P>Order No. 176 provided for the restoration of customs duties on imports of coated copy-making film. This film is another item which had inadvertently lost protection in the changeover to the Brussels Nomenclature form of customs classification and protection was restored in accordance with the understanding with the British about such cases.</P>
    <P>Finally, Order No. 177 imposed a duty against imports of certain crown corks from sources other than the <Col N="751" /> United Kingdom and increased the rates of duty applicable to certain plastic footballs imported from countries other than the United Kingdom. In order to simplify the new tariff, that is, the Brussels Nomenclature form of tariff, certain suspended duties, among them one on crown corks, were removed on the introduction of this tariff in 1963.  It was found, however, that the home manufacture of crown corks was threatened by large-scale low-priced imports from the Continent and a duty was re-imposed at the request of the manufacturers.  The duty on certain plastic footballs from sources other than the United Kingdom was increased following an application by the home manufacturers who were unable to complete with imported plastic footballs, particularly those from West Germany.  This increase brought the duties on these footballs into line with the duties payable on other plastic balls.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to give any further information required in connection with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give the Minister every facility in getting this Bill through quickly.  I notice from a quick look at the Dáil debates that very little time was expended in discussing this Bill and I think that we would favour just as quick a procedure in the Seanad.  I should just like to ask the Minister one or two questions arising out of his introductory statement. First, how will the reduction of these various duties affect the terms of the Anglo Irish Free Trade Agreement? In other words, do they cut across it?  Will we have to face competition under the various heads in the long term?  I assume the import of motor cars from Canada is negligible. I have not seen such a car and I do not know whether anybody else has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the importation of conifers, would the Minister explain, for the benefit of those not concerned with the industry, how significant conifers are as raw material for the industry concerned?  This may not be strictly relevant but I should like to ask the Minister what steps are being <Col N="752" /> taken in the country to encourage the establishment of a motor manufacturing industry similar to the type of car-manufacture or car-assembly in Sweden in connection with the Volvo car or the Saab, whereby parts, not necessarily manufactured in the country of origin, are brought together and used to manufacture what is essentially a Swedish car.  This probably does not arise strictly on this Bill but perhaps the Minister would be good enough to give us a little more information on it.</P>
    <P>Order No. 173 provided for a reduction in the duty on &ldquo;stockings of silk or man-made fibres of United Kingdom origin&rdquo;.  I can recall that there was an import tariff on articles containing man-made fibres being imported into Great Britain.  I wonder is this a logical sequence to the abolition of that duty? Is this just a very transitory arrangement? We must speak of our membership of EEC because we are likely, in any event, to come up against what the Minister has described in his statement as the dumping or importation of low-cost products from the Continent.  I think that refers to some of the items which are protected by tariffs.  If that is so, does the Minister think it is wise, notwithstanding the fact that we would all accept the necessity for protecting Irish manufacturers and Irish employment in industry, to turn our faces against the reality of the situation which will exist in the course of a few years.  The Government and the Minister share the view that we will have to compete against these Continental manufacturers in the future.  The statement was made in the Dáil that we would have to raise tariffs against imports from Northern Ireland.  We would all wish that the largest possible amount of cross-border trade was done between the two sections of our country, not only for economic reasons but also for other reasons as well.</P>
    <P>Finally, I was interested to read in the latter part of the Minister's statement where he proposes to impose a duty on certain plastic footballs from sources other than United Kingdom. Perhaps the Minister might give us some information on the extent of this industry which is quite unknown to me.  The Minister might tell us whether <Col N="753" /> it has any export potential.  We are prepared to facilitate the Minister in a speedy passage of the Bill through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular Bill is an annual event and it used to be the practice to allow it to go through practically without debate. It is a good thing for us to regard it as an obligation on us to examine each duty proposed by the Bill and to ask relevant questions on it.  I compliment the Minister for the printing of the Bill and for the explanatory memorandum which gives a pretty full account of the duties imposed and the reasons for them.  I am not quite sure why the same order, the Imposition of Duties (No. 169) Order, 1968 should at the same time reduce the duty on conifer wood from Canada to nil and place a fairly high duty on imported cars from Canada.  The two things seem to be unconnected. It would seem to me to be two orders and not just one.</P>
      <P>I refer now to the Imposition of Duties (No. 171) Order.  The explanatory memorandum says this order came into operation on the &ldquo;25th April, 1968 imposing duties at rates of 32 per cent (full, preferential and special preferential)&rdquo; and &ldquo;19.2 per cent (United Kingdom) on certain solid fuel stove-type boilers&rdquo;.  Similar wording occurs in relation to other orders.  I find it odd to be told there is a full duty, a preferential duty and a special preferential duty and in this case they are all the same.  There is also a special, special preferential duty for the United Kingdom. There is something odd about full preferential, and special preferential duties but there is yet another one with no particular nomenclature which you might call super grade or premium grade and which applies to the United Kingdom.  Words are beginning to lose their meaning if the same duty is charged and yet is called full preferential or special preferential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned another point.  The explanatory memorandum refers in relation to Order No. 177 to crown corks and to artificial plastic footballs as if there were natural plastic growing on trees or natural footballs.  The word &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; is a <Col N="754" /> bit odd in this context.  The Order refers only to plastic footballs.  &ldquo;Artificial plastic&rdquo; seems to be an odd phrase. The Department of Agriculture may discover there is natural plastic or a natural football.  Otherwise I do not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that he mentions that the purpose of this Bill is to confirm eight Orders made during 1968 and that it is a statutory requirement that the Orders be confirmed not later than the end of the calendar year following that in which they are made. Perhaps there is a good reason for this. Why is the Seanad presented on virtually the last day of its sitting for this year with a Bill of this description? If the Orders were made in the year 1968 I should have thought that 12 months would be a reasonable time within which to have the Orders passed by the Dáil and the Seanad.  I am not suggesting this is the fault of the Minister.  I would like to know the explanation of it.  This could be noted, in a mild way, as a protest that the Seanad should be asked to deal urgently with business which could have been dealt with any time within the past 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a few questions as well.  Our balance of payments problems is one of imbalance between imports and exports and I should like to join with Senator Russell in hoping our exports of home-manufactured footballs will increase. At the same time when we are constantly having problems in keeping down our imports I wonder why we have an item like this for the importation of plastic footballs from East Germany.  This is hardly due to consumer demand; does it arise because some wholesaler takes the initiative to import goods from East Germany or because of some balance that must be maintained under a trade agreement with East Germany?  I should like to have a comment from the Minister on that because it appears to me that if there is one thing we do not need it is imported plastic footballs from East Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> There is another small matter &mdash; perhaps the information may not be immediately available &mdash; but all politicians have the habit of thinking in local terms and when I saw an order affecting the import of tufted materials I thought of a firm near me &mdash; Diana Cowpe (Eire) Limited &mdash; which manufactures a candlewick-type of tufted product.  Naturally I am interested in anything that will improve their competitive position and I should like to know if in fact, apart from Dún Laoghaire, there is a developing industry for this type of tufted material in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>We have been speaking much today about newspapers, television and communications generally and another item which caught my attention was that affecting the import duty on daily papers.  One of the things I have noticed, without having any quantitative assessment of it, is that British newspapers seem to be growing in popularity in this country.  I wonder if the rate of average circulation limit for exemption from import duty on daily papers to 3,000 copies would in some way encourage the development of circulation by these newspapers or if most of them already have a circulation in excess of 3,000 copies, in which case this marginal change will not have a very big effect?  I appreciate that the answers to these points may not be available but, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has mentioned, we are glad to have an opportunity to ask about a couple of lay points which cross one's mind when one reads this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in answer to Senator Russell's query that the various alterations dealt with in these orders do not cut across the terms of the Free Trade Agreement but in the main they are in furtherance and in execution of that Agreement. The House will have noted a number of items dealt either with matters that were inadvertently left without protection when it was intended that they should be protected due to change in tariff headings or were matters that were dealt with after consultation or negotiation with the British.  The framework of many of these is provided in <Col N="756" /> the Free Trade Agreement; it contemplated such things as the orders mentioned here which arose out of the Agreement or in consultation with the British Authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of motor cars, the House will recall that some time ago we discussed here the Motor Vehicles Registration Bill which gave a legal framework to the agreement arrived at after lengthy negotiations between assemblers here, the British manufacturers, the British Government and our own Government.  The aim and effect of that agreement, and consequently of that legislation, was to ensure the continuation of the motor assembly industry on a long-term basis.  With regard to the question of a motor manufacturing industry as distinct from assembly, I cannot say offhand what efforts may have been made in the past to set this up &mdash; I think there have been some &mdash; but the economics of the scale have hitherto not made this a very attractive proposition. It is quite clear that for this to be attractive you either must have a substantial export market or have a completely confined home market and neither circumstance seemed a proposition, and I think this has been the main reason this has not developed.  I am aware of some efforts to set up such an industry on a fairly small scale in the beginning are at present being examined.  I have very good reason to believe that when we enter into the EEC &mdash; and I say when, not if, because I am reasonably optimistic about this &mdash; then almost certainly there is likely to be a large-scale motor manufacturing industry set up in this country. My contacts with some of the largest motor car manufacturers in the world have led me to believe that this is a very likely development arising out of our entry into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of duty on man-made fibres I do not know if there is a misunderstanding about this. However, I should like to make it clear that there was a substantial duty on our exports of man-made fibres into the British market until the Free Trade Agreement which abolished that duty. One might say this has led almost directly to the setting up of a new <Col N="757" /> industry in Sligo which is under construction at the moment, and to certain other advantages.  With reference to the question of competition from the Continent, I would point out that of all the items mentioned in these orders the problem of competition from countries of the EEC arises in one case only, that of crown corks; in the other cases this was not the problem. I would also point out with regard to goods from Northern Ireland the orders reduced duty on goods except in one case and that is for tufted bedspreads.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that I described the trade which developed from Northern Ireland, at least for materials coming in the piece, related to material imported into Northern Ireland from low cost countries.  It was not what might be called a genuine Northern Ireland product and, consequently, we need not worry unduly about the order that is made here which puts a stop to that trade.  I would repeat that in other cases where there is any reason to import from Northern Ireland we give an advantage to goods from Northern Ireland over those from other places, including Britain.</P>
    <P>With regard to conifer wood, the figures available for imports into this country of all types of Canadian wood amounted to £42,272 in 1968 and £10,598 for the first six months of this year, so the House will realise that the trade involved is not very large. Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised the point as to why this was dealt with in the same order as the one increasing the duties on Canadian motor cars.  It may seem a little odd on the face of it but the reason is that under the trade agreement which we had with Canada, the Canadians would have been entitled to the same preferential rates of duty as the British were getting under the Free Trade Area Agreement.  Part of the price we paid was this reduction of duty on Canadian wood.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that some Senators seem to be somewhat intrigued about this question of plastic footballs.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington about artificial plastic this thought also occurred to me when I saw that phrase but I can only tell the Senator that this apparently <Col N="758" /> is the technical description but in the layman's terms it seems illogical. However, I do not think that it will affect the validity of the order.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that the Irish manufacturers of these plastic footballs are located in the West of Ireland and that they are very successful.  Not only do they make these footballs but they make all kinds of plastic toys.  I understand that they are the second largest manufacturers of plastic toys either in Ireland or Britain and they export a very substantial amount of their products. What was involved in this case was that imports from East Germany can only be described as being at ridiculously low prices and this was affecting their market in this regard.  As indicated by Senator Keery, there was no particular reason why we ought to allow this to go on.  We do not have a trade agreement with East Germany and the balance of trade has not been very favourable to us.  We cannot say positively how they were coming in but we can surmise that they were brought in here by distributors who were offered them in London or elsewhere through agents of the East Germans and the reason they were being bought was because they were being sold at such ridiculously low prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean there is no export potential for those articles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very substantial potential.  I covered this when I said that a high percentage of the firm's products were being exported.</P>

      <P>I visited this firm some two years ago and I remember being told there that they and, as far as I can remember, one other firm in the world, were the only people who had mastered the art of making a plastic football that was completely spherical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the point raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington about different tariffs and so on, in the particular order to which I referred three of them are at the one rate so they are <Col N="759" /> referred to together as being such but in many cases each one is quite different. As he says, these have grown up during the year.  We are not the only people who use these terms; they are used internationally but depending on what agreements have been made during the year terms must be used to describe the different kinds of duties. With regard to the point raised by Senator Keery, I should tell him that there are two firms here making tufted bedspreads.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing the number of copies of newspapers to 3,000 to qualify for exemption from the import duty has been mentioned also. I should imagine that most of the newspapers coming here from Britain are above that level but there are some having small circulations and they are exempt in this way.  In connection with one particular newspaper which I consider to be a worthwhile one, it might not have been a very good proposition to continue sending the newspaper here if this duty had to be paid but it was considered worthwhile to increase the figure to 3,000 because largely it is a worthwhile newspaper from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins raised a point about the delay in bringing this Bill in.  There are quite a number of reasons for this delay but basically I must accept the responsibility for it myself.  I have expressed dissatisfaction at the delay myself because it has occurred in the past and complaint has been made about it.  There are a number of good reasons why this delay occurred but I do not think it need have been as long as it was and I accept responsibility for the undue delay.  I trust that it will not occur again.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since Senators have had in their hands for some time an explanatory memorandum on this Bill, I will not detain them unduly.  This House is, perhaps, aware that the statutory limit on expenditures by An Foras Tionscal will have been reached within a few weeks and that consequently it would be desirable that this Bill be given a speedy passage.  I look forward to the goodwill and cooperation of all sides of this House in bringing this about.</P>
      <P>Briefly, this Bill is designed to integrate and to make clear the incentives available for manufacturing projects and to bring them up-to-date in the light of experience as well as adding the flexibility needed for assisting the more sophisticated type of operation which is now needed to achieve rapid growth and complement our existing industrial structures.</P>
      <P>After prolonged consultation with the interests concerned the views of international consultants, A.D. Little, Inc., and of the National Industrial Economic Council were obtained.  The Bill incorporates the broad terms of the advice given by these bodies.</P>
      <P>Since this is an amending Bill it does not contain within itself all the provisions affecting industrial promotion or the operations of the Industrial Development Authority.  The Authority is, however, being expanded by absorbtion of An Foras Tionscal and by the creation of adequate structures for its future tasks.  Careers are being offered to staff chosen from outside the Civil Service.  It is hoped that their expertise will operate the improved promotional and advisory services which we will require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA promotional work, so far, has been effective and to this is due in no small measure the expansion of industrial employment which in June, 1969 was almost 11,000 higher than in June, 1968.  Similar or greater increases will, I hope, result from new industrial <Col N="761" /> projects which were approved or commenced production in the early part of this year.  These new projects will give rise to 9,800 new jobs at the end of their first year and an estimated 17,800 jobs ultimately.  At the current rate of increase, manufacturing industry is succeeding in bearing its share of the new job creation required for higher living standards and full employment in the foreseeable future.  A similar indicator is the value of industrial exports which is now six times that of ten years ago and is estimated to be over half of our total exports.</P>
    <P>I do not seek personal or political credit for these events which are due to the efforts, co-operation and adaptability of the whole Irish people and in particular to the improvement in technical and managerial skills in industry and to increased knowledge of design and marketing.</P>
    <P>The extent of the international scale on which this operation is working can be seen in a breakdown of the projects I have mentioned plus others currently under negotiation.  Approximately 25 per cent are British, 20 per cent Irish, 20 per cent American, 15 per cent German and there are others from Holland, France, Austria, Norway and Denmark, Sweden, Italy, India and Spain.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention the small industries scheme which has been providing outlets for the enterprise of our people and will, I think, make a substantial contribution in the time to come.  In the first half of this year, 119 small industry projects were approved for grants; these projects are estimated to give employment to 700 persons ultimately.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested in the development of regional policy.  The Industrial Development Authority are about to set up regional offices and provide services on a regional basis in co-operation with local interests. With this regional policy is linked the development of industrial estates, advance factories and the provision of housing for key workers, where appropriate.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the smaller scale of home based industry, we now have <Col N="762" /> under consideration a number of large industrial projects which have both substantial employment and growth potential.  These will be needed to diversify our existing industrial structure and to provide linkage with other home firms or demand for our own raw materials.  These projects must be chosen carefully, in view of their heavy capital cost and the limited resources at our disposal.  To assist the IDA in formulating and appraising such projects, consultants will, in future, be increasingly used in pursuance of a selective policy of industrial promotion geared to our requirements and resources.</P>
    <P>Changing circumstances have required new forms of industrial financial assistance.  Senators will note that it is proposed now that grants can now be given towards the cost of leased assets and that interest rates may be assisted within certain limits, the repayment of loans may be guaranteed and grants may be provided for industrial research and development. It is intended that a package of such incentives will be available in the larger cases in addition to first-tier and second-tier grants.  The Bill also contains improved provisions for training grants and for re-equipment grants which take the place of the adaptation grants available to existing industry until September, 1967.</P>
    <P>The designated, formerly undeveloped, areas are being favoured by a differential of 10 per cent under the re-equipment system and of 15 per cent in new industry grants.</P>
    <P>The powers being conferred on the Authority to provide factories for purchase or leasing will also enhance the range and suitability of the package of incentives.</P>
    <P>On a matter of detail, I should draw attention to the limitations imposed on grant issues.  The total of this kind of expenditure plus expenditures on industrial estates is being fixed at £100m.  Almost £50m. has already been issued under the existing enactments relating to industrial grants.  The percentage limits set out in the various grants sections may not be exceeded even where the required Government consent to the Authority's proposal to <Col N="763" /> give grants totalling over £350,000 to an enterprise has been secured.  Certain types of grants are being grouped together to count towards the specified grant maxima.</P>
    <P>As well as these main provisions the Bill contains a number of ancillary provisions which relate to the merger of IDA and An Foras Tionscal and to pensions, staffing, procedures and to the calculation of grants.</P>
    <P>Since the provisions of this Bill are generally based on successful experience of sound and practical measures for industrial development which have made such a substantial impact on our economy and our way of life I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <P>In his statement the Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned it would be desirable if this Bill was given a speedy passage and he looked forward to the goodwill and the co-operation of all sides of the House in bringing this about.  I assure him at the outset, on behalf of myself and my party, of our co-operation in achieving that purpose.  This Bill is a logical successor to the various enactments passed during the past 20 years, beginning with the IDA Bill of 1950 passed in the face of severe criticism from Fianna Fáil, then in Opposition, and threats wisely not carried out to repeal it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said truthfully that the 1950 Act marked the turning point in the whole idea of industrial development in this country.  Prior to that date, and particularly during the years 1932 to 1948, the main impetus in industrial development was provided by tariff protection, that is substitution of Irish manufactured goods for imported and foreign made goods in the home market.  From 1948 onwards, successive Governments have, through a policy of financial inducements, encouraged the establishment by foreign and home-based firms of industries producing goods mainly for the export market.  In other words, it was the national policy to buy know-how and to establish export markets as a quick <Col N="764" /> way to providing industrial employment.</P>
    <P>During the same period efforts were made to attract as many as possible of the new industries to the west or undeveloped areas by offering higher inducements to firms located in those areas.  Notwithstanding some notable failures, the policy of inducement has been generally successful as evidenced by the rising proportion of industrial exports each year in the face of keen competition and, I might say, empha-sised by the Minister in his statement before the adjournment.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, some criticisms have persisted in spite of those successes.  The more serious may be summarised as follows: preferential treatment to foreign industrialists, the preponderance of industrial development of industries in the Dublin area in spite of the higher incentives available in other areas, the neglect or apparent neglect of small industries, of small family business, the difficulty in dealing with various departments and organisations concerned with industrial development, the delay in getting replies and decisions from those departments and the costs involved, that is accountancy, solicitors, <i>et cetera</i>, and the amount of form-filling required.</P>
    <P>Recent developments within the IDA structure have done a great deal to eliminate those criticisms, particularly the establishment of the Small Industries Division a few years ago under the competent and enthusiastic management of Mr. Tom O'Connor, former Manager of the Limerick County Council.  The establishment of this section recognises that the predominant type of industrial undertaking in this as in more advanced countries will continue to be the small and mediumsized firm.  Apart from the instigation and production of specialist type goods, the small firm has a viable economic function to fulfil in subcontracting to larger firms whose main production methods do not permit the economic manufacture of specialist items in small runs.  The policy of recognising the small firm's difficulties and its potentialities and catering for them at local level has paid off handsomely in the number of new and extended industries and increased employment <Col N="765" /> in this area of our industrial sector.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House takes the IDA a further step towards the provision of a co-ordinated and comprehensive service for Irish industrialists and potential industrialists.  The merging of An Foras Tionscal's grant-giving function with the IDA is a sensible and logical development but the services of other organisations should also be transferred if the IDA are to act as a single body giving a fully comprehensive service to industry in this country.  I have in mind, in stating this, particularly the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Córas Tráchtála and certain services provided by the Department of Industry and Commerce. With all those services under one roof, so to speak, we would have an authority capable of providing all or nearly all the services required by industry quickly and cheaply.</P>
    <P>Two further services should be closely associated with the reorganised IDA, namely manpower, including technical and technological facilities and infra-structural requirements. Those may be more appropriate to the Department of Labour and the Department of Local Government or, preferably, the proposed Department of Physical Planning, if that proposal ever gets off the ground.  In any event, they must be jointed to the IDA either by incorporation or by representation on the board of the Authority.  Furthermore, the Industrial Credit Company, which are logically associated with the financing committee section of the IDA, should be more closely related to the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I should like, dealing more specifically with the points in the Bill, to take the explanatory memorandum which was issued with the first draft of the Bill principally because I am not aware, though perhaps the House is aware, in what form the Bill was finally passed but I am assuming the amendments presented on the Fourth Stage of the Bill in the Dáil have not been in fact included in the final document.</P>

      <P>In Part 1 of the Bill, section 6 defines the designated areas which will take the place of the undeveloped <Col N="766" /> areas as defined in section 3 of the Industrial Areas Act, 1952, and provides for the extension of these areas by Ministerial order.  I feel that the areas, whether they be designated or non-designated, should be related to existing or proposed development areas.  I have in mind particularly the mid-western area, more properly known as the Limerick, Clare and Tipperary North Riding Development Organisation, which are as far as I know the only regional development organisation so far established.</P>
      <P>In that area there are at the moment three types of incentive schemes.  There is the designated area which is that part of the mid-western area formerly named the undeveloped areas; there is the area outside the designated area; and finally there is the Shannon Free Airport Development area.  In the case of the designated areas there is what I think the Minister described as the first-tier grant of 40 per cent plus a possible further 20 per cent, and outside the designated area the present grant is 25 per cent with a further possible 20 per cent, and in the Shannon Airport then we have the different series of grants plus the 20-year tax free facility or inducement. I think that a common rate of grants or other incentives should be established in the mid-western area and that the same should apply in other areas as they are established throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know&mdash;and perhaps the Minister will inform the House when he is replying&mdash;what the position is in regard to the establishment of other development organisations throughout the country, but I do think that if the purpose of the Industrial Development Authority in its reorganised form is to be fully achieved the establishment of these regional development organisations is an urgent necessity, and I think that the Minister himself should do everything he possibly can to induce their early development.  I might say in that regard that reading the various accounts of the establishment of the mid-western area, that is Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary, the impression might be deduced that this particular development organisation <Col N="767" /> was established through pressure from above.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that there was considerable encouragement from the relevant Departments including the Minister's own Department, the Department of Local Government and other Departments concerned, but there was also an organic or local impetus from the people concerned in those areas, and we have in this particular area a board comprising a very wide interest.  The reason I mention this is because there was a good deal of talk recently on the question of growth centres and industrial estates. The argument has been put forward that if you establish industrial estates or growth centres or cores of development, or whatever you like to call them in this new terminology, the areas contiguous to them, that is the rural areas, will be denuded.  I would like to say with regard to our area, which comprises the two counties and the North Tipperary Riding as I have already mentioned, we have representatives from all the statutory bodies in that area, including Limerick City Council, Limerick County Council, Clare County Council, North Tipperary County Council, Limerick Harbour Board, Limerick Chamber of Commerce and so on.</P>

      <P>The important thing is that we have representation from the smaller areas including Ennis, Thurles, Nenagh and other similar-type areas, who have fair representation and indeed whose contributions to our meetings, as I think Senator Honan will agree, are very valuable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Senator must take my word for it.  I have been at all of them.  They have resulted in influencing the industrial development programme drawn up recently for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, which does provide for the establishment of advance factories not only in the bigger urban centres like <Col N="768" /> Limerick but over a wide part of the rural areas in these centres, including particularly Clare.</P>
      <P>Part III, chapter 1, section 12, contains general provisions.  I hope the Minister will forgive me for saying that I think he has been to some extent influenced by the arguments and amendments put forward in the Dáil even though he did not accept them. From his statement to us here this evening, I would say that he has taken cognisance of the views put forward, because I was very encouraged to read in the record of the establishment of regional offices of the Industrial Development Authority that he has accepted this as a definite policy.</P>
      <P>As my notes were prepared before I had an opportunity of listening to him, possibly to some degree I will have to adjust them, but this section in the Bill in its present form is quite wide.  It states: &ldquo;The Authority may in the exercise of its functions have regard to the extent to which an industrial undertaking will serve to promote national objectives for regional development.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister accepts as a firm commitment the necessity of having regional offices at the Industrial Development Authority in the various regions throughout the country.  The Minister, in his statement here before the adjournment, gave a much firmer indication that this is what he had in mind than the actual wording in the Bill.  Perhaps he would confirm that when he comes to wind up the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about regional development, growth areas, industrial estates, <i>et cetera</i>, for a long time.  I am sure the Minister recalls the various reports produced during the past seven or eight years.  I should like to refer specifically to the CIO Report of 1962 which came down very emphatically in favour of the establishment of growth areas.  They were called pools of development at that time.  That report refused to accept the argument that the establishment of growth centres necessarily meant that the contiguous rural areas would be denuded of their population or employment opportunities.  I have always accepted that point of view.  When you have a viable development centre, prosperity and opportunities <Col N="769" /> tend to move out from there and to result in the establishment of satellite or smaller industries in the towns and other smaller urban centres in the area.  Two further reports were issued in 1964 by the Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates. They corroborated the views expressed by the CIO Report two years earlier.</P>
    <P>In the same Chapter 1 of the explanatory memorandum, section 14 excludes the authority's grant giving functions from the Shannon Customs Free Airport.  The Minister is aware that SFADCO, almost 12 months ago, were charged with the responsibility of promoting industrial development in the entire mid-western area of Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary. As I mentioned before, they have drawn up a very comprehensive programme for the development of the area during the next five years.  That programme is showing tangible signs of progress.  There is at least one industry in Newcastlewest which is very close to completion.  Several advance factories under construction in the city of Limerick and other advance factories are scheduled for construction in other smaller centres throughout the area.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position of the IDA <i>vis-a-vis</i> SFADCO.  Are SFADCO to continue to promote industrial development? The Bill gives the impression that, apart from what it describes as the development on the industrial estates, the Shannon Company will not have the powers which they now have to promote development in Clare, Limerick or North Tipperary.  Does it mean we will have two bodies with the same powers and functions?</P>
    <P>On the same lines, I should like the Minister to clarify the relationship which will be in existence between the reorganised IDA and the Mid-Western Development Organisation.  In that board we have two representatives of the Department of Local Government, but if there is to be the close liaison which is absolutely necessary between the IDA headquarters and the regional areas as far as the mid-west is concerned, some form of close liaison, possibly through the board, will have <Col N="770" /> to be found to provide that close contact between them.  In Chapter 2, section 25, we have something which has been rejected by the Minister.  It provides:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Authority is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or as a member of Seanad Éireann, he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Authority.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my disapproval of that.  It has been accepted as a precedent. I remember as a Member of the Dáil seven or eight years ago protesting, but the precedent was established then, has been continued and will be continued.  It is wrong that a man or woman must resign from the Authority and possibly be beaten afterwards in the subsequent election. Chapter 3 is headed &ldquo;Provisions Relating to Grants&rdquo;.  Section 33 of the same chapter in referring to fixed assets, states that fixed assets are defined in the Bill as machinery, plant, equipment, lands, building and services, and other works of or for an industrial undertaking.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister would fixed assets include entrance roads, rail-sidings, and jetties or wharves if such had to be built in connection with the establishment of an industry?  Section 38 provides for grants &ldquo;towards the cost of fixed assets required for the re-equipment, modernisation, improvement or expansion of an industrial undertaking&rdquo;.  It goes on to say that these grants will be at the rate of 35 per cent in a designated area, or 25 per cent elsewhere, subject to a maximum of £350,000.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will have a counter-argument to this but I feel that the rate of grants for the modernisation and improvement of existing industries, which would mainly be established Irish firms seeking to modernise and expand, should enjoy the same percentage grants as new industries.  I may be wrong in my interpretation of the Bill but it seems to me that is a point which I touched on earlier. That criticism would certainly exist to a greater extent in the past.  There has been a discrimination between new <Col N="771" /> foreign industries and old-established firms.  This discrimination would appear to be perpetuated in this section of the Bill.  The Minister may have a very good argument against the point I have made.  I should like to hear him on this.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides a new scheme of grants for projects of research and states that the scheme is confined to work carried out wholly or mainly in the State.  It is quite possible, though not probable, that a research project of use to this country might have to be carried out entirely outside the State.  I do not think such a project should be precluded from assistance on those grounds.  The sum involved is quite small.  The grants will ordinarily not exceed 50 per cent of the approved cost, or £15,000.  There is a principle in this which might react unfavourably against us.  If some project were initiated or had to be carried out outside the State, it might suit us to give full grant terms.</P>
    <P>Section 43 makes provision to enable the authority to reckon the value or cost of assets or other benefits in determining the amount of grant.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is any appeal from the authority's valuation of the cost of the assets: in other words if an industrialist is seeking assistance from the IDA for a new factory or in regard to extension of an existing factory, must the authority's valuation be taken as final and not subject to appeal to any other authority, even the Minister himself?</P>
    <P>Section 44 empowers the authority to purchase or to take shares in an industrial undertaking.  I am glad the Minister included this provision in the Bill.  With the increasing proportion of foreign investment in Irish industry&mdash;I should like to make it clear that I do not object to the participation of foreign capital in Irish industry where the foreign capital is accompanied by know-how that we do not have at home or where it can give us entry into markets which would be difficult if not impossible for us to enter&mdash;but we all regard as undesirable the passing into outside hands of a large proportion <Col N="772" /> of Irish industry.  The Minister might consider, and possibly he has already done so in this section, taking a part of the equity or share capital in foreign industries established here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is the intention of the section and if so I am glad to have it included.  However, I do not approve of the next paragraph in which the authority must register these shares in the name of the Minister for Finance. I should prefer to see the State setting up a separate independent holding company into which these shares would be transferred and I should like to see it free from direct Ministerial or Departmental control, with its own independent board of people experienced in the handling of shares and so forth who might be permitted, with the concurrence of the Minister for Local Government, to sell these shares at a suitable date to Irish nationals.  What I have in mind is that in the early stages of development of a foreign-owned industry the State would take a minor percentage of the capital, say 15, 20 or 25 per cent, and later on if the industry progressed the State would dispose of its shares to Irish nationals. This would be one way of ensuring that successful foreign industries had a proportion of their equity capital in Irish hands.</P>
    <P>Section 46 makes provision for grants to secure reduction of factory rents on industrial estates.  I should like to ask the Minister whether such grants will be payable to industrial estates provided by private enterprise, local authorities or harbour commissioners. There is also a provision that a member of the authority who may wish to contest an election shall not be eligible for membership on the authority. I think it might be desirable to have a member of a local authority as a member on the board of IDA and I regret that provision was inserted. However, I suppose it is now a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>Much will depend on the membership of the board; the whole success of the IDA in its new form will depend on the nine men who will be charged with the encouragement of industrial development in every form <Col N="773" /> and in providing quickly and cheaply the type of services an industrialist needs.  The question of membership is vital and I trust the Minister will not mind my saying that I hope he will exercise an independent and critical mind in the selection of personnel on the board of the IDA.  I have some qualms about the membership having regard to the sudden departure of Mr. J.J. Walsh from membership of the IDA and I am sure other Members of the House, and certainly many people outside, agree with me on this.  I have had dealings with Mr. Walsh for a number of years and I feel my contribution to this debate would be incomplete without paying tribute to a very competent and dedicated man.  I regret the Minister or whoever was responsible for the change did not see fit to allow Mr. Walsh at least to remain in his post as chairman until the reorganised authority was in operation for a few years.</P>
    <P>Having said that I should like to deal more specifically with the membership question.  I think the House will agree with me that membership should be widely representative and should include persons experienced in industrial promotion.  It should also have some representation, if not directly from the universities, at least from somebody competent to contribute on technological and technical matters, because this is most essential. The trade unions will obviously have to be represented.  The regional bodies will also have to be tied up with the IDA.  The mid-west comes to mind first but there should be some representatives <i>per se</i> of the regional organisations to tie them up even closer with the IDA.</P>
    <P>Transport, shipping and agriculture obviously should be represented.  I noticed in reading the Dáil debate that there was reference to whether the members should be whole-time or part-time.  Obviously the Chairman must be whole-time&mdash;nobody will cavil at that.  The present board of five are persons transferred from the civil service and if the IDA is going to succeed in its task, which will be a heavy one in view of developments and particularly the accession of this country to the Common Market, the <Col N="774" /> responsibilities of the IDA are going to be very heavy and it should not be a body for political appointments in any form.  I do not wish to be offensive in any way whatsoever but there is definitely no place for politics on this board.  I express an opinion that the Minister will be independent and not be influenced by considerations other than the best men for the job.  I suggest that if there are to be nine members, five of these should be full-time members of the board with four part-time members.  Of course, this is only a personal opinion and the Minister may have very good reasons for having a different set-up.  If so, he will probably tell us the reasons when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the Bill I notice a reference to a quorum of three.  As far as I can remember, the way it was put was that three members will be empowered to act.  A quorum of three would mean in effect that two people out of nine could possibly decide on the location or the desirability of giving grants or otherwise to a very important industry in the country. Perhaps I am wrong in my interpretation but it is my opinion that a quorum should consist of at least one more than 50 per cent of the total membership because in view of what the Minister said when talking on the imposition of duties, one of the decisions that they will have to take will be in regard to regional industrial undertakings.  I would be quite dissatisfied to leave the decision in the hands of two men out of three.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the consent of the Minister for Finance is necessary for the appointment of members to the board of the IDA. I am sure I can speak for every Member of the House when I say that each of us would be satisfied to leave the appointment of members entirely in the hands of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There may be reasons for having the consent of the Minister for Finance because of possible connections with the financial reward of the members, but it is my opinion that the actual appointments should be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I would be much happier if he could make these appointments of his own volition and <Col N="775" /> without having to consult with the Minister for Finance.  I do not mean that in any personal sense but this in a very real sense will be his baby and it will be a very lusty baby and we hope a very successful one.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister is anxious to get the Bill through the House and I share his anxiety in that regard.  It is most important that we start the New Year with the IDA firmly set up and I would like to express my personal good wishes for their future.  The merger between the existing IDA and An Foras Tionscal is a sensible one.  Some years ago when An Foras Tionscal was being set up I took the view that it was an unnecessary division or responsibility but I hope it will be possible for the Minister at some future date to consider adding to the responsibilities of the IDA some of the services which I mentioned because they are so closely allied to the work which the IDA will be doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a good deal more experience than I in dealing with industrialists but in this day and age when one is dealing with industrialists in particular one finds that they like to go to the one source for almost every service.  One might say this about present-day shopping where the housewife likes to buy everything under the one roof in the shopping centre.  That philosophy is equally applicable in regard to industrial development.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is bringing into effect a very successful body subject to what I have said in regard to the members.  The Minister is acting very properly in his efforts to provide a full service to industrialists.  I do not know to what extent the Minister has taken our entry into the EEC into consideration when framing the terms of the IDA.  I hope he was influenced to a great extent by this very likely eventuality but if he was not he should change his ideas.</P>
    <P>This authority offers this country a very good opportunity of sharing in the challenge of the Common Market but when we are talking about the Common Market, and its great potentiality, we must remember that we are <Col N="776" /> to have a market of upwards of 300 million people and we must remember also that we are opening up our small market with our three million people to the continental giants and it is obvious that unless we trim off the fat from our industrial undertakings not only will we be unfit to complete in the Common Market but we will leave ourselves open to severe and deadly competition with the industrialists on the continent.</P>
    <P>I wish the IDA every success and I congratulate the Minister in bringing forward this Bill.  I endorse his request to get it through quickly so that it can be put into effect in the New Year.</P>

      <P>At the outset of Senator Russell's contribution he told us that he would not take very long in his deliberations.  All of us have heard the Minister's speech and I consider that it is almost self-explanatory.  I do not wish to become involved in any kind of tussle with Senator Russell but there are one or two points to which I should like to refer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to say with regard to the western areas that these grants were brought in because of the complete failure on behalf of new industrial promoters to attract industries to the west unless some special concession were given to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been proved that even with these special concessions it is still almost impossible to attract the kind of industry that everyone would like to see into the western and other sparsely populated areas because the advantages in the build-up centres outweigh the value of the grants and are more attractive to prospective industrialists. I want to put on record, in <Col N="777" /> case Senator Russell is thinking that in this famous council they have in Limerick they will initiate a programme to level out the grants that are applicable to the designated part of West Clare, that we will not see eye to eye with him on that one.</P>
      <P>In his second point, he referred briefly to the question of whether one talks about development areas or development centres.  I have felt the groundswell on this one.  When one talks about development centres apparently the idea is that one builds up a centre and brings everybody in there and when there are too many one tries to push them out again, back to where they came from.</P>

That cost a sizable amount of money.  Having got this thing down on paper and all these reports submitted to us everybody closed the book and then they decided they would require new designations.  The designations were laid down in the Litchfield Report and we want to see these implemented.</P>
      <P>No Bill which is ever likely to be brought in to cover a wide range of projections and hopefulness is likely to succeed completely but everybody will agree that the Minister has made a very sincere effort to include in this Bill the machinery that he sees as being necessary to promote industrial development and to ease out some of the abrasive characters enshrined in trying to promote industry at the moment.  He is to be commended for this.  I know he has put a lot of effort into seeing how this can be done.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to the argument between <Col N="778" /> Senator Russell from the booming city of Limerick and Senator Honan from the booming county of Clare.  Although they may differ in some of their opinions, I think it would be agreed that both areas have done extremely well in recent years.</P>
      <P>If any Member of this House were to drive from Dublin northwards he would cross the border at Monaghan and when he reached the end of the six counties he might discover to his surprise that there is still a part of Ireland left in the Republic.  This fact may not be known to many, particularly to the IDA.</P>
      <P>I live in a town similar in size to Senator Honan's town.  I remember Whit Monday 1952.  It was a red letter day in my town because on that day a factory opened which gave employment to 15 to 20 men.  That was 17 years ago.  Since then no factory has been built giving employment to men in that town.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce were to announce tonight the establishment of a factory in Donegal to employ 15 or 20 men I would say that there would be bonfires and torchlight processions that could not be equalled by any political parade and we are pretty good at that too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>This will strengthen my argument.  I think we will all agree that both these counties have progressed much better, as far as the establishment of industry is concerned, than Donegal.  We should consider for a moment just what is wrong.  I realise that a discussion on partition would be irrelevant in this debate but on the Appropriation Bill I pointed out that one of the terms of reference of the boundary commission was that the geographic and economic conditions were not taken into consideration when the boundary was created and that my county of Donegal suffered as a result.</P>
      <P>If we were to look for an explanation as to why Donegal has not made the progress that it should under the legislation that has been provided I think we could pin it to this: Donegal county has suffered economically as a result of the partition of Ireland.  For that reason I feel that my county is entitled to be made a special case. It is cut off from the rest of Ireland by the six counties under the Stormont Regime.  It is in the national interest that it should be made a special case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We read the statements made across the border, many of them grossly exaggerated, comparing the standard of living in the six counties with the standard of living here.  We hear of the unemployment comparisons made. We should remember that when politicians across the border are quoting like this they are not quoting County Louth, County Monaghan or County Dublin.  They are certainly not quoting County Clare or County Limerick. They are quoting County Donegal. To attempt to prove that these statements are untrue, no one in any part of Ireland will criticise the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he were to decide that because of the partition of Ireland, because of the fact that Donegal is cut off from the rest, it is entitled to be made a special case.  The Stormont Regime receives by way of subsidy something like £130,000,000 from the British Government.  If the British Government can see their way to spend <Col N="780" /> £130,000,000 in six of Ulster's counties we would not criticise the Dublin Government if they could see their way to spend a few million pounds in the three remaining counties.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider that before Donegal can benefit from the grants given, even the present grants under this Act, an airport must be established in our county.  An airport is a must for Donegal if the county is to benefit economically and industrially.  Some years ago the Glasgow-Derry boat was taken off and as a result my county suffered considerably.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Dáil the then Minister for Transport and Power refused to negotiate to have Irish Shipping Limited have a boat from Glasgow to the port of Rathmullen in County Donegal, which is one of the deepest ports in the country, deeper than Cobh, on the grounds that it would not be economic to do so.  I feel the economics of the operation should not be taken into consideration.  I appeal to the Minister to realise there are more Donegal people working in Camden Town, Birmingham and Manchester than there are in my native county.  While we wish Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Clare and Galway well, we also express the hope that some extra encouragement would be given to industrialists to come to the northern part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very brief on this because I do not want to detain the House.  There are just a few points I should like to make.  When Senator McGlinchey started to leave Dublin and get to Donegal one would have thought, listening to some of his statements about Donegal people, that he would have gone to Donegal through the whole Republic of Ireland and travelled through West Cavan right through into north Leitrim and then into Donegal.  He certainly would have got a very good view of west Cavan and north Leitrim, an area mind you for which there has not been much done as far as the industrial world is concerned.  Then if someone travelled into south Leitrim he would find an area which is improving very much in the industrial world with the <Col N="781" /> advantage of the grants which it has got from the small industries section.</P>
      <P>I feel obliged to mention here that in the town I live in there were six new industries opened in the past 12 months, which give employment to 60 people at the moment and will give employment to 100 people in the next two years.  I feel obliged to say that that situation was brought about through the efforts of the local people with the help they receive from the small industries section here in Dublin.  I often wonder if county development teams are accepted sufficiently by the Minister's Department. The county development teams, for the information of Senators who probably do not live in the areas they operate in, are made up of the county manager, the county engineer, the chief agricultural officer, the CEO of the vocational committee and the chairman of the county council.  I have experience of being a member of a county development team for the past three or four years and I certainly think county development teams are putting a tremendous amount of work into each and every one of their own counties to try to get industries for those counties.</P>
      <P>Quite recently at a regional meeting of county development teams in Athlone it was suggested that the Department of Industry and Commerce should give them a limited amount of money that they could spend each year because if they want to get money from the Department it is a rather slow process.  I could not attend the meeting but I think the figure mentioned was in the region of £2,000.  They had in mind giving grants to small development groups in every town in their respective counties, which would enable them to advertise in various papers and they would pay a percentage of the cost.  They did not intend to pay the full percentage as the local people would have to make a contribution of more than 50 per cent.  Those grants would help them to purchase brochures so that they could send them abroad.  I would ask the Minister to have a serious look at this matter when it comes to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, county <Col N="782" /> development teams are made up of responsible people and they certainly would not be prepared to spend public money in a wrong direction.  I am sure they would be quite prepared to submit, prior to the spending of the money, what it was to be spent on or even when it is spent let the Department know what it was spent on.</P>
    <P>We see on page 3 of the Minister's speech reference to the development of a regional office.  When one reads the Buchanan Report one can become weary of regional offices.  People who find themselves in a regional office just think of the town they are living in. It is clearly mentioned in the Buchanan Report that Sligo town should be a growth centre and that it would serve an area of north and south Leitrim. If one looks at that one realises that people from south Leitrim would be asked to travel as far as 50 and 60 miles to work every morning and evening and I do not think that is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about supplementing the income of the small farmers, which has been stated by the Minister for Lands in reply to his debate, it can only be done by giving employment to them within a reasonable distance of their holdings.  If those people are compelled to travel this distance night and morning the day is over when they get home and they are not able to do things they would like to do, such as milking.  For that reason I think the industries will have to be established in all those small towns, such as Senator McGlinchey has mentioned.  That is the only way the income of those people can be supplemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here before us a very important Bill which deals in a large measure with the general economic development of our country. I am sorry we have not more time to debate this Bill but we spent such a lot of time talking about a tribunal earlier on that we are short of time now.  I would like to compliment the Minister in his approach to this Bill and in his own dealings with people who approach him about industries. He is tireless in his efforts to create a situation in the country where full <Col N="783" /> employment will be the order of the day.  While I welcome this Bill there are a few points I would like to make on it.  It is proposed under this Bill to create regions for economic development. Regionalisation is a good idea and it could and should be able to supply all the dynamism that is necessary for development in the underdeveloped areas.  I suppose hereinafter we have to call them the designated areas.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the Buchanan Report and indeed some of it is not complimentary but in the Buchanan Report there are some charts and figures where we have populationwise the north west part of the country which could be classed as a disaster area.  This is part of the region about which Senator McGlinchey spoke a very short time ago.  I would like to feel that something very special would be done for this region.</P>
      <P>The whole western region suffers because it is far from Dublin and because Dublin has grown so much more quickly.  Part of the reason that industry cannot develop in the West, we are sometimes told, is transport costs.  There is talk sometimes of subsidising transport for the West of Ireland.  I think that this would be a very difficult thing to do, and that perhaps if we thought along the lines that with the ports we have in the West of Ireland that could and should be developed we would be doing an immense amount of good for the area as a whole.  Senator McGlinchey will excuse me for mentioning Galway, but Galway after all was a very big and important port in its day and now with the development of an industrial estate there I think that Galway should be for shipping what Shannon Free Airport is for air freight.</P>
      <P>Might I mention as an aside that down in Cork a lot of people are not very happy about having a nice big smelting project going in there.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to say something to the promoters to tell them to turn their eyes towards the West.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that we are now going to have regional officers and I think that Senator Russell seemed to think that the Minister was only now making up his mind about the regional officers, but there was an advertisement in the papers some time ago for the regional officers and areas were set out for the different regions. I would hope that when these men, if they are going to be appointed, are appointed perhaps a little change of mind might come about in the regions as they are now drawn, because Roscommon is in with Offaly and Laois, and for the life of me I cannot see what we have in common with those counties.  If nothing else they are on the other side of the Shannon and we in the West stay on our own side of the Shannon most of the time.  Perhaps this is not a good way to be but our situation there is peculiar to that region and it does not have much in common with those counties.</P>
      <P>I really am very uncertain as to whether I approve of these regional officers and the regional offices as they are at present proposed.  We have a very good county development team doing a very good job of work, and if the regional officer is coming in to help to implement those county development teams and give this thing a further impetus I would be very delighted, but I wonder if those people are going to be set up in offices eventually with budgets of their own something like the Shannon Free Development Company.  I know that this is the type of regional development we all like to see but I hope that the Minister would be able to set our minds at rest on what is envisaged in relation to the duties of these officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the provisions relating to grants under section 34 because I think that as it stands at the moment it could give a grant of up to 45 per cent outside the designated areas in certain cases.  I would like, in common with every Deputy and Senator from the West, to see a greater differentiation in grant allowances between the designated and non-designated areas in the country, because we must have great incentives to bring people to the designated areas, and I would join here with Senator <Col N="785" /> Russell in saying that I think it might be no harm if there was a change of mind about giving grants to existing industries who because they must rebuild their plants to become efficient and streamline their operations and enlarge their premises would be regarded for this purpose as a new industry, because in many cases the capital cost which these people are involved in would run into as much as a new industry and I think, though I am open to correction at the moment, that all these people could get is an adaptation grant.  I know that there is a question of money in this, but something could be done about this.  It is a good thing, our industrialists are being told that they must go into the Common Market and they must get ready for this.  I hope that the Minister will in his wisdom see fit to do something about helping existing firms.</P>
    <P>There should be, too, I think, an incentive given to firms in Dublin to move to the West.  Again I am open to correction on this but I think that they would not get any great concessions by way of grant to move to the West. They would just get the 25 per cent grant.  I would like to say that the small industries have done a lot for the West of Ireland.  It was a very wonderful scheme when it was envisaged first, but it would appear now that there are such a lot of industries being excluded from grants and that it is going to defeat its purpose.  I have always held that if there is a demand in any area or region for a particular product that the person setting up that industry or producing that product should get some assistance. I know that now the overall national picture is taken into consideration and grants are given or withheld on the information that is available as to what the supply or the capability to supply the needs of the country are. I would like to mention joinery as a typical example of this.  There are no grants now for small industries like this yet you have what appears to be a great demand for and a continuing shortage in certain areas of ordinary joinery products.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to section 34 again, dealing with further grants by the Authority, and unlike many of my fellow Senators here I cannot prefix <Col N="786" /> my statements by saying &ldquo;speaking as a lawyer&rdquo;.  I can only speak as a lay-woman and I would think that there are in subsection (3) certain specifications for further grants enumerated. It would appear on the reading of this that three of the four specifications must be present before a full grant will be given.  I would like to ask the Minister should not the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; not be in subsection (a) and subsection (b) as well as subsection (c).</P>
    <P>There is also section 40 which deals with research and development. Development is mentioned in (1) and (2) but after that the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; is missing.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this for us in his reply.</P>
    <P>Also I should like to say that I hope this will be the dawn of a new era for the Industrial Development Authority and I wish them well.  When he spoke about the setting up of the board, Senator Russell blandly assumed that the nine board members would be men. I would remind the House that there is another sex and that they are not completely brainless and might have something to offer to the board.</P>

      <P>I do not want to worry the House on this.  I may say that I have very considerable sympathy with Senator Farrell on what she has said with regard to the time available to us.  Senator Russell on behalf of the Fine Gael Party has already engaged to the Minister that we are prepared to respond to the wishes expressed by the Minister to give a speedy passage to this Bill in the Seanad, but I do think that it is unfortunate that the Seanad should once more be put in the position of having to consider a measure such as this, a Bill of quite substantial importance to the industrial development of this country, in a matter of some hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not take these remarks as being critical of him.  I am aware that he brought this Bill to the Seanad as soon as it came out of the Dáil but it is unfortunate that the Seanad find themselves in a position that with a Bill of 46 sections and two Schedules we are not being given <Col N="787" /> an opportunity of considering some amendments which I think might be very worthwhile asking the Minister to consider.  Senator Russell pointed out one matter in relation to the Second Schedule.  So far as I can see, he was correct.  It means that while the board will consist of nine people it may act with any three of those members. Unless I am entirely mistaken, and Senator Russell is also mistaken in his interpretation of it, that seems to indicate that while having a board of nine, in effect, a situation could arise where decisions of very considerable importance would have to be taken by two members of the board only.  If they are authorised to act by any three of those members and if a meeting consists of only three members then presumably the decision can be taken by the majority vote of those three.</P>
    <P>If that interpretation is correct, that is a matter in which it would have been well worth the while of the Seanad to discuss and consider an amendment on the lines indicated by Senator Russell so that the majority, that is, one over 50 per cent, would be required.  Perhaps there would be difficulties about this but at least it might be worth considering.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Farrell referred to a point in connection with section 34. It may be that it is intended to be exactly as it is, namely, that subsection (3) (a), (b) and (c) are lumped together and paragraph 4 is an alternative provision to the other three taken together.  There again it might have been worthwhile for the Seanad to consider whether or not each of these paragraphs might not have been considered as sufficient standing independently rather than that we should have a situation where three of them go together and the fourth is a counterbalance to that.  I know that the Seanad wish to facilitate not merely the Minister in this, but also those who are awaiting grants or facilities which would be available from the IDA under this Bill.  While wishing to facilitate those interests the Seanad must not be hamstrung in the consideration of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Bill as <Col N="788" /> being designed to integrate and to bring them up to date in the light of experience. I do not want to quarrel with that description of the Bill.  The Minister went on to refer to the fact that this was an amending Bill and does not contain within itself all the provisions relating to the IDA.  I do not quarrel with the accuracy of what the Minister says but I would like to suggest to him that he might take an opportunity to try and codify the legislation in relation to the IDA at some stage.  I know the importance of this from the point of view of a lawyer, as I am sure the Minister himself will appreciate, but it is not merely a matter of convenience to lawyers.  It is a matter of convenience to all who, for one reason or another, turn to the IDA for assistance by way of grant or general promotional activities in development. A measure such as I envisage would not be a controversial one.  It might consume some time in the Minister's Department to undertake the work, but it would be worth doing.  I would recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions that the promotional work of the IDA has been effective.  I do not want to indulge in politics in this but it is good to see the Minister or any Minister of the present Government Party acknowledging so whole-heartedly the work of the IDA. It seemed at one time when the authority was being formed that it had not the best wishes of the Minister's Party.  I am glad to say that the Minister has put himself on record so generously with regard to it.  In the second page of his speech the Minister referred to the value of industrial exports as being now six times that of ten years ago.  That seems to be an achievement.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that we must really look at the figures when we think in terms of money values.  Money values are approximately one-half of what they were ten years ago so that the actual value of the industrial exports is about three times what it was ten years ago.  I am not entirely happy about the practice shown by the breakdown of the projects mentioned by the Minister in the course of his opening speech.  At page 2 he mentions that the <Col N="789" /> extent of the international scale on which this operation is working can be seen in a breakdown of the projects he has mentioned plus others &ldquo;currently under negotiation&rdquo;.  The Minister gives the breakdown as being 25 per cent British, 20 per cent Irish, 20 per cent American, 15 per cent German, and also mentions that there are others from different countries.  The Minister is, in fact, saying that in all these projects the Irish interest is limited to 20 per cent. I agree with Senator Russell's remarks regarding the injection here of foreign capital and the conditions which he laid down for welcoming them.  It is just a little disturbing to find that of the projects described or mentioned by the Minister only 20 per cent are Irish. It is worth bearing that figure in mind. Many people will feel that while we may welcome and indeed we must welcome the injection of foreign capital and endeavour by incentives of one sort or another to attract foreign capital in order to further industrial development, at the same time I have the feeling that many people in this country would like to see the Irish arm of that effort strengthened, <i>vis-a-vis</i> foreign injection.</P>
    <P>On the question of the setting up of regional offices by the IDA, I can appreciate there may be two views as to the value of this.  Generally speaking, my own view would come down fairly heavily in favour of the establishment of regional offices, particularly if the idea and the establishment of the regional offices is to have them manned by officers who fulfil a twofold function: first, that they will be able to make available from their own knowledge and their own exploration in the particular region information regarding the region itself, and secondly that they would be able to make this information readily available if there are local inquiries regarding industry. It would be a pity if the situation developed that because a regional office was in a particular town it was assumed that it was the town which had sole importance in the region and was accepted as a kind of sinecure for all forms of industrial activity rather than being spread and spaced out more evenly throughout the region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> I am puzzled about a reference made by the Minister on page 3 of his report when he said:</P>
    <P>In contrast to the small scale of home-based industry, we now have under consideration a number of large industrial projects which have both substantial employment and growth potential.</P>
    <P>What is the significance of the phrase &ldquo;home-based industry&rdquo;?  It would seem to imply that the Minister or the IDA were considering the establishment of industries that were not home-based, which would be based outside this country.  I do not know whether the Minister intended that or not and I simply put it down as a query.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister for some information on his statement:</P>
    <P>The powers being conferred on the Authority to provide factories for purchase or leasing will also enhance the range and suitability of the package of incentives.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking that the power which the Minister refers to is the power given to the authority under section 15 of the Bill?  I am not criticising or objecting that the power should be given to the IDA, although this is a matter on which there might be two points of view.  If the IDA are being put in a position where they will either erect or purchase industrial premises of one sort or another and where they will go into the market either as landlords leasing out the premises or into the property market selling off their premises as they become vacant, there will be a number of people who might object to this kind of activity.  However I shall not go into this in more detail at the moment.  I shall merely ask the Minister if the powers he referred to in the second paragraph of page 4 of his statement are the powers contained in section 15 of the Bill?  It does not seem to me that this is made entirely clear by section 15 and I think many people reading that section might be surprised that this section gives the power of purchase, leasing and so on to the IDA.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo. <Col N="791" /> What I have to say will not be an extension of what has been said already; it will hardly be even parallel to what has been said but rather will it be taken to be complementary to what has already been said here.  We are now in the festive season of Christmas, the buying season as we all know in every sense of the word. It is alarming to find many shops completely full of foreign-made goods, displayed to the best advantage with the intention of attracting as many customers as possible.  Unfortunately a very large number of customers come along, buy these goods and do not bother to see whether they are made at home or abroad.  In my first lesson at the school of nationality I was given three precepts: be Irish, speak Irish, buy Irish, and perhaps for a moment we will look at the third dictum.</P>
      <P>It behoves us as patriotic Irishmen, and especially as Members of the Oireachtas, to do everything possible to ensure that Irish-made goods are displayed to the best advantage in our shops, stores, markets, and supermarkets and to encourage the public to purchase these goods in preference to the foreign-made product.  This is patriotic duty of the highest order. Every penny we spend on an article made here will find its way into the pocket of the bread-winner of an Irish family.  There may have been an excuse not to buy Irish-made articles in years gone by because unfortunately it was true that quite a number of articles were of inferior quality or were too costly but that day is now past and Irish-made goods, textiles, footwear, canned foods <i>et cetera</i> are comparable with, if not better than, similar products from abroad.  Therefore there is no excuse not to buy Irish-made goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, the shops seem to be full of foreign-made goods &mdash;Christmas cards and presents of all kinds&mdash;and I suggest now to everyone in this House that we must be firm when we go to purchase goods, we must give our views clearly and insist on buying the home-made product even at the risk of being regarded as tedious, over-bearing or even superpatriotic. <Col N="792" /> The greatest danger any country can face is, in my opinion, not poverty but opulence and in this era of ever-increasing prosperity we are inclined to forget ourselves and to regard the purchasing of the foreign-made articles as an indication of our superior social status.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I was speaking to a widow who has a small public house and grocery business right in the heart of a rural community.  She told me that of the farmers and farmers' sons who come in at night to watch television and have a drink, 75 or 85 per cent of them when calling for whiskey, ask for Scotch.  That is alarming when one realises that we have such fine whiskey in Ireland with the finest distilled at Cork&mdash;that is not a commercial.  I was also surprised to hear this considering that the half glass of Scotch probably costs two pence or three pence more than Irish.  It is an alarming tendency and we, as Irishmen and as Members of the Oireachtas, should dedicate ourselves by example and precept to counteracting that tendency.</P>

      <P>To turn now to the question of small industries, I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance of the small industry in Irish life, the industry which requires a comparatively small capital outlay but a high degree of skill.  Switzerland has shown the world what can be done in this field.  That inland country having no iron or coal mines and having to bring steel and fuel long distances&mdash; they have electric power and plenty of it&mdash;concentrated not on heavy machinery but on making watches, surgical instruments and things that required an extremely high degree of skill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is very sympathetic to this idea and has given every possible encouragement to it and with the emphasis on our education system moving from the purely academic and professional status to the more practical manifestation of intelligence we look forward to a greater desire among our young people for the acquiring of skills in woodwork, metal work and plastics.  The basic objective <Col N="793" /> in industrial development should be the establishment of one or more industries in every small town, village and parish.  The large centres of population are able to fend for themselves but what a change it would be if we had a good thriving industry in every parish in our country especially in these areas where we have the great problem of the small and unproductive farm.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the Bill which I commend most heartily and that is section 16 which reads:</P>
    <P>The Authority may provide and arrange the provision of housing intended for occupation by employees in industry and, for this purpose, may buy, lease or sell lands, subsidise rents and do everything necessary or ancillary to such provision.</P>
    <P>I regard it as a basic principle that people should live where they earn their living.  In that way they will give back to a district and its people at least part of what the district has given them.  They will have a greater pride in the achievement of that community and their lives will be richer and most rewarded.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to read the Minister's speech and, in particular, page 2 where he says with regard to new projects that these will give rise to almost 10,000 new jobs at the end of their first year and an estimated 17,800 jobs ultimately.  I notice that the Minister says he does not take personal or political credit for those events which, he says, are due to the efforts, co-operation and adaptability of the whole Irish people and in particular to the improvement in technical and managerial skills in industry and to increased knowledge of design and maketing.  Although the Minister says that in all humility our thanks are due to him for his untiring efforts to promote industrial activity.  I notice that at the end of page 2 the Minister says:</P>
    <P>In the first half of this year, 119 small industry projects were approved for grants; these projects are estimated to give employment to 700 persons ultimately.</P>
    <P>That is most encouraging and we offer our congratulations to the Minister <Col N="794" /> and everybody associated with this excellent work.</P>
    <P>Anois, an focal deiridh.  Ba dheas an leagan Gaeilge d'ainm an údaráis nua a bheith i mbéal an phobail i gcónaí. Faoi mar atá, ní bheidh acu ach an IDA nó an Industrial Development Authority.

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to say what I have to say in two minutes flat. I just want to touch on a few points and I shall make them relevant to the IDA and to the Bill.</P>
      <P>My first point is that whenever I am speaking at a meeting about incentives for development in this country at least one member of the public gets up and says: &ldquo;Oh, but services like the IDA are not readily available to Irish people and Irish enterprise and anyway in dealing with bodies like this we find too much Civil Service red tape and so on&rdquo;.  This is a commonly-held attitude. I welcome this Bill.  I feel that many of its arrangements are intended to break down this image.  It is well worth stressing on this occasion that the IDA, as I understand it, is there to serve Irish people and Irish enterprise equally with its job of attracting foreign industry and also that from now on it will be run on a much more commercial and enterprising basis than heretofore and much of the red tape is being got rid of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sections 11 and 12 of the Bill involving the implementation of national objectives for regional development it seems to me that one of the problems at the moment is that nobody is completely clear as to what our national objectives for regional development are.  It seems to <Col N="795" /> me that this underlies the urgent need for decisions on Buchanan, for announcements of decisions on regional development, because there are many alternative strategies and apart from the IDA being involved in it bodies like CIE are involved as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of regional offices but I think that regional organisation to be effective should follow on the lines of the suggestion which I very much approve of in an addendum to the Devlin Report by T.J. Barrington, Director of the Institute of Public Administration, whose comments about regionalisation are at page 483, paragraph 19, of the Devlin Report and I suggest that they are well worth studying.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the grants for research and development.  I wonder if the Minister could clarify whether it would be possible for an individual enterprise to sponsor industrial research completely outside the firm, research to be carried out in any one of our universities, whether a firm could get a grant for research to be entirely carried out at a university.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to make one query.  Section 19 on page 7 seems an unusual sort of section.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The Authority may accept a gift of money, land or other property on such trusts and conditions as may be specified by the donor.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is involved here?  If the hope is to attract funds from the Henry Ford or Andrew Carnegie of the day I hope it will be successful.  Even if we had an individual philanthropist who wanted to make a Christmas present to the IDA, would it be possible to make such a public-spirited gesture under this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation to the House for the co-operation it has shown and for the very constructive comments which we have had on the Bill.  I shall endeavour to deal as quickly as I can with as many of the points raised as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell made reference to failures.  He mentioned some notable failures in that connection.  The House <Col N="796" /> should know that to date our gross failure rate is approximately 10 per cent but if account is taken of new industries which have started up in the premises of those that went wrong we have what might be called a net failure rate of 4 per cent.  This, as far as we can ascertain, is quite low by international standards though other countries are not quite so open about their failures as we are.</P>
    <P>Another significant factor about those failures is that 60 per cent of those which have occurred relate to projects approved before 1960.  This is a reflection of a number of things&mdash;the growing expertise and sophistication in the IDA in assessing projects, the increasingly capital intensive nature of the projects which means that the promoters are much less likely to pull out, and some other aspects.  We must, of course, always accept that in the kind of programme that we are pursuing the risk of failure is there at all times and we must accept that risk.  If we do not accept that, our programme will not bring in one single industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of co-operation and co-ordination with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, Córas Tráchtála and the IRB of my own Department, there is in fact very close co-operation and co-ordination at the moment and they are taking further steps to make that even closer.  Of course, the relationship with An Chomhairle Oiliúna must be extremely close and will become even closer in future.  With the development of industry the importance of training will grow and I certainly expect the necessity for this kind of very close co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should get involved in the argument between Senator Russell and Senator Honan about the levelling up or levelling down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the level of grants in the mid-western region except to say that while I am aware of a number of arguments I would be slow to agree to any change which could have the effect of reducing the advantages for the western regions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Well I think to increase the level of grants in the non-western regions would have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the mid-western region.  I think that the middle of the country and the west should be higher but related specifically to the designated areas, in other words that the centre of the country and the west should have higher grants than Dublin and the east.  The only levelling up would be within the designated area.  That was what I meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I see what the Senator meant but in practice this is what happens administratively.  There are certain projects which will not get a grant at all in the Dublin region. There are others which if they qualify for a grant in the Dublin region they will get a low one whereas in other parts of the country they will get a much more substantial one.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell made the point, but I had better make it myself anyway, that it was not as a result of the debate in Dáil Éireann on this Bill that I accepted firmly the idea of regional development, regional offices or their evolution.  In fact I would draw the attention of the House to the statement which was issued by the Government quite a few months ago in relation to the Buchanan Report. That statement specified each of the nine regions into which the country is being divided for industrial development purposes and specified that regional development offices would be opened there and indicated, what I want to make clear, that there were special reasons why we were able to do what we did in the mid-west region. We had the existence of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the expertise that it had built up over the years.  In addition, and very important, we had the Lichfield Report on the region.  This meant we were able to go ahead there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that what I envisage is that some similar kind of structure will evolve in each of the <Col N="798" /> other eight regions.  Obviously this cannot be done quickly, certainly not overnight.  The creation of eight other SFADCOs will not be an easy operation, but steps have been taken to provide the kind of information within each region that was available already under the Lichfield Report and the regional offices will, I hope, be opened and staffed within a matter of a few months in each of the regions.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps, because a number of Senators referred to this, say something about what is intended, even from the beginning, as functions for the regional officers.  As I have indicated, one of their first tasks will be to assist in the preparation of industrial plans for the region.  It is also intended to give them these functions: (a)  to increase very considerably the present ability to service external industrialists who wish to explore the possibilities for industrial development in this country; (b) to afford an improved basis for after-care services for new industries which is a very important thing in the stimulation of further development; (c) to assist in the expansion part of existing industry; (d) to enable better use to be made of the initiative and energy of local development groups; (e) to increase the effectiveness of the small industries programme within the region; (f) to explore the possibility for a greater degree of linkage between existing industries and between new industry and existing firms.</P>
    <P>They will have functions in relation to industries throughout their region and will also discharge the present functions of the local estate management officers of An Foras Tionscal in relation to industrial estates.  They will also represent the IDA on regional organisations, which are at present being instituted, and will work closely with the local authorities on the physical planning and development of each region.  It is also expected, and hoped, that those regional offices and their staff will be a stimulant to existing Irish industries in their expansion and that they will provide more detailed information on the regions and on their development potential, that they will assist industrialists to formulate <Col N="799" /> industrial projects, co-ordinate housing for industry with the requirements and the functions of other housing bodies, achieve liaison with the Department of Labour and An Chomhairle Oiliúna in relation to regional manpower availability and also have certain functions in relation to the building and maintenance of advance factories and increase in the local industrial linkage.</P>
    <P>It will be clearly seen then from all of this that it is not intended that they will be some kind of a window dressing operation.  They will have a major job to do and as I said I visualise they will evolve in each region into something on the lines of what we have now in the mid-western region or the Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary region.</P>
    <P>A point was raised, I think by Senator O'Higgins, about the powers I had referred to in my speech.  He asked if I was referring to the powers conferred in section 15 and the answer to that is &ldquo;yes I was.&rdquo;  I might perhaps point out that the powers of compulsory acquisition under section 15, (2) are not new.  They were contained in fact in previous legislation.  The only additional thing is that they are now being extended to cover the establishment of advanced factories and industrial estates.  Heretofore they were available only in relation to the establishment of a specific industrial undertaking otherwise they are as they were before.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly about the relationship between the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the IDA but broadly speaking the intention is that, subject to the exclusion of the actual industrial estate at Shannon, which is remaining as before under the control of SFADCO, within the whole of the region the responsibility of SFADCO would be for industrial promotion. Indeed the activities they have undertaken so far give a fair idea of what is intended.</P>
    <P>They have drawn up a programme for the region.  They are securing, I think successfully, assent in the region to the kind of priorities that seem to be necessary.  They are indulging in a <Col N="800" /> good deal of promotion.  They will act as agents of the IDA within the region but their promotional activity abroad must be co-ordinated by the IDA themselves with that of the IDA and of other regions when this develops. The final decision on grants must rest with the IDA although in practice a certain amount of delegation from the IDA to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is taking place but the ultimate decisions on grant-giving in the region will be retained by the IDA.</P>
    <P>I would point out, in regard to the comments made on re-equipment grants for the designated areas, that in fact in this Bill we are stepping them up from 25 per cent to 35 per cent for the designated areas.  I would also like to make it clear that this has been so for a very long time but a number of Senators referred to it.  The treatment meted out to Irish firms on the one hand and foreign firms on the other is exactly the same where the circumstances are not the same.  When an Irish firm is applying for a re-equipment grant it can get this automatically and with no question about scaling down the grant from the 25 per cent in the non-designated and now 35 per cent in the designated areas provided it meets the normal criteria and submits the evidence required.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of new industry starting up, whether it is Irish or foreign, the criteria can be quite different. First of all, it will very often be insisted on that it export all or virtually all of its production.  It has to face various difficulties about location, perhaps building the new factory and getting services.  It has quite a number of other criteria applied to it.  So, what I want to make clear is where the circumstances are the same Irish and foreign firms are treated exactly the same way but in most cases where you have applications from Irish firms the circumstances are different from those of foreign firms.  I want to make it clear the position has been, still is, and will continue to be, where an Irish firm applies in respect of a new industry it gets the same treatment as foreign firms and in some respects it could be said it gets extra special treatment because it has certain facilities available <Col N="801" /> to it that foreign firms do not have, but by and large it would be true to say it gets the same treatment.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to comment further on the information I have given about the spread of new industries.  I said that it was 25 per cent.  This was related to the new ones &mdash;25 per cent American, 20 per cent Irish and so on.  Of course the comment was made, which was fair enough, that it seems to be a very small percentage which was Irish, but I would remind the House that we are talking about new Irish projects and that in fact that 20 per cent represents a fairly substantial increase on what we have been having in recent years. You must take into account the fact that the bulk of our industry is of course Irish and Irish controlled and we are talking here about new projects. I may also say in that regard that the wide spread of it is one guarantee to us against undue dominance by any one foreign country in our industry.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Senator Russell also as to whether roads, rail sidings and so on are eligible within the term of fixed assets.  The answer is that they are.  All sorts of things including jetties and so on are eligible within the term of fixed assets provided that they are inside the perimeter of the factory.  If they are outside then they are not so eligible, but of course the decision on whether a grant should be awarded in respect of expenditure on those items is a matter which has to be left to the Industrial Development Authority, which would have to decide each case on its merits, and they are certainly eligible for consideration provided they are within the perimeter of the factory.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taking of equity shares in projects such as this, this is a new power.  In the development of a number of projects coming in the promoters would not be prepared, I think, to offer shares to the State, but there are others coming from countries where they are more used to this idea and prepared to do so.  The thinking behind this is not, of course, that we are going to have shares in all these new industrial projects, but when we have perhaps big projects where the State is <Col N="802" /> giving a very substantial grant and where the prospects for the industry look very promising&mdash;as indeed they would have to if we were giving a very substantial grant&mdash;one method of ensuring that the State gets some return for its investment, some cash return, is to invest in portion of the equity.  The fact that these shares would be vested in the Minister for Finance is merely a convenient way of having them held by him as a trustee for the State.  This is normal practice.  The advice available in regard to such shares is of course quite extensive, particularly from the Industrial Credit Company.  I should perhaps say that I would visualise that providing the companies concerned had agreed to this condition at the beginning it would be possible for the State at what was considered to be an appropriate time to offer these shares in the equity to investors in the Irish market, and the time when that should be done would I think be related to the return to the State on the investment.  I would certainly, and have always, visualised this as a possibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of this difficulty.  With regard to the members of the board I would like to say that there would be certain people appointed to this board in representative capacities to ensure very close co-ordination and so on, but apart from those I do not intend to have people on this board in a representational capacity.  I think that this can be fatal to the working of the board.  What I want to do is, apart from those particular appointments, to appoint the best people that I can get, the best qualified to do the job here and I hope of such calibre and standing that it would be impossible to have any allegations urged against them of leaning one way or another in the exercise of their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Bill does not specify clearly whether they are to be full-time or part-time, or some of them full-time and some part-time, for the information of the House I should say that apart from the recently appointed chairman, who I visualised would be <Col N="803" /> managing director hereafter, I visualise all the other members of the board as being part-time.  The functions of the board would be the laying down of policy and its review from time to time and the assessment of the performance of the Industrial Development Authority in reaching targets which would be set down for it from time to time.  It is virtually impossible for full-time members of the board, or of any board, to perform this kind of function.  On the other hand there are considerable advantages in having full-time people available, as we have had heretofore, and I am trying to achieve this by utilising one of the provisions in the schedule to have the board delegate certain powers to the people who are at present full-time members of the board.  I think that it should be possible to have the best of both worlds this way.  In real life one finds difficulties both ways, but we will try it anyway, and this is what I have in mind.</P>
    <P>With regard to the quorum, I agree that it looks extremely small.  I would, however, suggest to the House that in practice the practical quorum will be considerably higher, but one can visualise situations in which an urgent decision on a very vital matter might be required and this is the reason that the quorum is relatively quite low, but as I say, in practical terms I do not visualise a quorum of three operating at all.  In other words I do not see meetings taking place with only three persons unless in an emergency situation of the kind that I have suggested. Even then I would think that if it were to happen it would be for a formal meeting to confirm something that the members of the board had in substance agreed to.</P>

I do not claim that I have arrived at it but I think that I have arrived at the best available solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Bill is so drafted that it can be dealt with either way.  I do not think that Senator Farrell was here when I mentioned what I visualised as the evolution of the regional development offices, but if she were here and heard what I had said about it I hope that what I said will satisfy her as to what is likely to develop.</P>
      <P>She raised two points.  With regard to section 34 (3), I want to assure her that all these points (a), (b), (c) and (d) are alternatives.  The drafting is done in that way to achieve that purpose, as though the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; were in after each one.  If Senator Farrell looks at subsection (1) she will see that research and development grants are described as research grants.  Thereafter, when that phrase is used we are referring to research and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator O'Higgins about consolidating this legislation.  I will give some thought to it.  I appreciate the point which he is making and think it is important.  The phrase &ldquo;home based&rdquo; which I used was a rather unfortunate one but it was intended to convey Irish ownership and nothing else.  With regard to the small industries projects programme to which a number of people referred, I believed in it originally when I introduced it and I believe in it now more than ever.  I am satisfied <Col N="805" /> it has considerable potential and has achieved considerable success.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Second Stage of the Bill I referred to the 119 small industries approved in the first half of this year but I did not make it clear that these would involve 700 additional jobs in small industries.  The figures which I have given about the projects, other than small industries approved in the first half of this year, are extremely heartening, but lest anybody think we are only talking about the potential of these, I would remind them the figures also show that in the 12 months ending June of this year there were just 11,000 new jobs created in manufacturing industries which is a little higher&mdash;having regard to the fact that I said &ldquo;manufacturing industries&rdquo;&mdash;than the target set in the NIEC Report on Full Employment. There is every reason to believe we will go ahead of that target.  The sooner we do the better.  We can all feel some satisfaction that we have now such momentum behind the industrial development drive that we can see the end of the tunnel, which is a position where no Irishman or Irishwoman will be forced by economic circumstances to leave this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery dealt with the question of Irish and foreign ownership. Plans have been initiated and will be developed under the new IDA specially related to Irish industry in order to develop it further.  I assure Senator Keery that work carried on wholly or mainly in universities will certainly qualify for grants.  Universities are already been used by the IDA in a consultancy capacity in certain cases. On the question of accepting gifts I would like to say that while we are not visualising soliciting gifts we do not want to be in the unhappy position where we could not accept gifts if offered.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1969: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>

      <P>I want to ask if the Minister has in mind any time for the coming into operation of this Bill?</P>

      <P>Broadly speaking, I might say as soon as possible.  Speaking from recollection, there may be certain parts which will not come in with the operation of the Bill itself originally.  For the general operation of the Bill I may say it will come into operation as soon as it is possible for me to make the order.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 4 to 9, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to say <Col N="807" /> on section 10 arises on other sections as well.  I think it arises on section 3 also.  When, under this Bill, regulations are laid before the House am I correct in thinking that neither House of the Oireachtas will have in fact an opportunity of rescinding them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  It is a fairly common provision in regard to matters such as pensions <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 11 to 15, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister confines the power and authority in relation to section 16 to houses intended for occupation by employees in industry. Is this wise?  What is contemplated is the provision of housing for industry, but I think it is possible to envisage a situation where houses originally intended for industry in order to provide accommodation for employees for one reason or another become redundant, for instance, as in the case of a mine which had been worked and operated successfully for a number of years and then peters out.  Perhaps a number of houses would become redundant. I am not entirely satisfied that the Authority would then have power either by sale or by letting to allow others than industrial employees have occupation of the houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not gone into the specific legal point raised by Senator O'Higgins, but at a glance I think it refers to housing intended for occupation by employees in industry. Provided that is complied with, if the situation which Senator O'Higgins visualises were to eventuate I think the authority would in fact have power to dispose of the housing if there were no employees in industry available as the &ldquo;intended for occupation&rdquo; phrase would have been satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it implies employees in industry.  The Minister may well be right but this is a point worth looking at again and in any event it will have to be looked at if the situation arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct.</P>

      <P>This amends the 1950 Act by substituting a new subsection and it is clear that under the subsection substituted where a member of the authority is nominated as a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas he is disqualified.  On rereading this it answers my query.  At first it seemed to me that the word &ldquo;candidate&rdquo; was only referable to the Dáil and that the second part &rdquo;nominated as a member&rdquo; referred to the Seanad and I wondered at first whether a person who was nominated as a candidate as distinct from a person nominated as a member of the Seanad was disqualified.  I think they are disqualified.</P>
