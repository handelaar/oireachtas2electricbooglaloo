    <Title>Agricultural Credit Bill, 1969: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the financial resources of the Agricultural Credit Corporation so that its work may continue and expand. The total amount of ACC loans at present outstanding exceeds £20 million.  Lending by the corporation in its present financial year, which ends on 30th April, will total more than £5 million and it is expected that this volume of business will increase steadily in the years immediately ahead.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Act, 1965, authorised share capital of £6 million for the corporation and increased to £20 million the borrowing powers of the corporation.  The share capital has now been fully subscribed by the State and total borrowing by the corporation amounts to approximately £15 million. The Bill proposes to increase the authorised share capital limit to £10 million (section 2) and to extend the borrowing limit to £25 million (section 3).  It is expected that the proposed new limits will suffice for at least five years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 proposes to extend the authority of the Minister for Finance to guarantee the corporation's borrowings to accord with the new borrowing limit.  Under present arrangements for financing the corporation, the Exchequer will take up the new share capital and will also make repayable <Col N="844" /> advances to meet the annual deficiency when the corporation's other sources of capital&mdash;repayments of earlier loans and borrowings from the public&mdash;have been tapped to the full.  Last year the corporation remunerated its share capital at four per cent and paid interest at the full lending rate on its Exchequer borrowings.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions in the Bill which are intended to facilitate the ACC in its day-to-day administration.  With the increase in its volume of business, the corporation is finding it increasingly difficult to have the annual accounts prepared, audited and furnished to the Minister for Finance for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas within ninety days after the end of the accounting year.  It is proposed in section 5 to follow modern practice generally in this respect in relation to State-sponsored bodies by removing the specific time limit of 90 days and substituting a requirement that the accounts be submitted as soon as may be after the close of the year.  Under this new provision the corporation will still be obliged to have the accounts prepared as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation, requests to a county registrar by the commercial banks and the ACC for information from the register of chattel mortgages must be made under seal.  This procedure has at times proved to be a source of delay for the corporation and it is proposed in section 6 of the Bill that requisitions to a county registrar may be made under the hand of a solicitor or law agent of the corporation or a bank.  The county registrar will continue to be the only person with direct access to the register of chattel mortgages.  I understand that the banks do not register chattel mortgages to any extent.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a consequential provision to empower the ACC to make the amendments in their memorandum and articles of association which may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The ACC offer a wide range of loan facilities designed to meet the productive needs of agriculture.  While overall lending by the corporation has fallen <Col N="845" /> off since 1965, due to the general suspension in the autumn of that year of loans for land purchase and the funding of bank debts because of the shortage of capital, there has been a steady increase in loans for directly productive purposes.  The number of unsecured loans issued by the corporation to farmers is rising rapidly and the maximum amount of loan which may be issued under the corporation's scheme of unsecured loans is now £750.</P>
    <P>The budgeted loan scheme, which has been in operation since the beginning of 1968, enables farmers to finance their seasonal needs as they arise by means of a book of dated cheques issued by the corporation; no security is required for loans of up to £1,000 under this scheme.  Business with farming co-operative societies is growing steadily, and outstanding loans to these societies at present well exceed £½ million.  More than 80 per cent of all loan applications received by the corporation are approved, and the repayments record of borrowers is excellent.  Because of the continuing shortage of capital it will be necessary to maintain the present restrictions on loans for land purchase and debt funding as directly productive needs must have first claim.  Any significant relaxation of these restrictions would give rise to considerable extra demand for Exchequer funds and add to the difficulties of financing the public capital programme.</P>
    <P>However, the corporation continue to make loans available for the purchase of land to enlarge uneconomic holdings.  During the past 12 months £150,000 was issued for this purpose.</P>
    <P>An important development in the ACC's activities has been the setting up of area officers in provincial centres. These officers provide a closer link between the ACC and the farmer and they help by their advice to ensure that credit is used to best advantage by the borrowers.  As the corporation's business grows, further extensions to the area-officer system are envisaged until the whole country is adequately catered for.</P>
    <P>In recent years the ACC have raised a considerable amount of capital from the public through the operation of a <Col N="846" /> deposits scheme and the issue of farm credit bonds.  Both deposits and bonds are guaranteed by the State.  The total of outstanding deposits and bonds at present amounts to approximately £6½ million.  The corporation's efforts to finance as much as possible of its lending operations from non-Exchequer sources were not very successful during the past year because of the general increase in interest rates which resulted in stronger competition from other borrowing institutions for the public's savings.  In order to maintain their competitive position the corporation revised their borrowing rates in January and again in April of this year.  The interest rates on deposits now range up to 7¼ per cent subject to six months notice of withdrawal and the interest rate applicable to the latest series of bonds is 6¾ per cent with a tax-free capital bonus of 2 per cent where the bonds are held for five years.</P>
    <P>The interest rate charged by the ACC on new loans issued is 8½ per cent which compares with the present bank overdraft rate of 9 per cent.  However as a concession to the small farmer, the corporation have maintained an interest rate of only 6½ per cent on all loans made under their scheme of unsecured loans where the borrower's total indebtedness to the corporation including the new loan, does not exceed £400.</P>
    <P>Loans in this category constitute approximately one-third of all loans issued by the corporation to individual farmers and the concession should therefore, be of significant benefit to the small farmer.  The corporation's loan interest rates and hire purchase charges are kept at as low a level as possible in the interests of the farming community.  Comparison with the rates of interest charged by agricultural credit institutions abroad is very difficult owing to the varying conditions relating to State assistance to agriculture in the different countries.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of the ACC is to ensure that the development of Irish agriculture is not impeded by lack of capital.  The corporation aim to be the most convenient and the cheapest possible source of credit for the farmer consistent with their operation as a <Col N="847" /> commercial organisation.  They issue loans for a wide variety of farming purposes on favourable terms as to interest and repayment and, in so far as they can, they seek to ensure that the money borrowed by the farmer is put to the best possible use.  The present Bill is intended to enable the good work being carried out by the ACC to be continued and I confidently recommend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture has many problems, a great many of which derive from its capital starvation during a long period.  It is therefore with the greatest pleasure that we welcome any means to provide additional credit for farmers to help them to improve their holdings and to increase production.  We all hope that in years to come credit can be provided at as cheap a rate as possible to those capable of using it to the best advantage.  In such circumstances, the Minister for Finance will have very little difficulty with balance of payment problems, provided his colleagues get out and secure markets for the increased production which increased credit can bring.</P>
      <P>It was quite a common feature in agriculture for farmers to fear credit rather than to accept it: first of all, they were afraid of revealing the state of their finances in case it reacted somewhat against them and, secondly, they were afraid of borrowing in case they would not be able to repay.  They have come a long way in a short time to realise that agriculture is similar to any other business undertaking and that without finance the necessary improvements to their properties and the necessary increases in their production cannot take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome this Bill but I am afraid that when the Minister suggests that this should be sufficient for five years he is casting a shadow across the future, implying that credit might be restricted during that period.  On the last occasion he came to the House with a similar Bill I remember asking him if some of the money would be utilised for farmer's sons to buy farms for themselves.  His reply was very definite, that that was one of the purposes of the Bill.  However, within a <Col N="848" /> short time, that was knocked on the head completely and nowadays a farmer's son, a second or a third son, wishing to engage in agriculture as a profession, wishing to have his own farm, has to compete with the moneyed men, many of them from the cities.</P>
    <P>We have a situation today in which there are far too many hobby farmers in the country, people who can obtain credit freely, and the farmers' second and third sons are on many occasions forced to leave agriculture and to take up some other occupation because if they wish to settle down, to make their own homes, they are unable to compete at the price which land is making.  They are not getting the assistance from organisations such as the ACC which we would hope they would get.  Many of those young men have much to offer to Irish agriculture: many of them have been trained in agricultural colleges and they have the great gift of experience on their fathers' farms. To use the American expression, they have the know-how.  If credit could be made generously available to those people with know-how the increase in production would be enormous and, as I have stated, the Minister's balance of payments problems would be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>During the years, the activities of the ACC have extended and one of the significant and welcome improvements has been the establishment of area officers.  However, it all too often happens that with the publicity a a certain type of farm receives&mdash;for example, a farm such as that tried out by the Agricultural Institute&mdash;a farmer in an area remote from there might decide this is something he could do usefully.  He would try it on borrowed money only to find that his area was quite unsuited for that kind of project. Therefore the establishment of area officers will help both the ACC and the farmers to try the type of production and project on which farmers could be best employed on credit from the ACC. In addition, if area officers did nothing more than to help farmers to complete application forms, they would be doing a good day's work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that short-term loans were the big end of the loans provided by the ACC.  This is very <Col N="849" /> welcome because most farmers at one time or another find they can do with a few hundred pounds which they want to use for a short term and they can go to the ACC and get the money. This is something they are becoming increasingly aware of and grateful for.</P>
    <P>There is one item I should like to draw the Minister's attention to and perhaps he in turn will remind the ACC of my remarks.  That is in relation to the purchase of farm machinery. About ten years ago a farmer obtaining a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation to purchase machinery was given a maximum time of repayment of 36 months.  An item of machinery costing at that time between £700 and £800 would today cost between £1,200 and £1,300.  When it was costing between £700 and £800 the farmer had 36 months to repay.  He could repay by monthly, quarterly or half yearly instalments.  Today the repayment period is exactly the same but the machinery is costing almost double. I am perfectly aware that the corporation, in arriving at the period of 36 months, was probably taking into consideration the fact that at the end of 36 months a machine could be worn out.  There may be isolated cases, such as agricultural contractors, whose machinery is working 24 hours a day, or where inefficient operators can wear out a machine very quickly but when the average farmer gets a new tractor or combine harvester it lasts him seven or eight years, and in many cases even longer.  It is a great hardship nowadays to have to repay the huge cost of machines as compared with the amounts when the scheme was originally introduced, in the same period of 36 months.  This matter should be considered and, if possible, the time should be extended.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that the corporation are having difficulty in producing their reports within the time of 90 days specified in the original Act. In the 1947 Act&mdash;section 19&mdash;it is provided:</P>
    <P>The Corporation shall, within ninety days after the end of each accounting year, furnish to the Minister such accounts (including a balance sheet and a profit and loss <Col N="850" /> account) as the Minister may from time to time direct for that accounting year duly audited by the auditor of the Corporation, together with a report of the operations of the Corporation during that accounting year, and the said accounts and report shall be drawn up in such form and contain such particulars as the Minister may from time to time direct.</P>
    <P>I wonder what has happened in the time between the 1947 Act and the 1969 Bill that would require that the 90 days be done away with and a provision brought in that the accounts and report shall be issued as soon as possible.  It is irratating to find that the report comes out about something which happened a year or two previously. While I do not claim to know what problems may arise with the Agricultural Credit Corporation whereby they could not produce their report within 90 days, it seems strange that in this day and age of computers and such machinery the Minister is asking us to change that provision and allow them to bring in a report at some future time which they may decide themselves.  I would imagine that their accounts are usually very up-to-date, that they would have half-yearly accounts, and nine months accounts, and would have to wait only for the last quarter to produce their final account, and then their report.  It is rather a mystery to me why the change is necessary at this time.  The House is entitled to get some further information as to why it has to be done just now.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with mortgages is, I am afraid, somewhat beyond me. The Minister might give some further explanation of it.  I should like to compare the drafting of the Bill with that of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill where instead of referring to sections in previous Acts, the section is re-written, which makes it much clearer and much easier to follow.  The activities of the corporation are growing. They are doing an excellent job.  The costs of each farmer's operation are increasing. A great problem arose in the past because farmers in seeking credit seldom looked for enough.  They always found themselves, when it came to meeting the first instalment of principal <Col N="851" /> and interest, in the position that they were not ready to do so.  The area officers can help to ensure that the farmer is prepared to relate his credit requirements to his ability to repay when the time comes to start repaying, because in the establishment of a project he may meet heavy weather during the first 12 or 18 months.  All too often when the first instalment is due the farmer is not ready to meet it.  For working capital as well as investment it is necessary that the farmer should provide himself with sufficient money to meet it.</P>
    <P>Finally, might I ask the Minister how near we are to the day of implementation of the recommendation made in the Gilmore Report Survey of Agricultural Credit in Ireland issued to the then Minister for Agriculture on the 9th September, 1959, in which subparagraph (b) of paragraph 3 states:</P>
    <P>The legislation should also provide for the ultimate purchase of the capital stock in the Corporation by farmers.  The stock purchase or farmer ownership feature should be the long range objective and should not be undertaken until farmers are ready and willing to invest their money in the capital of a permanent specialised farm credit organisation. The gradual retirement of Government stock would be accomplished through the required purchase of stock by borrowers.  Ultimately the Corporation would become completely farmer owned and would operate as a farmers' co-operative. In the meantime net worth could be gradually accumulated from earnings.</P>
    <P>How near are we to achieving that very laudable objective?</P>
    <P>It is the aim of all farmers' organisations that they control their own finances, and here is a great opportunity for farmers to invest in an organisation which is designed to assist them.  I hope that the day is not too far distant when the desire expressed in that recommendation by Mr. Gilmore will be realised and that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, as time goes on, will be able to increase <Col N="852" /> the credit to farmers, and that they, in turn, will invest in that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with many Bills which we have had in this House in the last few months, this is another Bill which enables the Government and their agents, in this instance the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to extend their investment in the productive outlets of the country. As indicated by Senator Malone, one can expect unanimous agreement that the moneys now being made available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for investment in agriculture and for facilities for the raising of such moneys are being extended in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill has outlined some very significant points in connection with the manner in which the farming community are using these facilities and the positive use to which they are putting the loans available to them.  In the first instance, one is almost gratified to note that something in the region of £20 million of loan fund is at present outstanding from the Corporation.  That in itself proves the fact that the farming community are now availing of these credit facilities.  I agree with Senator Malone that for a considerable period up to 5 or 10 years ago, the farming community did not avail to the same extent of credit facilities as did the industrial or business community in general.</P>
      <P>Obviously in a normal development which requires so much investment, it is desirable that they should avail of the facilities being provided, and it is very significant they are now doing so. What is even more significant is the fact they are not just availing of them but they are using them effectively and properly.  The Minister indicated in the Dáil in connection with this matter that the amount of bad debts outstanding on that very significant loan figure is almost negligible&mdash;in fact hardly such as could be rendered as a minimal percentage.  We can begin to realise that these debts are not just being repaid because the farming community are an honourable section of the community, as indeed they are, but because, in fact, farmers are using the loans to the fullest advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I am glad to note from inquiries which I have made outside the House that County Tipperary, which is one of the extensive and intensive farming counties, ranks high in the loan fund which has been distributed and low in the amount of outstanding bad debts. This pattern is what one would expect from the progressive farmers in County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The increase in productive and short-term loans which has been mentioned is a type of development which will ease the minor credit problems that will arise in any farming or business project from time to time.  I am glad to see that the amount of unsecured loans at present available reaches up to £750 and under almost every heading of the loans which are available there has been a significant increase both in demand and in use.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has not actually arisen on this discussion, except by inference from Senator Malone, is the question of suspension of loans for land purchase, with the qualification that they are still available for the relief of uneconomic holdings. My experience in discussing this matter with farmers is that they will readily agree that it is still appropriate that that restriction be retained until such time as the productive purposes for which the loans are being made available&mdash;short-term loans and loans of that sort&mdash;could be fully and adequately satisfied.</P>
    <P>I think the farmers realise that in many ways this was to a certain extent due to over-enthusiasm for these loans for farm purchase before this limitation was introduced and that it was this which was partly responsible for the inflated price of land which became current at that time.  I have certainly not heard any complaints and no significant group of the farming community have indicated that these loans should now be made available for land purchase, even for the case mentioned by Senator Malone.  The important thing is to avail as fully as possible of the limited resources, and resources are always limited, for productive purposes as is being done at present.</P>
    <P>It is fair to comment at this stage that the return from farming investment is <Col N="854" /> probably comparatively lower than the return from other industrial or business investment at present in this country, and indeed in many countries.  It is equally fair to comment that for that reason the extent of investment in farming projects will always be quite severe in many ways on the actual resources of the farmer himself and I am glad to note that the Minister has indicated that the intention is to expand these facilities, to extend the amount of credit over a period of five years, or as the occasion may demand from time to time.  It is not now possible to indicate what the position may be in three or four years time but the Minister has clearly indicated that within the range&mdash;and I think it is a reasonable range&mdash;of the increase which he proposes in share capital and the borrowing limit of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it should be possible to make adequate facilities available for increasing investment in the ACC.</P>
    <P>Another matter which caused some problems from time to time is the question of loans for the purchase of machinery.  It has been suggested, quite widely in recent times, that if anything we are over-mechanised.  This is due in many ways to the historical structure of our small farms and I think one of the problems which face the smallholder is the fact that if he wishes to avail of these facilities for the purchase of agricultural machinery he will have to undertake liabilities which he conscientiously feels he is not capable of meeting.  Perhaps the Minister could consider in the area of unsecured loans the possibility of introducing or extending&mdash;I am not sure if it has already been introduced &mdash;the acceptance of joint applications from small farmers who may jointly apply for facilities for the purchase of agricultural machinery.  This is something which would be desirable in the interests of the farming community. It is also desirable to ensure that such machinery as we have will be fully used by those who possess it.</P>
    <P>When a particular unit, whether it be business, farming or any other productive unit, is not making the fullest possible use of the machinery and equipment available to it, it is inevitable <Col N="855" /> that the balance of payments position will not reach the target it should otherwise reach at the end of the year.  I therefore suggest to the Minister that he explore fully the possibilities of accepting joint applications in cases of this sort.</P>
    <P>I, too, commend the extension of the appointment of area officers, particularly in Tipperary.  The proof of the service of such area officers is, as often as not, in the advice they give in matters not directly related to the loan application.  We are particularly fortunate in Tipperary to have a well-informed officer who has the rather unusual experience on occasions of advising people that their resources are not sufficient to meet the loan they require but advises them about what other loans they might consider. Indeed, sometimes he refuses the applications which they make and subsequently leaves them happier than they were before the applications were made.</P>
    <P>This is certainly something which those of us who know the farming community can readily understand.  Before taking on such a loan, the farmer&mdash;as indeed all of us should ask ourselves from time to time&mdash;should ask himself three basic questions: firstly, how much will it cost, secondly, where will it come from and thirdly, how will it be paid back?  Surely this is good business. Incidentally, I suggest it is equally good business when running the country.  I think one of the Opposition Parties should ask those very questions before setting out any proposals for the expansion of the business of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope that the facilities which are being extended here will continue to be extended so that the services which the Agricultural Credit Corporation make available will be used, as they have been up to the present, to the best possible advantage of the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Chairman, directors and staff of the ACC on the striking progress that the Corporation have made since <Col N="856" /> we last had an opportunity of discussing their affairs in 1965.</P>
      <P>In common with the previous speaker, I feel that one of the significant improvements in the facilities offered by the ACC has been the appointment of agricultural graduates as area officers.  This has done a lot to help the agricultural community, especially during the last year or so. I also think the Corporation should consider appointing a graduate of experience and status equal to a CAO in their headquarters, specifically to assess the merits or demerits of the farm plans that are continually being sent up from applicants.  These farm plans are designed and drafted by the applicant's own agricultural instructor and there appears to me to be a credibility gap between the man who drafted the plan and the people in Harcourt Street who do not either accept the figures submitted or appreciate them.</P>
      <P>We must organise in the shortest possible time, if we are going to be sincere and really effective in helping agriculture, some kind of seminar or committee, consisting of the officers of the Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural Institute and the advisory services in the ACC.  I presume Deputy Blaney, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, would be the person best able to organise it. To my mind no two of these agencies, which are designed and full-time employed to help agriculture, appear to be of the same mind at any one time. This is a deplorable state of affairs The Institute should at least be asked to supply the results of their many excellent trials and their scientific findings in agriculture to the ACC in order to keep these people abreast of modern developments in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a committee of agriculture, I find that practically every month our committee are asked to release instructors to go to seminars in various places and on various topics, but I have yet to hear of a seminar being held on the question of agriculture and farm finance.  Senator Malone mentioned the Gilmore Survey of some years back and even though the figures are outdated, because <Col N="857" /> they are all too low to apply to the present time, I imagine the percentages are still valid.  I should like to see the ACC organising some kind of sit-in with the advisory services throughout the country in order to keep themselves abreast of each other's plans and commitments right along the line in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the credit which our farmers are receiving at the present time is the dearest in Europe. The ACC have increased their interest rates twice in three months and this sets farmers off at a disadvantage, especially in a year when they know they will receive less, for instance, for the price of wheat.  One of the thoughts which are tormenting many of the grass farmers at the present time is how they can afford to buy their cattle for grazing this summer with the price of store cattle going very high.  It is very necessary for the ACC to be in a position to keep their schemes changing.</P>
    <P>They have, and I must compliment them on it, brought up the unsecured loan facilities to £750.  However, they should be in a position to do this right along the line as costs rise and the value of money falls.  They would appear in my opinion to be a little republic on their own.  I quite agree they are doing wonderful work but when people send up an application with plans on which one or two county instructors have worked for many hours and perhaps weeks in drawing up those plans with meticulous care, they are often passed off as being unrealistic or too big.  That to me does not seem to be consistent with what the ACC should be.</P>
    <P>They are certainly heading in the right direction with regard to their work generally but I feel they could go a step further and do much more if they broadened their scope and had first-hand information and advice from some of the other State-sponsored agencies that are directly involved in Irish agriculture.  As I stated they could seek the advice of the Agricultural Institute and of course the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make comes under section 5.  I, too, fail to understand <Col N="858" /> why this is necessary.  One would imagine any finance institute would of necessity have their books kept up to date and if we leave the audit over even longer than specified under the 1947 Act surely it will be more difficult for the board and the people directly involved to know exactly where they are.  However, if this thing is of such great importance I feel the House might now not want to hinder the wonderful work being done so I welcome the Bill and wish the work to continue.  I should like the people involved in Harcourt Street to get down a little closer to the people directly involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all join in welcoming this Bill which provides some increased capital for agriculture The amount, when we analyse it, is a projected increase of about £15 million during the next five years.  In other words, that is providing new capital at the rate of about £3 million a year It looks rather small in the context of our gross agricultural output of somewhere about £200 million.  Perhaps when it is weighed against the increase in agricultural output proposed, the two per cent increase of £4 million to £5 million, it is comparable but nothing like what a really galvanised agriculture could produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, we can set the £3 million side by side with that great effort by the Irish farmers some months back when they raised £3 million to take over International Meat Packers.  This was a wonderful example of the co-operative spirit and of what can be done by it.  The development of agricultural credit is proceeding well but not along the lines one would expect in the country which pioneered the co-operative movement through such people as Horace Plunkett, Father Finlay and others.  Perhaps there is some move in the right direction where the Agricultural Credit Corporation have appointed area officers in an effort to get closer to the people and to decentralise the administration involved, but surely when you follow that to its logical conclusion is it not time we linked up at that level with the co-operative movement itself and that the <Col N="859" /> co-operative units and co-operative societies were taking in each of the basic local units in the administration and the provision of agricultural credit in the community?</P>
    <P>Of course, we know the co-operative societies are already providing a great measure of credit for their members from their own resources but it is not of the long type of credit which comes from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. It would be worthwhile at this juncture in our development to see if we can create more integration in that we would have greater co-operation and more advisers at local level when our whole salvation depends on the co-operative approach.  I would envisage that the Agricultural Credit Corporation of the future would act more in the role of a central bank to the co-operative societies, giving them, as it were, block credits but letting the responsibility for the allocation and indeed for the recovery of the loan and interest remain with the local societies themselves.  That, after all, is the type of agricultural credit that is involved in places like Denmark and elsewhere where the co-operative movement has gone from its very promising stages here to the full fruition of what it should be in the middle of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>I believe the time is opportune for this because already there are two or three reports on the development of the co-operative movement in this country which are gathering dust on the bookshelves. No action has been taken on them and I suggest it is time we had a comprehensive plan.  Finance will be one of the main factors in this.  It is not just sufficient in the case of giving capital for production purposes that a form should be filled stating that the project is a sound one and that it is likely to be of continuing benefit to the farmers of the country.  That is all very well as far as it goes.  Under that heading you might put the provision of capital for additional livestock.  Then, this form of giving capital and, of course, recovery of principal and interest over some period of say three to five years, makes no provision for depreciation.  Unfortunately most agricultural requirements depreciate. <Col N="860" /> Whether they are machinery or livestock, they must be replaced.</P>
    <P>In proper development through the local co-operative society, the society would have the task of recovering the loan and interest, a very simple task because the farmer's produce in any case would be going through the society and the matter would be only an agreed deduction on a weekly or a monthly basis.  I should like to see a depreciation deduction which would mean that if a farmer got a loan for an additional cow, at the end of the normal useful life of that cow, say five years, there would have accrued in the farmer's account in the co-operative sufficient new capital to replace that cow when she would be disposed of.  It is in that way that we can keep the assets in good production&mdash;we guarantee that the cow will live forever and continue to produce forever.</P>
    <P>That has been the weakness all through in our efforts to put productive capital into Irish agriculture&mdash;this weakness at the depreciation level, the provision of a fund for renewal.  Our farmers, naturally, are not businessmen to the extent that they will make such provision of their own accord. Many of those being helped are at a very low level of income and it does not take much imagination on their part to be able to spend whatever increased income results from investment over and above their commitments for paying back.  They make little or no provision for the rainy day except to go back again to the ACC for a new loan for almost the same purpose after the four or five year period.  We should try to get away from that.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the interest rate of 8½ per cent.  I know it is the current rate but it is an extravagant one and it is too high for capital for productive purposes.  First of all, the rate should be made attractive.  Some of the money we are spending on various schemes for agricultural incentives could be very profitably diverted to helping to lower the rate of credit for approved productive purposes.  That is not as general as it sounds.</P>
    <P>In agriculture at present, excluding <Col N="861" /> land, you might expect a gross return on £200 of at least £100.  In other words £100 invested should produce £50 gross.  When you examine that £50, which is a net increase within the economy, that net increase, that money, circulates within the economy and it is captured by the tax laws whether it is spent on an additional gallon of petrol or an additional drink or any of those things which bear taxes.  The money is deposited in the Exchequer. It is calculated that £100 of a true increase benefits the Exchequer by almost £40.  <i>Pro rata,</i> on a Budget basis, it works out at about £25, and when you take the multiplication factor that arises when the increase is on a primary product, you get a factor of anything between 1½ and 2. It has been estimated at about £40.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a £100 new increase would produce 40 per cent increased revenue, and £200 new capital at 8½ per cent would produce £17.  Therefore, is it unreasonable to ask the State, which benefits by an increased tax yield of £40, to make some contribution to reducing that £17.</P>
    <P>Many of us will be sorry that the time is not opportune to do something about loans for land purchase or at least to provide some imaginative scheme to enable young men to acquire land.  At present, with inflated land values, it is not a practical proposition because when you take the situation where land is going freely at £200 an acre, you certainly appreciate that you will not stock it and equipit for less than another £100.  That brings it to £300 an acre.  If you take current interest rates, it means an additional £25 per acre.  Yet, if you are doing a very good job on beef, which is being pushed at the moment, a £30 return is very good and £40 is exceptional. That leaves no room for a man who has to pay interest on capital for land.  In other words, it is not a practical proposition at the moment to finance people into land purchase.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience of the good work done by the ACC through their small farm plan and, above all, of the beneficial effects on the farmers concerned of having to plan with a number of agricultural authorities including the CAO of their respective <Col N="862" /> counties.  I have experience of a case in point, a family who had spent 15 years in London.  I am proud and happy to have been able to encourage them to come back to take a modest holding of 50 acres.  With the help of the ACC and the planning necessary to get the required loan from the ACC, the family have returned and made a success of the project.  It is the type of pattern that many other families abroad might be encouraged to follow with the same assistance, guidance and friendly compulsion that the giving of credit by the ACC entails.</P>
    <P>There is little more I have to say on this except again to welcome the Bill and to ask the Minister to take the big jump and to let us have real agricultural credit where the State's role will be that of providing a type of central bank from which the dispensation can be done by the co-operative movement at grassroot level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill and the fact that the ACC have been a success.  We all perhaps, city folk especially, have a mental picture of the farmer of being very conservative and somewhat lazy, disinclined to invest their money in their holdings, in equipment, in expanding their own resources. That situation, if it was ever correct, is rapidly changing in this country.  I am struck by the very progressive young farmers that one now meets around the country.  The provision of credit to those people is essential and is something to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the provisions for credit in previous legislation are being used up and that we now need to provide for the future.  Having said that, may I make the point made by other speakers that the rate of interest is a disincentive to those progressive farmers?  Mention was made already that the rate of interest here is the highest in Europe.  I know that the Minister will deny that and will make the justifiable point that account must be taken of the grants given as well as the rate of interest.  I accept that. Perhaps we might think again about this sort of package which we send to the farmers.  Grants do not now seem to the progressive farmers to be a very determining factor.  They are very coni <Col N="863" /> cerned about the rates of interest which they will have to pay on loans and the amount of profit they can make out of their holdings and their equipment in order to provide for repayments.</P>
    <P>We are all inclined to regard a grant as something you get and forget about, whereas it is an inducement to the people to better their position and to make their holdings more efficient and more productive.  I should like to see special consideration given to the lowering of the rates of interest by way of a subsidy, as it undoubtedly would be.  It would be a more useful productive subsidy than might be spent in other aspects of agriculture at the present time.  We should be concerned about keeping the enterprising young farmers on the land.  We should encourage them to make the very best use of their acres.</P>
    <P>More important still, it is very good for the country and the nation as a whole to have these young farmers. The face of agriculture is changing.  I should like to see it change even more rapidly and to see more enterprising, intelligent and well-trained young farmers in control of the farms.  We should do everything possible to encourage these people to bring their equipment and their holdings up to the most efficient level.  I am in favour of subsidy by way of reduced interest rates on the loans which these people would find it necessary to borrow.  It would be a good and useful subsidy and possibly far more productive than other subsidies we might give to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am not knowledgeable enough in the field to be able to say which branch of agricultural subsidisation should be pruned in order to divert money to this particular aspect of it.  From my rather limited contact with farmers and agriculture I think the present interest rate is a disincentive to the younger farmers at the present time.  The rate of interest is too high and subsidy assistance from the State in this direction would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, I plead that special assistance in this direction by way of subsidy for loan charges might <Col N="864" /> be given to the co-operatives or to farmers working through a group. Sometimes you find in the country an individual farmer who is very enterprising and intelligent.  His neighbours are not so enterprising.  It would be a great help all round if they co-operated and acted in a group and we would then have the intelligent people helping their neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one question very briefly. We are all in favour of extending help to the farming community.  I notice the limited share capital is to be raised from £6 million to £10 million, a rise of 66? per cent, and the borrowing limit from £20 million to £25 million, a rise of 25 per cent.  I notice that the maximum amount of loan which may be issued under the Corporation scheme of unsecured loan is £750 and that the maximum amount of loan upon which a return of interest rate of 6½ per cent is charged to the farmers is now £400, including any new loan.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask, first of all, who decides these two maxima of £750 and £400 which seem small to me at present money values, and secondly, has the Minister considered recommending the raising of these maxima also?  The share capital and the limit of borrowing of the Corporation has been raised in view of the present money values which have dropped.  Might it not be good to raise these £750 and £400 maxima since the farmers too suffer from the diminished value of money?  A loan of £400 at reduced interest rate seems to me a fairly small maximum.  I am not quite sure how much could be done on such a loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for this facility to enable me to conclude and <Col N="865" /> I will not keep the House very long. Most of the points which Senators have raised are matters which come within the jurisdiction of the Board of the ACC and relate to their day-to-day administration.  It would be better for me not to go into the particular merits of suggestions put forward but rather to convey them to the Board for sympathetic consideration.  I will certainly do that.</P>
      <P>I will take the all-over point made by Senator Quinlan in which he spoke of the total volume of credit available to farmers and to agriculture.  It seems that the Senator is overlooking the fact that the commercial banks also lend to the farming community.  At 31st December, 1968, the figure of loans outstanding to the farming community by the commercial banks was £55 million.  You can add to that the ACC figure of £20 million and then there is a fair amount of lending by other financial institutions by way of hire purchase transactions.  There was at least £5 million more lent to the farmers from that source.</P>
      <P>You can readily identify at least £80 million of credit made available to farmers to the end of last year.  I am sure there is some more, but that is probably the bulk.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation do a fair bit of business with the co-operative societies: they issue block finance to them for the purchase of fertilisers and they also arrange for the issue of unsecured loans through creameries.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator McDonald, there are a number of senior agricultural graduates in ACC headquarters and the Corporation maintain very close liaison with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This brings me to the point raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I imagine these limits of £400 and £750 are decided by the Board in discussion with the Department of Agriculture.  The idea is to try to channel whatever money is available to small farmers at cheap rates.  That is why the limits are imposed and I am sure that both the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Agricultural Credit Corporation keep the limits under review from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> Senator O'Kennedy dealt very ably with the question of the policy decision that the Agricultural Credit Corporation should not make loans available for the purchase of land or funding of bank debts, with the exception of land purchase in the case of uneconomic holdings.  I do not think the time has come to change that decision and I agree fully with Senator O'Kennedy in regard to this matter.  I think the decision as it stands at the moment has the support of most farmers and farming organisations.  They are agreed that whatever capital is available&mdash;and it is always limited&mdash;should be directed to the most productive purposes possible.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator McDonald should repeat what was said earlier in the Dáil that agricultural credit here is the dearest in Europe.  That is not so. There is the point made by Senator Murphy that in deciding on the overall cost of a loan for a particular project to a farmer, account should be taken of a grant already given, in regard to the amount of interest repayable. Apart from that, the ACC loan rates are substantially lower than those prevailing in Great Britain and they are endeavouring to keep the rates as low as possible.  They are still below the ordinary bank overdraft rate in all cases and they are considerably below the bank rate in the type of case mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington. That is why we have this capital made available by the State to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We make capital available to the Corporation in two forms, one a very cheap form of share capital at 4 per cent and the other repayable advances which carry the full going rate of interest.  This enables the Corporation to be flexible in their approach to interest rates to farmers.</P>
    <P>I consider the suggestion by Mr. Gilmore totally unrealistic.  As long as the Government are prepared to make money available to the ACC in the form of share capital, and to accept a rate of remuneration of 4 per cent, I do not think it would be realistic to expect that farmers would be prepared to take over that share holding from us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> I would not expect them to do that. Any farmer who has capital available would be much wiser to employ it for his own productive purposes rather than to buy the share capital of the ACC.  It would suit me as Minister for Finance if I could unload the entire share capital of the ACC to the general public but I do not think it would be in the interests of the farming community if they should try to undertake this.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of joint applications for loans. My reply is that the Corporation entertain joint applications and consider them as favourably as possible.  I repeat that the ACC hope to keep on lending at an increasing rate.  They anticipate their annual investment in Irish agriculture will increase at a rate of about half a million pounds yearly &mdash;perhaps more, but at least that amount.  We will place no restrictions on their activities subject to the particular policy decision I have mentioned. Within the framework of activities which are authorised, there will be no limit on the amount of money they make available to the farming community. We will try to make that finance available to the ACC at a reasonable rate so that they will be able to lend it to the farming community at as low an interest rate as possible.</P>
    <P>I promise the Seanad that I will submit all the points raised regarding the administration of the Corporation to the board of the ACC and, in so far as it affects them, to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, for sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Would he consider giving farmers who are engaged full-time in agriculture and who qualify for the farm loan, the choice of drawing the dole or availing of the credit at very low rates of interest, say 4 or 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>May I mention this question which was raised regarding the 90 days?  This is in order to bring the Corporation into line with modern practice.  Most of the latter-day State companies which have been established do not have this particular period prescribed for them and I think this is not unreasonable.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation have expanded their activities enourmously, not just in the total amount they are lending but in the number of loans they are making.  I consider it would be a little restrictive to expect them to have their books ready, audited and submitted within three months.</P>
      <P>From my experience as an accountant, I do not think many commercial concerns adhere to that sort of period. I can assure the Seanad that so far as we, the Department of Finance, are concerned we will not permit the Corporation to be dilatory in any way in submitting their accounts and report. On the other hand we do not think we should be unduly restrictive on them, because excessive restriction might interfere with their day-to-day operations and their amended programme.</P>

      <P>While I can appreciate that the three months period may be unduly restrictive, I certainly am not content to leave it at, &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo;.  We have had experience during the years of State bodies failing to produce audit accounts, and we have also had cases where bodies have produced accounts year after year without including any provision for interest rates <Col N="869" /> in the accounts.  The Minister, in his professional capacity as an accountant, a profession to which he may be returning at some point, possibly in the not too distant future, should not be in a position to allow accounts not to be submitted indefinitely.  It is the normal policy for State bodies to produce their accounts within four months at the end of July, although there are some exceptions.  I should be quite prepared to agree to the insertion of four months or five months, but I do not think it should be left completely open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a measure to increase the overall statutory limit on industrial grants from £40 million to £50 million.  The House will recall that on a similar Bill last year which made the overall limit £40 million, I said then that it was a necessary temporary provision until major legislation amending the Industrial Grants Acts was introduced.  I thought at the time <Col N="870" /> that this could be done without too much delay.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that it has not been possible for me to bring that major legislation before the House by now, and the present interim Bill to provide more money for An Foras Tionscal has become a necessity.  The present ceiling of £40 million that can be paid out by An Foras Tionscal on grants and the provision of industrial estates, authorised by the present legislation, will be reached very shortly.  Approximately £38 million had been spent by 31st March, 1969.</P>
      <P>It will be seen that an increase in the limit by £10 million will suffice only for a short period of time.  It will be used up within the present financial year, but within that time, the House may expect to have before it the major legislation which I have promised revising the grant structure.</P>
      <P>The delay in introducing this major revising legislation has been due to difficulties of preparation and drafting. There are 12 Acts relating to this matter on the statute book which have to be taken into account, and the forthcoming legislation will have to deal not merely with the various types of grant and the building of estates and factories but also with the administrative structure to handle them.  As the House is aware, it is proposed to amalgamate the Industrial Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal, and these bodies have been separately established by different Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned all this simply to let An Seanad know the position about the pending legislation, but none of it arises on the present Bill.  This Bill will merely enable An Foras to continue to discharge its commitments made under the present code for a short period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that in the Bill there are two separate provisions relating to the increase to £50 million.  The first subsection of section 1 fixes the global limit for payments by An Foras Tionscal or by the Industrial Development Authority, which was previously a grant-giving body, at £50 million.  The second subsection refers to the grants-in-aid given by the Minister to An <Col N="871" /> Foras Tionscal to enable them to make such payments, and fixes this similarly at £50 million.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of An Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill itself is clearly unobjectionable, but an objection does arise because of the circumstances in which the Bill is brought in.  The Minister has been frank enough about the circumstances, and though he has told us plainly what the problem is he has not justified it.  The fact is that many months have elapsed since the relevant recommendations were made to the Minister by the Gilmore Report and subsequently by the NIEC, whose amendments to the Gilmore Report were broadly accepted by the Government.  My recollection is&mdash;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that he announced at the time of the publication of the Gilmore Report acceptance in principle of the Report and its recommendations or at least that is my recollection of it. My complaint is that that took place a very long time ago.  I am becoming increasingly concerned by the way in which the tempo of the government machine is slowing down, and by that I mean the whole machine of government, not the Government in the political sense, but government in the public administration sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know life is becoming more complex, that legislation is becoming more complex and there is much more to legislate about.  Nevertheless, that is not an excuse for public administration and the Government not to keep up with the needs of the time.  In every area of public policy we are meeting with constant frustrations because of this slowness.  Anybody reading the Third Programme will see that this is illustrated very effectively throughout. Indeed the comment made by somebody, even before I commented on it, was that when you read through it and see the number of things which are not finished, the number of things in process, the number of decisions pending, the number of decisions which have yet to be taken on matters which should have come up for consideration, one is faced with the extraordinary <Col N="872" /> position of a Government so slow as to fail completely to match the needs of the time.  The contrast between the way in which events are speeding up in the world generally and the way in which things took generations now take decades; the things which took decades now take years and the things which took years now take months.</P>
    <P>Everything in life is speeding up and the machinery of government is going down.  This is extremely disturbing and we have here an illustration of this.  The Minister has explained there are a number of Acts of the Oireachtas to be considered, 12 Acts, and a proposal to amalgamate two bodies, but this does not explain why it should take so many months to do this.  I am afraid a Government in office for such a long time may become complacent in those matters.  They may be used to this slow tempo of work in the public service.  I can quite visualise if I were in Government for ten years I would become so used to the speed at which the Government service works as to forget the speed at which the rest of the world has to work.</P>
    <P>I feel there has been a growing acceptance by the Government of the slow tempo of work and a failure to realise that the tempo is in fact slowing down all the time.  The members of the Government have forgotten their own experience, before they were in Government, in their own walks of life, in the speed in which they are now working.  Perhaps those comments are ill-directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who before he was Minister was a solicitor, a profession which is not known perhaps for the speed in which it completes some of its work.  Nevertheless I think there is a point there of very general application and I think this is a clear illustration of it.</P>
    <P>Certainly I have found within the past two years in my contact with public affairs outside politics in this House and Party politics generally, a growing frustration with this problem among people who are concerned with public affairs and involved in public affairs, a growing frustration which is translating itself increasingly into protests by people, whether they be management, unions or farmers, with <Col N="873" /> the process of government and the slow tempo of government.  I think this is a case in which we should make this protest.  The Minister should not have to come here with this Bill.  He should have come earlier than this, indeed, with the full legislation required in the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to be a little more explicit as to the exact reasons for the delay.  He really gave two sets of reasons.  One of these is that there are 12 Acts to be brought together but this is something which a competent draftsman should be able to do in a matter of days rather than months and the other that the Department are amalgamating two bodies. There may be some problem in this latter one.  Certainly in Irish life to create any kind of corporate body, to merge it maybe or modify it or modify it relating to another body, seems to be extremely difficult.  Is it in this area the delay has occurred?  I feel there is a little more to this.</P>
    <P>In the other House mention was made, and I think properly, of another document relative to this Bill in its broad context, which is also held up &mdash;the Buchanan Report.  The Third Programme records that the Buchanan Report was presented to the Government last September.  We are now near the end of April, seven months later, and the Government have not yet published the Report other than some comments on it.  I suspect the reason for this is that the Report was made to the Minister for Local Government and that the Minister has been concerning himself over a period of almost a year with two measures of particular interest to the Fianna Fáil Party but not of great advantage in fact to the country, and that Minister has not got the reputation of handling matters very quickly in his Department but rather of putting them into a bottleneck and that in fact he has been sitting on this Report.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong.  It may be that the Government are simply afraid to publish the Report and to give their decision on it before the election. There may be political reasons.  Certainly there can be no excuse for this and I wonder whether the delay in publishing the full industrial development <Col N="874" /> legislation is connected with this. Is it perhaps the case that the whole question of industrial grants for different parts of the country involves the question of regionalisation of the country and the development of growth centres recommended in the Buchanan Report?  Is there any connection betwen those two things?  Certainly the idea of regional growth centres in the Buchanan Report, and the Government sitting on them, will have very great implications on the whole development of industrial grants, and I cannot feel the delay in dealing with that and in even bringing it before the Oireachtas is anything but harmful in relation to the whole industrial grants policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil dealt with this matter in a rather odd way, if I may say so, with respect to him, because he made the point, perfectly validly, that people should not simply say: &ldquo;Oh, you have got a recommendation, why don't you implement it?&rdquo;  He also made the point: &ldquo;It is for the Government to decide whether a particular recommendation should be implemented.&rdquo;  I think that was a right assertion of the political role of a Government.  It is the Government's job to do that and the Government are rightly inclined at times to reject recommendations made to them and at other times to accept them, but I do not think his assertion that the Government are right justifies the Government not simply taking a decision. It justifies them taking a decision perhaps contrary to the recommendation but it does not justify them postponing the decision indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I notice he used the words: &ldquo;Such reports which go to the Government are considered by them but the ultimate decisions on them are Government decisions&rdquo;.  I do not know quite what emphasis he placed on the word &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; in the Dáil but in the light of what has been happening in this particular sphere he would be justified in putting pretty heavy emphasis on it because &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; is the appropriate word for decisions which are so long in coming about.  He said in the Dáil: &ldquo;Indeed there was no certainty the Buchanan Report would be accepted by the Government&rdquo;.  I <Col N="875" /> suggest that the Government should make up their minds on it.  I wonder if the Government have even received the Buchanan Report yet, as distinct from the Minister for Local Government. I know the Report may have been seen by the Government in general terms but has it even come up for decision by the Government yet or have the Government been too preoccupied with other matters.</P>
    <P>Remember the background to this. Our whole industrial programme has been running along lines which have been condemned as long ago as 1964 by the Committee on Industrial Organisation. After prolonged discussion at the Committee on Industrial Organisation, in which the Government took part and expressed certain views, they eventually joined in the report and it was recommended our existing policies were unsuited to the needs of this country, that the policy of industrialisation everywhere, on industry in every village, was one which could not but slow down the growth of industrialisation and the growth of employment. If we are to succeed both in attracting large industries and large quantities of industries and developing industrialisation on a large scale in this country and in decentralising industry from Dublin to other parts of the country, the only possible policy to pursue is one involving concentration on growth centres.  The Government reaction on this was to kick for touch by referring the matter to another committee which reported 18 months later.</P>

      <P>I am more than happy to develop the point for Senator Ó Maoláin but it might delay us too long.  Certainly, if he wishes, I will do so.  The position was that the recommendation was one which is obviously a political sentinel for any Government and I can quite sympathise with the Government having to cope with this particular decision and having to concentrate growth in certain <Col N="876" /> growth centres.  In areas outside those growth centres they might fail to appreciate that they will in turn benefit and they may feel aggrieved.  Nevertheless, the Government kicked for touch by instead of taking a decision of a firm recommendation of civil servants in Finance and Industry and Commerce, of management and of trade unions speaking together in this report, they referred them to another committee.  That is what I call kicking for touch.  It is a well know term in certain centres of sport with which Senator Ó Maoláin is perhaps familiar.</P>
      <P>That committee's report is again in favour of this reform.  Was anything done about it?  Yes, indeed, something was done.  The Government took a decision in principle.  That is another form of kicking for touch.  It means you announce you are in favour of doing something and are not going to do anything about it at the moment. It says that of course it was in favour of growth centres in principle but it was going to see where the growth centres were to be.  Those were to emerge from the process of regional planning.  That is, they would wait and see what kind of proposals emerged from regional planning in different parts of the country for particular centres to be developed for industrialisation, leaving the matter to a further committee set up for this purpose.  Not alone that, but they did not in fact appoint that committee for a further 15 months or thereabouts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the Buchanan Group who were appointed to study this.  When the Buchanan Report was received, they left it sitting for seven months without doing anything about it.  Some years have been lost in delays either through kicking for touch by referring matters to a second committee or alternatively by not taking a decision or by the postponing of the decision. We now have lost two years in this whole matter, two years which could have been years of fruitful industrial expansion on a larger scale than at present.  They have been lost because this Government have been putting off making a decision.  I think this is inexcusable. I think it needs to be said that these are criticisms which are <Col N="877" /> being made by people who have no political sides and no political desire to attack the Government as such.  They are criticisms now very widespread.</P>
    <P>I therefore press the Minister to get ahead with a decision about growth centres and to get on with the Bill and to bring the Bill in as soon as possible because we cannot afford these persistent delays.  In areas of policy formulation we have been quick.  Indeed the Government, in time, and their officers have been quick to see what is wrong and to see what might be done about it.  However, when we do see what is wrong whether through the eyes of a joint committee or the public service or members of the Government, the time we do anything about it is so long &mdash; it is, on average, about five years&mdash;that the tempo of economic growth has been slowed down to a very serious degree.  It is partly the fault of the Government individually. It is partly the fault of the public service.  Delays seem to be due either through the Government not wanting to take decisions because of the danger of their being unpopular or through their being preoccupied with political activities such as the Referendum last year and the Electoral Bill, and the very slow tempo of the work in the public service has become increasingly disastrous for this country.</P>
    <P>One quite incidental beneficial byproduct of a change of Government would be that a new Government coming in would consist of people who had been used to a tempo of work quite different from that which is now the practice in Dublin.  Maybe the members of the new Government would get drugged by the process after a number of years but at the early stages they would come in with a sense of number of years but at the early stages they would come in with a sense of frustration at the delays involved and they would speed up the tempo of decision making.</P>
    <P>Having said that, and it was justified, the Bill itself is acceptable.  Not alone do we not wish to hold on the process of industrialisation by holding up money needed by An Foras Tionscal, but we are glad the process of industrialisation is so much faster than the process of Government decision-making that the Minister has had to <Col N="878" /> come back here to look for more money.  If the Minister is to delay legislation himself or is to have it delayed on him by other people, at least it is encouraging that the process of industrialisation will not wait on such delays and that the Minister must come back here for more money.</P>
    <P>The Government are right in the priority they are giving to industrial grants.  No matter what cuts there have been in spending at times when temporary mismanagement of the economy has led to inflation and cuts in capital spending, the Government have not cut back on industrial grants. They have been given priority and therefore the process of industrialisation has not been affected such as other services, such as housing, have been particularly in the period 1965 and 1966.  For those reasons the Bill is welcome, though the strictures I have made are well deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite expansion in the industrial sphere, the number of wage earners this year is smaller than last year.  The proposal now before us is a clear indication that the Government have grown tired and lazy.  Otherwise they have become confused and preoccupied.  There must be some explanation for the delay in bringing in legislation which was announced 12 months ago.  If we examine the Minister's statement we shall see that the average expenditure on industrialisation during the past 12 months was £750,000 per week, a total of £38 million in 52 weeks.  Now the Minister is asking for £10 million.  If the average rate is to continue &mdash; the Minister mentioned that it is beginning to quicken&mdash;the sum now being asked for will bring us as far as 1st August, right in the middle of the recess.  It is difficult to understand why the Minister has chosen a figure of £10 million if the annual sum is £38 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Senator, but his calculations are not correct.  The £38 million is the total amount up to the date mentioned. It is not the total for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  That means that the expenditure is much less than £750,000 per week.  It upsets <Col N="879" /> my argument because I had understood that this money had been expended during the period 1968-69.  The Minister indicated that £38 million had been expended up to 31st March, 1969.  If this £10 million is to carry us through the summer, the argument is, of course, quite different.  The question arises &mdash; it may be what is delaying the Minister&mdash;of the IDA losing their identity, becoming amalgamated with An Foras Tionscal.  This will be a move towards bureaucratic control.  There will be two different departments, if you like to call them departments, functioning as one and in this kind of bureaucratic machine the matter of getting decisions may be a slower process.  At present one may get a quick decision from the IDA and may have to wait for An Foras Tionscal, or <i>vice versa.</i>  When you get the two combined people will have to wait for one administrative unit to make decisions.</P>
      <P>I agree this legislation is necessary. It is possible, however, that the Minister visualises the comprehensive legislation promised at a suitable time during the coming general election campaign.  It is the only excuse I can think of for the delay in presenting such legislation up to now.  Senator FitzGerald suggested the delay may have been due to electoral activities last year.  Recently there has been a movement towards industrialisation, particularly towards manufacture for export, and it is desirable that the trend in this direction should be maintained and that the necessary finances should be provided as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>This proposal for an extra £10 million is a temporary expedient to allow things to continue until a combined piece of legislation is presented to the House.  I support the proposal here because I think that whatever can be done towards increasing our exports should be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help seeing a contrast between this Bill and the Bill we had before the House just before this Bill.  The first Bill was for the purpose of raising from £20 million to £25 million the amount guaranteed to the ACC for the purpose <Col N="880" /> of providing loans to assist farmers, with various exclusions such as that loans cannot be given to farmers to purchase land.  That would be considered far too dangerous.  There is also the proviso in general that farmers would pay an interest rate of 8½ per cent on the loans they get, though the interest rate was reduced to 6½ per cent provided that the amount of the loan to any individual farmer did not exceed £400.  Here we have a Bill to give not loans but free grants, not to farmers but to industrialists, and indeed to industrialists who may well use the money to buy land outright or at least to acquire a very big working interest in land.  These grants are not loans and not only do they not bear interest rates &mdash;if I am correct on that point and I think I am&mdash;but they are largely unrepayable.</P>
      <P>There is an implication here that the Government, and perhaps we ourselves as a society, view the industry of agriculture and other industries in a very different light.  Agriculture will have £25 million made available for lending to farmers at 8½ per cent.  I am aware that it has been mentioned that there are grants to farmers and that apart from the grants there are subventions to farm products.  Apart from the grants to industrialists there is remission of income tax.  Some foreign industrialists coming in are not asked to pay income tax at all for a period extending up to ten years.  There are other imponderables granted to industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>There are some farmers prepared to contend that they pay more than their share.  Today we have two Bills before us.  In one case we are asked to enable farmers to borrow up to £25 million and to pay it all back with 8½ per cent interest.  There are few bad debts because the money is largely repaid.  The other Bill today is a Bill to make available twice that amount, some £50 million, to industrialists.  The Minister is apologetic because he says this will be enough for the current year.  The <Col N="881" /> Minister will have to come back, with major legislation, like Oliver Twist, asking for more.  Here we are asked to supply twice the amount for industrialists as for farmers.  I feel that farmers will want to know why is it that they have to pay such a high rate of interest, and why is it that there cannot be for farmers as well as for industrialists at least a waiting period before they start paying back, and why is it that when substantial grants can be given to industrialists&mdash;and some of them industrialists about whom we know very little who come from outside &mdash; whereas for farmers to benefit from the low 6½ per cent, the amount of their loans must not exceed £400.  Would the Minister venture to guess what industrialists, Irish or foreign, would say if they were to be told they would be given a maximum of £400?</P>

      <P>A grant of £400 to an industrialist would be regarded as chicken-feed but to a farmer it is supposed to be a significant loan which must be paid back <i>in toto</i> at a so-called reduced rate of 6½ per cent. I should like to link this also with another aspect.  We are told frequently by members of the Government that this country is proud of the fact that it is run under the system of profits and private enterprise.  I remember Senator Donegan in the Seanad some <Col N="882" /> years ago saying we have in this country, thank God, the profit system and the system of private enterprise. I felt prompted to interject &ldquo;thank Mammon&rdquo;.  It seemed to me he was addressing himself to the wrong deity. Mammon is largely in charge of the profit system and the system laughingly called private enterprise.</P>
      <P>This private enterprise we are supposed to visualise is composed of businessmen and industrial tycoons bursting with energy, drive and imagination, creating industries out of nothing, competing with one another and the best man coming to the top with brilliance and talent and supplying the needs of the people who make demands on the market system, but in this country, apparently, under the present Government and under all Governments so far, we appear to be in favour of private enterprise provided that private enterprise is adequately, if not generally, State-aided.  We have a system here of State aided private enterprise.  I suggest that is a contradiction in terms.  If the State is required to aid private enterprise the private enterprise has no longer the right to be so called.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>After this interval which saved the Government I should like to return to Government policy in relation to private enterprise, because it puzzles me. On the one hand we are supposed to think of private enterprise as being <Col N="883" /> conducted by rugged individuals who would have nothing to do with the welfare state; who want no handouts from anybody; who through their own talent, drive and energy, and through the mechanism of free and open competition, place themselves, for profit, at the service of the community, and build up our whole industrial scheme. If that is so, what do they want these grants for?  Where do the £50 million come in?  Why do we have to give them a free gift from the State?  Oh, horror, £50 million of dole, of a handout being given to the rugged private enterprise individualists.  Is there not something paradoxical in our saying we are in favour of private enterprise provided that it is generously and adequately State-aided?  This is a case, as I see it, of the welfare state supplying crutches to spavined industrialists who are incapable of walking unaided.  Why are these crutches necessary?  Why does not private enterprise supply the money? Why is the system based upon profit and private greed not enough to supply, through its banks and its merchants, enough money for these rugged individualists to build up what industries they want?</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if that is not possible so to do, are we not wrong to throw this £50 million or more as a free gift to these people?  Would we not be far better advised to enter into State enterprise on a wider scale than we have already?  It will be recognised on all sides of the House that we have engaged in it in various spheres.  Why not develop this with the £50 million, which we seem to have to spare now, instead of putting it in the pockets of exponents of so-called &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo;, and helping them to buy land, build factories and run industries? Would we not be better, even at this late stage, to enable building land, for instance, to be stabilised in price through municipalisation, or even through nationalisation, thereby refusing to allow private speculators in land to take profits added to the land not by their efforts, but by the efforts of the community surrounding them?  Should we not long ago have decided to municipalise the land <Col N="884" /> around our large towns and cities and prevent the mechanism which, by the fantastic increase in the price of land, produces higher prices in all the products of these industrialists and is, perhaps, a factor in their now requiring from us this dole, represented by the £50 million the Minister is now asking for.  He has also assured us that this will only be enough for the current year, telling us at the same time that he is going to come back soon and ask for a really big sum for these unfortunate people who, while talking about private enterprise, seem to require lavish State aid in order to allow them to go forward at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KitAhern" hpid="Mrs. Ahern Mrs. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few short observations to make.  First of all, I think it is appropriate to refer to the Minister's last visit to the House because Senator Sheehy Skeffington has forgotten all about it.  On that occasion I was very remiss that I did not congratulate the Minister and the Government on coming to the House to seek more money for the small industries, especially since small industries, even in my own village, have benefited from the Small Industries Programme.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington has been sneering at £750 maximum, but I know people in small industries who have been very glad to get an amount as big as this.  The scheme for small industries corresponds with the scheme for the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for bringing in this Bill asking for further help for our large industries. It is very heartening news that the amount available has been used up and that we need more in the interim period.  This shows the confidence that industrialists have in our country and in our Government.  I would remind Senator Garret FitzGerald that, far from the tempo of Government slowing down, the position is that progress under our Fianna Fáil Government is so fast that even the Government themselves cannot keep up with it.  A statement was made by a Professor at Leicester University about three months ago, in which he said that the progress in Ireland over the last ten years was nothing short of a modern miracle.  Perhaps if Opposition <Col N="885" /> Members would take the trouble to skim through this statement there would be no need to give apologies because Fianna Fáil are looking for more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to note that the House appears on the whole to welcome this Bill.  What Senator Ahern has just said is something I was going to say and I think it bears repeating. The problem in relation to Bills of the kind mentioned in my introductory statement is that we are working at such a fast rate under this Government that some of our machinery cannot keep up with it.  We are endeavouring to speed up that machinery.  But I think this is a case for congratulation rather than otherwise.  I was amused listening to Senator Garret FitzGerald in his essay of possible reasons for delay in bringing forward this legislation.  In fact, I thought he had exhausted every possible reasons except the truth until I heard Senator Rooney, who managed to think up another one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter, as I have stated, is simply the difficulty in obtaining the Bill from the draftsmen. The decisions have been made; they have been announced and industrialists are aware of what they are.  Indeed, within certain limitations, they are being operated.  The machinery for the amalgamation of the IGA and An Foras Tionscal is going ahead.  A good deal of the recruiting of the staff, based on the new structure which I announced, has gone ahead and is continuing.  Anyone who did not know what was going on in this country could be forgiven, having listened to Senator Garret FitzGerald, for thinking that what is happening here is that things are grinding slowly&mdash;or perhaps quickly&mdash;to a halt.  The truth of the matter as far as the industrial sphere is concerned, which is what we are concerned with here, is that each of the last few years has seen a considerable increase on the previous year.  But the year which finished on the 31st March last saw almost a doubling of the number of projects and the amount of employment involved over the previous year, which itself was an increase over the year before and exceeds all records we have ever had.  This is the <Col N="886" /> reason for the necessity for more money and why we think the £10 million will not be sufficient for the present financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, anybody listening to Senator Garret FitzGerald and who did not know the facts would have thought things were not going well, but they would have been wrong. The facts are at variance with what was given by Senator FitzGerald.  I might in relation to something said by Senator Ahern, say that this includes the money involved for the small industries programme.</P>
      <P>I must confess I was very puzzled in the early parts of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's speech because, whatever one might say about him, one would not say he is unintelligent.  Yet he proceeded on a most unintelligent basis to try to compare things which were not allied, to try to compare loans for agriculture with grants for industry. The thing was so ludicrously fallacious it was obvious that Senator Sheehy Skeffington was well aware of this.  I was puzzled as to how he could proceed on this basis, how his intellectual integrity would allow him to proceed on such a foolish basis.  I then realised when he proceeded further that all he was doing was trying to lay some kind of foundation for his lecture on the philosophy of private enterprise.  I do not propose to follow him in that regard as I do not think it is necessary. I was, however, amused by his statement that in the case of private enterprise economics the general impression as to which deity was in charge was wrong.  He said it was not God, it was Mammon.  The corollary to that, which would seem to follow, was that in public enterprise economies God was in charge.  This is not as obvious to other people as it may be to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice, too, he appeared to think that in the case of farmers, even on the basis of his peculiar terms of reference in this debate, there was some kind of unfair treatment of them as compared with what was done for industrialists. The implications in the latter part of <Col N="887" /> his address seemed to me to indicate that he does not think that farmers are private enterprise.  I would like to let him know they are very much so and he will have quite a job convincing the farmers of this country that they should agree with him to do away with private enterprise.</P>

I said I did not want to follow him too far in this as I do not think it is worthwhile, but I want to say that the scheme we have been operating in the development of industry is meeting with increasing success. As I have indicated, the success in the year ended 31st March last is quite spectacular, and I believe we are going to proceed with even greater momentum and the major legislation, to which I have referred, will expedite and assist that development.  In the meantime, what is required to keep up this momentum is to provide further money for An Foras Tionscal.  As I have indicated, this is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>

      <P>I should just like to make a comment on what the Minister said.  He told us in some detail about how amused he was on the one hand and how puzzled on the other, without actually answering my queries as to why private enterprise is not self-lubricating and why private enterprise was incapable of finding anything for itself.  Surely the perfect system is a system whereby, if a thing is worthwhile from the profit point of view, it will make a profit and can be launched?  Why does the welfare state have to help private industrialists?  The Minister said he was puzzled and amused but he did not tell us why the merchant banks, the private enterprise financiers, cannot find money.  He did not tell us why it is necessary to charge farmers a fairly sharp rate of interest and why they cannot avail of the free unredeemable interest-free grants given to industrialists.</P>
      <P>The Minister felt he was answering my point on that by simply saying that a loan is a different thing from a grant.  I would ask him why there are two different things applied here, one to farmers and one to industrialists. Why is it the farmer has to struggle along, as a small industry if you like on his farm and, not alone has to pay back anything he gets by way of loan but has to pay a fairly sharp rate of interest, while the industrialist, and some of those come in from outside, gets an interest-free unredeemable grant?  Why is there the different basis and why is private enterprise not self-lubricating and self-propelling?  Why is it so crippled and why does it require those crutches?  Why does it have to get hand-outs from the welfare state?</P>

      <P>First of all, I wanted to make one point on my own behalf.  I must not have made <Col N="889" /> myself sufficiently clear when I was speaking, unless of course the Minister misunderstood me.  I was not of course suggesting the momentum of the industrialisation programme was slowing down.  On the contrary, it has been increasing and is still doing so.  I made that point, but the Minister may not have caught it.  What I am concerned about is that, when we come to areas where it is necessary to devise new policies, to change our policies, because they are inadequate or the circumstances require them to be changed, the process is slowing down. The Minister admitted this because he said the Bill was held up and the Department concerned was not able to produce it quickly enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This argues incompetence in failing to provide sufficient staff.  There are many Departments in which either more staff are needed or present staff could be deployed more usefully.  Though I do not advocate increasing the bureaucracy unnecessarily, there are areas where false economy is holding us up because sufficient staff are not being provided. There are, accordingly, delays in economic growth.  In many cases the staff could be found within the public service.  The actual balancing and use of staff is ineffective.  Staffs seem to be composed of generals and the generals are occupied mainly in being generals and no work is being done.  I came across recently a case where principal officers who were engaged on important policy matters had not time to get on with other work.  At the same time, there are other Departments which seem to have more junior staff than is necessary.  There is therefore a need for revamping the public service. I am aware that the process of industrialisation is going on rapidly but it is not progressing sufficiently rapidly to solve our problems on the employment front.</P>

      <P>More than a quarter or one-third of our young people are emigrating and I shall not be pleased until that has been improved. Senator Sheehy Skeffington was a bit unfair.  He took two Bills which have not come before us, one providing a tiny segment of the aid given to agriculture and the other providing aid for industry.  There is the Industrial Credit Company about which we are not legislating today, though we are legislating about an inordinate amount, which gives loans to industry.  The Senator could find an entry &ldquo;State aid to agriculture&rdquo;, in the current Budget figures. There he will see sums amounting to £70 million in aid to agriculture.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Sheehy Skeffington I should like to point out that the private benefit and the social benefit do not coincide.  If you leave private enterprise to work for itself it does not do so adequately and it is necessary for the Government to intervene from time to time.  We can take tourism as an example.  At certain times of the year in certain parts of the country there have been shortages of hotel capacity. Because tourists spend only one-fifth of their money on hotel accommodation, any bottle-neck in hotels not only loses X amount to the hotels but loses 4X amount to other spheres.  There is the point also that it is uneconomic to invest in a hotel in a tourist area where the business is seasonal, lasting for only three months of the year, because, though you may make a profit in the running of the hotel during that period, it could not be sufficient to cover the whole capital sum.</P>
      <P>It is because of the need to consider social benefit as well as private benefit that we have to supplement private enterprise.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington may say that all these various businesses should be in public ownership. But, given the situation that we have a system of private enterprise, we cannot agree with the Senator's suggestion that it should be left to run itself and that the Government should not intervene.  I am afraid this is a misapplication of the Senator's socialist principles.</P>

    <Title>Holycross Abbey (County Tipperary) Bill, 1969: Second and subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Holycross Abbey was established <Col N="893" /> about 1811.  It contains some 13th-century additions and was extensively re-modelled about the 15th century. The buildings provide some outstanding examples of the distinctively Irish style of Gothic.  The more noteworthy features include the ornate Butler tomb and Sedilia, the cloister erected in the middle of the 15th century and a fresco in the north transept which depicts a hunting scene.</P>
      <P>The Abbey was originally founded by the O'Briens, Kings of Thomond, for the Cistercians.  It became a noted place of pilgrimage because a relic of the True Cross was enshrined there, from which the Abbey took its name.</P>
      <P>It was suggested to the Government by His Grace the Archbishop of Cashel that the ruined 15th-century Church at the National Monument, Holycross Abbey, be restored for use for ecclesiastical purposes.  This Bill contains the legal provisions required to enable this to be done.</P>
      <P>The restoration of the Church for ecclesiastical purposes required legislation for the following reasons:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Commissioners of Public Works need power to restore the National Monument, as existing National Monuments legislation empowers them merely to preserve National Monuments.</P>
      <P>(2)  It is necessary to remove doubt as to the power of the Commissioners to require a lessee or licensee, to whom a lease or licence under Section 17 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954 is given, to pay the cost of restoration.</P>
      <P>(3)  It is necessary to remove any prohibition against the use of the Church as a place of public worship which may arise from Section 25 (1) of the Irish Church Act, 1869, pursuant to which Holycross Abbey was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Church of Ireland Authorities have been consulted, and they have no objections to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The work of restoration will be done under the supervision of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no better way of preserving <Col N="894" /> a National Monument such as Holycross Abbey than by restoring it to use.  This will enhance its beauty and give it a new place in the daily lives of our people.  I am confident therefore that the House will welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend a warm welcome to this Bill, not only a warm welcome to the project but to the Bill as a Bill.  It is an excellently drafted Bill.  I make adverse comments about drafting sometimes, but I think this is a perfect piece of work.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his statement referred to consultation with the Church of Ireland authorities and to their raising no objection.  I should like to make it clear that this has nothing to do with Holycross Abbey, as such.  It was merely because there is involved the 1869 Act, which disestablished the Church of Ireland.  There has been very kind consultation with the Church of Ireland Authorities in this matter.  It is clear from the way the Bill is drafted that the only interest anyone in the Church of Ireland would have would be as a private citizen of the State and not as a member of the Church of Ireland.  The Bill is so well drafted that there can be no question of interfering with any right of the Church of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has given the history of this Bill it is perfectly clear that at no time had the Church of Ireland any claim on it.  It was scheduled in the 1869 Act to be handed over to the Board of Works as a national monument. At that time the Church of Ireland could have made a claim, had they any claim.  Any interest would be in an amendment of the 1869 Act and it will be seen from the way this is dealt with that the Act itself is not amended.  Section 3 of the Bill is worded in such a way because, notwithstanding the Act of 1869, this may be done.  If it had been done in another way, amending the Act might have given rise to misapprehensions.  I want to make it clear that, except as ordinary citizens, at no time had the members of the Church of Ireland any interest in this matter.  We all welcome the restoration of this marvellous example of our heritage from the past.</P>

      <P>I, too, am very happy to welcome this Bill in that it purports to effect the restoration of one of our great national monuments, Holycross Abbey, one of the places of pilgrimage in Tipperary.  In its own way Holycross Abbey represents the history of this country since the Norman Invasion, both in its architectural style and, indeed, also in the associations which it had with the history of that particular era.  All of us agree that the most effective manner of preservation is to restore for normal usage.  This restoration here is in line with the very praiseworthy work that has been done in other areas of the country, such as Bunratty Castle and other ancient monuments.  It is important that our young people should have an opportunity, not just of hearing about the history of these times, but in a way becoming part of this history by being allowed to use for worship and otherwise&mdash;it is worship in this case&mdash;some of these ancient buildings which would otherwise in time disintegrate into ruin.</P>
      <P>Everybody in this country must welcome this measure but I think it is fair to say that Tipperary people are particularly happy and proud that this suggestion has come from His Grace, the Archbishop of Cashel.  All of us feel greatly in his debt and I am quite sure that the work which will be undertaken as a result of this Bill will be not just a monument to his realisation of our heritage, both historically and otherwise, but will also serve to remind those of us who possibly all too often ignore this great heritage, that we now have an opportunity of living in it and for this reason any proposal of this sort will be most welcome in this House.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in welcoming this Bill.  As a visitor to Holycross Abbey on a number of occasions, I am familiar with what the Minister has stated about the marvellous state of preservation.  For that I think a tribute is due to the Commissioners of Public Works, not only for the work they have done on Holycross Abbey but on a number of others also.  It is good to know that now this old Abbey is to receive a new lease of life and to be restored to its former greatness <Col N="896" /> as a place of worship.  I feel that we may possibly be starting a trend here in restoring the other ancient Abbeys which could equally be utilised for their former purpose.  I have in mind particularly the Abbey at Jerpoint which is well worth seeing and one that I hope in the future may be restored for use.</P>
      <P>I am a little confused regarding this Bill.  In section 2 it is stated that the Commissioners may, if they think fit, restore the Church for use for ecclesiastical purposes.  I understand the Minister to say that His Grace the Archbishop has intimated that he would use the Church for ecclesiastical purposes and I am at a loss to know why this was inserted in the Bill.  Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What struck me about the Minister's opening remarks was that were someone present here from Mars or any other place he would have difficulty in ascertaining for what particular purpose the Abbey is being restored.  The subtlety in the way in which it was indicated to us that it was for the purpose of worship for the Roman Catholic community was in the reference to the Archbishop of Cashel rather than to the Bishop of Cashel.  No other reference was made to denominations.  This was done in a nice way and I congratulate the Minister on his approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill with some qualms because there has been criticism on the question of restoration.  My own inclination is to restore buildings of this kind but we have to recognise that there has been criticism of past restoration work, particularly that carried out in the last century when serious damage was caused to cathedrals in Dublin.  From what I know of the work of the Commissioners of Public Works I do not suggest that there will be a danger of this repetition but there are people who feel that to restore a building, even with great care, is a mistake.  I do not share that view but I think every care should be taken to ensure that the restoration work is carried out in such a way that the Abbey is returned to its original shape and <Col N="897" /> there is no intrusion of any new elements in the restoration work.</P>
    <P>A point has been made about heating arrangements, and perhaps an unobstrusive system of heating emerging from the walls might be desirable from the point of view of those using the church for worship.  I welcome this Bill and hope great care is taken in the work of restoration and from what I know of the work of the Commissioners of Public Works I am sure this care will be exercised.</P>

Difficulties might arise and then we should be in a very difficult situation. All the Bill needs to do is to authorise the Office of Public Works to do this; in other words, to restore as distinct from preserving.  I can assure Senator FitzGerald that the restoration work will be carried out as faithfully as possible and I think we have in the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works sufficient knowledge&mdash;I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;expertise&rdquo;&mdash;and skill to enable the work to be done with the utmost integrity. I am not sure if I made it clear that the cost of the work of restoration, though carried out by the Office of Public Works, will subsequently be recovered from the Archbishop of Cashel.</P>

      <P>The Bill approves the Government's acceptance of the amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund which is set out in the Schedule and authorises participation in due course in the special drawing rights scheme.  It also transfers certain functions and assets relating to the International Monetary Fund from the Minister for Finance to the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The special drawing rights scheme is designed to supplement international reserves.  There have been growing fears that the usual sources of international reserves are not adequate to meet the requirements of expanding world trade and payments.  Existing means of increasing international liquidity are limited and haphazard. Gold, which holds the key position because of its general acceptability, cannot be depended upon as a source of new liquidity.  In 1966 and 1967 demand for industrial use and for hoarding absorbed all newly mined gold and none went into international reserves.  World gold reserves increased slightly last year but, for the present at least, no substantial overall addition to the amount of gold available to finance trade can be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> For several years the main sources of supply of increased international liquidity have been the deficits in the balance of payments of Great Britain and the United States, chiefly the latter. As Senators know, both these countries are taking determined measures to reduce their deficits.  It is strange but true that the achievement of a sound balance of payments position by the United States and Britain could lead to a crisis in international trade and finance through its effect in reducing the volume of international reserves.</P>
    <P>The International Monetary Fund has for a number of years past been carrying out an intensive examination of the international monetary mechanism to find an acceptable way of creating additional reserve units.  The special drawing rights scheme is the result.  The detailed scheme has been prepared in the form of an amendment to the Fund's Articles of Agreement, which is now open for acceptance by member countries.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme, each country wishing to participate will be allocated special drawing rights by the Fund in proportion to its present quota irrespective of its external payments position. These drawing rights will be additional to the Fund's existing arrangements for assisting member countries.  The underlying concept is also different.  At present, members in balance of payments difficulties may draw temporarily on the resources of the Fund. These consist of the total of members' subscriptions or quotas.  A drawing is made by purchasing foreign exchange from the Fund in exchange for the member's own currency.  There is a limit on outstanding drawings of 125 per cent of the quota.  The first 25 per cent, which represents the portion of the subscription paid in gold, can be drawn automatically.  The Fund, however, exercises closer supervision over all further drawings.  It must be satisfied that the member country is taking effective measures to correct the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>Special drawing rights will not replace any portion of these existing rights.  They will be created without any prior deposit of gold or currency by participating countries and will be <Col N="900" /> used, not by making an actual drawing on the Fund, but by direct transfer between the participating countries.</P>
    <P>If a country gets into balance of payments difficulties and wishes to use these rights, it will exchange them for an equivalent amount of another country's currency.  The Fund will designate the participating country which will provide the currency but it will also be possible to arrange the transactions directly between two countries. The borrowing country will use the foreign currency obtained towards financing its balance of payments deficit. The scheme, in effect, is based on the obligation of participants to accept drawing rights from other members in exchange for an equal amount of convertible currency.  Special drawing rights, therefore, will have the character of reserve assets.  They will have a fixed value in terms of gold and countries participating in the scheme will accept them on the understanding that they are exchangeable for their own currency on this basis.  In practice, the rights will represent a supplement to the world's gold stocks available for monetary purposes.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested unofficially that, in the first five years, the total amount of special drawing rights to be created would not exceed $10,000 million, that is the equivalent of 50 per cent of the total of members' quotas in the International Monetary Fund.  This would be a relatively small increase in liquidity compared with total world reserves of around $73,000 million.  On this basis we would become entitled to receive drawing rights amounting to rather less than £17 million, or under £3½ million a year, over the first five years.  Our liability to provide convertible currency in the same period in exchange for drawing rights of other countries would be limited to $80 million or £33 million&mdash;that is twice the allocation of drawing rights to us.</P>
    <P>It will not be clear until the scheme has been in operation for some time to what extent we might be asked to provide convertible currency in exchange for other countries' drawing rights, but it is not expected that we would have any difficulty in meeting any requests made to us.  The Fund in designating <Col N="901" /> countries to provide currency will take into account the strength of their balance of payments and reserve positions. The aim will be to achieve a balanced distribution of drawing rights among participants.  We would have the same entitlement as other countries to use our own special drawing rights to obtain convertible currency in case of need.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Governor of the Fund for Ireland, I have given my support to the special drawing rights scheme.  Member countries agreeing to the scheme are expected to make any necessary legislative and other provision to enable them to fulfil their obligations under it.  We are dependent to an exceptionally large extent on external trade for our prosperity and can only lose from a contraction in the rate of growth of world trade.  The tendency of the international monetary system to drift into a situation of recurrent crisis must, therefore, be a particular source of concern to us.  It follows that the efforts of the International Monetary Fund to provide for the deliberate, planned creation of reserves are welcome.  The Fund's approach has been cautious but, nevertheless, it is a beginning and is worthy of our support.</P>
    <P>The proposed facilities will not relieve this or any other country from the necessity of containing inflation. On the basis which has been suggested for the scheme, participating countries would receive only a modest addition to their reserves.  In our case, as I have already mentioned, we would become entitled to drawing rights amounting to less than £3½ million a year over the first five years.  This would be quite small compared with our existing reserves of £283 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the introduction of the special drawing rights scheme the amendment to the Fund's Articles of Agreement as set out in the Schedule to the Bill proposes certain other changes in the Fund's rules and practices.  These are largely procedural, relating for example, to voting arrangements and the interpretation of the rules.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that special drawing rights allocated to Ireland will be held by the Central Bank of Ireland <Col N="902" /> and that the bank will be responsible for all transactions and operations relating to drawing rights.  Since drawing rights will have the characteristics of reserve assets, it is appropriate that they should be held by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill to take power to transfer to the Central Bank certain functions under the 1957 Bretton Woods Agreements Act which are now exercised by the Minister for Finance.  These functions relate to the making of payments to and the receipt of moneys from the International Monetary Fund.  Transactions of this kind arise in connection with the payment of subscription moneys, the purchase of other currencies from the Fund in exchange for Irish currency and repurchases of Irish currency.  It would be more appropriate for the Central Bank to carry out these transactions than the Exchequer.  This is the position in various other countries. The change will also simplify administration to some extent.  Under the present arrangements all payments to the International Monetary Fund must be made out of the Central Fund and all receipts must be credited to it.  In practice the money for payments is provided by the Central Bank against certificates of indebtedness issued by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill further provides for the vesting in the Central Bank of the assets represented by our gold subscription to the Fund and foreign currency made available to other countries under our obligations to the Fund. These assets will be credited by the Bank against an equal amount of Exchequer indebtedness to the bank for advances made for payments to the Fund.</P>
    <P>The effect of these arrangements will be that the Central Bank will hold more of the country's external reserves. In the context of the sterling holdings of the commercial banks, I may recall that as a result of the agreement with Britain on the application of the Basle arrangements to our sterling holdings a substantial amount of the Associated Banks' sterling assets&mdash;£40 million in all&mdash;was deposited with the Central Bank in November last.  The Central Bank's custody of our external reserves <Col N="903" /> is, therefore, becoming much more complete than it was in the past.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Bill that the order transferring functions or vesting the assets in the Central Bank will come into operation on a day to be fixed with the agreement of the Central Bank.  This will ensure that the transfer will take place at a mutually convenient time.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a useful Bill and a useful contribution to the world of banking but though it is useful it is somewhat, and I know the Minister agrees with this, inadequate to the needs of the present situation. Every few months we find some kind of disturbance in the world exchange market.  Indeed, today as a result of the French situation we have had both the franc and the pound under pressure again and this constant speculative pressure creates an atmosphere of lack of confidence in world currencies and clearly there is an underlying weakness here which needs to be tackled.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of an international attempt to tackle it.  It is, as I say, a very inadequate attempt but it is useful as far as it goes.  It will give a little more leeway.  It will, perhaps, reduce marginally the speculative pressure at certain periods but it does not go really to the root of the problem.  However, the Minister again shares my view on that so there is no need at present to press it further.  I should only like to say that the Irish policy in this matter seems, in so far as we have been able to extract it from the limited amount of information given to us, to be sound and constructive but I think I said before to the Minister that the more publicity that can be given to our views the better because I do not think they are widely understood in this country today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former secretary of the Minister's Department, who is now Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Whitaker, gave an excellent address in Trinity College some years ago at which I think many people were present.  Those who had the opportunity of reading it <Col N="904" /> found it enlightening as regards the Irish attitude and where Ireland stood as between conflicting schools of thought in this province.  I think this is useful in informing public opinion and encouraging public debate.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity from time to time to raise and discuss those matters although I know he may be a little discouraged by the fact that when he did so not so very long ago at a function which one would have thought would be appropriate, a banking function, there was a good deal of criticism of him for talking gobbledegook. It may well be that the Minister could have tried to translate it.</P>

      <P>I shall not make any comment on that part of it though, certainly, the Minister is better equipped to know what he is talking about than other Ministers for Finance I could name.  I should like to take this opportunity, however, to raise a couple <Col N="905" /> of other matters which are related to this whole question, particularly in relation to the loan to the Central Bank which is being altered to some degree, usefully, by this Bill.  Do I understand from the provisions of this Bill that the necessity for the carrying of contra items introduced into the Capital Budget for the year just ended will no longer exist because we have this peculiar situation of the whole Capital Budget being inflated by adding in something between £13 million and £16 million to both sides because of transactions fundamentally between the Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund which, because of the absence of this Bill, had to pass through the Government?</P>
      <P>This does not make it any easier for the general public to understand the Capital Budget and if, as I believe the case to be, this Bill removes the necessity for those contra items, I think it is welcome from that point of view alone quite apart from the fact that it is a further recognition of the role of the Central Bank, a further normalisation of the role of the Central Bank and a further building-up of the role of the Central Bank, all of which are desirable.  I, myself, have difficulty in understanding those contra items because unlike most contra items they were not the same on the two sides of the account.  The explanation given in the text of the Capital Budget was incomplete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Senator's elevation to the Seanad he has no longer the facility of attending my Press conferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the facility and, indeed, would be entitled to do so, but I feel it would be indelicate and so I have cordially refrained.  It is a great penance to me in view of the fact that in the Seanad we are precluded from asking questions of Ministers directly and I should have an opportunity of doing so at the Press conference.  I thought it would be inappropriate for me to mix my two roles in that way.  If the Minister is implying that the question was asked at the Press conference and it was recorded, then I must have missed it <Col N="906" /> because I am still at a loss to understand why on the one side of the account there is £13 million&mdash;I speak from memory because I have not got the figures with me as I left them at home during the interval&mdash;and on the other side there is £16 million.  As they are specified to be payments to the International Monetary Fund and the world bank on one side and borrowing from the Central Bank for this purpose on the other side, I am sure there is some simple explanation but it was not given.</P>
      <P>Indeed, as I am referring to that, I should like to make a point which may, perhaps, be regarded as petty, which is hardly the word to use, but as one involving too much detail.  The Government have for some years past published the Capital Budget document, which is extremely useful and a great advance on the little information given previously.  It not only sets out more clearly than was done previously the Capital Budget and the capital programme for the year just ended and the projections for the year ahead but it also includes a fairly extensive text designed to explain those items.  All of this is welcome but the text is really, in a sense a list of items&mdash;there is explanatory matter as well&mdash;an incomplete list.  I do not suppose the Minister has ever had, because he has access to the files, to try to extract from this text the complete picture of what the Capital Budget is for.</P>
      <P>I had to do this quite recently and I must say I had the greatest difficulty in trying to get the complete picture because naturally enough in this text the major items are highlighted and the smaller things are left on one side. Items mentioned one year may, perhaps, not be mentioned the next year because they are of lesser importance. If you are trying to get a complete picture, as in a table setting out details of the Capital Budget, it is hard to get it and I should like to ask the Minister if he could supplement this text with a breakdown of the items in the Capital Budget so that one will not have to build up such a table piecemeal from the text.  A text not accompanied by a table relating to the items in it is not a satisfactory way of listing items, and, after all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, what was a relevant contribution originally in connection with payments to the IMF becomes irrelevant.  I have made the point sufficiently clear and the Minister will, perhaps, consider it.</P>
      <P>On the question of our reserves generally, to which, of course, our IMF quota provides a contribution, it is a good thing that the details are now published in the Central Bank Bulletin as they had not been done up to recently.  It is a pity we had not this information sooner but I appreciate that the Minister was in a difficult position about our purchases of gold during the past year because this might have had some repercussions on sterling before the stand-by loan was negotiated.  I wonder, however, whether the table is correctly titled &ldquo;External Monetary Reserves&rdquo;.  Previously, the items in this table, the details of which were published without including our IMF position or the gold item, were headed &ldquo;External Assets&rdquo; and this was accepted by most people as a more accurate description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you include, as reserves, the external assets of the banking system here, you are inaccurate because they are not reserves.  They include, for instance, bank premises in Northern Ireland and they can hardly be described as liquid assets.  Therefore, the heading of that <Col N="908" /> item is a bit inappropriate.  Is it possible for us to make any assessment of what are our reserves as happens in other countries?  What are our free reserves?</P>
    <P>The Minister recently remarked that our reserves were at a record level a short time ago.  While this may be an exaggerated statement if one goes back a long time, there is truth in the statement made then that the figure of £290 million-odd was higher than for many years past, but this figure is not really our reserves.  This becomes clear when we face our balance of payments situation.  If we had reserves of £290 million, including our IMF contribution, I do not think we would be ever worried about a deficit even as high as £50 million in a particular year in view of the fact that our capital inflow would counteract it.</P>
    <P>Though it may look well to make a figure appear as big as possible, the figure given did not include the items that really matter and it would have been much better to have given an accurate figure of what are our reserves.  We know they represent a substantial proportion of the £290 million but that sum includes bank premises in Northern Ireland and external assets of the Northern Ireland banking system, which we can hardly claim as ours.  In so far as what is left is concerned, we really have not a clear picture of what our reserves are and I should like some more information about it from the Minister.</P>
    <P>On another aspect of the whole problem, the Minister some time ago, shortly after the devaluation announcement, I think, announced legislation which would remove the requirement to introduce legislation in order to change the parity of our pound with sterling.  What has happened to that promised legislation?  Has the Minister decided to wait until the new Central Bank Bill, announced three years ago, is produced or will it be allowed to drag on year after year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the fact that this requirement must be some inhibition to a Government <Col N="909" /> faced with the situation we had 18 months ago, I wonder why this was not introduced long ago, say, at the time the Minister said it.  Since the provision will be covered in the Central Bank Bill, I am satisfied.  I hope it will not be left too many years in gestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald is right in his assumption that from now on these transactions should disappear from the Capital Budget.  What happens now is that the Minister for Finance deals with the IMF.  He borrows the money from the Central Bank to pay into the Fund, if he has to make payments, and gives the Central Bank a certificate of indebtedness in return. From now on that will be changed and the Central Bank, as the custodian of our official reserves, to an increasing extent will deal directly with the IMF in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I have not got the full details of the item in the Capital Budget but I have some of them. During the year we acquired a creditor position with the Fund as part of our policy of diversifying our reserves. We made available Irish currency to the Fund and we acquired a creditor position, above our gold tranche, of £13¾ million.  We paid Irish pounds to the Fund in a transaction with Ceylon in April, 1968. The Senator will recall the Fund had a major operation with France in June, 1968 in which we participated.  In October, 1968, we assisted with Ceylon again and in <Col N="910" /> January, 1969, we made available Irish currency to Bolivia&mdash;£2.08 million. That would total £13¾ million.  That is around the figure of £14 million in the Capital Budget.  I have not full details of the transaction but I can forward them to Senator FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>The Bill gives effect to arrangements made by Dublin Corporation with the trustees of the Nelson Pillar following the blowing up of the monument on the 8th March, 1966, and the subsequent removal of what remained of the monument.  It was agreed, following negotiations between the Dublin city manager and the trustees, that the trustees would hand over the site of the pillar to Dublin Corporation in consideration of an agreed amount of compensation and a statutory indemnity against any possible claim arising out of their actions in accepting these arrangements.</P>
      <P>The payment by the Dublin Corporation of the agreed compensation to the trustees is provided for in section 2. Section 3 provides that the site of the pillar shall be vested in Dublin Corporation and empowers the corporation to appropriate it for any of their purposes.  The section also terminates the trusts of the trustees.  Section 4 contains the indemnity for the trustees to which I have already referred and validates the actions of the trustees in accepting the compensation provided by the Bill and in not restoring the monument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No part of the compensation to be paid to the trustees under section 2 of the Bill will be borne by the Dublin city ratepayers.  I have obtained the approval of the Government to the recoupment from the Exchequer of the <Col N="913" /> total amount involved and provision will be made accordingly in my Department's Vote for the current year.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concluded his statement by saying that no part of the compensation to be paid to the trustees under section 2 of the Bill will be borne by the Dublin city ratepayers. That is correct but there is an omission here.  When the pillar was destroyed there was divided opinion among the citizens of Dublin.  Many felt that the removal of this monument, peculiar to Dublin city and a wellknown landmark to visitors was a loss; on the other hand there were people who regarded the pillar as a symbol of the past which had unhappy memories for them and they were glad to see it destroyed.  It has been completely removed now and I think that the beautiful vista of O'Connell Bridge makes people feel it was a good thing for the city that the pillar was removed. We have a very fine view of the main street in Dublin city now and this creates a good impression on visitors here.</P>
      <P>There were all kinds of allegations as to the cause of the destruction of the Nelson Pillar but the facts never came to light.  It is extraordinary but a fact that the first explosion, which was illegal, caused only £1,600 worth of damage.  However that apparently is not finally decided yet, but this amount has been quoted at the moment.  The ratepayers of Dublin city will have to pay compensation for malicious damages resulting from the first explosion.  A figure of £1,622 has been mentioned but there are still other claims pending and as far as the ratepayers are concerned they do not yet know what the full amount will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the taxpayers will pay for the second explosion.  That was an explosion at ground level, carried out by members of the Irish Army, and people who saw that job on film agree that it was carried out in a very scientific way.  Of course when the explosion took place at ground level a considerable amount of damage was caused as compared with the illegal explosion which occurred half-way up <Col N="914" /> the column.  Although the first explosion involving 22 claims amounted to only £1,622 the second explosion involved 14 claims costing approximately £17,200.  The Department of finance also paid out approximately £8,000 in respect of the second explosion.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to legalise the agreement which was made between Dublin Corporation and the trustees, who apparently are to get £21,750 in respect of the pillar.  I suppose that figure of compensation was worked out by accountants and arrived at on a fair basis.  Thousands of visitors and, indeed, Irish people and citizens of Dublin, climbed the pillar for a charge of approximately 6d.  One climbed up a winding stairway to the platform on which the statue was located and from that height one certainly had a wonderful view of the city. In the days before we had Liberty Hall, Hawkins House and O'Connell Bridge House the top of the pillar was the only place from which one could get such a view of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise another point with the Minister which he may not be in a position to clarify at this stage. Apparently there are still claims coming in as a result of the second explosion.  If it is in respect of the second explosion I assume that the Minister will be responsible because the question of malicious damages arises only in connection with the first explosion.  A sum of £39,000 has been paid out so far with the exception of the malicious damages which have yet to be paid by Dublin Corporation.  I am making a suggestion to the Minister, considering he has gone so far as to bring in this Bill for the purpose of legalising the agreement between the trustees and Dublin Corporation to pay compensation to the trustees, I suppose on behalf of Dublin Corporation who are now the owners of the site and, of course, in lieu of the monument which has disappeared.  We should have regard to the origin of the malicious injury code and the Malicious Damages Act, which was designed to penalise people in the immediate locality and damages were usually paid by the ratepayers of the locality. Apparently, in the case of the pillar <Col N="915" /> the ratepayers of Dublin city are required to pay the compensation on principle but the Minister has already recognised that the taxpayers in general should be required to pay the amount agreed between Dublin Corporation and the trustees.  When the Minister has involved the taxpayers to such an extent, he should take over the remainder of this compensation, that is £1,622, in respect of the first explosion in addition to the cost of any further claims which may arise, resulting from that first explosion.</P>

      <P>I should like to support some of what Senator Rooney has been saying about Nelson's Pillar.  Nelson, I think, had no relevance at all to Dublin either good or bad, except that the shopkeepers of Dublin in the early years of the last century decided to express their gratitude to him, as they saw it, for keeping, or helping to keep, Napoleon out of the country, and they put up this pillar. Obviously, Nelson never did any good to Dublin nor did he do any harm. There is no special animus against him.</P>
      <P>In the years between our gaining political freedom of this portion of the country and the blowing up of the statue there was ample opportunity for anybody who was concerned and in a position of authority, to replace the statue of Nelson with anybody they pleased.  I mention no names; but there would have been obvious candidates. Mammon would have been a good candidate, or perhaps the Golden Calf, or one of his more modern disciples, but without necessarily deciding what statue best typifies or symbolises our modern society, nobody would have shed tears if the statue of Nelson had been taken down publicly and some other statue had been put up.  I think it would have been too much to expect that a statue of somebody like Pearse or Connolly would have been put up there, but almost any statue publicly approved could have been put up. However, the corporation did not do anything about it, nor did the Minister for Local Government, or the Government.  There was, in fact, no action taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> When in 1966 the pillar was half blown down by a person or persons unknown, I, as a Dubliner, felt a sense of loss, not because of Nelson&mdash;one could hardly see Nelson at the top&mdash; but because this pillar symbolised for many Dubliners the centre of the city. It had a certain rugged, elegant grace about it, apart from the kind of little cage at the top which was there to prevent people jumping off.  It had a rugged, elegant grace about it which marked the city as something different from a city which had grown mushroom-like in the last few decades.</P>
    <P>The pillar went back to the early days of the 19th Century and most people would agree, when looking at prints of old Dublin showing O'Connell Street, Upper O'Connell Street or Sackville Street, the old O'Connell Bridge, which was first called Carlisle Bridge, with the pillar in the background, they see the city and O'Connell Street with a grace which is sadly lacking today.  The only thing of elegance left in O'Connell Street now&mdash;apart from the statue of O'Connell, and one can argue about that, although I personally have rather an affection for it&mdash; is the General Post Office.  O'Connell Street now has a ring of Piccadilly Circus about it, with the new buildings, which have been erected to replace the destroyed ones, covered in advertising matter.  The man who destroyed the pillar made Dublin look more like Birmingham and less like an ancient city on the River Liffey, because the presence of the pillar gave Dublin an internationally known appearance.</P>
    <P>I remember being taken by my father, who was an Ulster man brought up in County Down, to Belfast.  I was about six at the time and I remember asking him where the middle of Belfast was, and he told me that it was &ldquo;that kiosk over there&rdquo;.  I looked with childish Dublin pride perhaps at something which seemed to me to be totally inadequate in the light of my six years of experience, at what was the centre of this big city, because I remembered Dublin's Nelson's Pillar.  I remember the look of the pillar; I remember climbing the pillar; I remember the view from the top; I remember the way in which it stood in front of the <Col N="917" /> General Post Office and it was something I admired even at the age of six without knowing why.  I suggest that most Dubliners, and many who are not Dubliners, had this kind of perhaps irrational affection for this monument.</P>
    <P>I saw recently a poster about Ireland, I am not sure by which organisation it was issued so I shall not mention the name, in a shop window in a provincial town.  It was a new poster advertising Ireland, with a picture of Dublin and O'Connell Street, including the pillar, and I think that is not without significance. Some people say they like the vista, the blankness, because more cars can be parked there, but I feel that is the rising of a materialistic civilisation, a utilitarian view, which would wipe away anything which gets in the way of the money-grubbing which has become such a powerful influence in our society today.</P>
    <P>Those who are advertising our country by showing fine colour pictures of O'Connell Street with the pillar are showing a sense of the value and the rugged, elegant grace of something we have lost.</P>
    <P>The Government removed with indecent haste the remaining half of the pillar, the base and half the column, which remained standing after the attack by a person or persons unknown. They did so without consulting the public, the corporation, the Arts Council and without taking the advice of any responsible body in the city or in the country.  They simply rushed in to complete the work of the vandals who had knocked off the top.  Why did they do that?  I should like to hear from the Minister, who I think is in a position to answer such a question, why were the Government in such a hurry?  I can imagine some sort of case being made on account of structural uncertainty, but why the rush and why the lack of consultation?  Why were they so eager to get rid of it so fast, when for 40 years or more they had not done anything to replace the statue of Nelson by the statue of somebody more in keeping with Irish aspirations or Irish history?</P>
    <P>In section 2, subsection (1) of this Bill I notice it says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="918" /> The Corporation shall pay to the trustees the following sums by way of compensation.</P>
    <P>I suppose this is a common form of legislation but it seems to me a little bit arbitrary.  It seems to me the Dublin Corporation might well ask the Minister: &ldquo;Have you, even with the best intention of recouping us, really got the power to legislate and say: `The Corporation shall pay' ?&rdquo;  I am aware the Minister is strongly of the opinion in certain other matters that he has power to force the Corporation to do things. I wonder have we the right to say that &ldquo;The Corporation shall pay the following sums&rdquo;.  I know, of course, the Minister says in his speech and I quote from it:</P>
    <P>No part of the compensation to be paid to the trustees under section 2 of the Bill will be borne by the Dublin city ratepayers.  I have obtained the approval of the Government to the recoupment from the Exchequer of the total amount involved and provision will be made accordingly in my Department's Vote for the current year.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's statement that once we say &ldquo;The Corporation shall pay&rdquo; he commits himself to the promise that the Exchequer will recoup the Corporation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing about that in the Bill, however.  I cannot help wondering why there is not any section in the Bill to say &ldquo;The Minister shall recoup the Corporation&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Exchequer shall recoup the Corporation for the total amount involved&rdquo;.  After all, on the one hand, we have the Bill demanding, writing it down, instructing the Corporation to pay this compensation, and, on the other hand, we have just a speech by the Minister, a few words by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting he is not telling the truth, and I am prepared to recognise that in the Estimates for his Department such an item appears, but I should feel happier if it were also to appear in this Bill just as the requirement placed on the Corporation appears in this Bill.  Possibly there is some legitimate explanation for this but, unless the Minister can satisfy me on this, I should like to see it included <Col N="919" /> in this Bill as a promise of his intention or, better still, of our intention, the intention of the Oireachtas, that the Exchequer shall pay.  I feel it should be decided and laid down in this Nelson Pillar Bill and not merely included in an Estimate for his Department.</P>
    <P>In section 2, subsection (1), paragraph (a) the sum of £21,750 is mentioned. This is to be paid by the Corporation to the trustees for the damage caused to the Pillar on the 8th day of March, 1966, and the subsequent removal of the pillar.  Senator Rooney has pointed out that this is really two items, the damage done by persons unknown and the damage done by persons known.  I should like a breakdown of that figure.  How much of the £21,750 is to compensate the trustees for the damage done by persons unknown and how much is to compensate the trustees for the damage done by persons only too well known?  What is the breakdown?  Is it 50/50 or one-third/two-thirds? How does it go?  How much of that sum does the Minister regard the Government and the Army as having been responsible for?  What proportion of the damage was done by them?</P>
    <P>I think this is an important point because, in trying to assess damage to other property round about, it would be interesting to be able to apportion the amount that could be attributable to malicious damage by persons unknown and theoretically non-malicious damage done by Government authority. I should like, therefore, to have a breakdown on this figure.  I should also like something more specific than the words &ldquo;the subsequent removal of the Pillar&rdquo;.  There should be some wording in this clause which indicates that the Government went in and directed further demolition and removal of the not inconsiderable portion of the pillar which remained standing after the initial attempt of partial destruction.  I think that there is here a bit of covering up, that it is made to seem just as if a few stones were left and the Government went in and had them removed. There was a lot more left than a few stones.  There was the whole base of the pillar and about half of the <Col N="920" /> column was left on top of it, quite easily repairable.  Quite a number of buildings in a worse state have been repaired.</P>

      <P>It was quite sturdy still.  I do not think it would bend and it was sufficiently high for Senator Ó Maoláin to be distant from the passer by, and I do not think there would have been any occasion for fright or the disturbance of traffic.  I would prefer, therefore, to have seen it rebuilt, and would have put up almost anybody, because it is the pillar which seemed to me to have the elegance and the early 19th Century grace, not the statue on its top.  I feel there is a sliding over in this paragraph of the fact that a lot of the damage was done by Government direction.  I have already adverted to the fact it was done, as it appeared to the public at any rate, without due consultation with either Dublin municipal representatives, the Arts Council or any advisory body.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I want to make for clarification.  I think the Minister should be prepared to give us some kind of explanation of section 2, subsection (2) which says:</P>
      <P>The sum referred to in paragraph (b) of the foregoing subsection is such sum as bears to £1,500 the same proportion as the number of days in the relevant period bears to 365.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is some kind of supplementary payment.  I am not quite sure on what basis that is reached.  It is a minor point, but I should like to hear the <Col N="921" /> Minister on that.  I should like also to have the opportunity of the Committee Stage next week or at some future session for the purpose of putting down one or two amendments on the lines I have mentioned.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> Senator Sheehy Skeffington dealt with points on which he should have informed himself.  He suggested that the demolition of the statue by the Army authorities was not necessary.  I do not attempt to set myself up as a demolition expert but I suggest that there were factors involved which necessitated the action taken by the Army. With Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I regret the demolition.  It seemed a senseless thing because it might have taken the lives of people and I think it was sheer luck that human lives were <Col N="922" /> not lost in the original demolition by a person or persons unknown.</P>
      <P>People had got used to the statue and I do not think people in Dublin were bothered whether Horatio Nelson had one eye or two eyes or one arm or two arms.  The column had elegance and it added grace in its own way to O'Connell Street.  The only thing it ever did for me, apart from climbing it when I was young, was that it helped to teach me to write dates in Roman numerals.  That, probably, is one of the reasons why I am sorry it was demolished.</P>
      <P>Going back to the relatives, I am one of the people inclined to suggest that the British Government were paying pensions to the wrong people.  As most people who read history, I have become aware of the relative relationship which existed with Emma Hamilton&mdash;I think that was her name. However, that does not arise now.  We are dealing with the compensation proposed to be paid under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amateurs are more ardent than experts and as an ardent amateur I am inclined to take the view that the first explosion was carried out without any great knowledge of the use of explosives.  I take the view that the intention of the person or persons unknown was to destroy the statue only, foolish as that may seem because Horatio Nelson at that time was not doing any harm.  He was a man one could admire in many ways.  However, the person or persons unknown failed to realise that they were causing a detonation at the top of a tube and when the detonation took place there was a rush upwards which caused a vacuum underneath which sucked in the doors.  Then there was the compensating force in one direction and, as Isaac Newton put it, the force upwards and the force downwards met somewhere about the middle of the tube. That is my view and I propounded it at the time.  I was pleased to learn that the experts in the Army and in the police&mdash;I heard it from a Minister&mdash; held that view.  Of course, experts can be dangerous people who may not always be right.  However, the column was then in a dangerous condition. <Col N="923" /> Senator Sheehy Skeffington may be a patient and a benign person but I am sure he has turned off a tap in a hurry and that he has heard the knocking of the fellow with the hammer who appeared to be inside the tap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> The effect was the same in the whole pipe of the column supporting Nelson. It could be regarded as dangerous and that was sufficient justification for the Government to give an order to the Army completely to demolish it.  The second explosion was at a lower level and even with a milder explosion there was bound to have been a more serious shock effect.  I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that it was a pity the pillar had to be removed because it had become a part of Dublin.  It made Dublin different.  It was the centre of Dublin.  If another statue had been put on the pillar, even of Senator Ó Maoláin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was dangerous, and human beings are more important than statues.  As Senator Sheehy Skeffington is aware, the person or persons unknown could come back again and demolish the pillar completely.  Whether the compensation is evenly spread as between one explosion or another I will leave that matter for other people to argue, but I am of the opinion despite the fact that I was sorry to see the pillar removed that the right thing was done.</P>

      <P>I do not know where Senator Rooney got his figures with regard to the expenses arising out of <Col N="924" /> the two different operations on Nelson Pillar.  They certainly do not tally with my figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Senator did not interpret it properly.  He did not get those figures in it.  It is a fact that a total of £1,622 has been paid by the corporation in respect of malicious injuries claims and that there are some further claims pending.  There were 36 claims and of these 22 have been paid. It is true that it is not known exactly what may be involved in the settlement of the other 14 claims.</P>
      <P>With regard to the damage caused by the second explosion, the claims arising from that have been completely dealt with.  There were 29 claims and the payments were £2,283.  In addition, there were payments to Dublin Corporation in recoupment of the cost of services rendered in respect of demolition work&mdash;£8,038.  There were some expenses incurred by the Department of Defence amounting to £139.  It is not right to say there may still be new claims.  Claims had to be submitted within seven days of the event.  Therefore, we are reasonably certain that the total cost of the whole operation will not be substantially more than what we know at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Rooney dealt with the principle of the malicious injury code.  I do not intend to deal with that.  That is a matter for the Minister for Justice. When Senator Sheehy Skeffington was complaining about the removal of the remains of the pillar and waxing eloquent about the beauty of the original monument, I did not for a long time know what he was really getting at.  I found it hard to believe that he was really suggesting or implying that the Government should have rebuilt the monument.  It was only as a result of an interruption from this side of the House that the Senator finally did make it clear that that was, in fact, what he was advocating.  The removal of the remains was the obvious thing to do. With regard to the complaint about the hurry in doing it, I suppose the Senator would have preferred if the Government had left the remains there and <Col N="925" /> waited for the inevitable development of a crank pressure group to advocate the replacement of the monument.  I cannot see why the Government should be in any way blamed for the removal of the monument.  It was inevitable after the first explosion for which the Government had no responsibility. There is no question of the Bill compelling the corporation to pay, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington implied.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in fact, as I explained in my opening statement, giving effect to an agreement entered into between the corporation and the trustees of Nelson Pillar.  It is not correct to say that there is no undertaking with regard to the recoupment of the amount of compensation payable by the corporation to the trustees, except a few words in my opening statement.  The Book of Estimates has been published and the Estimate for my Department for the coming year provides for this payment to the corporation.  I have not gone through the operation of trying to separate the amount of damage caused to the monument by the first and second explosions.  That would be a futile and rather silly operation since the whole thing was the result of the first explosion.  The question of the removal would not have arisen only it was the obvious thing to do in view of the condition in which it was left.  There is, of course, no question of this Bill glossing over, as the Senator alleged, the manner in which the final removal was effected.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to give effect to the agreement made between Dublin Corporation and the trustees of Nelson Pillar and nothing more.  It does not purport to be a description of the whole operation.  I am prepared to leave that to people like Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  It is quite obvious from the total cost of this that the ultimate removal of the remains of the pillar was carried out in the most efficient and least expensive way, and in a way which caused the least inconvenience to the citizens of Dublin.  I do not think there are any other points I want to deal with.</P>
    <P>The question of whether or not the majority of the people would have preferred to have kept Nelson Pillar <Col N="926" /> is something that is not very relevant at this stage.  So far as the Government was concerned, once this damage had been done there was no question whatever of rebuilding it.  In so far as Dublin Corporation is concerned it is true that they have to pay a certain amount in respect of malicious damages but they have, as a result, this valuable central city site transferred to them.  It has resulted in a freer flow of traffic.  We have heard it said that some people think that the city has been improved as a result.  I quite recognise that others think the city would have been better if the monument was allowed to remain there.  I cannot make an assessment as to the relative numbers of people in these two groups.  It is irrelevant. Once the substantial damage had been done to the monument its removal was inevitable.  I am quite satisfied the Government did this in the most efficient and least expensive way.</P>

In those circumstances obviously any amendment could well upset this agreement and defeat the whole purpose of the Bill. As far as I am concerned, I am always happy to pay a visit to the Seanad and, if the Seanad does not want to deal with this matter today, I cannot help that.  I think it is unnecessary to bring either the Seanad or myself back on a second occasion to deal with this very simple Bill which merely gives effect to an agreement made between the Corporation and the trustees.</P>

    <Title>Nelson Pillar Bill, 1969: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>In section 2, subsection (1), paragraph (a), lines 23 to 24, to delete the words &ldquo;removal of the Pillar&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;Government-directed demolition and removal of the considerable portion which remained standing after the initial act of partial destruction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under this amendment, if it is passed, as I am sure it will be, paragraph (a) of section 2 would then read:</P>
      <P>The Corporation shall pay to the Trustees the following sums by way of compensation:</P>
      <P>(a) the sum of £21,750 for the damage caused to the Pillar on the 8th day of March, 1966, and the subsequent Government-directed demolition and removal of the considerable portion which remained standing after the initial act of partial destruction.</P>
      <P>My object in putting this amendment down is simply to put on the record in the relevant Bill the two parts of what happened.  The words at present in the Bill &ldquo;the subsequent removal of the Pillar&rdquo; are insufficient to indicate that there were two acts of vandalism, one official following on the unofficial one.</P>
      <P>I have not used the word &ldquo;vandalism&rdquo; in the amendment, but it is obvious that not only was the base of the Pillar still remaining pretty firmly after the first explosion but also about half of the column.  Senator O'Reilly's sympathetic speech, sympathetic both to me and to the Pillar, made the point that the Pillar was so badly shaken that it constituted a danger and had to be taken down.  This, of course, can be argued.  I can remember, again as a very small boy, a very considerable portion of O'Connell Street being in the same state, and the General Post Office had not a floor in it, had not a roof on it and the walls were badly shaken by bombarding from the Liffey. I do not remember any suggestion from any quarter that it should be taken down stone from stone and that fresh explosives should be put in in order to destroy the work ill-begun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if a monument which one wants to preserve, or a house which one wants to preserve, is damaged and is capable of repair, there is no excuse for saying: &ldquo;This house is in a dangerous condition, let us blow up the rest of it.&rdquo;  I believe a pillar or a house, if damaged, can be shored up and preserved even if it is in a shaken condition.  In fact, the base of the <Col N="931" /> Pillar was so solid and the Pillar was so narrow in comparison with it that I do not believe there was any real danger which could not have been met by a shoring up which would not take more than a few hours.  I believe the Pillar could have been re-assembled and rebuilt.  The Minister seemed very shocked at the notion they might do this.  After all, this was done to the Four Courts; it was done to the Custom House and it was done to the General Post Office and there was no feeling that they had to be gutted and torn down because of the damage done by high explosives.  I do not see any reason why the Minister should express surprise at my suggestion that this damage should have been repaired and the rugged elegance of the Pillar restored.  However, the Minister regards this as quite impossible, but I would not like him to be allowed to evade in the terms of the Bill the responsibility which lay on him and on the Government for this act of official destruction.</P>
    <P>That is why I want to change the words in paragraph (a) from &ldquo;the subsequent removal of the Pillar&rdquo; to the words &ldquo;the subsequent Government-directed demolition and removal of the considerable portion which remained standing after the initial act of partial destruction&rdquo;.  I am not content simply to attribute to the Government the &ldquo;removal&rdquo; of the Pillar.  It is not as if they merely removed a pile of rubble lying in the street.  This was not the case.  There should, in all honesty, be in this Nelson Pillar Bill some reference to what happened to the Pillar both by the unofficial action and by most regrettable and very hasty Government official action.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall in this connection that the Minister's reply to me when I suggested the Government might at least have taken some advice from the members of the Dublin Corporation, the members of the Arts Council and from some other advisory body before taking what was for the city and the country quite a big decision, was that I appeared to be wanting him to wait until a &ldquo;crank pressure group&rdquo;, or I think crank pressure groups were the words he used, would stop him from doing anything.  I am <Col N="932" /> not quite sure what those crank pressure groups were supposed to do to him.  What he means, in fact, is that public opinion would become so strong that he feared he would not have been, or the Government would not have been, allowed to carry out further destruction rendering our city more like any other big office-block city in Western Europe.  For that reason I feel there should be incorporated in the text of the Bill a wording which recognises and mentions the responsibility the Government undertook in this regard, and which I do not think they should be allowed, even verbally, to evade.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether at this juncture I am in order in mentioning that the Minister has promised to do this thing and, consequently, the charge is already on the public funds.  Therefore, when I am suggesting merely that it be mentioned in the text of the Bill, I am not putting any extra charge on public funds.  I am merely writing into the Bill something which the Minister has already agreed to do, and which is already in the Estimates, so I cannot really, on a point of order, be accused of adding a charge.  I am merely specifically mentioning a charge that is already there.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington says that his sole purpose in this amendment is to put what actually happened in the removal of the pillar on record in the relevant Bill. This, of course, is not a relevant Bill. It is not a Bill which sets out to record the whole saga of the disappearance of Nelson Pillar from the city of Dublin. It is merely a Bill, as I said, to give effect to an agreement entered into by the Corporation of Dublin and the trustees of Nelson Pillar.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out already that I am willing to allow the chronicle of the event to be made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I have no aspirations in that direction whatsoever.  I do not think the rebuilding of O'Connell Street after the damage caused in 1916 and during the War of Independence is in any way comparable to the proposition of the Senator that Nelson Pillar should be rebuilt.  The buildings to which the Senator referred were functional buildings and, therefore, the expenditure on their rebuilding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no excess funds at my disposal with which to preserve the stump of Nelson Pillar or to rebuild the monument.  I manage to obtain from the Government, at the appropriate time every year, substantially increased funds for the needs of my Department, but I need every penny for the important work that has to be done by my Department and I would not be prepared to utilise any of that money for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious there is no comparison between the rebuilding of the GPO, the Four Courts and so on and what Senator Sheehy Skeffington wants us to do. The original explosion, which effectively demolished Nelson Pillar was, of <Col N="934" /> course, an illegal one which, I think, every responsible person will regret. They will particularly regret that the people responsible for this illegal action were not apprehended.  However, once this damage had been done, the removal of the remains of the pillar was the obvious course.  Regrettable as the illegal demolition of the pillar was, it did give expression to the divergence of opinion that was known to exist as to the desirability of the monument being there at all.  I do not think there was any such divergence of opinion with regard to the GPO or the Four Courts.  I oppose the amendment because it has no relevance to the Bill, which does not set out to describe this operation but merely to give effect to the agreement between the Corporation of Dublin and the trustees of the pillar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has seen a distinction between the rebuilding of the GPO, the Four Courts and the Custom House and the retoration of the pillar.  The distinction he sees is that the other three were functional, by which he means utilitarian. For utilitarian reasons, he is prepared to see a case for it, but where it is merely an artistic reason he has no time or funds for it.  This represents very well the official view of Dublin today where some of the most beautiful buildings are demolished on &ldquo;functional&rdquo; grounds, utilitarian grounds, materialistic grounds; and a protest on artistic grounds is dismissed as being the protest of a crank pressure group.</P>
      <P>I do not know what kind of a country we would have if the entire judgement as to what is worth doing and what is not worth doing were to be left to those who see justification only in the functional, only in the utilitarian. I am sorry to say we have gone a long way on that road already but I do not believe the Irish people as a whole are interested solely in the utilitarian, and I feel the Minister is not speaking for all the people when he makes such a defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, he says: &ldquo;I have no funds to preserve such things as the stump of Nelson Pillar&rdquo;.  This is not what I was suggesting might have been <Col N="935" /> advised.  The base was there, half the column was there, and it could have been rebuilt in much the same way as the other buildings mentioned were rebuilt.  Furthermore, when the Minister says he has no funds, he has got £21,000 which was forked out to the Corporation and some of that expenditure would have been avoided had the pillar been rebuilt and become again a money-making proposition.</P>

      <P>This, in fact, is not the case.  We here, by this Bill&mdash;I do not know whether the Senator has read the Bill, but I refer him to section 4 which states:</P>
      <P>No action, proceeding, claim or demand of any kind or description shall lie against the trustees or any of them by any person in respect of their actions in&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) agreeing to accept the monetary provision contained in section 2 of this Act in full and final settlement of all claims in relation to the pillar and its site, and</P>
      <P>(b) not restoring a monument to Nelson,</P>
      <P>and that those actions shall have the like effect and validity as if they had been expressly authorised by the terms of the trusts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £21,000, therefore, to which they agreed was clearly in the light of their no longer being able to get any income from the pillar.  If the pillar had been rebuilt, even if a statue of Michael Yeats had been put on the top, the view from the top would have been sufficient to compensate the people from getting closer to the statue.  Therefore, the compensation would not have needed to be of the order of £21,000. The question of the trustees obligations to Nelson can be ruled out by <Col N="936" /> an Act of the Oireachtas.  That is what we are doing and it is what Senator Yeats attempts to deny.</P>

      <P>I am always ready to be enlightened, but I have not always the good fortune to be enlightened when I listen to Senator Yeats.  If he is out of order, as has been suggested by the Leader of the House, I plead with the Chair, nevertheless, for clemency to allow me to reply to the point he made.  The Senator asserted that £21,000 would have to be paid whether or not the pillar became again a revenue-producing object.  He has not proved that. It is obvious that the amount of the compensation is this size because the pillar has been wiped out as a revenue-producing object.  If it were restored, the full sum of £21,000 would clearly not have been necessary.  There probably would have been some compensation but there would have been no need, as Senator Yeats suggested, to have Nelson at the top.  Nelson could have been wiped out by a clause such as this.  This could have been done years ago by Senator Yeats and/or his Party.  They have been in power for nearly 30 years.  If they objected to Nelson at the top he could have been removed long ago.  I do not know why Senator Yeats waits for me to make a speech, before suggesting that the only way to get rid of Nelson was to blow him up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister who says he has no funds available to preserve the grace of Dublin and the elegance of Nelson Pillar in O'Connell Street can find £21,000 to repair the damage, a portion of which was done at his direction. He was unwilling to break down that sum and to state how much damage was done by him and how much by persons unknown.  He had an <Col N="937" /> odd expression in his reply just now. He said that the &ldquo;illegal explosion had given expression to a divergence of opinion about the value of retaining the pillar&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel this is the kind of expression of divergence of opinion which should be deplored.  If adverted to at all by a responsible Minister, it should be specifically deplored.  In so far as it in him lies, I feel he ought to restore the <i>status quo ante</i> and not allow this particular type of &ldquo;expression of divergence of opinion&rdquo; to be encouraged here or anywhere else.  Therefore, I feel like pressing this amendment.  The Minister suggests that it is not the purpose of the Bill to write the saga of what took place.  The House will agree that the addition of the dozen words or so I propose is hardly for the purpose of telling the whole saga, but merely of mentioning that, though some damage was done on the 8th March, 1966, further damage was subsequently done by the Government officially and that the Government did a little bit more than remove the pillar but actually directed further demolition, because the base took a lot more wiping out than the upper pillar.  While the Minister says it is not the function of this Bill to contain words that reveal this fact, I feel it is not the purpose of the wording of this Bill to conceal this fact.  This is what is done by the wording which refers only to the removal by the Government and not to the damage done by the Government.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 5 says: &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister appoints by Order&rdquo;.  What I am simply asking the Minister to tell us is the order of magnitude of lapse of time he envisages in our passing the Bill and his giving effect to it, because it has been indicated to us that it would be a dreadful pity if we did not take all Stages tonight.  Now the Minister is being very coy, and says he will not tell us when he is going to bring this into operation.  I would plead with him to be less coy and give us the facts. What is his objection to telling us, even approximately, the order of magnitude of delay he has in mind between the passing of the Act and its coming into operation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>Again, on this section I feel the Minister is treating us with less than courtesy.  For all we know he may be going to allow this to stand aside for six months or so.  He is probably very busy with other things, but the mere fact that he feels slightly irritated or testy now, because <Col N="939" /> he is being kept rather later than he wants to stay, should not make him refuse to give us an indication of what he has in mind, and I feel he owes this in courtesy to the House.  Why should the Minister sit mute, however glorious, when asked a simple question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

      <P>The Minister did not sit mute.  The Senator probably did not hear him he is so full up of his own importance.  The Minister said he would make up his mind when the Bill was passed and that is the answer to the Senator's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was what was the order of magnitude of the delay he had in mind and the Minister answered he did not know, that he would not make up his mind until the Bill was passed.  I pressed him on this and his second answer was, in my opinion, the equivalent of being mute because he said he had already answered that question, but he had not.  In courtesy to the House he might be a little less coy because I do not think the coy attitude suits the Minister.  He should come clean and tell us if he intends to delay it one month, six months or three years.  I cannot see any reason for his being so unwilling to tell us this until we give him the Bill.</P>
