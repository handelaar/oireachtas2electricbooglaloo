    <Title>Central Fund Bill, 1958&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, when speaking on this Bill, I was talking about what seemed to me to be our contradictory attitude towards private enterprise and State interference. I suggested that what we seem to be asking for is private enterprise &ldquo;untrammelled&rdquo; by State interference, but protected by State interference; private enterprise standing on its own feet, but leaning on the taxpayers' shoulders; private enterprise open wide to the money of foreign investors, but narrowly closed, as far as non-national ownership goes.</P>
      <P>I think that part of the contradictory attitude is made clear by two Bills which will come before us.  One has the aim of admitting rather more foreign investment, modifying somewhat our former attitude under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  The other is a tea importation Bill whose aim, as far as I can see, is to keep foreigners more strictly out than ever. It seems that we would like foreign investors to bring in their money, but we would like as far as possible to have the profits accruing therefrom remain in the pockets of Irish nationals.  We would like foreign investments here for Irish profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that can be done.  I think the contradictions inherent in this attitude led to some at least of the evils that now beset us.  We cannot really have it both ways.  We cannot say: &ldquo;Let us have foreign investment but let us use it solely to keep profits in Irish pockets.&rdquo;  I should be sorry <Col N="222" /> to feel that the national ideal in realisation had merely become one of confining the exploitation of Irish labour to Irish nationals.  I do not think that was the sole aim when this State got its independence.  I feel we have in this economy of ours two legitimate alternatives.  First, we should plan our economy, assess our resources both local and national, assess our labour-power and our prime needs and then apply all available labour-power to all our resources for the meeting, as a prime objective, of the prime needs of our people.  To set about that would be, of course, to go towards socialism&mdash;democratic socialism&mdash;and the very word, I am afraid, appears to terrify people in this country.  The other alternative would be, as I see it, to give free enterprise a free hand.  I think Senator McGuire and one or two others took that view in speaking in this very debate&mdash;give free enterprise a free hand.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator McGuire who talked about loosening controls, easing taxation, and so on&mdash;to give it a free hand, uninhibited by any of the barriers, for instance, against non-nationals but, I would presume, unprotected by State interference in relation to the laws of supply and demand in the world market.  In other words, give our own private enterprise the full benefit of real competition.  I would assume that those who support that view will naturally be opposed to the imposition of fresh duties, to the State guaranteeing fresh loans to a private enterprise that really wants to be free.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, with these two legitimate alternatives, we are, in fact, trying to choose a third way.  We do not choose the democratically planned and socialistic economy, and we do not choose the free private enterprise economy.  We try to choose a third way &mdash;a private enterprise economy but with the profits, channelled by State interventions, in the hands as far as possible of an Irish owing-class, largely a new class in this country.  The Irish businessman, as I see him to-day, wants the State to hold his hand for him, and even to carry his bag for him, but, as to looking into the bag and <Col N="223" /> seeing what is contained therein, they want &ldquo;no State interference&rdquo;.  I believe that this kind of thing can be done for a time, but only for a time, and a relatively short time at that.</P>
    <P>I believe that this attempt to pretend we have a private enterprise economy, and yet having it bolstered-up and cushioned by State intervention and all kinds of regulations about non-nationals, and giving protective tariffs and rather easily come-by loans, and so on, leads to inefficiency, underproduction, unemployment and emigration. It leads also to the building-up of a rather pampered and not notably competent privileged class, a class State-protected, at least for a time, from the cold wind of international competition in industry.</P>

      <P>It seems it would be perfectly futile for me to expect anything at all from Senator McGuire.  I will accept that position. Perhaps it promotes a certain amount <Col N="224" /> of irritation when I suggest that this kind of economy tends to build up a pampered and not notably competent privileged class, a State-protected privileged class, in the country, State-protected for a time from the cold wind of international competition.</P>
      <P>It is true that, under this régime, some will wax fat, and flabby, and inefficient; and in fact the economy, the community, will get the worst of both worlds, will get the disadvantages of State control without its benefits, and the disadvantages of private enterprise without the benefits that would derive to the community from real competition.  I should like to ask why it is that our private enterprise economy has failed.  What is wrong with it?  Whose fault is it?</P>
      <P>There has been a suggestion that we got too much State interference, and that that is what is wrong.  Can a case really be made to show that it is this State interference that has prevented our ruggedly individualistic private enterprise exponents from producing the goods and giving us the kind of prosperity we require, when it comes to developing our own resources?  Let us take the case, for instance, of the Avoca Copper Mines. It seems fantastic that we should first spend money on finding out if there is any copper there: we spend £500,000 on that work, and then, on the promise that a new private enterprise company will pay us back that £500,000, we lease the mines to them.  Subsequently, we lend them £350,000, and we are, at present, further guaranteeing a loan to them of £1,300,000.  When we ask them what security they will give us for that, they say: &ldquo;We will give you as security the mines you leased to us.&rdquo;  And we are quite happy.  That is an example of the Irish system in practice.  I suggest it is a good example of getting the worst of both worlds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me, a fundamental question to-day in Ireland is why is it, with a thousand things crying out to be done for the benefit of our people, that our private enterprise economy is not only incapable of employing usefully our 80,000 unemployed but leads to the losing of the brains and the skill and <Col N="225" /> the muscle of some 50,000 Irish workers every year, not just a sum total of 50,000 but 50,000 every year?  I understand there are now something like 800,000 Irish workers in Britain to-day. Not only can our private enterprise economy not usefully employ the 80,000 unemployed but it can find no means of keeping in the country the brains and skill represented by these 50,000 Irish workers draining out of the country every year.  Why?</P>
    <P>Why can private enterprise which, after all, is praised by every big Party in this country, in these two very important respects, with so many things crying out to be done, not deliver the goods?  That is a question which I have not heard answered.  In fact, it seems to promote a certain amount of irritation, even when it is asked.  Nor do I see any sign that this Government, any more than the last Government, has the intention or the capacity to grapple effectively with the real problems which beset our people, and which were mentioned in the speech which I quoted to the House last evening by the late Senator Hawkins &mdash;problems of poverty, under-education, unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Poverty is a very real problem and it hits a large proportion of our people to-day.  To some extent, perhaps, we are blinded to-day by the fact that so many of our most affected sections of the community can get out, can leave this country; but the poverty is there, and it remains.  I was asked the other day by a small boy of my own, observing messenger boys delivering parcels in very wintry weather: &ldquo;Why do boys become messenger boys&rdquo;?  I gave him the answer which I believe to be true: &ldquo;Because their parents are poor.&rdquo;  I do not know whether any Senator would like to give any other answer.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have a very large number of under-privileged children and under-privileged families, living on the poverty line.  We have 500,000 primary school children&mdash; 500,000 of them.  Of those, some 64,000 get to secondary or vocational schools. Now, 64,000 in 500,000 represents about 12½ per cent.  What kind of fair chance is given to the others, to the rest of <Col N="226" /> the percentage?  If only 12½ per cent. get some kind of continuing education, what happens to the others?</P>
    <P>Are we satisfied, are the Government satisfied, is the Minister satisfied, that we are doing the best we can in the circumstances for the 87½ per cent. of these 500,000 schoolchildren, who do not reach any other education than primary education?  I notice that the comparable figures in the North of Ireland are 207,000 primary schoolchildren and 50,000 secondary and technical schoolchildren.  In other words, in the North, it is found possible to give 25 per cent. of them a chance of further education.  That is not enough.  It is twice as good as we are doing, even though it is still far from enough.</P>
    <P>Another indication, I suggest, of the level of poverty at which so many of our people are living, is given in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, 1957, the latest one available.  I refer Senators to page 186, where some figures given under the heading of Social Amenities give a picture of the poverty, particularly the rural poverty but also the urban poverty in this country.  For instance, in relation to the question of domestic sanitation, there are in all 662,000 private dwellings in the Republic. Figures are given for those which have sanitation&mdash;those which have flush lavatories, those which have a chemical closet, those which have a dry closet, and those which have no sanitary facilities whatever.  How many of those private dwellings in this Republic of ours have no sanitary facilities, not even a dry closet?  According to the official figures, the number is 320,000 out of 662,000. That is an indication, I suggest of gross poverty, it is an indication of the level of life which we as a society&mdash;let us not blame merely the Government&mdash; are at present tolerating.</P>
    <P>Of the same 662,000 dwellings only less than half, not very much more than one-third&mdash;255,000&mdash;have got water piped into the house; and even of those&mdash;and this applies to many urban homes, the dwellings of many Dublin workers and Cork workers, too, probably&mdash;some 61,000 have to use a tap in common with other people in the same house.</P>
    <P>Again, according to official figures, we have over 800 schools which, according <Col N="227" /> to the Minister himself, are officially admitted to be obsolete.</P>
    <P>On unemployment, I need not give the figures.  They are circulated to us every week and we notice very little drop below the figure of 80,000 workers. And they represent far more than 80,000 people, they represent the wives and families and they form a very large section of our urban working class.</P>
    <P>Emigration figures have risen lately, from somewhere near the 40,000 mark to 50,000 a year.  In other words, the country is, in my contention, bleeding to death&mdash;for what is the country without its people, and the people are leaving at this frightening rate.  We are not a big country with a big population where, particularly with emigration, a flow to and from is perfectly understandable.  About 50,000 are going out of the country every year, and many of those who remain are living in squalor and increasing despair.</P>
    <P>It is against such a background that I feel entitled to ask whether the Government really is grappling effectively with these problems of poverty, under-education, unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>Even within our present economy, of which I am deeply critical, on the present budgetary basis, we could plan far better than we do. Much of the present spending, as calculated in these Estimates and as spoken of by the Minister, is planned on irrational and ill-balanced lines.  I hope presently to make a comparison between education and defence in the matter of expenditure.  On the whole question of education, I suggest that (a) we are not doing half enough, and (b) some of the money we are spending is spent in ill-advised ways, from every angle.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes spoke about the language policy.  I believe it is costing a lot of money, and, even from the point of view of those who want to revive the language, I believe the policy is a bad one and the money is ill-spent.  I agree with Senator Hayes when he suggests that what the Government has said about hoping to <Col N="228" /> set up a commission to examine the position is not enough.</P>
    <P>There is one point which he made upon which I should like to comment, partly because I think he did not quite mean what he appeared to say.  He went so far as to say&mdash;I think, unjustifiably&mdash;that if a Senator gets up in this House and makes a speech in fluent Irish, the reporters cannot take him down accurately.  I think what he meant was not to cast reflection on the reporters, but to indicate that a technical and rapid speech in Irish presents difficulties in stenography which are extremely hard to cope with.</P>
    <P>On that particular point in relation to Irish language reporting, I should like to mention&mdash;and I think in fairness it should be mentioned&mdash;what the position is in other assemblies.  I think of the Council of Europe, where two official languages are on an equal footing&mdash;English and French.  There they have a specialised staff for each language; they have a French stenographic staff and an English stenographic staff, and they are separate, and they work in pairs.  Now, what we expect is that the same reporter shall do the work of two such specialised reporters.  When I mention that the members of the temporary staff at the Council of Europe, as verbatim reporters, are paid at the rate of £56 a week&mdash;I am talking only about temporary staff; the permanent staff is paid at a slightly lower rate&mdash;I think I will not be accused of exaggerating, therefore, when I say that not merely do we ask the reporting staff here to do two men's work, but we ask them to do it at half a man's salary.  I do not believe Senator Hayes would disagree with that, and I take up the point not so much to correct what he said as to place an emphasis on it which I think he would approve of.</P>
    <P>I agree with what he said about doing something a little bit more than merely setting up a commission.  I believe we should, quite simply, have a referendum, and I would like to see that allowed for in these Estimates&mdash;a referendum on the question of whether the people would like Irish to be treated as an optional subject in our schools or not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> I believe that the money that is being spent on the present language policy is actively militating against the language itself, by dilution and by the compulsory spreading of a very much watered down tongue.  I suggest that the Government, the authorities, do not really want to know the facts about Irish.  I notice from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, which gives the census returns, that, in 1926, the percentage of Irish speakers over the age of three in this Republic was 19.3.  By 1936, it was 23.7 and, by 1946, it had dropped to 21.2.  What was the figure for 1956? We do not know; and why do we not know?  Because the authorities decided, on the whole, not to ask the question in that census.  Why did they not ask the question?  Because they did not want to face the facts; because they realise that in fact the percentage is dropping and, if it is, they do not want to know it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a bad attitude. I think we should be prepared to find out.  I think that that governmental attitude is paralleled in many other fields.  I notice in relation to overcrowded classes&mdash;which is surely a fundamental problem in relation to education&mdash;that the Government and the Department of Education do not even ask school managers to give a return showing the size of classes.  In July, 1956, Deputy McQuillan asked the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mulcahy, what was the extent of overcrowding in Dublin and Cork schools; how many classes there were of 50 and over, how many classes with 60 and over, and how many with 70 and over; and how many schoolrooms contained two or more classes.  The Minister's reply was that he had not got the figures, because the Department did not normally ask the managers for those figures, and, as the schools were in recess, he could not get them. Deputy McQuillan asked whether, if he raised the question in the autumn, he could then get the figures, and the Minister said that he could.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of 1956, Deputy McQuillan put the question again.  The reply was that the Department had asked the school managers, but that the facts had not come in and had <Col N="230" /> not been tabulated, but if the Deputy would wait for a while the figures would be forwarded to him.  In fact, the figures were never made public, but we must presume that the Department did finally find out the figures for October, 1956.  Yet I notice that Deputy Dr. Browne, on 20th March last, asked a similar question of the Minister for Education about overcrowding in Dublin classes.  I should like to quote the reply of the Minister. It is given at column 564, Volume 166, of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The returns furnished annually by the managers of national schools to the Department are not in such a form as would permit of the statistics requested by the Deputy being compiled.  Their compilation would involve the obtaining of special returns from all the schools in the County Borough of Dublin which would entail the expenditure of an inordinate amount of time and work both on the part of school managers and the officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I feel it should suffice if I tell the Deputy that by reference to enrolment for the year 1956-57 and the number of classes operating on 30th June, 1957, the average number of pupils to a class in national schools in Dublin County Borough was 47.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Two points arise from that.  If the average number in Dublin classes is 47, what is the maximum likely to be?</P>
    <P>The other point, which is far more important, is that not merely does the Department not know the answer to any question about overcrowding in our schools, but it does not seek for it, and is not prepared to ask for it, and does not seem to care.  I believe it should be part of our Government policy to find out the facts regarding overcrowding of classes, and to remedy this major defect.  I believe it is one of the major crimes committed against our school children.  Yet apparently the Government do not even want to know the facts, do not ask school managers as a routine matter: &ldquo;What are the sizes of your various classes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even when new schools are being built, they are built to house a <Col N="231" /> theoretical 50 children per class&mdash;and if anybody cares to make the calculation, he can see it reported every time a new school is put up, how many classes it will have and how many children it will serve.  I think that is wrong, because even those excessive numbers will themselves be exceeded quite considerably.  Yet that is how we are building.  On that question of school building, I should like to see a more intelligent Government policy.  We know that the Government give no grant at all for the building of secondary schools which are crying out for reconstruction grants. In the North, every secondary school which applies can get 65 per cent. of the money for such building recouped. Here they do not get one penny. Surely that is all wrong.</P>
    <P>Another point in relation to Government policy for education is the quota system of registered teachers.  I suggest that if a teacher has the qualifications to be a registered teacher, he should be registered, irrespective of the number of recognised pupils in the school.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the niggardly way in which increments to secondary teachers are approached.  They are not given in the first year that the teacher is qualified; and many teachers are tempted, for that reason, to leave the country, even though they may have the full qualifications.  Then the hours which the teacher may do with junior classes are not counted towards their increment hours.  So it is that the qualified teacher aiming at getting increments is hampered by petty Government regulations, the purpose of which would only seem to be to save a pound here and there.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about expenditure on education, and I have suggested that even within our system, without going outside it, we could find more money if we regarded education as sufficiently basic and important.  The Vote for Defence is now being debated in the Dáil, and it is under that Estimate that I should like to see the possibility examined of making major savings. I notice, for instance, the general trend.  If you compare the expenditure on defence and education down the years, and I will quote a few figures, <Col N="232" /> you will find that, in 1938-39, £1.7 million was the Estimate for Defence (the Army) and in the same year, the Estimate for Education was £4.4 million.  The present Estimate before us gives us a figure of £6.2 million for defence and £12.5 million for education. In the intervening years between 1938-39&mdash;the last pre-war budgetary year&mdash;when £1.7 million was voted for defence, the trend for both Estimates was naturally a rising one.</P>
    <P>If we were to take that pre-war year as a basis and notice what has been done in relation to the defence figure, we would find that the amount estimated for defence this year is a multiplication of that figure by nearly four, by in fact, 3.65.  If we had multiplied the Estimate for Education in exactly the same proportion, 3.65, the present Estimate for Education would not be £12.5 million as it now is&mdash;I am talking about primary, secondary and technical education&mdash;but £16,000,000.  What follows from those figures is that we have considered it more important to increase expenditure on defence than on education, which, after all, might largely be regarded as another very important item of national defence.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that during the war there was a need for the stepping up of figures for defence, and they went up in 1942-43 to over £8,000,000 and to nearly £9,000,000 in 1945-46.  Surely they might now be allowed&mdash;particularly in the world situation where the old-fashioned army is becoming more and more out of date&mdash;to be cut, in the interests of increased benefit to educational grants and education in general?</P>
    <P>I speak here as a representative of a university constituency.  I must confess that if I were to be asked: &ldquo;Which would you rather spend the money thus saved on, university education or primary education?&rdquo;  I would be bound to answer, if that choice was put before me: primary education.  Because I think they are, above all, the most under-privileged section of our whole educational system.  That, however, does not mean that more money should not and could not be spent at every level of our educational system.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Senator Dr. O'Donovan yesterday in relation to <Col N="233" /> figures which he gave for the public endowment rate per Irish student in the various universities, and he pointed out that the figure for Trinity College was higher, though he admitted he was calculating this only in relation to the Irish students for Trinity College.  I should like to say that I speak with complete sympathy for what Senator Dr. O'Donovan was saying about U.C.D. in particular, and the state of under-endowment in which it finds itself.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Senator Stanford, has pointed out, all our universities in the Republic stand in a state of under-endowment. It is particularly noteworthy that U.C.D. is under-endowed and overcrowded.  Therefore, I speak in entire sympathy with Senator Dr. O'Donovan when he makes that point, but I would make a point in relation to Trinity, on his excluding from his calculations all our overseas students. I should like to suggest that is not quite legitimate.  The figure he gave was not quite comparable.  He mentioned £160 for public endowment for the average Irish student in T.C.D., £110 in Cork, £80 in Galway and £70 in U.C.D.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to make is that the figures are not quite comparable because, I think, we can say we are justifiably proud that Trinity College does attract so many overseas students. Quite apart from that, the point has been well made before&mdash;it was made very well by Senator Stanford last year&mdash;that these students are far from coming empty-handed into the country.  They each spend an average of something like £300 a year in the country.  At a time when we are granting loans and concessions to industrialists, and devising propaganda for tourists to attract them into the country, we ought to be very happy to have a large number of overseas students attracted into our universities. I do not think these overseas students should be excluded from the figures given by Senator Dr. O'Donovan.  It is true, of course, that Irish Catholic students cannot attend Trinity College without ecclesiastical permission.  There has been a ban since 1926.  That is an obvious wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only further point I want to make in relation to this is that the figures Senator Dr. O'Donovan quoted in relation to the various universities are dwarfed by the figure quoted yesterday by Senator Stanford for Queen's University, which has a yearly amount of £400 of public endowment per student there.  It is in the light of that fact that we should review these figures.  So that, while recognising that there is serious overcrowding in U.C.D., for whatever reasons, we should also recognise that the amount at present being granted for all our universities is well below the minimum desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken too long, but my conclusion would be that these Estimates represent essentially a failure to plan for community needs instead of for private greeds.  I suggest that that failure is the besetting Government sin in this country&mdash;the sin of all our Governments.  In Britain, the Tory Government, when it is in power, blames everything on the previous Socialist Government, but here, alas, we have not so far had a Socialist Government and, therefore, our Government cannot get up and say it is all the fault of these wicked Socialists.  There is one thing we have produced more of, in greater quantities, than Britain, and that is Tory Parties.  We have five Tory Parties; Britain has got only one.  Consequently you find, and I am afraid I am sorry to say it applies as much, or nearly as much, to the Irish Labour Party as to the other Parties, no Socialist or even progressive criticism of the Estimates <Col N="235" /> for Government policy in relation to Government expenditure, or in relation to production.</P>
    <P>They are all the time conditioned by a Tory attitude of mind, a deeply Tory attitude of mind, far more Tory in some respects than the very Tory Government in Britain to-day.  I should like to see some evidence of new thinking and new planning, some evidence of a change of emphasis at least in these Estimates, some hint that the real problems are at last going to be tackled, no matter what vested interests are crossed, no matter how irritated some privileged persons may become.  I should like to see some sign that expenditure is going to be more intelligently balanced in future between the two items, military defence and intellectual defence, between our Army and our educational system.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I see no such evidence, not even a hint of it.  These Estimates reveal, alas only too well, Government policy, the policy of all Irish Governments since the beginning of the State.  They represent the same old mixture as before and will produce, short term, merely sedative results, followed, long term, by economic disaster&mdash;and not so very long term, either.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides us with an opportunity of stocktaking, and, especially to the Independent representatives, of giving some constructive criticism.</P>
      <P>Our main defect at present is a lack of confidence, and I suggest that the main job confronting us is to instil confidence into the public.  We can do this by going back and counting our blessings, because we have many, if we only start to think.  I have been recently at some meetings of young farmers who were feeling, naturally, rather disturbed by the present price trends.  I always begin by showing them our present position.  We do not stand in fear of hearing the knock at the door, the knock of the secret police outside.  Neither do we dread that we are going to face starvation.</P>

      <P>That is very different from facing queuing for hours just for one crust of bread, something that millions in India and elsewhere know only too well at present.  We have never known this fear.  Again, let us count our blessings.  We do not have an economic empire, but we have an empire far more lasting&mdash;our spiritual empire.  Let us, when we count our blessings here, count the blessing of living in a country that is the world's ideal for Christian living. That is a blessing that we cannot treat and should never treat lightly.</P>
      <P>We have always to keep in mind that we have not here a lasting city, and if we keep this firmly in mind, we can plan a future for our country that will be in keeping with its glorious past.  We can plan an expansion for it that will be in keeping with the magnificent work that is done by our Irish men and women, our missionaries, our medicals and teachers, in far-flung corners of the world to-day. They are in Africa; they are in the Fiji Islands; they are in Burma; they are all over the world.  Is there an Irishman amongst us who does not listen with a thrill of pride to Micheál Ó Hehir on All-Ireland day when he sends our greetings to our exiles all over the world, to the far-flung corners of the globe?</P>
      <P>I suggest that we have here a country that we can be proud of, and we can build a glorious future by realising the many blessings we now enjoy.  To do anything else would be to fly in the face of Providence.  We can take our competitors, who are held up as such glorious examples to us.

      <P>If we read what the Danish sociologists think of their country, we find that they are not worried about its economic development, or about problems of the Free Trade Area; their concern is to preserve the very soul of Denmark.  Again, take the mighty United States.  I have lived there and seen its problems.  Personally, I would not bring up my family there, if I had a chance to bring them up here.  Every nation has its problems.  Let us face ours squarely and honestly.  Perhaps our greatest difficulty here is the ease with which our people can go to England and America and fit in there as very welcome citizens.  That, you might say, is our unfortunate, or fortunate, position. If we were down in the South of Europe, or pitched somewhere in Africa, with our present standards, we would be the Americans of the region.</P>
      <P>But, however, praising ourselves is not sufficient.  We must seek the causes why we are not making more headway at present.  We cannot claim that we are making sufficient headway when we are confronted with our present alarming figures for emigration and unemployment.  We must face the fact, and this is no discredit to any of our previous Governments&mdash;I take it they all did their best&mdash;but the sad fact is that there were 24,000 fewer in employment last year than the previous year.  I hope that the trend is picking up, and I think it is, but it is a grim reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration and unemployment are problems besides which Partition fades into insignificance.  They are our main problems, and let us not delude ourselves that by chasing Partition we are solving the other two.  In fact, <Col N="238" /> Partition will be solved only when the others are well on the way to solution.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the reason for our failure to make more headway has been our failure to develop here a Christian democracy.  This is aggravated by the stranglehold that bureaucracy has on our country.</P>
    <P>Bureaucracy in an occupied country, which we were until quite recently, has as its main function to put across the policy of the occupier.  In other words, it must be ruthless.  It does not consult.  It has to act virtually as a dictator. Then in a new country, after liberation, those organisations so necessary in a democratic country, rural, professional and trade organisations, are not developed or in a position where they can take the responsibility they must take in any enlightened democracy.  We did not have these in the twenties and we did not have many of them in the thirties, and consequently those engaged in our bureaucracy, the officials at various levels, were forced to continue in almost the same frame of mind as they had when we were an occupied country.</P>
    <P>Conditions began to change in the forties, and are changing very much at present.  Our bureaucracy badly needs to adjust itself to the changed conditions, to realise that the fullest possible use must be made of all our organisations, that our organisations must carry their full measure of responsibility; we must develop together as a real example of a Christian democracy, putting foremost the principle of subsidiary function, that no body will attempt to do itself what a lesser body can accomplish.</P>
    <P>Holland subscribes to this principle. So does Canada.  So do all countries where democracy is enlightened and progressive.  The older democracies such as England and America have had their democratic organisations for years.  They are the competitive factor that ensures that their bureaucracy works.  That is the main factor, I submit, that is missing in our democracy to-day.  However, it is a lack that, once recognised, can be rectified by a deliberate policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The Vocational Commission reported in 1943.  I must say that, in 15 years, very little advance has been made in vocationalism, notwithstanding the recommendations of that commission. Perhaps, the major advance has been the organisations that have developed in that period.  Speaking of agricultural organisations, we had Muintir na Tíre beginning in 1938 and Macra na Feirme beginning in 1946.  Thus the organisations that are needed for the building of a proper vocational order are now well developed, and so the recommendations of the Vocational Commission can be put into effect.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as criticising the Civil Service or any other body.  I am simply stating the facts. We cannot blame the Civil Service and other bodies for taking powers unto themselves in the absence of responsible organisations.  We have all had experience of irresponsible organisations. Many of them are still with us to-day.</P>
    <P>The stranglehold of a bureaucracy is evident at all levels to-day.  First of all, let us take the case of any Minister. A Minister is almost powerless to change a Department.  He has not got the forward line to give the necessary impetus and originality to his Department. The regular officials of a Department are properly the defence of the State.  They know all the answers as to why things do not work.  But the spark of originality can be provided only by the Minister bringing in his own special advisers for the duration of his ministry.</P>
    <P>The United States work that system and it works excellently.  Ministerial advisers are brought in from business, agricultural and other organisations. Some may be agricultural officers, others being teachers and professors. Their originality makes a splendid contribution to the advancement of the State.  We have a defence, but we have not got a forward line.  That is why there is essentially so little difference when Ministers are changed in a Department.  It is not enough merely to change the full-forward of a team.  You must change a few men as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> In dealing with the professional bodies, I submit that all our Governments are very much at fault.  Such bodies are not treated as partners or as responsible citizens.  Nothing emphasises that more, I think, than the recent crisis in regard to agricultural prices.  I submit that in such a case the farmers should have argued the agricultural prices around the conference table.</P>
    <P>As in England, a price should be negotiated.  After all, the State cannot pay out more than it has in its coffers, and any responsible organisation of farmers coming in can appreciate that fact.  Having negotiated a price, it is then the duty of the organisation concerned to carry its full share of the unpopularity of any reduction of price entailed, and also carry its full share of stimulating the increased production that is necessary to overcome a price cut, rather than be forced as they are to-day to come out and attack the Government.</P>
    <P>You cannot give money out, if you have not got it.  I submit that our organisations are being put into a very false position, by being treated as juveniles, to be entertained, but not consulted.  However, there is one ray of hope.  It is the recent annual price review promised by the Taoiseach.  I hope that develops.  That could be an excellent means for both Government and organisations alike, all working and teaming together, to better develop our resources.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the professional organisations concerned, I am very much connected with many of these, especially the Engineers' Association, Cumann na n-Innealtóirí. I find it an excellent body of enthusiastic young Irishmen who are keen and eager to play their part in the full development of this country. They are not satisfied with the contacts they have with the various State Departments.  They feel they are being treated as juveniles who have little or no contribution to make.  In fact, they have the capacity for making many constructive proposals.</P>
    <P>I hope in the next session to be able to speak on the Adjournment on a report that the Engineers' Association <Col N="241" /> is bringing out on national development. I know they have worked hard and long at it for the past couple of years.  I believe it is a document that will be well worth serious study.  I suggest that the Departments concerned should team up with the engineers, meet them and use them.  They have ability and something to offer.  Together, a notable contribution can be made.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire spoke about the balance between public and private enterprise. We all recognise the necessity for that, but I am stressing this other balance which is even more necessary&mdash;the balance between our bureaucracy and our professional and rural bodies.  We need to keep that very much in mind.  Our need is to train up our young men and women for leadership so that they can play their part in the organisations.</P>
    <P>I am proud and happy to be associated with the adult education movement in University College, Cork. We have a similar movement in University College, Dublin.  University College, Dublin, deals largely with the problem of training leaders for the various city organisations.  In University College, Cork, as befits a rural university, having done its bit on the town side, it went to the country some seven years ago.  To-day there are 270 young farmers holding diplomas in five counties in Munster, excluding Clare. They studied two nights per week from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. combining both sociology and leadership, on the one hand, with rural science and economics on the other.</P>
    <P>These young men have enthusiasm and a broad outlook on the country's problems.  They are not just solely concerned with farming problems.  I submit that with that leadership available, a vast change will be made in agriculture.  The change is already evident in many of the labour organisations, and even in management.  We have got a management course, the only difference being that we have not been able to get management to take examinations.  At present 130 young farmers are completing the first year of their course.</P>
    <P>The only criticism I want to make in <Col N="242" /> detail of the Estimates is the fact that we have been handed £2,000 to do a job that costs £3,500.  Accordingly, we in University College, Cork, have no option but either to go into debt or to cut the courses.  It would be an act of national sabotage to cut the expenditure on our courses.  We must go into debt to continue.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to right this in the present Estimates if possible, otherwise we will have to go into debt to continue these courses.</P>
    <P>The work of outside bodies is making itself apparent in a very healthy way in the many ratepayers' associations we have in the country.  These are doing excellent work on the rates at present.  They are adopting a businesslike approach.  They are saying to those in charge: &ldquo;You get so much money; do the job.  It is not a question of calculating how much money you want in order to do the ideal job. You must cut your cloth according to your measure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A good step was taken in Cork recently where the committee rightly decided they had too many top administrators, that the county should capably be run by one county manager and two, rather than three, assistants. It can be done by cutting red tape, by devolving authority, by giving the public representatives on the bodies more say.  Let our council members function as befits members of corporations or county councils.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up an undue amount of the time of the House.  I have pointed out briefly what I believe needs most urgently to be rectified in our Government system.  I pointed out that it is a hang-over from the time we were an occupied nation and that we have made progress.  Perhaps we could not devolve responsibility before this. However, the time has now come to put the principles of vocationalism into practice.  This will do far more to solve our problems in the future than any amount of State aid and further bureaucratic controls.  Vocationalism is the key.</P>
    <P>What can we do ourselves?  I believe that each section can make its contribution to the economic development ahead.  First, let us place at the head <Col N="243" /> of everything, the community.  We are all Irishmen first&mdash;the community or the taxpayer.  The taxpayer at present is called on to pay, to provide the money for subsidies both to agriculture and to industry.  The taxpayer's natural reaction is: Why should he? We must show the taxpayer why he has to pay those subsidies.  We must make him feel they are all part of a definite plan.  We need a five-year plan, with targets as to what must be produced in the various years.  We should set up these targets and show the taxpayer where we are going.  I have no doubt that the taxpayer will willingly make his contribution thereby making as big a contribution to the advance of the nation as the farmer who is working in the fields.</P>
    <P>Then we come to consider the contributions that the various sections of the community can make to the national five-year plan.  First, consider the agricultural community itself.  Everybody has stated in recent periods that our whole future depends upon agriculture, that it is our greatest single industry and that we must develop it fully before we can really hope to develop the industrial arm which we also wish.  The two may go hand in hand, but the development of agriculture is the primary necessity at present.  I now wish to give a few facts and figures in that connection because there seems to be a lot of very wrong thinking abroad at present on agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want to deal, first of all, with the idea that we are a great agricultural nation, or that we are producing such tremendous surpluses.  A few figures will show the magnitude of these surpluses. Last year we produced a record amount of butter&mdash;50,000 tons. We exported 15,000 tons of that to the British market.  The total imports into England last year were 360,000 tons. In other words, we supplied 4 per cent. of the British market.  New Zealand exported to England 150,000 tons&mdash;ten times what we supplied.</P>
    <P>We are sending the produce of half our pigs&mdash;that is, somewhere around 500,000 pigs&mdash;to England.  The total English consumption at present of pig <Col N="244" /> products is over 10,000,000.  Accordingly, we are supplying 5 per cent. of the market.</P>
    <P>Take beef production.  Our total potential here, if we kept our stores at home and fattened all these, is 300,000,000 lbs. of beef in the year&mdash; enough to feed 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 Englishmen or 2,000,000 Americans.  In other words, our present production is just a drop in the ocean.  It follows, therefore, that we have not the capacity within ourselves to create gluts on the foreign market.  If gluts come, it is New Zealand and others that will create them.  If New Zealand increases her production 10 or 15 per cent. that can create a glut.  The little increase we can achieve over the next few years, or, even with planning, in the next five or ten years, can never of its own accord create a glut.  It follows that the only way we can develop here is to produce as much as we can.  We have to export to live. Agriculture is our mainstay in exports.</P>
    <P>The question is raised: can we export economically?  There is no use in producing an article costing 3/- and having to sell it for 2/6.  We want to know if we can export agriculture economically.  We have the facts, in the Farm Survey, to answer this question. In that survey, you have the record of 600 farms out of 2,000&mdash;the top third of our farms&mdash;and how they work; then the middle third; and then the bottom third.  If we aimed at raising the general level up to the level of the top third of our farms at present, I submit that would be a reasonable target for, say, ten years.  This would give, on the Farm Survey figures, an increased production of about 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>An increase of 45 per cent. on last year's production of £180,000,000, at last year's prices, would amount to £82,000,000.  Perhaps, you say, we would not get that, selling abroad.  All right.  For argument's sake, assume that for exports abroad we must accept a price reduction of 25 per cent. on home prices, on the understanding that exporting abroad does not in any way affect the price we get for produce on the home market.  Let us agree, then, to take 25 per cent. less&mdash;and that is a very drastic figure, because <Col N="245" /> any extra cattle we produce are at present prices and many of the extra crops will be consumed at home. Therefore, if you take a reduction of 25 per cent., that gives a potential cash return of £60,000,000 for our increased exports.  If we go back to the Farm Survey we can calculate, based on the pattern of production on the upper third of our farms, what the increased costs are likely to be.  I will give just a few figures.  Fertilisers would cost an extra £3,000,000; machinery, depreciation and equipment would cost an extra £5,000,000; foodstuffs, which would probably be bought from the neighbours, would add up to another £10,000,000; seeds would cost another £1,500,000; other items would cost another £5,000,000.  The total cost would amount to £25,000,000, leaving a balance of £36,000,000 to reward the extra labour involved in the increased production.</P>
    <P>The Farm Survey also shows what extra labour would be required.  We find what we all know, that the better worked farms are employing more labour, between family and hired labour, than the other farms.  We find that the amount of labour required on that pattern would be 70,000 men and accordingly the additional 70,000 men would have a labour reward of £35,000,000&mdash;that is an average of £500 per worker engaged in the industry. I submit that is an attractive proposition at any industrial level. Remember that I took export prices at 25 per cent. under home prices. That gives the answer to the question, &ldquo;Can we produce?&rdquo;  Of course we can, if only we face the task.</P>
    <P>We might not realise the calculated increase of 70,000 additional labour force because advances in technology would probably cut it down somewhat. However, even if we employed half that, 35,000, that is a substantial increase in employment, when we consider that with our whole industrial efforts we have placed only 50,000 extra in employment over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>There is one snag, that more capital is required for this development.  One expects that.  The better farmer has more cows, more houses and more <Col N="246" /> machinery.  Again, from the survey we can actually estimate the additional capital required.  The figure is about £6 an acre, or something between £80,000,000 and £100,000,000. Even, I submit, expressed in that way, an industry capable of employing a sizable fraction of 70,000 people, capable of earning a labour income of £35,000,000, would be attractive, even if it required £100,000,000 capital.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, however, has one advantage over industry, it does not need all the capital before it begins to produce.  It is a gradual process; you put in a little this year and you get increased production, you put in more next year and so on.  With a factory it is different; you require to build the factory as a start.  I submit that the only practicable way to provide the capital for agriculture is to pay prices for agricultural produce that will enable the farmer to plough back.  That is the only efficient way of doing it, and it is the chief reason why we should pay high prices for our agricultural produce at home.  The higher prices we pay the better, because the quicker we can get our agriculture capitalised and thereby get the increased production of which agriculture is capable.  These are the simple economic facts of the case.</P>
    <P>These facts have to be explained clearly to the taxpayer; a five or ten year plan has to be set up; and the taxpayer has to feel that he is as much part of the increased effort as the farmer working in the field.  We all, at the end of each year, want to see that our production target for that year has been reached.  Remember that England set herself a target after the war to increase agricultural production by 50 per cent.  She kept a check on that target from year to year and she actually beat the target.  We can do the same.</P>
    <P>There is just one snag&mdash;I do not wish to go into it right now&mdash;it is this question of 70,000 workers on the land. This calls for turning back to agriculture the cream of our young men. In other words, it calls for the development of farm apprenticeship.  This has been very much in the news recently and many of us have been <Col N="247" /> working steadily at it for the past four or five years.  I do not wish to detain the Seanad on it now, as it would take far too long.  The principle in it is that any young lad who decides to make a career on the land must have a hope of one day becoming a farmer, if he is good enough.  Farm work has to be given the status that it merits, it has to be made a national service that a young lad is proud to undertake. Macra na Feirme has given status to the farmer.  Our young farmers now would not change places with any professional, but status has to be given to the farm work if we are to develop our agriculture.</P>
    <P>The other bottleneck is that of marketing.  That has to be dealt with also, if we are to succeed.  We can do it, but we have not tried up to the present.  I have to make reservations on that point.  We did not have the produce, or the continuity of supply, which would have enabled us to make a proper attempt at marketing.  We can face that task and, please God, with a united effort, we can succeed. It should be remembered that we are looking only for a couple of million people to buy our produce, we are not asking everybody in England to buy it. We can supply only a couple of million.  Even if we advanced spectacularly over the next five years, we could still supply only 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 people.  The population of America is increasing at present at 2,000,000 a year; therefore, we should not take a defeatist attitude.  We can sell and will sell, please God.  It merely demands courage, patience and originality.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of bureaucracy.  What contribution can bureaucracy make to our increased efforts?  Here I want to go on record as supporting Senator O'Donovan when he says that the Government cannot deny to its own employees that which has been granted to other employees. That is only simple justice.  I believe that increases should be conceded to those employees, if they are conceded generally to other employees.  However, we then have a right to ask from <Col N="248" /> these employees increased effort, just as all other employees getting wage increases are asked for increased effort. Now, what increased effort can we get from our officials?  The average number of hours worked by an official at present is something like 33 to 35.  I submit that, in our present national crisis, that is too low.  Many of us would be prepared to put in that amount voluntarily.  If an increase in wages is given, as it must be and should be given, the hours of working should be increased to at least 40 hours a week.  Large economies could be made by suspending recruitment to a great extent for the next three, four or five years.  I do not see any merit in providing jobs just for the sake of jobs.  If we lengthen the working week, we should not need that recruitment. If we cut out red tape we can get increased production from our civil servants just as County Cork is going to get it from its officials. But you may say that it is not fair to young men who are perhaps preparing for the Civil Service or similar positions. If such young men are material for the Civil Service, then they are quite capable and competent to follow a university course and they should get it.  If we are not prepared to give it to them, they can readily get it in an English university, though I think we should provide it for them.  In other words, we should offset the decreasing opportunities for our young men by increasing the opportunities for university and higher technological work.  Then we will create the team of young men which will be needed if we are to develop as an exporting nation.  You cannot simply double or treble your exports without a vast and well-trained organisation to handle those exports.</P>
    <P>I now come to Senator Murphy's question of workers involved.  I believe there should be production targets, but as a nation we must guarantee specifically that anybody producing more will earn more.  We have got to dispel the belief, which unfortunately is very often only too true, that a man can work himself out of a job.  That is the real reason why Irish labour is not more productive.  I for one cannot blame them.  It is for the same reason that <Col N="249" /> the farmers have not succeeded in giving greater production.  They feel that with increased production they will have less at the end than at the beginning. I submit that there is common ground between the industrialists and the farmers for that fear.  We can get spectacular achievements in production from our labour when we guarantee them an adequate reward.</P>
    <P>I next come to two or three other categories in the community.  We are all very concerned about the very large number of unemployed, not alone so much with the loss of money as the psychological effect which unemployment has on the individual.  The Government might well consider allowing any unemployed man to work two days a week without any reduction in his unemployment allowance.  It may be said that there will be abuses but there will always be some people who will take a mean advantage of any scheme we draw up.  Our task should be to do the greatest good for the greatest number and not merely to catch out the small percentage of people who will try to defraud any regulations or system which we bring in. With the unemployed we should also build for the future.  We should encourage them to attend trade classes in our vocational schools, and aid them so that they can make profitable use of their period of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In regard to teachers I think that they can make a tremendous contribution, and are making it, but they can make an even greater one by spreading enthusiasm for work, love of the country and a belief in the future of the country.  That is the special task of the teachers.  It is not demanded in the school syllabus but it is a work that they can do better than anybody else.  Teachers can play an ever-increasing part in the many organisations that are developing and in development committees.  We have professional personnel scattered all over the country and there is no town in which a proper development committee could not be set up to prepare development plans for their region.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the universities. They are already making a contribution. The hours which we work in <Col N="250" /> universities are often up to 12 and 1 o'clock at night.  It is not merely a question of the hours which are written down, it is the time which you have to devote to thinking, to research, to writing and to planning.  That is the special function of the university. A university is not merely a threadmill for lectures.  We have got to give lectures, but I submit that the real contribution that the university can make to the country is on a different level.  It is in training in leadership and in this field I submit that there is nothing more important than the adult educational movement.  Speaking for myself and my colleagues we are never happier than when returning home at 12 or 1 o'clock, having gone 40 or 50 miles to an adult educational centre. It is an education for my university colleagues and myself to go and meet the enthusiastic young men and women of the adult education movement, whether they are farmers, trade unionists or ladies.  At such centres lectures are on a topic like increased production for an hour, an hour and a half or perhaps two hours and then one stands up to a barrage of questions for another hour and then sits down to tea with the class.  That is as fine a contribution as we can make to the general community effort.  Again, of course, we can be of service to Irish industry, though our technological departments are very small.  But small and all as they are, our university departments are at all times eager and willing to give service.  Speaking for Cork, a very notable development has taken place there in the past few years where industrialists are rallying around to supply funds to the university for research and in return they are having their research problems investigated as far as we can do with our limited resources.</P>
    <P>I must conclude by returning to ourselves here in the Seanad.  What can we do?  Personally I feel that we have not done very much this term.  We have met only on five days.  I think it is a record of which we cannot be proud.  Admittedly it was not our fault as Bills were not coming up from An Dáil, but we should make work for ourselves.  We read of the tremendous work which is done by other Senates, <Col N="251" /> America for instance, where there are Senate Investigation Committees.  This Seanad could make a tremendous contribution in that regard by having Seanad inquiry committees.  The days of the standard commission are, perhaps, numbered.  Commissions are more or less in disrepute.  They take too long to accomplish anything and we have had too many bitter experiences of them in the past&mdash;the latest, of course, being the fiasco of the Milk Costings Commission.  That has shaken my faith in all forms of commissions.  I do not want to hold up the House on this matter now, but I will deal with it during the next term.  I will then ask for effective action from the Seanad.  It is something which we have to face up to, something that has to be fearlessly investigated and exposed if the Government is to regain the confidence of the agricultural community, or, should I say, the confidence, not alone of the agricultural community but of the community as a whole?  When the rest of the community see what has been done to agriculture, they will have no faith in any commission set up for any purpose. I do believe that if we only think we can make work for ourselves, work that will justify our existence here, and work that will make a very important contribution to the welfare of the nation.  I see no reason why we cannot achieve what the American Senate Committees have done.  Above all, we can instil confidence.  Let us constantly repeat the blessings we as a nation enjoy, and when we thank God for all we have got, then we should be in a proper frame of mind to plan for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate a certain amount of criticism has been levelled at the aid which the Government proposes to give to that sector of industry operated by private enterprise, and these industries have been contrasted unfavourably with semi-State bodies.  While I share the admiration which some of the former speakers have expressed for the semi-State bodies, I believe that many of the industries operated by private enterprise are also worthy of admiration. In regard to State participation <Col N="252" /> in industry, I think it is clear that there is a very limited field beyond which the State should not go.  I think the existing State bodies are examples of the type of industry in which the State should participate.  These are, generally speaking, industries which are required from a national point of view, which are necessary to the national economy, and are industries which private enterprise would not be likely to undertake.  There may be, in addition to the industries operated at the moment by the State, other industries in which the State may find it necessary to participate in future, but it is obvious there is a very wide field into which the State should not go. That being the case, it must also be obvious that private enterprise must cater for these industries in which the State should not participate.  If it is obvious that private enterprise must operate these industries, then private enterprise must be given the chance to operate them properly.</P>
      <P>In regard to the industries operated by private enterprise and which are likely to benefit from Government policy next year, the question arises: if they need aid, should they get the aid they require?  Is there any doubt what the Government should do if it appears clear to them&mdash;of course, they may be wrong&mdash;that these industries need aid of one kind or another, whether financial aid or aid by way of protectionist policy?  If that aid is withdrawn or withheld, then it seems most likely these industries will collapse. If they do not actually collapse, they will do something which, in present circumstances, is almost as bad.  They will fail to expand; they will fail to get into the export market, which is a very important requirement of industry at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position facing the Government is one of deciding whether they will give the aid which appears to be necessary, or whether they will withhold that aid.  I do not think anyone could quarrel with the decision of the Government to give that aid, if it appears necessary to them that they should give it.  Is anyone going to stand over the consequences of not giving that aid?  If industries do not get the help <Col N="253" /> they require, the almost certain consequences will be emigration, unemployment and disimprovement in the balance of payments.  That is the decision which the Government have to make, whether to avoid these things or to let them occur, and I believe that the Government are right in giving the help which they propose to give to private enterprise and to industries generally.</P>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made with the alleged inconsistency in the attitude of industry, the alleged inconsistency that in so far as, on the one hand, they want to be independent and, on the other hand, they want to be dependent on the Government in many respects.  In considering that problem, it must be admitted that industry is, to a certain extent, inconsistent in that respect, but I think it is necessary to get the matter into proper perspective.  It is important to realise that the State gets a much bigger contribution, that industry gives a far bigger contribution to the State than the State has ever given, or is ever likely to give, to industry.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that industry would be quite happy to carry on without State intervention, if the State were willing to leave industry entirely to itself&mdash;I mean if the State were willing to allow industry to use all its profits for expansion and for getting into the export market.  I think it follows that, if the State takes as much as it does in the way of profits, rates and various other exactions, industry is handicapped. It is only fair that, in special circumstances, industry should expect a certain amount of State aid.</P>
    <P>Industries in this country are in a special position as compared with most other countries because most of them have been established during the past 20 or 30 years.  In other countries, industries were established in the last century when taxes were very much lower, when national and international restrictions were very much fewer, and when costs of production were much lower.  They were able in those circumstances to build up very large reserves and the industries in some of these countries, established for one or two centuries, are able to meet the <Col N="254" /> vicissitudes which face them at the present day, and are able to find the money to expand, to meet the special problems and the expansion necessary.</P>
    <P>They are able to find the money to meet the special problems and expenses necessary if exports are to be established, but it is very difficult with most of the industries in this country which have been established, as I say, only 20 to 30 years, and which have had no opportunity of building up reserves, and consequently are not able to meet the special circumstances facing them to-day.  They are not able to meet the necessity of expending out of their own profits and reserves the very large sums which will be required to explore the export markets and compete in them effectively.  Consequently, I think the State is quite right, and if it requires industry to expand, must give the aids which it is proposed to give during the coming year.</P>
    <P>The two biggest problems of to-day are unemployment and the necessity of balancing our payments, of having more exports.  In both these fields, industry can play a very large part.  It is safe to say that only in industry can we get a really big increase in employment, because in agriculture the more efficient agriculture becomes&mdash;I will not say, the less employment will be provided but certainly as it becomes more efficient and expands, it does not appear to give more employment. Consequently, it is to industry that we must look particularly for an increase in employment.</P>
    <P>All the expansion and improvement in exports and in the balance of payments position are things which depend very much on an expansion of industry, and the State should consequently give the aids proposed to be given.  The Government may in the future extend its participation in industry in a few respects, but in the meantime private enterprise will have to carry the main burden of industrial expansion, and consequently private enterprise is entitled to the aid which is proposed to be given to it during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the attractions of the debate on the Central Fund <Col N="255" /> Bill is that it gives us more or less a rehearsal of the forthcoming debates on the Estimates and on the Budget. In some ways, it is rather like a review of the films.  When a film is reviewed in the papers, nothing you say or do can alter the film.  It is already in circulation, and that is that.  The most you can hope to do is to influence the producers of the next film, the people working on the script, the renters and people like that, with regard to forthcoming entertainments.  In these debates and in this particular one, we have had the advantage of an expert able to survey our economic situation, a survey which, in the words of the Americans, would be worth paying money to hear.  We have had statements of the interests of various important aspects of the activity of our country, put forward by experts who have very carefully prepared the subject, and I do not propose to try to sharpen any of the points or drive them home.</P>
      <P>I do not think that need be done. The points have been very well presented.  I should, however, mention in passing the point made by Senator Quinlan, that we should get more committee work as a Seanad.  I emphasised that point myself in the early days years ago, but I do not think it was ever followed up.  Here we have an expert body of reasonably intelligent people and we could do quite a lot of useful work on particular things.</P>
      <P>However, the only thing I might refer to as a thing which I do not think has been properly approached or developed in this debate is: where is the extra money to come from?  If you will allow me to take the very stale simile of the ship of State proceeding on its leisurely way, it is a galley and at the moment rather a leaky one.  We are working hard at the oars to increase production, and at the same time baling out, and we do not lack encouragement by the statesmen at the helm and on the bridge and in other parts of the ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us survey for the moment the different aspects of this vessel we all <Col N="256" /> occupy.  It leaks.  The leaks are in State expenditure.  State expenditure is essential, of course, but the leaks are partly State extravagances and partly State expenditure on the wrong things.  These matters have been touched on during the past few days, and I do not intend to comment further on them, except to remind the House of the story of the Scotsman who saved a lot of money through having a sixpence which had the letter Y stamped on it.  Every time he thought of making a substantial purchase he took it out and looked at it and saw the letter reminding him &ldquo;Y spend it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the beginning of our Book of Estimates, I should like to see the letter Y in front of each Estimate, reminding us to examine how far each Estimate represents the need of our country&mdash;to equate what we cannot go below and what becomes luxury spending.</P>
    <P>With regard to the oarsmen on the ship of State, and their production, it is all very well to talk about increased production, but increased production of what?  We have to be far more critical of what we produce in view of the changing times and the fact that many things we produce cannot really compete against the more expert European market.</P>
    <P>We are producing people for export. Emigration is being touched upon, and will be touched upon, but I think it requires a realistic approach, because as a mother country, we have been exporting right through our history, back to the time when St. Brendan, wisely or unwisely, discovered America. It is possible to find out what our export figure should be in relation to the population and wealth of the country&mdash;what is the export level below which it is rather dangerous and we are losing more blood than we can afford.  There is a level when it becomes disastrous.  Our present rate is becoming a haemorrhage and threatens us with disaster.  But when we talk about emigration, do not let us imagine that we will ever have a country in which there is no emigration. That is not our vision of the Irish nation.  We have always been exporting people and we have been <Col N="257" /> very proud of them, and they come back to us in various ways.</P>
    <P>The other thing is the question of baling the ship as hard as we can; but we have a very leaky baler.  We earn a certain amount of money and a certain amount of money is taken from us.  One thing which I submit the Minister ought to do in all fairness, which would go a considerable way to satisfying the unfortunate one in 14 of us who has to pay income-tax, and that is to have some relationship between the cost of living and the personal allowances.  When we realise the claims that are made by various worthy organisations who are seeking increased wages, we are at the same time ignoring the fact that we continue a cost-of-living allowance, that is supposed to be related to our minimum requirements, which has become practically static.  The cost-of-living and personal allowance figures certainly require revision, if we are to be fairly treated. Now when you earn so much money, so much is taken from you under the income-tax that it is grotesque.  One can only hope that the commission at present considering the entire question of income-tax laws will arrive at a speedy and merciful conclusion before we are all disheartened and simply feel ourselves as slaves to the State machine.</P>
    <P>I do not want to close those fortuitous remarks without suggesting one or two ways in which we might make money.  We are a historic country and are well known.  I would suggest the we could sell postage stamps. have produced of the stamps.  Some really well patriots are really well known but they are better known after a stamp is issued.  We go on circulating those stamps.  What we want are some really attractive Irish views.  We want pictures of our country well drawn and well painted.  Furthermore, we should issue the stamp only for a certain time so that people will say: &ldquo;If I do not buy the stamp of the Colleen Bawn rock in Killarney, it will go out of issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have only got to consider the very large incomes made by so many European countries in their continual issue of stamps.  Stamp collecting is <Col N="258" /> very much on the increase.  Here is really one very good way in which we can respectfully and creditably increase our national income by producing the right sort of stamp over a short period.  We can put ourselves on the stamp collectors' map as well as on the economic map of Europe.</P>
    <P>This has been a most interesting and representative debate.  I do not think it is necessary to emphasise the importance of education.  That has been adequately done by several speakers. I feel that, when the main fireworks start later, we will want to have our guns well trained on the target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to cover a few points which were not stressed in this debate and to answer some questions which were posed by some of the previous speakers.  One matter which has occupied my mind for quite a long time and which has been touched upon by Senator Quinlan is an alteration of the land tenure system in Ireland.  At the present moment, it is extrem difficult for the second son of or for a progressive farm labourer to acquire land.  If farms could be leased and rented, as they are it would other countries, I er of virile enbring in a large agricultural economy trants into our agricultural economy every year the history of land tenure</P>
      <P>We know the hiostory of land tenure in Ireland and the reasons for the development of the 11-months system. It is now over 50 years since our land legislation was more or less finalished in this country.  The problems we had then are not with us now.  Therefore we could look at the question again.  I think that the entrance of progressive elements into any phase of our economy is good.  We are, by the present system, almost precluding everyone except people of large means. That does not help towards the wider distribution of property or towards progress in an industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan also mentioned the marketing of Irish produce.  I was glad to hear him say that one of the reasons why we were behind in the marketing of Irish produce is that we had not the produce to market.  Many of our people who are marketing an increased <Col N="259" /> amount are marketing it effectively.  I happen to be a member of an international body and I often meet Danes, Swedes, Dutch and others who are supposed to be extraordinarily progressive. They have experience in doing the job because they had such large volumes of produce to deal with over long periods.  We have had some experience, but it is not as continuous an experience as our friends, the Danes, the Dutch and the various Scandinavian peoples had.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties that I see in looking at the Irish economy is that we have <i>per capita</i> only approximately £55 per head as against £100 in Britain.  Anyone who does not like what we can afford to give him in this country is inclined to abuse our present institutions and say: &ldquo;Look how much better I can do in other places.&rdquo;  I wonder how can we redress that balance?  I believe that we in Ireland should try to get value for money.  If everyone, from the managing director of a firm down to the humblest worker, from a Minister of State to the most recent entrant to the Civil Service, could all have their remuneration and the cost of everything they buy reduced by 10 per cent., we would all be far better off, because we are exporting a large quantity of agricultural produce which commands the world price.  We would get the same amount for our exports if we had better value for the money we have at home.  We would be better off.  Even if the value of our money could be improved by some mild form of State subsidy, it might be better.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government are well aware of the problems.  The technical advisers are aware of the problems and the strains imposed on our economy by overtaxation.  Senator O'Brien crystallised this yesterday when he said that we had a financial superstructure on an economic foundation which was not able to support it. I believe that was a very true statement. It is a warning.  We cannot in our economy do more than we have the resources to do.</P>
    <P>To my mind, there was much food for thought in an address given last <Col N="260" /> March by a professor of economics in Queen's University to the Irish Association in Dublin.  I wish to quote briefly from that article.  He is making a suggestion as to what we ought to do here in Government, and he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to me probable that a concentration of Government assistance on fewer schemes of high economic priority would produce better results.  In particular, I have great doubts about schemes undertaken because of their high employment content that may give work to ten men now at the cost of having undone the things which would give work to 100 in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for that because pressure is being exerted on the Government to give palliatives here and there for various things; but I would exhort everyone interested in our economy to read Professor Charles F. Carter's article read before the Irish Association in Dublin last March. Senator Skeffington suggested that private enterprise was living and working here in ideal conditions and that we were falling down on the job and that we should have something like what he called &ldquo;democratic socialism&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid of socialism of any sort because I believe it leads to a limitation of freedom and that it does not build up men to their full stature.  If you can give people property and if you can give them the ways of having self-reliance through property in industry or agriculture, then you are making good citizens and they will be the main bulwark against socialism.  I believe socialism is the road to serfdom.  Anywhere it came, the freedom of the individual was limited.  In Germany they had national socialism.  Hitler was the greatest socialist and the greatest popular leader in our times, but what did he give us but Dachau and the various other concentration camps, because he wanted to impose his belief on the people and to give them what he called a &ldquo;planned economy&rdquo;.  In Russia, the freedom of the individual is completely and entirely unrecognised.  It may be called a communist State, but it had <Col N="261" /> its genesis in socialism.  Socialist fellow-travellers praise it and certainly they praise it against any form of capitalist economy.</P>
    <P>I want to give some illustration, which I believe is true, of the difficulties which private enterprise is suffering from in this country.  In the first place, take State-sponsored companies. They are assisted by the State.  The State helps them to get money by a public issue and by subscriptions.  They are allowed, if you like, to trade unfairly under private enterprise.  They say that these companies are brought into existence because they are providing a service that private enterprise could not reasonably be expected to provide.  I agree.</P>
    <P>In the town in which I live, there was a very progressive firm of electrical contractors.  They purchased a large premises and renovated them.  They made the premises one of the finest electrical sales shops in the provinces. Very recently the E.S.B. purchased a premises in the same street and they are now showing electrical equipment in that premises.  They have lights burning there all night.  I am sure it costs pounds per day to light and heat those E.S.B. premises.  Outside the premises they have strips of electric heating which no commercial firm could afford to have.  On a cold night, anyone passing by can stand outside the premises and warm himself.  In that way, people are attracted by the powerful glare of lights inside the premises.</P>
    <P>I contend that the sale of electric appliances is one aspect of E.S.B. activity that could be allowed to private enterprise.  I happened to be at a corporation meeting in Clonmel the other evening.  Many members of the corporation commented on the unfair advantage conferred on the E.S.B., as against private industry, particularly in this form of trading.  I suggest the E.S.B. could use their sales shops to display their electrical equipment and encourage the use of that equipment, but that they could suggest to the people who come in that these items can be purchased from private traders operating in the towns.  I suggest the <Col N="262" /> E.S.B. could use these premises as a sales promotion device rather than sell the equipment themselves to the people.  Furthermore, the E.S.B. use the Irish radio station.  Ordinary people cannot afford to make use of that medium for advertising purposes. In a way, it is an advantage which the State-sponsored company has over private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to public companies and examine the advantages they have over the private individual.  The shareholders of Irish-owned public companies get a special reduction in the tax on their dividends.  They also get tax-free exports on anything over and above the datum year.  The private company does not get any tax exemption on their dividends.  They pay the full standard rate of tax.  They get the exemption on exports when they comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>The private individual will get no reduction on his income-tax, although he is the most typical Irish citizen.  He will get no tax relief on exports.  When the owner of the firm dies, he has to bear the full burden of death duties. They often weigh very heavily on a family business or a family firm.  Death duties tend to arrest the development of a family business and family firm in a very special way and anybody who has had experience in that connection knows the position well.</P>
    <P>I know of a family business which was impeded in progress for a decade as a result of death duties.  The firm is now giving large employment.  That industry would have developed much sooner but for the incidence of death duties.  Another objection I have to that iniquitous tax is that it is used as revenue.  If it were put into a special pool and used to assist industry, for instance, and only that, there would be some virtue in that tax. It is purely inflationary at present. Frequently, securities or stock have to be realised or a firm has to be let go without the money for production which it would otherwise have.  That money goes into the coffers of the State and is used as revenue.  It is spent, maybe, to pay salaries to officials, which is causing inflationary pressure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> I understand we are to have a television station in this country.  I was told this morning that the rate for advertising on that service will be £1,000 a minute.  Only the subsidiaries of big international companies will be in a position to advertise on that service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anticipating things, but I just wanted to say it, in passing.  I think the points I have covered in my few remarks have not been made here before.  I wish to show, in no uncertain manner, that industry here is not the pampered creature which Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggests it is and suggests should be removed so that we would have a more enlightened and progressively-directed economy.</P>
      <P>I am interested in people.  I believe that, if you allow the man working for himself&mdash;whether he be a farmer or a business man&mdash;to progress, he will develop his mental talents and all these things which God gave him, if he has economic strength.  He should be the first charge on the State.  It should be an overriding consideration of the State that he be made strong, independent and free.  He is the bulwark of all the virtues we would like to have in this country.</P>
      <P>I suggest, then, that the private company ought to be the next which we would support, with the public company and the State-sponsored company last.  We have reversed the natural order of things.  It ought to be the object of the Government to support these things.</P>
      <P>Another point which Senator Sheehy Skeffington made yesterday was that there was no fundamental difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I wondered why he should raise that question.</P>

      <P>I am sorry.  You, Sir, were not in the Chair when it was being discussed, but I shall not proceed <Col N="264" /> with it, if you say so.  I want to say on that, as I made the point, that the most successful Governments have been those where there have not been fundamental differences, as, for instance, in America and Britain in the last century.  I would refer to the statement of Sir Stafford Cripps who said: &ldquo;We will scramble the eggs in such a way that no one will be allowed to unscramble them again.&rdquo;  It means that you have a revolution with every change of Government.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like the Minister to consider the points I have made, particularly about private enterprise, the private trader and the farmer, and how they are affected adversely by the system of taxation which is imposed in this State and the reliefs and privileges which are given to the larger bodies rather than the smaller and individual groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prompted to intervene in this debate by the opening remarks of Senator Burke.  He said&mdash; but unfortunately he did not continue &mdash;that he would like to see some change in the land tenure conditions in Ireland.  He mentioned the leasing or renting of land.  This is a question which I have thought a lot about, for this reason.  I see land let year after year on conacre, or on the 11-months system, and obviously deteriorating.  I believe there is power in the Land Acts to lease or rent land for longer periods, say, for ten years.  If that is so, I should like it to be more publicly known.  If it is correct, we might produce some form of a cheap lease under which a person could let land for a short term, say ten to 15 years.  I am informed that one-third of the ownership of land in this part of the country is held by widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed also that the average age of farmers is something over 60.  I do not say a farmer over 60 is not capable of farming his land, but you find land like that being set in conacre year after year, possibly until a child grows up.  When the child becomes old enough to farm the land, the land will be practically useless, because those taking it in conacre will <Col N="265" /> not spend money on manures.  If men could get that land for ten or 12 years, they would be prepared to take care of it and keep it in good heart.  On the other side of the question we have the man who is taking the land, these farmers' sons who are searching for land and taking it on conacre.  They cannot afford to spend, nor do they see any use in spending money on it if they have no guarantee of getting that land the following year.  That would be simplified if there is legal power to prepare a form of lease for, say, ten years. If that were then publicised, the land would be put to greater use.</P>
      <P>The speech made by Senator Quinlan was one of the few constructive speeches we had here to-day.  He suggested we could get a much greater output from the land we are using at present.  He gave figures and he suggested a ten-year period.  In order to do that, we need greater education on agriculture and that depends on an agricultural bias in our primary schools.</P>

      <P>I intend only to dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; of a few statements made here in the course of the debate.  I should like to say at the start that the new trend shown in the Book of Estimates this year is certainly welcomed by the country.  The Book of Estimates shows that some progress has been made by the Government in their efforts to halt the rise in expenditure.  Under the two Coalition Governments, expenditure increased by over £30,000,000.  Compared with last year's figures current expenditure is almost £4,000,000 less, although much greater help is being given to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had some talk about the Irish language.  Both Senator Hayes and Senator Ó Siochfhradha referred to the inquiry which the Taoiseach agreed to institute, into the position of the language and the progress <Col N="266" /> made, or not made, according to the view taken by those who consider the matter.  I spoke in the Seanad debate on 30th January and expressed the hope that any such inquiry as was proposed in the motion should take in, not only the schools and universities and what was being done there, but also public life, trade and commerce, sport and entertainment, and the Church.  It is in those spheres that the whole weakness of the language drive lies.  Therefore, I am pleased to hear the Senators' argument with most of which I find myself in agreement and with the pleas in which I find myself in complete support.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is intended to widen the scope of the inquiry, as was suggested, so as to take in the whole field; and it only remains for me, on my own behalf, and, I am sure, on behalf of the Seanad, to express our good wishes to those who will constitute the committee and the hope that they will complete the very important task that will be assigned to them, as quickly and as speedily and as effectively as it can be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggested that we should have a referendum on the language.  I do not know whether he realises that not one but many referenda were held on this question.  No later than 1st July, 1937, a plebiscite of the people was taken on the Constitution under which we live, one Article of which relates to the Irish language.  This plebiscite followed general election after general election since 1918.  There is no question whatever of any referendum on the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I suggested a referendum on the question as to whether Irish should be an optional subject in the schools, not on the language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I hope Senator Sheehy Skeffington will go before the inquiry that is to be set up and make his case in regard to matters of that nature.  I am sure he will be given every facility to argue the points on which he has oft-times spoken here in regard to the language.  I can <Col N="267" /> assure him, however, that there is no doubt whatever in my mind that the vast majority of the people will not tolerate any interference whatsoever with the teaching of Irish in the schools, or any indirect attempt to eliminate it as a subject which all children must take as a matter of national pride and prestige.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have been asked time after time and their views have been well expressed in the ballot-boxes.  I found myself getting a little excited when I was listening to Senator Quinlan describing to us the thrill he got on St. Patrick's Day on hearing Micheál Ó Hehir broadcasting greetings from Ireland to the Irish people in far-flung parts of the world. I was waiting for Senator Quinlan to say that the broadcast was, of course, made by courtesy of <i>Radio Diffusion Francaise</i> and that we were able to reach those far-flung exiles with commentaries on the national games only by reason of the fact that a foreign broadcasting organisation extended the courtesy of its facilities to us to do so.</P>
      <P>I thought he might go on to develop the point that we are in the humiliating position that if the President of Ireland, or the Taoiseach, desired to give a St. Patrick's Day message to our exiles in any part of the world, or on any other occasion, national festival or otherwise, he could do so only through the facilities afforded by the British Broadcasting Corporation, or by some equally powerful radio transmitting station as I have mentioned. I thought that Senator Quinlan would then express regret that the shortwave transmitter was one of the casualties suffered by the people under the first Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>As it is, we are in the position of being the only small nation without a voice on the shortwaves. I was particularly interested in Senator Murphy's remarks, and listening to him, one would imagine this was the only country in the world cursed with unemployment.  It is no harm to remark that, last year, according to official statistics, the numbers out of work increased in quite a number of countries&mdash;Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and the Six Counties.  In these Twenty-Six Counties, however, the number out of work decreased by over 8,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last year of the Coalition, which Senator Murphy supported, the number out of work increased by some 23,000.  Now, even Senator Murphy, I am sure, able propagandist as he is, will agree that it takes some time to complete the reversal of a slump of this magnitude, but the Government&mdash;and I use the phrase with great glee&mdash;have got cracking&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if Senator Murphy will read the statistics sent to him through the post every week, he will find that the figures for unemployment week after week now, thank God, are decreasing and that more people are going back to work. It will take time and it is a big problem, and nobody can be satisfied with the size of it, and with the comparatively slow progress made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an admission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but nevertheless progress is being made.  The trend has been reversed and we hope that, by the end of this year, the position will have improved considerably and that as a consequence of new industrial <Col N="269" /> development, thousands more workers will find employment here.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy also spoke of social welfare benefits.  I have great sympathy with his plea for increased benefits for certain categories of people, but I did not learn from the Senator where the money was to come from to pay for these suggested increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not because the Senator was in order in making one suggestion, that the Labour Party would agree to an increase in taxation for that purpose.  I am just wondering would they.  I have a recollection of their attitude on many occasions in the Dáil and of the completely contrary attitude adopted by them on the hustings and in the country, when it came to accepting responsibility for new taxation for any purpose.  I should like to know whether the Senator could get the Party, of which he is such a distinguished member, to make an official statement to that effect, that they would be prepared to stand over extra taxation for any purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it very much.  I am glad, however, that the Senator saw some light through the darkness and admitted that there are signs that our economy is beginning to pick up.  Perhaps it might be no harm to tell him that he is not alone in that view.  It might also cheer up Senator Baxter, who said that the country is in the doldrums and that something must be done to bring it out of that state.  Senator Donegan was on the same theme.  For the benefit of the three of them, who do not appear to believe as we believe, I might recall the conclusion reached a few days ago by the president of the strongest trade union in the country, Mr. John Conroy, President of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, who was speaking at the annual general meeting of the Waterford branch.  He is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 24th March as saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" />&ldquo;There are indications of some little improvement in the country's economic position.  I hope we have hit rock bottom in this latest grave economic depression.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very optimistic to say it hit rock bottom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is optimistic and it was quoted deliberately to show that Mr. Conroy realised what apparently the Senators who spoke on behalf of the previous Government did not realise, that they had created an economic depression the consequences of which it is going to require an enormous effort to surmount.  The Government are tackling that job and it is no small job, and now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and now light has been seen and we are moving out of the darkness away from the depression. It is as well to remind Senators what caused that depression and why it is that it is only now, after 12 months of hard work by the Fianna Fáil Government, that some light does appear in the darkness.  In case that might be considered as favourable to the Government, my next quotation is from the <i>Statist</i>, a reputable financial London review, from the issue of 23rd February.  It cannot be accused of being pro anybody here.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recent political and economic developments in Ireland show that the country is emerging from the depression of the past decade....The year-end trading figures come as a tonic for a country which has become almost inured to the chronic postwar disequilibrium in the balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter, in the course of his speech, took occasion <Col N="271" /> to admonish Senator Lenihan for referring to the past.  The only comment I should like to make on that is to suggest that he could more properly have addressed his remarks on this point to his Fine Gael colleague, Senator L'Estrange, who has again interrupted me, and who has made political bitterness and insult his stock in trade in the Seanad since I came into it.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter bemoans the fate of the local authorities who, he says, are having a difficult time trying to maintain essential services. I do not think the position is as tough for them as it was in the last year of the Coalition Government which he supported.  He will no doubt remember that the local authorities could not get the grants due to them under housing schemes.  Incidentally, neither could private builders, and it was very tough on the local authorities at that time having to keep essential services going.  Surely he must know that so bad had the position become for local authorities, and for one in particular, that the Government owed one local authority almost £500,000? Does Senator Baxter not also know the sleight of hand methods adopted under the direction of the Minister for Finance in 1956 by which the local authorities were authorised to spend money they had not got on roads, in advance of grants which they might not get the following year?  If he thinks the difficulties at present are anything like the difficulties which faced the local authorities in those times, then I am afraid he is underestimating the position completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford and Senator Quinlan both spoke with regard to the provision made for the universities.  I am in full sympathy with their pleas and I am quite certain that the Government appreciates the need, and will do its part when the money is available. I had a feeling, however, listening to Senator Quinlan and Senator Stanford&mdash;I think Senator Sheehy <Col N="272" /> Skeffington also referred to it&mdash;that the existing grants to the universities here could give better results, could go further, and be of greater advantage to the community if some way could be found to eliminate the duplication which exists at present, and to ensure more co-ordination between the universities and colleges.  I think Senator Stanford, Senator Quinlan, Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Fearon also, would be doing a very valuable work if they could find some way of using their influence to improve that position, and to see whether there could not be more co-ordination of effort and less duplication between the universities.</P>

      <P>When I am speaking of this matter of education, I should like to recall also that the Coalition, as one of its dying kicks, cut the grants to the vocational education committees by 6 per cent.  I am very glad to note that these Estimates provide that the grants will be restored and paid in full this year.  I am also glad to note that the Government will spend almost £250,000 more this year on school buildings.  As a consequence, I hope it will be able to catch up on the arrears of 1956 which were due, in case Senators have forgotten, to the fact that the Coalition Government shut down on school building, in exactly the same way as they shut down on housing in the last six months of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also said that he would have to refer back to the past to find any difference between the present Government and the Parties which constituted the Coalition Government.  I think he must be a very innocent man if he has not realised that there are very essential differences, the most important of which, germane to the present Bill, is the little word Senator Quinlan toyed with for a while&mdash;confidence.  There was no confidence in the Coalition Government and that was what was badly needed in this country.  There is confidence in the present Government and that is the great essential difference which we <Col N="273" /> do not have to travel back into the past to see.</P>
    <P>Before the general election, it had become almost impossible to obtain money for capital development.  The last national loans floated by the Coalition Government were a failure. Now with Fianna Fáil as a stable and energetic Government, confidence has been restored and, even in the past 12 months, two successful Savings Bonds issues were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>A national loan and an E.S.B. loan have been successfully floated.  That means, in other words, that the people believe in this Government, believe they can trust them, believe they are going to do a good job and they are prepared to lend them their money.  They were not prepared to lend money to the Coalition.</P>
      <P>I might also mention, since I am on that topic and since some of the Senators referred to it, that the first Coalition Government from 1948 to 1951 piled up deficits totalling over £61,000,000.  Fianna Fáil had reduced that in three years to £5,500,000, but unfortunately the second Coalition arrived, and when Fianna Fáil took over last year they found it was over £17,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter also which might be of interest to Senator O'Brien, whose address I listened to with great attention, that is, the amount to be paid in principal and interest on loans increased from £4,500,000 when the first Coalition took over in 1948 to over £10,000,000 by the time they left office in 1951, and when they were thrown out last year after a second term, the amount had gone up to £17,000,000.  That is why confidence, of which Senator Quinlan spoke, now rests in the Government elected last March.  The people have confidence now that the country will go ahead, that the Government will make decisions they are prepared to stand over, that they know where they are going and what they are doing.  The people are prepared to trust this Government.  I have no doubt whatever that the Estimates <Col N="274" /> which are enshrined in this Central Fund Bill will be appreciated and approved by the people, who know that a genuine effort is now being made to curb expenditure, to ensure efficiency and to give the best possible value to the people for the money expended by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOBrien" hpid="Mrs. Connolly O'Brien Mrs. Connolly O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Connolly O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the emigration problem to which I wish to direct the attention of the Government.  I as a town dweller feel rather diffident in raising this aspect, and I had hoped that other speakers, more learned and more expert in the subject than I am, would have mentioned it.  The aspect of emigration on which I wish to speak is the emigration of small farmers from Ireland.  I visited down the country a few months ago and was horrified when I was taken for a drive all around the countryside to find the driver every now and then saying: &ldquo;No one lives in that house now,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They have gone away from that house now,&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is only the old woman living in that house now,&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is only the old pair living there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All through the drive, that was his comment, and to my question, &ldquo;Where have they all gone?&rdquo;  the answer was either Birmingham or Manchester or Coventry or London.  It had a dreadfully depressing effect on me, because it conjured up a vision of the whole countryside depleted of its farming community, with no youth growing up to take the place of the older farmers, with no young family to take the place of the old people when they died, and the whole farming community of this country growing smaller and smaller, and all the inherited tradition and love and understanding of the land being lost to us and to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where have these people gone? They have gone to English manufacturing centres, and as a result our farming community are being turned into English factory hands, and our potential farmers of the future, their families and all their inherited knowledge and love and understanding of the land are being lost not only to us but to a world that is crying out for more food and for the knowledge and <Col N="275" /> understanding of the land that these families could give.</P>
    <P>It gave me, a town dweller, a real understanding of the problem.  It does not seem right to adopt a general policy on emigration for the country. We will have to adopt a policy about emigration and to assess the problem and its solution from the point of view of the small farmers, so as to prevent the loss to our country of all that necessary knowledge and inherited tradition and love of farming. I know that the small farmers are considered uneconomic and that they cannot get a living based on our present standards.  No one would dare suggest that the small farmer should go back to the standards of the small farmer's family of the past, or give up an iota of the amenities they have achieved as a result of their work.  But something must be done.</P>
    <P>If agriculture is, as everybody is willing to agree, the most important industry we have and our country must stand or fall by it, some policy must be found to save our small farmers for the benefit of the country, something which will change the situation we find to-day, that when a small farmer hears that a neighbour is thinking of giving up and emigrating, overshadowing his sense of regret at the loss of a good neighbour will be the greedy thought that here is a chance to add some more acres to his own and give himself a greater chance of being able to stay on in the farming community in which his father and himself have lived.  We must find some way of preventing the new possessor of divided land from letting his land or selling it to a bigger farmer with more capital.  It seems to me that in that way we are helping to create bigger and bigger farms and also helping to recreate in Ireland the evil of the big landlords.  Something must be done to prevent such a state, which is bringing about bigger and bigger holdings with a very few families and fewer and fewer people working on them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, reading, as I do, comments concerning agriculture and talking with people engaged in agriculture, that there is a dangerous tendency towards this increasing of big <Col N="276" /> holdings.  Greater productivity and efficiency is the great cry to-day, but if it is our aim, we must make sure that it will not be achieved at the cost of our small farming community and at the price of the loss of our population.</P>

      <P>I was stating that greater productivity and greater efficiency is the cry and the aim to-day in agriculture, that I believed it was correct that that should be so, but that we must make sure it is not achieved at the cost of our small farming community and at the price of their emigration and loss of population to the country.</P>
      <P>I believe that a country's population is a country's real wealth.  Without people, a nation cannot exist.  The life-blood of a nation is its population and there is no possibility of having a healthy nation, if we allow its lifeblood to drain away.  Greater efficiency and greater productivity are coming to be connected in the minds of the people with the use of machines.  It is a fact that, in small farms, there is very little manoeuvrability for machines, and farmers who cannot use machines are at a tremendous disadvantage. But surely there are sufficient expert minds in the country who can devise a method whereby they can achieve greater productivity, without lessening the number of men on the land.  It is long overdue, but our Government and the agricultural advisers to the Government should set themselves to the solution of this problem.</P>
      <P>It does not seem right to me to adopt a policy for agriculture which gives all the advantages to the big farmer.  If we are really anxious to keep our farming population at home, if a differential policy for farmers must be adopted, that differential should be to the advantage of the small farmer. I should say the efficient small farmer, for I have no wish that the Government should set a premium on inefficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great drain of emigration is a problem that has faced our Governments and is still crying for solution, but perhaps it might be possible to <Col N="277" /> find, through an agricultural policy, a solution to the emigration of our farming community.  I do not believe that giving voice to vague hopes will ever aid in the solution of this problem, so may I suggest to the Government that one way of making it possible for the small farming community to remain on the land would be co-operative farming? By that, I mean that the Government should consider favourably the idea that when two or three demesnes in one locality are due for division, these two or three demesnes should not be divided into uneconomic holdings but that they should be set up as large co-operative farms under the aegis of Macra na Feirme or Muintir na Tíre and worked co-operatively.</P>
    <P>I do not mean a State-owned farm or a collective farm.  I am utterly opposed to such a project because I do not believe that a farm can be worked from a desk in a Government building.  What I advocate is that the young farmers in the district who are looking for homes and farms of their own should be told that if they form a co-operative society among themselves and the smallholders in the locality they will be given the land as a whole to work co-operatively, and that the land of these demesnes will not be divided into uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>Such a farm, I believe, would appeal to the minds of our young farmers and farmers' sons, as well as to the minds of some of our older farmers.  It would appeal to the adventurous spirit of youth.  They would see in it a chance to stay on the land, to bring up their children on the land.  It would bring new life and hope to the farming community and bring a measure of prosperity and happiness to a small farming locality which now can see no future, save that of emigration.</P>
    <P>A scheme of this kind would take some working out.  Safeguards would have to be devised, but it can be done and it has been done successfully in Ireland.  Let no one think that I am referring to ancient history such as the Ralahine venture.  I am referring to such a co-operative scheme as was undertaken and worked successfully during those bad farming days at the time of the economic war, when the <Col N="278" /> Ulster Bank leased lands they held in Westmeath to a group of small farmers and landless men who worked the land, paid for all the labour on it at the local rate, yet showed a profit at the end of the year, and gave up the prospect only when, despite appeals, the land was taken over and divided by the Government.  The measure of their feeling for the co-operative project was given by one old small farmer who, although he had received an addition through the dividing of the land, remarked: &ldquo;Why could they not leave us as we were?  They were the happiest years of my life working with my neighbours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If these men could work happily and successfully a co-operative farm during those bad years, I cannot help but think it could be done to-day, when things are so much better for farmers, and that such farms could do much to hold our youth to the land and their young and receptive minds could do much to heighten our efficiency and productivity.  Such projects would help to stop the flight from the land, halt the flow of emigration by our small farmers' families.  New homes and families would spring up to take the place of the derelict farmhouse and the population on the land would begin to rise again.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to quote a poem which we all learned when we were going to school.  You all know the one I mean, &ldquo;Ill fares the land...&rdquo; so I shall not quote it.  But do not let us, in the vision of greater efficiency and productivity, lose sight of our people.  If it can only be achieved by immense holdings and machines and with fewer and fewer families on the land, then that, I suggest, is too high a price to pay for greater efficiency and greater productivity.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government that they consider the advisability of announcing that they are prepared to consider favourably the idea of co-operative farms run by Macra na Feirme and Muintir na Tíre in the different areas.  When they make that announcement, they will, I am sure, be overwhelmed with applications from people to whom that will bring hope and offer the possibility of remaining on the land of their fathers <Col N="279" /> and making it as fully productive as it should be.</P>

      <P>The Central Fund Bill is usually the first indication of the intended financial and economic policy of the Government.  So far in this debate, we have heard nothing&mdash;certainly very little&mdash;about that.  It seems to be one of the secrets of the Fianna Fáil Party.  To-day, we heard nothing from Fianna Fáil Senators but condemnation and misrepresentation of the work of the inter-Party Government, while at the same time they tried to claim credit, and did claim credit, because the year 1957 proved a reasonably good year.  We had huge exports, but, remember, all that was due to the work of the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs, who was Acting-Minister for Agriculture last autumn, told Deputy Corry, when he asked for an increase in the price of wheat and farm produce to encourage production, that no increase at that time would make any material difference because the farmers had their minds made up and their plans laid for the year 1957.  We all know that the inter-Party Government took courageous, although unpopular, action in 1956 to put the ship of State back on an even keel and Fianna Fáil are now claiming the credit for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a good deal to-day about broken promises.  The Fianna Fáil Party in that respect remind me of the father with the bandy-legged boy. When he was sending the boy to school, he said to him: &ldquo;Paddy, you are very bandy and if you happen to get into a row with another boy start calling him &lsquo;Bandy-legs, Bandy-legs&rsquo;, before he gets the opportunity of calling it to you.&rdquo;  We all know that at the election this time 12 months the present Taoiseach went round the country like a pious old preacher.  I have here the headings that appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> about &ldquo;Honour in Public Life&rdquo;, about lies and false promises and deception.  These remind me of the Russians talking about peace at the United Nations, because never in the history of this little country of ours were the people promised so <Col N="280" /> much by a political Party at an election and never were they led to expect so much, and never did they get less.</P>
    <P>The facts are&mdash;let nobody here or anywhere else try to deny them&mdash;that the Fianna Fáil Party made promises at that time that they themselves knew they had no intention of fulfilling, for they themselves knew they could not fulfil them.  Nevertheless, they were prepared to dupe the people and get their votes.  Unfortunately, they got their votes.  They had a policy and that policy was printed in a pamphlet which was distributed to practically every voter in the country.  I will run briefly through the promises and, if anybody feels like denying them now, he can read them for himself.  We will see who broke their promises and who kept their word to the Irish people.</P>

      <P>The second was that subsidies were to remain.  The Taoiseach stated that in Belmullet and he was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 1st March, 1957.  I hope the Senator will not deny that.  He said: &ldquo;You know we have never done the things they said we would do.  They have told you that you would be paying more for your bread.&rdquo;  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said the same thing in Dungarvan, and he was even more emphatic.  He said they would not remove the subsidies.  Unfortunately, we know what happened in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> We remember the promises about unemployment and emigration.  Fianna Fáil promised full employment.  They said unemployment could be cured. More jobs would be found for all.  The story we heard to-day from Senator Ó Maoláin is very different from what we heard then.  The people did not elect Fianna Fáil to have just 6,000 fewer unemployed today as compared with 12 months ago.  Unemployment was high last year, but the Government had to take measures to rectify our balance of trade.  They had to impose levies.  There was the glut of Argentine beef in Britain and that affected the price of cattle here.  We were told at that time by Fianna Fáil that they would cure unemployment.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to remind Senator Ó Maoláin that Deputy Michael O'Higgins was informed in the Dáil recently, in answer to a question, that there were 14,000 fewer employed in industry in 1957 as compared with 1956; that there were 10,000 fewer employed on the land in 1957 as against 1956, and thousands fewer employed on the roads and by the county councils in 1957 as against 1956.</P>
    <P>I saw Senator Colley here this time 12 months shed crocodile tears about the people of Dublin and the hardships that existed.  The hardships that exist to-day are much greater than at that time.  Senator Ó Maoláin told us to-day of the confidence the people of Ireland have in the Government, but it might be no harm to quote an account in the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> of Saturday, March 1st.  The boys may laugh, but this was from their own disciples who had paid their half-crowns for their membership cards. They were Fianna Fáil delegates at a Fianna Fáil meeting.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Roger Williams, Clough-jordan, said that last year they had Mr. Lemass in Nenagh and he told them the object of the Government <Col N="282" /> was to relieve unemployment.  He said &lsquo;let us get cracking.&rsquo;  They&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Fianna Fáil people themselves&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;had waited for the Government to get cracking and the results had been very poor.  There was almost as many unemployed to-day as there was 13 months ago and in addition 50,000 had emigrated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are Fianna Fáil figures.  They are not mine.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That was very bad cracking&rdquo;, said the speaker.  And he went on to say that the delegates he spoke to were disgusted with the way things were going.  There is the Government that the Fianna Fáil delegates in North Tipperary have confidence in.  They are disgusted with the way things are going.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin spoke about the confidence the people have in the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotations are here.  They can come over here and read them themselves.  I have taken them down, one by one, from this.</P>
      <P>To come back to emigration, I know emigration was bad in the past.  In the past, daughters and maybe sons emigrated.  They went abroad and sent home money to help keep the home going.  In some ways, they were an asset to the country.  What has happened? Fathers and mothers and their children are uprooting themselves from the land of their parents.  You have small farmers leaving their little whitewashed thatched cottages in the hills of Leitrim and Longford.  They are leaving houses that their fathers fought for, fathers who went barefooted in the past to bring up their families. They are going abroad and to England. Whole families have to leave.  Some of them leave their lands there and others give them to the local auctioneer.  Have those people any confidence left in the Government?  If they had, they would not be doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were also told by Fianna Fáil that they would end the depression. As I have pointed out, the action taken by the last Government went a long way, and Deputy Sweetman even stated during the election that we were almost out of the wood, that if we got increased exports&mdash;and we did get them during the past year&mdash;that that would help to end the depression.  At the same time, it has to be admitted, especially by small shopkeepers and others throughout the country, that they were never in a more depressed state than at present.  Many of them <Col N="284" /> are standing behind half-empty counters. They will all tell you, be it in Mullingar, Enfield or Kilcock, that money was never more scarce than at present.  Perhaps that is the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>We heard people here to-day talking about private enterprise.  In the Dáil, on 6th March, 1951, at column 1167, Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have got to persuade the people that, instead of giving the Government 5/4 out of every £ they should give 6/- or 6/6 or 7/-, persuade them that it is better for themselves that they should spend less at their own discretion and let the Government do the spending for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no denying that since the food subsidies were reduced, which meant a saving of £9,000,000, anyone with a family has very little left to spend.</P>
    <P>We were also told last year&mdash;and it is in this pamphlet&mdash;that Government expenditure was to be curbed.  Despite the fact that the Minister saved £9,000,000 by the removal of the subsidies, expenditure is up this year by £600,000.  Therefore, the Government do not seem to be keeping their promises in that regard, either.</P>
    <P>As regards the E.S.B., we were told that &ldquo;power plants will be set moving again&rdquo;.  They claimed that &ldquo;the hand of the Coalition lay heavily on them&rdquo; and that there was a &ldquo;slowing down&rdquo;. The &ldquo;slowing down&rdquo; meant in 1955-56 there were 100 areas electrified, and it is the intention of the Government next year to keep the plans moving by doing 69 areas.  That is a little bit of a change from the promises they made.</P>
    <P>They also had a plan for agriculture. It is there&mdash;&ldquo;the plan for agriculture&rdquo; and &ldquo;fundamentals of good agricultural policy&rdquo;.  They had a plan in 1932, when they tried to destroy all we had in the country, when the calves and the cattle were slaughtered.  It is a big change to see the Taoiseach admit in the Dáil a few months ago that we are dependent on the export of cattle at present and that we should switch over from trying to export milk <Col N="285" /> and bacon to the export of cattle.  The Taoiseach admitted that.  It is a far cry from the day when he was speaking in Arva himself.  That was beside Senator O'Reilly, who was laughing so heartily a few minutes ago.  He said that the cattle trade was finished.</P>

      <P>Nobody could forget about it because you were slaughtering them a few years ago and now you are trying to encourage people to rear and export more of them.  In Arva, the Taoiseach told the farmers that the British market was gone and that they should go in for bees and the export of honey.  Unfortunately, many fine farmers were stung by some of the drones of the Fianna Fáil Party from 1932 to 1937.</P>

      <P>It is a well-known fact that since the plan for agriculture came into operation during the present year, the price of wheat has been cut by from 6/- to 10/- or 12/- a barrel; the price of barley is to come down by perhaps 3/- 5/- or 7/- a barrel.  The majority of small farmers in the past have tried to live on the export of eggs.  Eggs are selling in country districts at 1/3 and 1/6 a dozen.  No farmer's wife can live on the sale of eggs at those prices.  It costs at least 2/6 a dozen to produce eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to pigs, the Minister notified the producers about three months ago that the price of pigs would be brought down by 5/- a cwt. The farmers always sought stability in prices and Deputy Dillon gave them that when he got the pig agreement two years ago and the price of bacon was fixed at 235/- per cwt. for grade A bacon.  Since this Government came into power, the bacon curers can do what they like and in the last six or <Col N="286" /> eight months it has been almost impossible to get grade A prices.  I know farmers who had to take 150/- and 160/- a cwt. for their pigs as grade B and grade C, but when the bacon is being sold to the working man, the bacon is not sold as grade B or grade C or at 1/6 or 1/8 a lb.  It is all sold at the same price.</P>
    <P>We hear nothing now about the Fianna Fáil plan.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was speaking at Graiguecullen, Carlow, on 11th November, said he had published on behalf of Fianna Fáil proposals for a full employment policy designed to secure that, in five years, capital investment would be extended until jobs were available for every boy and girl leaving school, as well as absorbing those unemployed at the present, and that these proposals still stood.  There is not a single word about those proposals to-day.</P>
    <P>We remember all that was said about the inter-Party Government slowing down house building.  In the Minister's Estimate, there is a reduction under the heading of grants for the building of houses and a reduction of £27,000 in the provision for Gaeltacht housing under sub-head F (1).  How will these reductions help the building trade?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking at Castlecomer on 24th February, 1957, had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new Government must at once stimulate employment by the institution of a capital investment programme designed to put men to work, to put wages into their pockets so that these wages will be spent in the shops and so that the whole national income would get a boost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of putting men to work, we find fewer employed in industry, fewer employed in agriculture, fewer working on the roads and for county councils because the Government discontinued the grants that were given by the previous Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes. Senator Ó Maoláin said that there was more for the building of schools.  He should look up the Estimates.  There is £174,000 less for school building. There is £700,000 less for ordinary <Col N="287" /> housing grants and, as I have already mentioned, the provision of money has been stopped completely under the heading of the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House have always believed that this country is predominantly an agricultural country.  If any Government can make the people on the land prosperous, the whole nation will prosper. If the people on the land are poor, the whole nation will ultimately be poor. No matter where they live, whether in the cities or towns, the people's standard of living depends on what the farmer can get from the land and export profitably.  The farmer's profit is the difference between his cost of production and what he is able to get on foreign markets.  At present, the price of wheat, barley, bacon and pigs is coming down.  The farmer is almost depending on cattle and sheep.  Profits are fairly stable for cattle and sheep. The farmer's overhead expenses, his rates and so on, are increasing.  If his cost of production increases, while the price he gets for his produce remains the same or declines, as it is at the present time, his profits will diminish. The farmer's profits are diminishing at present and if that should continue to be the case, the country will not be able to stand up to it and the people will not have even the standard of living they have now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 12,000,000 arable acres in this country and a population of roughly 2,500,000.  There are five acres of land, roughly, for every head of the population.  Despite all that Fianna Fáil Senators have said here to-day about Fianna Fáil being a great Party and a great Government, after 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government, in 1947, we were almost without butter and bacon and were importing those two commodities. Nobody can deny that, after 16 years of their Government, that was <Col N="288" /> the position in a country with that amount of good land and a people willing to work.</P>
    <P>There was a change of Government in 1947 and there was a change of outlook immediately following that change of Government.  The people had confidence in the Government then elected.  The then Minister for Agriculture had to start from scratch.  We had the lowest number of cattle and the lowest number of pigs since records were first introduced here.  In 1931, our total exports were worth £36.3 million; after 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government, 16 years of strong and stable, one-man Government&mdash;the fact that prices of cattle almost doubled was not due to anything Fianna Fáil did for the farmers, but was due solely to the European war&mdash;our total exports increased from £36,000,000 in 1931 to £39.5 million in 1947, an increase of £3,000,000 in 16 years.  If the prices of our exports had not doubled, our exports would have been worth only half of that.</P>
    <P>We hear so much about the adverse trade balance&mdash;we had it yesterday from Senator Lenihan&mdash;that one might think it grew up with the inter-Party Government, but, in 1947, we had an adverse trade balance of £91,823,314.</P>

The archpatriots of Fianna Fáil have always told us that England's difficulty was Ireland's opportunity, and there was England's difficulty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told me they would have got a better agreement and I want to ask why, when England was in such dire straits for cattle, our farmers had to sell cattle between 50/- and £3 per cwt.? When the inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 they knew that in the three years before that, in 1945, 1946 and 1947, 116,000 calves had been slaughtered in each year.  In 1948, 82 were slaughtered, but when Deputy Dillon came into power he closed down those factories and the majority of the calves that would have been slaughtered were sold for £50, £60 or £70 afterwards.  The cattle that are going out of the country to-day and helping to redress our adverse trade balance are the progeny of cattle that would have been slaughtered, had Fianna Fáil not been put out of office in 1948.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's plan went into operation, with the result that this year £131,000,000 worth of produce was exported.  Surely no one on the other side of this House can say they had anything to do with that?  One would think the cows calved and the calves were fattened and reared, since the people in their wisdom put Fianna Fáil back into power.  Some people down the country tried to get people to believe that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you admit it.  The year 1946 was an unfortunate one for this country, because we are a small island, and when an economic cyclone strikes the whole world the adverse winds that affect other countries also affect us here.  Even Britain was in danger, as the British Premier announced at that time.  There was a glut of cattle on the British market and our cattle prices dropped to £3 10s. per cwt.  We had the Suez Canal crisis also.  Surely the outgoing Government were not to blame for those things?  They took courageous steps and imposed levies which they admitted would lead to a certain amount of unemployment, but it was agreed that if they did not take these measures, other measures would have to be taken, or, perhaps, everybody in the country would be unemployed in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They took the necessary measures and these measures bore fruit.  Fianna Fáil is reaping the benefit, and more luck to them.  Frequently, there is an element of luck in politics and Fianna Fáil were also lucky in that the index price of imports has dropped steadily from 117 in February, 1957, when we were in power&mdash;the highest it ever reached&mdash;to 113 at the present time. That favours the Government.  When we were in power, cattle were £4 per cwt., due to the Argentine beef; they are now up to £8 per cwt. not because of anything Fianna Fáil did, though Fianna Fáil reaps the benefit <Col N="291" /> of it, but because of what the previous Government did.</P>
    <P>When we speak about imports and exports, Senator Lenihan may smile. He spoke a good deal about exports. I am young enough to remember it being said that if every ship was sent to the bottom of the sea, we could get on without the rest of the world.  We would live on our own.  We were to be self-supporting and all that.  Senator Lenihan's speech yesterday was far away from the things that were said in those days.</P>
    <P>Our exports increased from £39,000,000 in 1947 to £131,000,000 in 1957.  That is a marvellous increase&mdash; an increase of over 300 per cent.  As regards wool, in 1947 we exported £870,000 worth and last year we exported £4,000,000 worth of wool.  In 1947, there were 1,468,000 barrels of wheat produced from 600,000 acres of land and in 1957, 3.22 million barrels of wheat were produced from 350,000 acres of land.  That is what we want in this country.  We want intensive farming and not extensive borrowing. Deputy Dillon showed the farmers the way through the limestone scheme, the land rehabilitation scheme, the parish plan and all the other schemes he put into operation.  In 1947, we exported £50 worth of bacon.  Last year, we exported £4.25 million worth of bacon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 830,000 cattle worth £45,700,000 exported in 1957.  It took the people on this side of the House a long time to convince those on the opposite side of the value of our cattle exports.  I remember Deputy Dillon saying that we had a fertile soil, a suitable rainfall and that we should try to get the best out of the land.  We were called a ranchers' Party which went in for nothing but the bullock, but the bullock is helping to pay the allowances of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Senators and keep us all alive at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the export of fresh, chilled and frozen beef.  It is advocated by many that, instead of sending our cattle out on the hoof, we should try to send out more of our cattle in the form of beef, frozen or chilled, and keep the hide and horns at home because we could base other industries on these.  In 1947, we exported £79,000,000 worth of fresh, chilled and frozen beef and in 1957, we exported £6,000,000 worth.  That is nothing to be laughed at.  It shows that the previous Government did some good and that the farmers, who were often hounded in the past, answered the call for increased production, with the result that at the present time we have overproduction. Instead of encouraging the farmers when we get over-production, <Col N="293" /> as we now have in the case of wheat at least, we are telling them that the more they produce, the less they will get for it.</P>
    <P>That is bad because in the past the farmers always feared that.  It was one of their greatest fears that if they produced too much, the price would go down and they would get nothing for it.  That is why I think it is up to the Minister to say that the price for those articles, where we have full production at the present time, will be maintained. We remember all the talk there was in the Seanad about creamery milk and about the Milk Costings Commission.  I remember hearing Senator Lenihan speaking some place on the border of Kerry and Limerick.  He shed crocodile tears about the price of milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>A shilling a gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and about the price the farmers were getting for it and what they would give to the farmers for milk.  The facts are that, in 1947, we had 154,000,000 gallons of milk produced.  In the year 1957, the farmers sent to the creameries 289,000,000 gallons of milk.  I think that is a marvellous achievement. Those cows were not born since 20th March, 1957.  As regards the output of creamery butter, in 1947 we produced 5,019,000 cwt. and in 1957, the farmers, in answer to the call for increased production, produced 9,077,000 cwt. of butter, which is a record for all time. I see the Minister is smiling.  Does he not agree that that is a record for all time?  The fact is that the farmers produced that amount of butter last year.  The official statistics are hardly wrong.</P>
      <P>As regards the export of creamery butter, in 1947, we exported no butter and after 16 years of a good agricultural policy, we were eating yellow butter from abroad, but in the year 1957, we exported butter to the tune of £4,349,000 worth.  That is something which any Government should claim credit for and be proud of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of pigs received at our factories in 1947 was 306,000.  In the year which has just ended, due to the <Col N="294" /> fact that there was a stable and guaranteed price for pigs, and that the bacon curers, whether they liked it or not, could not mulct the farmers, as they are now doing, there were 1,115,000 pigs slaughtered in our bacon factories.</P>
    <P>I say all that in answer to the criticism made of the work of the inter-Party Government.  If Fianna Fáil remained dormant and allowed the policy of the previous Minister for Agriculture to continue, this little country would prosper, because we were out of the wood last year.  We took the right action and this Government are now reaping the benefit.</P>
    <P>Levies were imposed at that time. I remember the cries in this House about the price of oranges to the poor. A Member spoke about poor expectant mothers and young children.  The levies were since taken off, but the price of oranges has not been reduced. What has happened in the meantime? We were told in this House, and from this side of the House, about the levies on cars.  The levies have since been removed, but the price of cars has not come down.  Where is the money going?  That is a question I should like the Minister to answer.  Who is getting the difference?</P>
    <P>Another matter that faces this country at the moment is the question of our entry into the Free Trade Area.  It is annoying many people throughout the country that we have a Minister for Agriculture, and that this is a predominantly agricultural country, but that, instead of the Minister for Agriculture going to the Free Trade Area talks, along with the British Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce represents us at those discussions.  I hold that that is wrong.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the leading figure in the Fianna Fáil Government, he can be that, but, at the same time, he should bring his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, along with him, so that the colleague can be there to stand up and argue on behalf of the farmers of this country.  Remember, <Col N="295" /> this whole question of our entry into the Free Trade Area is very important. It affects the lives of each and every one of us.  It will affect the standard of living of our people for perhaps generations to come.  The question as to whether we can maintain our freedom and maintain employment and give jobs to our own people at home here in Ireland depends on the outcome of this matter.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there are three things which we can do as regards the Free Trade Area.  We can do nothing&mdash;not enter it.  However, we are all agreed that, as a small nation, if we did that, we should wither away and die as we would not be able to live on our own and then the other nations of Europe would not support us or buy or trade with us in any way.  Secondly, we can seek closer co-operation with Britain. We should try, I think, to move step by step with Britain.  We should try to save our farmers and at least get as good rights for them as they had under the 1948 Trade Agreement.</P>
    <P>We all know that we can enter the Free Trade Area.  If we enter that area, we will have a potential market of something like 284,000,000 people. That is something.  We should try to get a foothold in that market. It is agreed by many people that, if we enter it without certain strings, our industrialists will suffer. I know that the Tánaiste will fight for our industrialists at the Free Trade Area meetings.  He has set up the industries.  For what he has done in that regard I give him full credit. I should also like to see the Minister for Agriculture in the present Government as active and as energetic on behalf of the farmers.  I should like to see him uphold the point of view of our farmers before the different bodies at the Free Trade Area talks.  I hope our Minister for Agriculture will represent us there in the future.</P>
    <P>Some of our industrialists may not be able to stand up to competition, if we enter the Free Trade Area.  They have been cushioned in many ways, by tariffs and protection, in the past.  We have some good industrialists who have done their best; we have others of <Col N="296" /> whom the country should be ashamed and who should be ashamed of themselves because they have not tried to pull their weight.  When tariffs and protection were given to them, all they did was to increase their prices.  It might be no harm if some of those people suffered in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I want to talk now about the farmers.  No matter what has been said about their being slow and about lack of initiative, and so on, they have always had to face competition from abroad.  They have had to face competition from the farmers of Belgium, Holland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other countries and they have always been able to hold their own on the markets of the world.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our marketing system in this country is antediluvian.  It is nearly 100 years out of date.  For that reason, I was glad to see that the Minister gave a grant of £230,000 or £250,000 towards the setting-up of a proper marketing board.  That is money well spent.  The sooner we can get that board going on a proper footing, the better, because we shall have a board composed of men who have their fingers on the pulse of the markets of the world.  If there is a shortage of bacon in a particular area and a glut in another, instead of our farmers dumping bacon where there is a glut, they will be able to direct it to the place where people are crying out for it.</P>
    <P>We are spending £500,000 on our embassies throughout the world.  We are a small nation and we should try to hold up our head and hold our own in every country.  That is only right. However, in each of these embassies and consulates, we should have a graduate of agriculture, or a salesman, or somebody who knows something about our main industry.  We should have a man who would try to get us markets and help us to sell our agricultural produce abroad.</P>
    <P>We know the Irish people are scattered over the face of the earth, in countries throughout the whole world. If it were brought to their notice that we had this produce for sale, that there was a glut of certain produce in Ireland and that the little homeland needed some extra money, we might <Col N="297" /> get many of those people, even for sentimental reasons, to buy our Irish produce. The quicker and sooner the Minister gets this board into full operation, the better.</P>
    <P>We should also have properly organised shipping facilities.  We were told by Senator Prendergast and Senator John D. Sheridan in the past, that it cost as much to send a ton of beef from Dublin to England as it cost to send it from the Argentine to the British market.  That cannot be denied. We should have our own shipping fleet to put our produce on those markets. We should also have an air service to bring cream and fresh fruit, or produce like that, to the London market, where there is a population of over 6,000,000. There is a huge market there, but we have not proper marketing facilities, or the transport to get our produce there quickly.</P>
    <P>There should also be a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign at home in Ireland, and by that I do not mean for St. Patrick's Day, or one week of the year, but for all 52 weeks.  We should get our own people interested in buying Irish at all times, if possible.  It should be pointed out that it is in the interests of all sections&mdash;labour, industrialists and farmers&mdash;to buy as much Irish produce as possible.  The citizen who takes foreign goods or the first thing offered to him is doing a disservice to himself and to his country.  The shopkeeper who does not help to push Irish goods or who keeps them at the back of the shelves, is striking at the country's economy and his own prosperity and, perhaps, in the end, at his own job.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan spoke about the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme yesterday evening and about eight or ten other Bills rushed through the House in the past year.  These Bills were all printed and ready for introduction by the previous Government. The Ministers of this Government who introduced them said in each case they were introducing Bills which had been prepared by the previous Government.  That is why there was very little discussion on them. There were attempts to blame the previous Government for not going ahead more quickly with this scheme.  We <Col N="298" /> should appeal to milk men in the south who have stated they will not support it because the price of milk has been cut.  That is a bad idea and, as a farmer, I would appeal to all farmers to support this eradication scheme.  Remember this is our little country, not the country of one political Party.  If any Government are working a good scheme, the other Parties should give it full support.  We give this scheme our full support and we appeal to the farmers to support it to the full.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes one sad to have this sort of debate when one is dealing with an expenditure of over £110,000,000.  That is why I ask Senator L'Estrange to read his own speech and also Senator Baxter's.  Then we might not have <Col N="299" /> that tone in the speeches here.  I will not reply further to Senator L'Estrange, beyond saying that, though he is a nice person to meet socially, whatever evil spirit seems to take possession of him, he treats us to this kind of speech occassionally.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien can always be relied upon to give us a very clear picture, when he starts to analyse the financial position.  He made an excellent speech and, if he restated anything, he did so in different words from those of his speeches on previous occasions.  He pointed out to the Minister how vital it is to maintain a balance in our external trade.  That was the principal aim, as stated by Senator O'Brien. Senator O'Brien also said another aim should be to maintain a balance in our internal financial position; in other words, in our internal Budget.  Above all, he warned against the dangers of borrowing to balance our internal financial affairs and particularly borrowing from abroad.  In other words, those are the aims and objects which the Minister should have, as stated by Senator O'Brien.  We can all agree that the very same aims and objects have been stated in the Dáil and in the Seanad and at many meetings all over the country by the heads of the Government.</P>
    <P>They are fundamental things with which we cannot disagree.  There are so many points on which we can agree in issues like that that it does seem a little out of place to hear some of the tirades we have heard in this House. They are not intended to help and they can wear out one's patience.  They may not be meant to be annoying, but they can be annoying ultimately.  As I say, those aims are fundamental, if we are to make any progress in balancing our external payments and our Budget.  Senator O'Brien referred to the necessity for an expansion in our exports.  Nobody challenges that fact.  When we are faced, as we are now, with having to export some of our agricultural produce on a depressed market, that is the time that we should close our ranks, and, in the national interest, try to find the best possible solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> It is a good thing that we have an exportable surplus of butter and bacon.  We always did seem to have an exportable surplus of cattle, in one form or another, and the only remark I will make to Senator L'Estrange regarding cattle is that the value of cattle has always been well understood in Ireland&mdash;even since the days we fought a civil war, somewhere around Cooley.  All Parties have realised the value of cattle and it is silly to say that only one Party realises it.  In regard to our exportable surplus of butter and bacon, one of our difficulties would appear to be that there has not been a continued flow of bacon and butter through our export markets and, because of that, it is hard to get people to buy commodities which they have not been in the habit of buying, because human beings are creatures of habit.</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper recently a suggestion that an appeal should be made to Irish people living abroad to buy Irish exports, and that some agency should be set up to market directly in cities in England where there are large numbers of Irish people, and that an effort should be made to sell to them. That had occurred to me before and it occurred to me that rather than have Government agencies marketing in bulk, like the Butter Marketing Committee, it is really the duty of our co-operative societies to sell agricultural produce in cities like Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham.  That should be within the capabilities of some of our co-operative societies.  They have the capital to do it and they are organised to do it, and I do not see why they should not enter into the wholesale or retail trade in English cities with large numbers of Irish people and make an appeal through the different Irish societies there.</P>
    <P>I feel that would be a better way of tackling the problem than exporting in bulk through a bulk agency like the butter exporting agency.  I hope the Minister will think about that and I hope he may be able to get the co-operative societies to organise and start business along that line.  Surely those societies and firms would have as good a right to do it, and indeed a better right, as the many English <Col N="301" /> firms who are trading here, manufacturing and selling?  I feel that if properly prosecuted it would be successful. I think it would be a better approach than through a Government agency, even though, if I may say so, Senator Sheehy Skeffington probably will not agree with that.  I am afraid I am then subscribing to the private enterprise outlook as outlined by Senator McGuire.  Even though I may incur the displeasure of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I genuinely feel that it is the better way to approach that problem.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to analyse the difference between the free enterprise suggestion of Senator McGuire and the socialist speech of Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  One is sorely tempted to do that.  I am afraid I am inclined to come down in favour of Senator McGuire, for this reason only, that there did appear to be a weakness in the case made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  He advocated the expenditure of money without having any regard, as far as I could see, to where the money was to be found.  It is very desirable to have social services better than anywhere else, if we can afford them, but it does not seem to have occurred to him that we can have good roads, good hospitals and good schools only after we have created an economy which can be taxed and a wealth that can produce profit.  Then the profit from that economy can be taxed to provide those very desirable things.  I do not want Senator Sheehy Skeffington to think that I am anti-socialist.  I am not.  I would very much like to have roads, hospitals and schools better than those which could be found anywhere else, but I realise the difficulties. It often occurred to me that Senator Sheehy Skeffington is inclined to put the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>It is only after we have created a buoyant economy that can produce sufficient wealth that we can, without danger to the economy, take enough of our national income to provide those things.  It has occurred to me that, after all, we did canalise too much of our national capital into what appears, on the surface, to be capital investment, on roads, housing, hospitalisation <Col N="302" /> and the very many other desirable things.  I know that Senator O'Brien has sounded that warning.  It did appear to me to be a sounder policy to create an expanding economy and out of that to provide the money for those very desirable services that we would like to see in this country, just as much as Senator Sheehy Skeffington would like to see them.  That is why I am inclined to come down on the side of Senator McGuire.</P>
    <P>I was tempted to make some reference in that regard to the expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare. I always believed, and still believe, that social welfare services are necessary and desirable in any Christian country, that we are, after all, our neighbour's keeper.  There is a duty on us, and on the State, to provide for the less well-off and for the needy, but, when the gross total is so much of the money raised by taxation in this country, and when that is being channelled into social services, it is not a good thing.  No Party can regard it as a desirable thing that over £20,000,000 is spent in a year by the Department of Social Welfare, in a country like this which has such a small taxable capacity.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there have been abuses.  If there have been such abuses, there is a fundamental duty on each and every one of us to ensure that they be eradicated.  If there are wholesale abuses, as is suggested in some quarters, it means that the people entitled to benefits will be denied the full amount of benefit to which they are entitled.  There is also a danger to the national economy if so much of our national income has to be spent along those lines.  It means that we will not have money to spend on other very desirable projects.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to speak on emigration. I will leave that to the Minister. There are other things I intended to speak upon, but, owing to the lateness of the hour and to the length of time taken by my colleagues on the other side, I think it better to conclude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. P. Crowley Mr. P. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise at this late stage merely to offer a few comments and a few suggestions.  I do so because <Col N="303" /> the consideration of these Estimates presents us with the all too rare opportunity of reviewing the outlook and general administration of the Government's policy by all Government Departments.  What I have to say in that respect will be brief, and I am hoping that its brevity will be compensated to some extent by a complete absence of any political bias or preference for any of the lines that up to the moment, at any rate, do not seem to have been very successful in solving some of the problems with which we are faced.</P>
      <P>I do not think that any sane person can deny that our country and our people are faced with some very grave problems.  I contend, and I do not think I can be contradicted, that the policy of any of the Governments or any of the Parties comprising these Governments for many years past cannot be said to have offered any solution, or even any prospect of a solution, of these same grave problems, to judge by the results achieved up-to-date.</P>
      <P>On both sides of the House, and outside it, there is a surplus of theories, but there is a very definite deficiency of any practical remedies, particularly remedies for the two main evils of unemployment and emigration.  Like the previous Senator, I do not propose to go too deeply into the problems of unemployment and emigration because, frankly, I do not consider myself competent to do so within the time to which I propose to limit myself.  However, I do wish to make one or two points in regard to them, because I contend that in considering these problems we are not making the best possible use of the means at our disposal in trying to solve them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin by saying that I do not think any section of our people can be blamed for seeking standards of living in this country comparable with, and commensurate with, the standards which we know exist in every country surrounding us. It seems to me only natural that people should seek to secure these standards and that, to my mind, seems to provide us with the real cause for <Col N="304" /> emigration.  If we cannot provide them with opportunities at home to attain such standards of living, we cannot blame them for going abroad to seek them.</P>
    <P>The most serious population drift seems to be from what we might describe as the provincial and rural areas.  That drift in turn creates new problems of unemployment, because the shift in population and the corresponding reduction of the available population within the country, reduces the demand for consumer goods of every kind and even for agricultural production.  I believe we are not making the best possible use of all the means at our disposal to point the way towards a solution of these problems. One thing we can do, and, I think, ought to do, if we are to make any effort at all to solve these problems, is to take stock of our existing policies and outlook and, if necessary, recast and reorientate our ideas and policy towards these problems.</P>
    <P>I think most members of the House will agree with me when I say we have good reason to complain seriously of the moribund, bureaucratic outlook of our Government Departments when they are faced with any new ideas or suggestions put to them, either by members of this House or by responsible people outside it.  What I complain about is the attitude of these officials expressing through the Departments the attitude of the Government. I should like to point to the fact that the Government themselves must accept responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is very surprising when we see Ministers making statements and going on record on the most extraordinary pretexts in relation to some of the problems I am alluding to. What I am complaining about is the attitude, for example, of the present Government towards the principle of arbitration.  We had that attitude quite recently very definitely expressed towards the possible results of arbitration in the case of civil servants generally, who, like every other section of working people, are at the moment quite legitimately and justifiably seeking to have their standards of remuneration <Col N="305" /> adjusted at least to meet the increased cost of living.  Yet, within a matter of weeks or months past, we had the Government stating that, even if arbitration supported that claim on behalf of the civil servants, the Government would not honour it.</P>
    <P>Government cannot do these things without suffering for it in one way or another.  Through that decision, which, in my candid opinion, was wrong, we as a people will be suffering for it, too.  The tragic part of it is that the result of that decision not only affected the civil servants, but affected very large groups, and in fact every group of salaried workers in the country. We had employers, both organised in the Federated Union of Employers and outside it, who stood behind that decision and used it as an excuse to deny justice in respect of similar claims on behalf of other sections of the people who were equally entitled to salary adjustments.</P>
    <P>More amazing still, the position is now reached when in fact, whether the Government like it or not, it will have to review that decision within a very short time, and I believe will inevitably have to alter it, because clearly we know that the claims of the civil servants cannot be denied indefinitely, any more than those of any other section, so long as they are justifiable. That is one of the aspects of the attitude of mind I am complaining about.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude with one or two brief examples.  I have suggested already that our heaviest loss by way of emigration is from the provincial or rural centres.  I am not alone in this.  I have previously suggested that the Government could do very much more than has been done, or is being done, in dealing with that problem, by encouraging, if not insisting upon, some decentralisation of our industries and our amenities generally. Yet, if we are to judge again by the attitude of most Government Departments and officials on this matter, the policy still seems to be far more vigorously directed towards concentrating all our amenities, if not our industries, here in Dublin.  I submit that that is wrong, that it is one of the most serious evils we have, and that the <Col N="306" /> Government could do a great deal more to correct it.</P>
    <P>We have not had an opportunity here yet of examining the Government's handling of the demand of the people of Cork for an airport, but we have sufficient information at our disposal already to satisfy us that every effort on the part of people in Cork to help themselves in the matter of providing an airport seems to be frustrated and hampered at every turn by officialdom or refusal on the part of the Government Department concerned to admit that anybody but they knows anything about the building of an airport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. P. Crowley Mr. P. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought there was. At any rate, my point simply was that I believe the Government could do very much more than it has done to encourage projects of that kind, particularly where they are mooted and advanced by people in the outer fringes of the country, so to speak, outside this perimeter within a radius of five or ten or 20 miles of O'Connell Bridge.</P>
      <P>Again, I submit that some other opportunities are open to the Government by which that same policy could be very much more advanced than it has been.  We will shortly have an opportunity for the Government to do something really practicable, for instance, by ensuring that the new Agricultural Institute at least shall be sited in some provincial centre, where it will be more convenient and more freely available to the people who need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote one other example.  I have referred in this House on more than one occasion before to the export every year which has now reached the figure of almost £11,000,000 in insurance premiums.  The attitude of Government Departments and officials <Col N="307" /> about whom I am complaining was expressed to me very forcibly in the past few months.  Quite frankly, I was shocked to find a senior official of one Department who tried to justify the export of that amount of money by way of insurance every year by telling me that it was not lost to the country. That observation was an insult to the intelligence of anybody who would attempt to look at that problem, and I do not regard it as any compliment to myself.</P>
    <P>I have maintained previously regarding the export of that very substantial amount of money that its importance lies chiefly in the fact that it would otherwise be available for capital development inside the country. Clearly, we would be assessing the intelligence of our own people at a very low level indeed, if we thought that Irish men or women would be willing to suffer the loss of that amount of money year after year and not expect something for it.  What is wrong is that we are content to see that money leaving the country, money which this country so badly needs for capital development.  A great deal more than has been done could be done by the Government in dealing with that problem.  I will say no more about it at this stage, but I may have to say more on it later.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I feel that one thing we need is a very drastic change in the mentality in Dublin to which I have alluded.  We are, as a nation and a people, facing a period of great uncertainty. Nobody will deny that contention.  It has been pointed to from all sides of the House in this debate.  What is equally clear is that whatever type of thinking was good enough in the thirties and the forties is not going to be good enough in the sixties, and it is high time that we admitted that and realised that we have to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I conclude by appealing to the Government to realise that it behoves them to take serious heed of all the warnings and certainly some of the suggestions that have been offered from all sides of the House in this debate, and to take whatever steps may be necessary, <Col N="308" /> even if some of them may be drastic, to deal with the problems to which I have briefly alluded.  There is still ample time available to the Government at least to make better use of the means at our disposal inside the country in facing up to the problems than has been made up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Brien made a very lucid speech here on the financing of this coming year.  One of the observations he made which I took a note of was that he sees no possibility of saving in the coming year on these Estimates, but sees many opportunities of adding to expenditure.  That, I am sure, is quite true.  There is, however, always a saving on the Estimates.  No matter how tightly drawn they are by the various Departments it will always be the case at the end of the year that some of the Departments were not able to spend the amount of money for which they asked.  On the other hand, there are many requests for Supplementary Estimates during the year, but the Government must use their discretion, as far as they are concerned, to stop them if they think they are out of all proportion and, of course, agree to them when they think they are desirable or essential.  If they are essential, they must agree to them, and, even if they are desirable, they may also agree to them.</P>
      <P>Every Government would, I suppose, take a different view in regard to the Supplementary Estimates that should be allowed to come in.  Take, for instance, Shannon Airport, for which there was a Supplementary Estimate during the year.  The criticism which was levelled at us by the Opposition Parties would lead one to believe that if they were in office, they would not have sanctioned it.  I imagine that, if they were there, they would have done that.  It shows the different attitude that is taken when in Opposition from that taken when in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position that was put to us in regard to Shannon Airport was that in four or five years' time, jet planes, to a large extent, would take the place of the planes there now.  The jet planes could not use Shannon as it is and we would have to spend £1,000,000 <Col N="309" /> in order to keep that airport in use. Therefore, the proposition before us was: were we to let the airport go into obsolescence in four or five years' time or spend £1,000,000 and keep it in use for jet planes?  We decided to spend the money and I think any other Government would have done the same.</P>
    <P>On the general proposition in regard to more expenditure, many Senators thought the bill was too high.  We all think it is too high.  I am sure members of Fianna Fáil will say it is too high also and that it would be a good thing if it could be reduced.  The trouble is that nobody in the Dáil or the Seanad, including Fianna Fáil, made any very constructive suggestion &mdash;I can recall only one that came from Senator Sheehy Skeffington on Defence &mdash;as to what items could be reduced. That, however, I suppose, does not excuse the Government from reducing the Estimates, if it can possibly be done.  After all, the Government have more time to go into these questions. They have more expert advice at their disposal and they are in a better way to consider the Estimates minutely and should, of course, bring them before the Oireachtas in a manner in which they can defend them.</P>
    <P>The next point made by Senator O'Brien was in relation to the public debt, which has gone up enormously in the past ten years.  The result is that we are now compelled to find £20,000,000 per year to service that debt.  That is a very heavy burden on current revenue at the present time. Nevertheless, I do not think we can take too narrow a view of the assets that are created by the spending of this borrowed money.  Sometimes, we can spend borrowed money on a project where we get a good return, from the point of view of the country and a good return financially.  For instance, for the money lent to the E.S.B., we get the amenities of electricity for the people and we also get a return on the capital from the company.  It is a good investment in every way.  The same applies to money spent on telephone development.  That money is being used to install telephones, and so on, which go to improve the standard of living of the people, and they are also paying a return on the money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> There are many other such items which can be quoted which are not only national assets but also financial assets from the budgetary point of view, but we cannot always confine ourselves to the financial aspect.  Take health expenditure, which was referred to here by more than one speaker.  The health of the people is a very important matter, and if we spend some millions of pounds on it, we do not get our 5 per cent. back in cash, but we have succeeded in the past ten or 12 years in cutting the death rate from tuberculosis by a very significant figure.  I have not got the figures to quote, but Senators know them.  Infantile mortality has gone down very much and even the ordinary death rate has decreased substantially.</P>
    <P>That situation can be claimed to a great extent to be due to the money spent on health services.  Even though we do not get a financial return for the money spent, we get a very good return in the health and in the lives of the people.  The same applies to many other types of expenditure, such as social welfare benefits; of course, that comes out of current revenue and I am not talking about capital there.  There are other items that could be mentioned apart from health, housing, for instance.  We do not get a good financial return for money spent on housing, but any country would have to provide good houses for its people. In so far as we have completed that job, the money is well spent.  I am not saying whether the houses were well built or built in the most economical way, but I say the idea was a good one, of spending money on housing.  To the extent that our capital has been used for housing, it is a national asset, even if it is not a financial asset.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health services, Senator Baxter said we were inclined to repudiate the Health Act.  I, for one, am not inclined to repudiate it, because in so far as it did help&mdash;and it did, of course&mdash;to improve the health of the people and to reduce the death rate, it was a very good Act.  I admit it was not implemented as I had hoped it would be.  When Senator Baxter says politics should be cut out, I say <Col N="311" /> that if politics had been cut out in the implementation of the Health Act by the local authorities there would have been a different story now.  However, that cannot be helped now and we have to do the best we can, go back over the ground and see if we can get it working smoothly again.</P>
    <P>Let us take examples of a few other assets.  Take the question of bovine tuberculosis.  This is the first year in these Estimates where we propose to borrow in respect of the expenditure on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. That money will be spent over a period of seven or eight years.  We hope the job will be completed in seven or eight years and it would, I think, be unfair to make the taxpayer now pay for that over the next seven or eight years.  We expect, and we are entitled to expect, that as a result of the seven or eight years spent on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, our cattle herds will be much more valuable. That national asset, when that work is completed, will be a very valuable asset and, for that reason, posterity should be made to pay a little bit for this, just as well as the present taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Take forestry.  Forestry will be a very valuable asset in time, but it takes 45 to 50 years before the asset is created.  Again, it would be unfair to ask this generation to pay the entire cost of forestry and make a present of the results to those living here in 45 or 50 years' time.  There are various types of projects for which we borrow and one justifies them on the grounds of their being good national assets, but not necessarily on the grounds of their being good budgetary assets, and all these will pay a return in cash. They are all defined under different headings.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien asked when the next report of the Capital Advisory Committee will be available.  As a matter of fact, it is with the printers and it may be available in a few weeks. I am not sure how long the printing will take.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said that the imbalance on external payments is a sure <Col N="312" /> sign of internal inflation.  I took that down because it struck me as being a little too dogmatic.  It is not a sure sign because, if the imbalance is created by the building up of domestic capital goods here, if capital development were financed in that way, it should not create inflation.  However, I shall not argue these economic subjects with the Senator, but I do want to put it to him that that would be a case in point.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to say that inflation is caused only by deficit budgeting. I think there are other instances in which internal inflation might be caused.  I was told some 18 months ago that the inflation in 1955 was largely due to the fact that the banks indulged in large-scale lending.  I do not remember whether there was a budgetary deficit that year, but, whether there was or not, the inflation in that year might not have been due to that cause.  There might also have been a rise in money incomes.  If there is a big increase in wages all round, there may be no Budget deficit, but there can still be inflation.  Borrowing from the banks is not necessarily inflationary because we have been borrowing from the banks for some years past.  We found in 1957, and again this year, that we are taking only a small proportion of the savings that are there.  Savings, as Senators are aware, were on the increase during 1957.  The tendency has continued so far this year.  The banks, of course, are getting a share of those savings.  We have taken only a proportion of them and, therefore, our borrowing from the banks could not be inflationary.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien went on to say that the Estimates are too high and he added the comment that he thought that was an unpopular thing to say. It is not unpopular.  Anybody can say it.  What is unpopular is when someone names an individual item as too high.  He may then run into unpopularity. The general statement is made by so many people now that no notice is taken of it.  It is the specific cut suggested that leads to unpopularity. The Senator said that the Government, being strong in numbers, should do their duty.  We believe we are doing our duty.  I did not hear from the Senator <Col N="313" /> what he conceives to be the duty of the Government that we are leaving undone.  It was inferred by the Senator that we should reduce expenditure somehow or other, but that is not an easy matter.</P>
    <P>Take the big items of expenditure in this Book.  I mentioned health.  Social welfare runs over £20,000,000.  Education is a very big item.  Agriculture is a very big item.  I am sure no Senator would say we are spending too much on any of those.  I expect what they will say is that we are not spending the money properly.  What they usually say is that we are not spending enough.  Several speakers said here that we are not spending enough on agriculture; several said that we are not spending enough on education; some said we were not spending enough on social services.  I do not remember now if the same remark was made in regard to health, but, generally speaking, whether it be in the Dáil or in the Seanad, we are usually told we are not spending enough under this, that or the other Estimate, and we very seldom get a suggestion as to where a saving can be made, despite the fact that that is what we would like to have.  I do not say that if the suggestion were made, it would be adopted, but we would like to hear the suggestion.</P>
    <P>These are the Estimates as agreed by the Government.  I suppose every Senator knows that every Minister in every Government, every year looks for more, and there is no exception to that.  The Government sit down and decide that they must cut the Estimates by several millions, and they do that.  That was done this year.  They thought they had cut to the essentials under each heading and they could not be expected to do more.  I should like those speakers who criticise our high expenditure to give us an indication of the direction in which the spending is too high.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGuire on several of the principles he laid down. I agree with free and private enterprise. I agree that the profit incentive is the only attraction for capital. There is no other attraction for capital, except the profit incentive.  I also agree that high profits do not necessarily <Col N="314" /> mean high prices, because sometimes the efficient manufacturer will make a bigger profit than the inefficient, but he may not charge as high a price as the inefficient, so efficiency comes into it to a great extent.</P>
    <P>State intervention is, however, sometimes necessary.  We have had in the past on many occasions to bring the State into operation in the manufacture or production of certain items, whether it was sugar, electricity or anything else.  I do not know whether or not it will again be necessary to have State intervention, but, if it is necessary, it will be done.  We have not departed from our policy of using the State, if necessary, to produce any particular item that may be required.</P>
    <P>The Senator also said that we had retained too many emergency controls, controls put on during the war for certain reasons.  I thought we had got rid of most of those.  Admittedly, some of them have been put into permanent legislation, but I do not think there are any of them with which one could find any great fault.  I shall be very glad to have an example of any that are objectionable.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy talked about using more milk and more butter.  We are very high consumers of milk and we stand very high as consumers of butter. We stand almost at the top as consumers of butter.  We could not be expected to get our people to use more milk and butter to any great extent. There was a proposition made to give cheaper butter to our own people.  If it is 7d. per lb. cheaper, and assuming that the 7d. goes to the producer, the cost of the subsidy to make that up would be £2,225,000.  It was suggested in the Dáil that we should give butter here at the same price as in England, 2/6 per lb.  That would cost £7,000,000. There would be more consumption, but I do not believe the increased consumption would meet two bills like that. Therefore, the money would have to be found from the Exchequer in some way.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lenihan that the balance of payments and the balancing of the Budget are not ends in themselves.  We believe them to be necessary to a sound economy.  We must have a sound economy, if we <Col N="315" /> want to get higher production.  That will give us the bigger national income, which has been referred to as necessary in order to do more for social services, education and so on.  It is only by having a bigger national income that we can give a little more for these various purposes.  A sound economy is necessary for that national income. That, in turn, should cut down unemployment and give us all a higher standard of living.  That is what we are all aiming at.  The aim is not a balanced Budget.  It is only one of our means of achieving the aim of a higher standard of living.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked did the Government really desire increased production.  They could not have said it more often than they did.  It became a sort of joke across the House.  We were always talking about increased production and I cannot see how any Senator could be unaware of that.  We do want increased production in butter, bacon and everything else.  An increase in butter production will have to go for export.  These exports will be necessary to pay for imports, if we want a higher standard of living.  But I want to say emphatically that we do want increased production.</P>
    <P>I do not hold that we must follow that increased production with 100 per cent. export subsidy.  Last year, we had the position that the butter producers increased their income by £2,225,000.  They had £20,000,000 in 1956 and £22,225,000 in 1957.  They also got the benefit of the increase in the value of cattle, which went up by about £5,000,000 or £6,000,000.  They got the benefit of the increased price for calves, even if they did not rear cattle at all.</P>
    <P>When we came to consider this matter, we said: &ldquo;You have the producer, the taxpayer and the consumer.&rdquo; You will agree we gave the consumer enough of a knock last year. We said: &ldquo;We will not touch you again&rdquo;.  We had to decide between the producer and the taxpayer.  To avoid misunderstanding, I must say we were delighted to see that there was bigger production and that the producers were better off.  When you take <Col N="316" /> into account the price of calves, they had about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 extra.  Was it fair that we should say to the taxpayers&mdash;many of whom had no increase last year, were living on fixed incomes and not getting any more than they got in 1956&mdash;&ldquo;You will have to follow these people 100 per cent.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We adopted a compromise.  We said we would let the consumers pay one-third of the increase in the subsidy and we would pay two-thirds.  That was a fair enough deal.  The same applied to pigs and bacon.  They had £2,000,000 of an increase over the previous year.  We said that we would have a compromise in that case too, that we would ask them to pay only 20 per cent. and that we would pay the rest.  Between butter and bacon, we will save £1,000,000 this year in export bounty.  It was a choice of whether we would take from the taxpayers £2,500,000 or £3,500,000 for these export bounties.  We decided on the £2,500,000.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter went on to make an observation very often made by those not sympathetic to Fianna Fáil policy. He said that if we did as much for agriculture as we did for industry, agriculture would be in a better way. What are we doing for industry more than we are doing for agriculture?  We protect the home market for both.  We protect it well enough for agricultural products.  We do not let them in at all. It takes a tariff of 70 per cent. to keep foreign butter out.  We do not let foreign potatoes in.  There is a tariff of £28 per ton on potatoes, a 500 per cent. tariff.  Eggs, chickens and everything in the agricultural line are not let in.  If we are accused of protecting the home market for industrial products, at least we have not gone as far as we have in regard to agricultural products.  We do not altogether prohibit industrial products from coming in here.</P>
    <P>Take now the question of grants. There is only £650,000 for grants to industry in this Book of Estimates.  Now see the position as regards agriculture. There is £5,500,000 for agricultural grants against rates.  There are many other grants, such as those for cow byres, water schemes and all sorts of <Col N="317" /> things.  They total about £7,000,000 or £8,000,000.  There you have the comparison with regard to grants.</P>
    <P>Now we come to loans.  As far as I can recollect, no loan is given to industry, unless it is very well documented and unless the ordinary lender would lend money on it.  And, of course, an economic rate of interest is charged. If money is lent to industry, it is lent as a good financial proposition.  I admit that not so much money is lent to agriculture.  It is a more difficult proposition.  Senators will agree that we could not lend money to agriculture to buy land because we would be just putting one farmer up against another and putting up the price of land.</P>
    <P>On the export side, we give remission of income-tax to companies for exports, but although they, admittedly, are nearly always industrial products, the same thing would apply to agricultural products also.  That is just a remission of income-tax, but, on the other hand, on agricultural products, we give export bounties which we do not give in the case of industrial products. So, whatever complaints we may make with regard to the treatment of agriculture, let us not, as it were, support the farmer in his wrong belief that he is being victimised and that industry is being built up.  It is quite the contrary and there is no reason why the farmers should be told by responsible Senators that they are not being treated nearly as well as the industrialist.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asked me about the Royal Hospital.  The Royal Hospital is in a bad way.  There is a very bad report on it.  It will cost a lot of money.  That is all I can say at the moment.  The big consideration is whether that money should be spent on it or not, because it is a very big sum.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan did not accept my figures on wheat and I had to get them again.  Senator O'Donovan can follow it for himself.  In 1947, the price was 55/- per barrel for wheat bushelling 57 or over.  In the autumn of 1947, Fianna Fáil promised the farmers&mdash; the announcement was always at that <Col N="318" /> time made in the autumn for the following year&mdash;for the 1948 crop another 7/6.  That was made by the Coalition, all right, promised by Fianna Fáil and given by the Coalition.  I do not know where the honours would lie there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no change in 1949 or 1950.  In 1951, there was an increase of 5/- on wheat bushelling 57 and an extra 2/6 for a new category brought in of wheat bushelling 60.  In 1952, there was an increase of 7/6; in 1953, an increase of 2/6 and a still higher category brought in, bushelling 63&mdash;2/6 extra for that; in 1954, no change; in 1955, it was reduced by 12/6 and in 1956, 2/6 of that 12/6 was restored.  To go back to wheat of 57 lb. to the bushel, the price went from 55/- in 1947 to 67/6&mdash;an increase of 12/6 but, for wheat over 63, it went from 55/- to 72/6.  I might have been a bit unfair in taking wheat over 63 lb. to the bushel but I took over 60 lb. to the bushel, because my own wheat is somewhere around 60 to 61. As far as I can see from these figures the result was that it was put up from 55/- to 82/6 at one stage by Fianna Fáil and brought down by 10/- net by the Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>The Senator wanted to know also why was the provision for the staff of the Board of Works brought up, while work was brought down.  That, of course, would appear to be so from the face of the Estimate. What really happened was that last year I allowed the Board of Works something like £1,550,000 for schools and they were unable to spend it.  The reason they gave at the end of 1956 as to why they were not able to erect any more school buildings was that their staffs were scattered and they had not got them back.  The staffs must go back.  They have gone back now and we hope to be able to increase the amount spent on schools up to £1,400,000, instead of £1,200,000 spent during this present financial year.</P>
      <P>A Senator said that we are providing £1,800,000 for the Industrial Credit Company for new factories, while we are neglecting the old ones.  Of course, that is not true.  The company will look after the old companies as well as new companies.  The Industrial Credit Company can issue capital for a new company.  They can issue capital for an old company.  They can guarantee a loan for a new company or for an old company, or they can lend money themselves to an old company or a new company.  They can do all these things. It is not a matter whether the company is new or old.  As a matter of fact, a good deal of business has been done with the old companies in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan said that it was a fraud&mdash;I think that was the word he <Col N="320" /> used&mdash;not to put in more money for agricultural marketing this year.  They got £250,000 last year as a grant-in-aid and they still have it.  They have not spent very much.  The scheme came into operation only a couple of months ago.  As soon as they spend that money they can come looking for more.  I do not see why we should give them more now when they have almost £250,000 at their disposal.</P>
    <P>As regards the scheme for small loans for small farmers, Senator Donegan is right.  I have got this document, and I note that Deputy Costello, on 15th October, 1956, mentioned that they were going to bring in a scheme that would give short-term credit to small and medium sized farms.  I do not want to read the whole of it.  That is the gist of it.  Afterwards, on 6th February, there was a Fine Gael Árd Fheis and Deputy Sweetman said that there was &ldquo;a new scheme of agricultural credit foreshadowed by the Taoiseach last October, the main provisions of which will be indicated by the Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;.  The Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order to help farmers achieve increased production the Government propose to provide facilities for short-term credit, which will enable any farmer with a £50 valuation or under to get a loan equal to ten times his valuation, subject to a limit of £250, which will be repayable over five and a half years; provided the farmer is prepared to consult the agricultural instructor or parish agent in his area when he is preparing his plans for increased production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The scheme was launched.  The number of applicants was 707; not qualified, 516; sanctioned, 122; loans sanctioned, £17,551; and the number of loans refused, 43.  That scheme that was talked so much about does not appear to have done very much.</P>
    <P>There is a token Vote in the Estimate. The Estimate can only bear a token Vote here because all that has been done is to guarantee the Credit Corporation against any loss on these loans.  We have done that.  We have put in our token Estimate and are prepared to guarantee the loss.  We have <Col N="321" /> not interfered with the Credit Corporation. The scheme was given to them and they are administering it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will send the Senators' observations to the Minister for Agriculture. Senator Sheehy Skeffington quoted the late Senator Hawkins in asking the Government at that time why they had not reduced the cost of living, and many other questions.  The reason, I take it, is that he felt that he was entitled to ask the question on account of the promises they had made.  I do not know whether there was any more in it than that.  He did not get a very encouraging promise, so far as I remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke about the question being dropped in the census paper with regard to the speaking of Irish.  It was not dropped with malice aforethought.  As a matter of fact, we have got back to the census every five years&mdash;it had been only every ten years.  It is intended to make the census of 1957, 1967 and so on, the <Col N="322" /> principal one.  All the questions will be asked then.  I take it that the census of 1955, 1960 and so on are meant merely to get populations and a few other items that would not cost so much to collect.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the Fianna Fáil Party being classed as a Tory Party, except that I do object to being put into a more Tory category than the British Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan said we had failed to develop a Christian democracy and that bureaucracy was too strong.  I have gained a lot of knowledge about the civil servants and bureaucracy, and I do not agree with him at all.  The Senator thought that when a Minister came into office, he was not able to deal with the Civil Service and that he should have advisers as well.  These advisers would have to be full-time, highly paid men and it looks as if it was approaching very much to the ins and outs.  If we do that, I think we will destroy the Civil Service we have.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable thing, and I think every Senator here can bear me out, that we have a Civil Service that has served most faithfully the various Governments.  I have never yet heard a disparaging remark from a civil servant about a Minister in another Government.  It just goes to show they are prepared to serve faithfully, whatever Government comes in.  I believe that the Civil Service would be killed if we were to bring in advisers who would be more or less in charge of the Departments, if it were done in that way.  Ministers are responsible under the Constitution for their own Departments, and if anything goes wrong, they must accept responsibility. They are responsible to the people through the Dáil and I think the system works fairly well and is better than any that has been suggested so far.</P>
    <P>If I go into the Department with a great idea and I say to the civil servants: &ldquo;I think this would be a great idea and I want to do this,&rdquo; they are bound to tell me that I am a fool, if it is a foolish thing.  Of course, they will not say I am a fool, but they are bound to argue against it and point out all the pitfalls, but if, in the end, <Col N="323" /> I say that I am going to do it anyway, there is never another word.  They will do it in the best way possible and they do not try to get their own back, so to speak, by destroying it.  I say that from my own experience and over 20 years of my life have been spent in association with the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about red tape and personally I would like to cut out red tape.  I believe a good deal of it has been cut out down the years. There may be some left and if so, I would like to be told about it, wherever it is.  The higher civil servants are very anxious to cut out red tape and wherever we hear of it we will try to get rid of it as far as we can.  There is a certain amount of red tape, if you wish to call it that, a certain amount of care and caution that must be observed in Government Departments and which need not be observed in private enterprise.  If you are running your own business, you can take a short cut; you can take a chance.  Certainly you cannot take a chance in the public service, where you have a Public Accounts Committee and so on, bodies that must be satisfied that things are done properly and in a certain way.  It sometimes seems the red tape is excessive, but it may be hard to escape.</P>
    <P>Very often in the Dáil, sometimes here, and very often down the country, one meets people who say: &ldquo;Will the Government not do something about this?&rdquo;, and when one says: &ldquo;They have no power&rdquo;, the invariable reply is: &ldquo;They should have the power&rdquo;. People nearly always say they favour giving more power to the Government, but I should like to say in regard to the Civil Service they do not want to take more power: they would be very foolish, if they did.  I have often found that when I argue that we should take power, they argue against me.  They must have been able to convince me, but in any case they are inclined to argue against taking more power.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon talked about the relation there should be, he thought, between the cost of living and personal allowances.  We cannot all recoup ourselves up to the level of the cost of <Col N="324" /> living, when prices go up; it would be well if we could, but it cannot be done, and therefore we have to say it is impossible in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke spoke of land tenure and the desirability of landless men, such as second sons, getting land. That has been considered and will be considered again.  It is by no means a closed chapter and something may be done in that direction.  He said nearly all the land of Ireland was owned by people over 60 or by widows.  If that is so, it is very bad; there may be something in it.</P>
    <P>He also spoke of the disability of the private company and the private individual in business compared with the public company.  I admit there is something in that: it is difficult for the private company or individual in business to get capital.  The public company, if doing well, will get debenture or preference shares and so on and will be in a position to get capital to carry on.  It may be difficult for a private company to do it, but I do not think there is much of a case to make, as the Senator tried to make it, to the effect that the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners are treating them very differently.</P>
    <P>There is a slight benefit for a shareholder where the shares are on the Stock Exchange&mdash;that means, of course, a public company.  They get 20 per cent. remission in income-tax on the dividends and it is not given to shares in a private company because these are not on the Stock Exchange.  I do not think they are&mdash; they may be in some cases, but it is not usual.  The same benefit is given on death duties to a person who leaves shares in a public company: there is a remission also in death duties there. That is not a very big thing, and, apart from that, I do not think there is any difference made between them.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien made the point that we should try to favour the small farmer.  I do not think it is true to say that any of our schemes favour the big farmer.  Our agricultural grant, which is one of the biggest schemes we have, involving £5,500,000, favours the small farmer because we <Col N="325" /> give more relief on the first £20 valuation than on the rest.  Therefore, the small farmer gets a bigger slice proportionately than the bigger.  I do not think any of our schemes would favour the large farmer against the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say a couple of words about the speech made by Senator L'Estrange.  Like Senator O'Reilly, I do not want to follow him the whole way.  I have a great admiration for Fine Gael propaganda because it is impossible for a person like me to say a thing down the country without being quoted, but they do not quote me, if it does not suit them. They are quite capable of quoting half a sentence and adopting all the tricks of the propagandist.  Senator L'Estrange would have got a good job from Goebbels if he had applied to him in his heyday.</P>
    <P>There were two things, for instance, which Senator L'Estrange laboured very much.  He takes the year 1947 and compares it with the year 1957.  Is that not the most unfair thing in the world?  Would any Senator say to me it is fair to take 1947 as a year for comparison with the year 1957?  It was a year after a world war when we were compelling farmers to grow our own wheat and when we could not get in artificial manures.  Why do they not take the year 1954, the year we went out of office?  I took the year 1954 in the Dáil and I will not weary the House by going over the reasons again.  I compared that year with 1957 and I can tell the House that the Coalition Government did not get off so well.</P>
    <P>Would they not go back to a prewar year and take the year 1939 for their comparison?  It is a most unfair thing for any Party to act like this.  Yet they in Fine Gael do it up and down the country.  Deputy Dillon's figures are trotted out by every member of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

We have no sympathy for them at all.  We handed over the country to them in 1954 with an adverse trade balance of £6,000,000, and they ran it up in two years to £37,000,000, and made a mess out of everything and claimed our sympathy.  We handed over £6,000,000 in 1954.  We took it over when it was £61,000,000 and brought it down and they brought it up to £37,000,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, a Bill has to be introduced in the Oireachtas to secure confirmation of Orders imposing customs duties made by the Government during the previous year.  This Bill is to confirm the Orders made during 1957.  The purpose of each Order is indicated in one of the columns to the Schedule of the Bill.  I propose to make only a brief reference for the purpose of explaining the circumstances in which these Orders came to be made.  If any further information is required, it can be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> The first Order on the list, relating to wheaten breakfast foods, was an Order which substituted a customs duty on these goods for quantitative restrictions following a review of the protection given under Article 8 of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  The review was carried out by the Industrail Development Authority.</P>
    <P>The second Order, which relates to malt extract preparations, was made to prevent evasion of the duty.  Indeed, the Order which was made was found to be ineffective in that regard and a second Order had to be made in September in order to make the duty effective.</P>
    <P>The third Order excluded from the scope of the duty upon iron and steel bars, rods and sections, certain types of bars, rods and sections which are not being manufactured in this country. The importance of excluding goods of that kind which are not produced here is that, under the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, duty-free licences for the importation of these goods involve an obligation to charge 10 per cent. when the goods are of non-British origin.</P>
    <P>The Order amending the duty on shirts arose from a threat to native manufacturers of shirts from the rising imports of low-priced products from Far Eastern sources.</P>
    <P>The duty on forks was increased and extended to protect the output of the Irish manufacturers against imports from the Continent which appeared to be of the character of dumping.</P>
    <P>The duty on power-drawn agricultural machinery comprising certain tool bar frames, cocklifters, broadcast seed and fertiliser spreaders and certain component parts of these articles was imposed to protect the output of the firms manufacturing these articles and operated to extend the scope of a corresponding Order made in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The duty on glazed fireclay pipes and fittings was a specific duty which was imposed many years ago and had ceased to be effective with the rise in prices and was substituted by the usual <i>ad valorem</i> duty.</P>
    <P>The production of galvanised plain and corrugated iron and steel sheet is now carried on at Irish Steel Holdings, <Col N="329" /> Haulbowline, and the duty was imposed to protect that development.</P>
    <P>The duty on spun rayon yarn was imposed following the establishment of a new undertaking at Sligo for the production of these goods.</P>
    <P>The duty on concrete beams was imposed to protect the Irish manufacturer and the exclusion in the duty on concrete products in respect of articles which are glazed and polished was terminated to prevent possible evasion of duty.</P>
    <P>The production of plant pots of paper and felt was undertaken by a firm which was previously engaged, and is still engaged, in the manufacture of clay plant pots.  However, as the public taste appears to be moving away in favour of the other products, they commenced their manufacture and the scope of the duty was extended to cover them.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of iron and steel cable and rope commenced in 1954.  The duty was imposed to afford a measure of protection to that industry.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of coil springs for motor vehicle suspensions has been undertaken recently in Wexford and the duty was imposed to protect that industry.</P>
    <P>The production of gummed paper, the last of the items here, to be used in the manufacture of tape has commenced and the duty was imposed to protect the local manufacturer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say very much on this measure because it is very late, but I think it is necessary to say a few words.  In spite of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington seemed to take from some previous remarks I made this evening, I should like to make it clear that I have no sympathy whatever with protecting unnecessarily private enterprise with tariffs and protection of one kind or another which protects inefficiency and bolsters-up undeserved profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see industry in this country which will not only be free to operate but which will also be free from protections, props, and so on.  In other words, I want freedom in both ways.  It was suggested that industry in this country wanted freedom from <Col N="330" /> all sorts of Government interference and, at the same time, expected to be propped up.  Nobody wants that.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the particular proposals in this Bill because I think we have had statements from the Minister for Industry and Commerce himself pointing out that the day of wholesale protection in this country has finished and that the infant stages of industry have now been got over. Industry that is worth keeping should, by this time, have become virile and strong.  I take it that, in view of that, the duties we are concerned with in this Bill are now being imposed under strong revisionary scrutiny, especially having an eye to the probability that, in a very short time, our industries will be called upon to compete in perhaps a Free Trade Area.  That being so, I take it that the provisions in this Bill have been advanced to us here to-day to approve of them but that the Minister is bringing them here only because they are absolutely essential and that they are taken with an eye to the necessity for competing ultimately in a Free Trade Area.  Therefore, I approve of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my disappointment with this Bill and with the general attitude of the Minister on the whole question of the imposition of duties.  When the Minister came back to see us here in the Seanad after the change of Government I expressed the hope that we should see some change of policy between the new Government and the old.  He assured me in ringing tones that I should see a very big change. On this particular issue, I see no change at all, or, if any, I see a change for the worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire has referred to the fact that the Minister has been quoted widely as speaking rather as if he intends to change the policy of the Government in relation to protective tariffs.  I am afraid we must, in fact, judge what he intends to do by what he does.  In the <i>Irish Times</i> of 6th March, 1958, there is a report of a speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the official opening of Irish Week at the <Col N="331" /> N.A.I.D.A. headquarters.  He is quoted as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is right, therefore, for us to decide even now that if and when a European economic arrangement, embracing all the countries of Western Europe, including Britain, comes into being, it is more likely than not that we will elect to go into it, and to begin now the reconsideration of economic aims and policies which such a decision would force on us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We needed, he stressed, to start building up greater confidence in our industrial potentialities.  I do not feel that, in introducing fresh tariffs and fresh duties, and in increasing old duties, the Minister is demonstrating, in practice, any change of heart.</P>
    <P>On 28th March, 1957, we debated this same type of Bill with the same Minister.  In Volume 47 of the Official Seanad Report, column 327, I am quoted as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to hear from the Minister something, at any rate.... of the Government's general attitude towards the imposition in future of such protective tariffs and duties as are confirmed in this Imposition of Duties Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 328, I am further reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Could the Minister say whether the Government has under consideration the possibility of having something like a descending scale of duty for the protection of a given commodity being newly manufactured in this country?  It seems legitimate to me that we should give reasonably efficient new industries starting here a measure of protection in what one might call their formative years, the years when they are being set up, installed and are exploring markets and perhaps learning a little by their mistakes.  It seems quite legitimate that we should give them perhaps even a high measure of protection, but it is equally legitimate that we, as representatives of the people, should expect that, if the industry is thriving and has in fact been <Col N="332" /> learning, it will improve down the years in efficiency, and, as it improves in efficiency, will require a decreasing amount of protection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed at that time to listen with some sympathy to that point of view.  He is reported in the same debate at column 332 as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There certainly will be cases where a higher rate of duty at the beginning of an industry might be regarded as necessary, even though there could be at the time a determination to reduce it later when the need to interrupt trade connections and to turn the minds of buyers to the need for securing their requirements from Irish factories has been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has many times in public talked as if he were going to have some new policy on general protection of industries, and so on, but to-day we are confronted with an Imposition of Duties Bill for the confirmation of 15 new or increased duties, and there is not a single duty being reduced by this Bill, and not a single one being abolished.</P>
    <P>I was equally critical of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Norton, but I remember several occasions upon which the then Minister brought in an Imposition of Duties Bill which actually contained proposals for reducing and even abolishing certain duties. Therefore, on the question of protective tariffs the Minister is doing rather less than his predecessor to abolish or reduce these duties which, apparently in theory, he is in favour of reducing. I wonder why that is so.</P>
    <P>I notice in a memorandum sent out to all of us on &ldquo;Ireland and the Free Trade Area&rdquo; by the Minister's Department, there is in paragraph 12, page 7, a sub-paragraph which talks about the rhythm of tariff reduction that will take place if we go into this Free Trade Area.  I quote sub-paragraph (a):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first four-years stage a series of reductions will take place after one year, i.e., on 1st January, 1959; a second reduction 18 months later; and a third 18 months later again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> Perhaps I am unkind in wondering whether this future prospect has something to do with what we are now doing.  We are like people who are about to have a &ldquo;colossal sale&rdquo; and who, in order to slash prices later, put them up well in advance.  I wonder whether we are not putting on duties now simply for the purpose of cutting them in relation to the Free Trade Area, with a great flourish on the 1st January, 1959.  Are we putting on new duties now for the cutting of which we will make an ostensible sacrifice if this Free Trade Area comes about?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House, but I do not think we should let each of these items go without some comment. I am not going to mention more than four of them.  The first item is the 100 per cent. tariff duty on wheaten breakfast foods.  That is 100 per cent. protection with 66 2/3rds. for U.K. and Canada.  I should have liked to hear the Minister defending the size of this tariff.  We can defend tariffs, protection and so on, but is it really necessary, for the sake of the Irish trade, to put on as big a tariff as 100 per cent?  Are we not running the danger of giving them over-protection, and perhaps rendering them weak and enfeebled in this kind of conservatory atmosphere we build around them by such gigantic protection?</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is about an exception in the application of this duty, that is, to exclude from the duty preparations &ldquo;intended primarily for the consumption by infants and invalids.&rdquo;  The intention of the exclusion is admirable, but how is it to be interpreted?  How can one ensure that a particular wheaten breakfast food is &ldquo;intended&rdquo; not solely but &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; for consumption by infants and invalids?  How do you know whether an invalid is consuming a breakfast food because he is an invalid or because he likes breakfast food?  In other words, I am questioning the possibility of conveniently interpreting such an Order.  What kind of court, or what officer of the Revenue Commissioners, will be able to decide whether a given preparation is intended&mdash;intended, mark you&mdash;primarily for consumption by infants and invalids?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> The next point refers to item 4 in the explanatory memorandum and deals with an additional duty of 6/- each on men's shirts not exceeding 8/- in value.  The value is 8/- and an extra 6/- is put on.  There is also 4/- put on boys' shirts not exceeding 5/- in value.  It is quite obvious that that is a very big tariff.  The Minister has said that it is to save us from cheap shirts from the Far East, but I would point out that this type of shirt is the kind which will be bought by the poorer sections of our community, and it is the mothers and fathers who are seeking to clothe their children inexpensively and who have not got very much money to do it, who will be tempted to buy the 5/- shirt for their boys.  Under this Order that becomes a 9/- shirt.  We are putting a prohibitive tariff on goods destined exclusively for the use of the poorer sections of the community.  I would object very strongly to that particular duty.</P>
    <P>The other two I would mention relate to agriculture&mdash;the fifth and sixth in this explanatory memorandum.  One is on certain agricultural forks, and the other on certain power drawn agricultural machinery.  On the last occasion when we had an Imposition of Duties Bill before us in March of last year I proposed one amendment to delete a part of the Schedule referring to agricultural machinery and I was faintly surprised, shall I say, to find that in this vocational Seanad, which has agricultural representatives in it, I did not get support from any representative of the farmers in the Seanad, for the deletion of this particular duty, though even the Minister has said that the Irish companies were in fact producing as cheaply as the English, the implication being that if the Irish farmer had a choice, at even prices, he bought in preference foreign agricultural machinery.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us, in relation to Item 5, the duty on agricultural forks, that this is mainly to protect the output of home firms against Continental articles which are being brought in.  But the customs duty is 30 per cent. full, and still 20 per cent. for U.K. and Canada.  Therefore, it is not by any means solely against Continental <Col N="335" /> products which are being &ldquo;more or less dumped&rdquo;, as he states, but also against U.K. products.  This is an increased charge upon our agricultural community, and it is being put on at a time when it has been increasingly difficult for the agricultural community to buy the equipment, the tools and the machinery which are found necessary in modern agriculture. Consequently, I intend to propose the deletion of these two portions of the Schedule also, and I hope I shall have the support of Senators representing farming interests.</P>
    <P>We are not entitled in the Seanad to propose amendments to this type of Bill, but we can make recommendations, and I propose on the Committee Stage to make recommendations, or ask the Seanad to agree to proposed recommendations, for the deletion of the Orders&mdash;we cannot amend them&mdash; relating to wheaten breakfast foods where 100 per cent. is put on, and to these cheaper quality shirts, and the two items regarding agricultural machinery.</P>
    <P>Senator McQuire has told us most vehemently that he is not in favour of protecting inefficient industry, and quite genuinely he misunderstood my references to him earlier on.  I never mistook him for one who defended this stupid and excessive protection.  I think anybody who knows his record knows that he does not stand for that kind of protection of inefficient industry; and he will see from the report that I never even implied that he did. On the contrary, I implied that he is the sort of representative of Irish industry and commerce who would strongly favour the reduction of tariffs and the abolition of them where possible. His speech to-night confirmed that view of mine.  I do find it most disappointing, though, when, having said what he did say, he then says he is in favour of these 15 new tariffs, some of them going up to 100 per cent., and is prepared to vote for the Bill. I find that disappointing, and I hope there will be some other Senators who will support me when I beg leave, on the Committee Stage, to propose a recommendation regarding these four deletions from the Schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGuire referred to the possible advent of the Free Trade Area in Europe and the need to keep that in mind when considering applications for new tariffs. It must be clearly understood&mdash;Senator Sheehy Skeffington has not understood it, apparently&mdash;that any agreement for the establishment of a Free Trade Area in Europe will not merely involve arrangements for the gradual removal of tariffs but also for the removal of unfair trade practices.  The agreement will certainly provide that action can be taken by any country against dumping, as it will be defined in the agreement.</P>
      <P>It will provide, I hope, for the elimination of cartels, which distort trade, and thus give full play to competition and give access on equal terms to raw materials for the industries of all countries.  It will certainly necessitate the abolition of the dual price system for iron and steel which operates in Britain.  Until these conditions exist, until Irish industry is given the opportunity of competing upon equal terms with the industries of other countries, then clearly we will have need to protect them, and the right to protect them, in circumstances where these conditions are not fulfilled, perhaps even under a free trade arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at present to forecast when, if at all, such an agreement will be made and what its exact terms will be.  In so far as there is a draft agreement at present&mdash;and at present there is not very much of a draft&mdash;it contemplates that the tariffs which are regarded as effective for the purpose of the agreement will be those in force on 1st September, 1957.  In our case, however, and in the case of some other countries, arrangements will I hope be made to permit of the operation of some other effective date.  Indeed, the negotiations have now proceeded over such a length of time that that date is probably regarded as inapplicable to the whole arrangement.  The aim of protection is to get industries in a position, by giving them an adequate market in which to operate, to increase their efficiency and acquire that stability in their operations which will <Col N="337" /> enable them to meet the impact of competition from abroad when it comes.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington said that I promised a change of policy.  I do not think I ever, in any statement, even by implication suggested that no new tariffs were going to be imposed no matter what the circumstances.  If one is to start thinking about operating a descending scale of tariffs the wisdom of doing it at present would be very doubtful, at the present stage of the free trade negotiations.  I have said that in the circumstances that are likely to arise in the future protection as a instrument of industrial development looks like being less important than in the past.  I believe that to be so but the granting of protection in the circumstances such as are now arising is not merely necessary for the preservation of our existing industrial organisations but is justifiable in that the competition which some of our industries are meeting can accurately be described as unfair.</P>
    <P>In regard to the particular duties to which the Senator referred I would point out that he was wrong in one statement.  One Order in fact removes a duty and one reduces another, so that obviously the Senator has not studied them very carefully.  I would like to make some comment on the four duties he referred to, in order to make an effort to ensure that no member of this House will be foolish enough to support him in making recommendations for their revocation.  In regard to the wheaten breakfast foods concerned, the duties were imposed following a review by the Industrial Development Authority of the position, at the request of the British Government&mdash;which was entitled to make that request under the Trade Agreement-for the substitution of a quantitative restriction by a custom duty.</P>
    <P>We guarantee the price for wheat and the firms making this product here use 100 per cent. Irish wheat.  If these firms were not given that protection it is obvious that they would not be able to remain in business, against the competition of firms which can obtain wheat at very much lower prices than that which we guarantee to our producers. <Col N="338" /> The firms making wheaten breakfast food are very efficient firms, as it happens.  They are all associated with world-wide organisations and able to avail of technical advice of a high standard, so I do not think anybody can suggest that they are not working efficiently.  I feel sure that if they could be assured their raw material at the price which their competitors abroad get it that they also could produce at the same price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a wheaten breakfast food.  The Senator and Senator Sheehy Skeffington must give full credit to the ingenuity of the Revenue Commissioners who can interpret all these terms with remarkable skill.</P>
      <P>With regard to shirts, this problem of low-price textiles and textile goods from Hong Kong and Far Eastern countries is, of course, of world-wide concern.  It is not merely a problem for us; it is one of the considerations which are being constantly borne in mind by those engaged in a European Free Trade Area because it has a bearing there, too.  We have here a shirt manufacturing industry which is not merely well established but is of a very substantial scale.  Its output exceeds £1,000,000 in value and it employs over 2,000 workers.  The number of firms engaged in it is large and they are in close competition with each other and, facing competition from countries in which social conditions are similar to our own, I am sure they could stand up to it in the export market, but it is unreasonable to expect them to meet the kind of competition which they are encountering from Far Eastern sources.  Indeed, no country in Europe could meet that competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty on agricultural forks is another one of the duties with which Senator Sheehy Skeffington is concerned. He will be interested to know that we have a number of firms in this country making these forks more efficiently than in England.  Their prices are lower than for those made in England and they are even exporting <Col N="339" /> their products to Britain.  It is a fair standard for judging any Irish agricultural industry, if it can beat the British price.</P>

      <P>There are certain international obligations which prevent us imposing duties on the products of a single country.  At any rate that industry is one that I am very glad to be able to help.  If I can prevent it being undermined by the unfair importation which it had to meet last year its development is assured.  Its quite remarkable efficiency has been disclosed by its achievements.  It is an industry which I must say was subjected to review in all its aspects and operations by the Industrial Development Authority and the report of the authority was such as to justify me in making that statement regarding its efficiency.</P>
      <P>As far as agricultural machinery is concerned that is a matter on which we have had a lot of discussion, in and out of the Dáil, and the policy of the Government in that regard has been made very clear.  We believe it is desirable that we should aim at making here all the agricultural machinery which can be economically produced. We believe that is being done at the present time.  Indeed, the prices of Irish agricultural machinery compare quite favourably with the prices at which such agricultural machinery can be imported but that can only be maintained if the volume of their output can be assured to the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem, however, regarding the design and quality of Irish agricultural machinery produced here <Col N="340" /> to meet all the needs of Irish farmers. I have been urging that the farming organisations and the machinery manufacturers, instead of sniping at each other at long range, should get together and establish some type of organisation which can keep them in constant touch, and ensure that any complaints regarding quality and design of the machinery produced here will be attended to and rectified.</P>
    <P>I have met the machinery manufacturers and discussed that matter with them, and I have their assurance that they would be only too anxious to enter into an arrangement of that kind. I hope the farming organisations which have been doing some campaigning against them will be equally willing and, if that arrangement is made, it will be to everyone's benefit.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, an organisation set up under the auspices of the Government in 1956 to carry out certain tests on agricultural machinery and some ploughs were tested.  The results of the test were not to the disrepute of the Irish plough, and these tests can be continued in relation to other types of machinery at any time. The committee set up in 1956 was not given any money and the problem of who is going to pay for future tests is not yet solved.  The committee is still in existence and if any organisation of farmers wants to avail of it, as a means by which the suitability of design and standard of quality of Irish agricultural machinery can be tested, they are free to do so.  Personally, I would prefer to see the Government out of this.  It seems to be common sense to suggest that the producers of the machinery and the farming organisations should get together and do this work for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have said that the instrument of protection will be less effective in future in producing the type of industrial development that we desire.  That is because we must now seek industrial development in the form of undertakings planned from the start for export business, but it is clear that until we can assure the manufacturers of conditions of fair competition protection must be continued for the meantime.</P>

    <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to deal with the other three recommendations which I propose to move, on recommendation No. 1.  The other recommendations relate to boys' and men's shirts and agricultural implements and machines.  If a vote is to be taken, it should be taken separately on each.</P>
    <P>With reference to wheaten breakfast foods, the Minister has told us that these manufacturers have to use a great deal of Irish wheat and therefore their costs are high and consequently they need increasing protection. I understand the price of wheat has dropped.  There has been a lot of noise because the price has dropped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the Minister is telling us that they need 100 per cent. protection for these Irish goods.  I think the packet of wheaten breakfast food which costs 1/10 retail can be sold at a profit in some shops for as low as 1/4, and sometimes less. I would suggest that there is a big margin there and possibly these firms are pricing their products too high and are seeking for protection which is not justified.  I think, in any event, that a 100 per cent. duty is too high, and if I had the opportunity of proposing a reduction in the duty I would do so, but in the Seanad we can only suggest it be deleted, enabling the Minister to introduce a fresh Order. Our powers extend only to delete.</P>
      <P>On the question of cheaper shirts, I think it is monstrous that we should add a duty of 4/- on boys' shirts to the original value of not more than 5/-. We are here hitting the poorer sections of the community.  Protection of this size is unwarranted.  It transforms a shirt made at 5/- into a 9/- shirt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to agricultural components the Minister has told us that these forks can undersell the British equivalent; yet he is asking for a 20 per cent. duty on U.K. imports.  I do not know how he justifies that and I do not know how the Seanad takes his justification. He refers to some Continental countries, <Col N="343" /> but in fact he is putting 20 per cent. on the U.K. and Canada and 30 per cent. on others.  Furthermore, he tells us that we are underselling the British in their own market.  I am not convinced by the Minister's argument, and it is time we resisted the further imposition on the agricultural community of the extra charges caused by these protective duties, particularly when, out of the Minister's mouth, we are informed that they are not necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as wheaten breakfast foods are concerned, I have explained that the review of the protection given there was requested by the British Government under the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  That review was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority who were required by the terms of the agreement to consider what protection was needed, having regard to the relative cost of economic and efficient production.  It was the Industrial Development Authority, in the report it made to the Government, following that review, that recommended the imposition of duties at this rate.  It made that recommendation to my predecessor and it was the previous Government which acted upon it. I think that they rightly regarded themselves as obliged to act upon the report of the Industrial Development Authority which carried out this formal review under the provisions of the trade agreement.  If the Senator's recommendation was adopted, the result would be to increase the protection <Col N="344" /> these people are receiving by restoring quantitative restrictions.</P>
      <P>In regard to shirts, I have nothing more to say.  It is possible for us to buy shirts made in Hong Kong and other foreign places much cheaper than we can make them ourselves.  If we decided to avail of these cheaper shirts, we would be putting 2,000 workers out of employment in this country, and I cannot recommend the Seanad to do that.</P>
      <P>In the case of forks, the Senator completely misunderstands the situation. The effect of the withdrawal of the duty would be to undermine the position of the Irish industry and increase the price of forks.  They manufacture these forks cheaper than we can get them from Britain, because they have the whole of the market.  If that position was undermined by the dumping of these goods from Continental countries, the effect would be an increase in the price of these forks for Irish farmers, rather than a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this amending Order arises out of certain evasions of the principal Order which was being operated.  The original Order, Quota Order No. 13, restricts the importation of woven piece goods and synthetic and artificial fabrics. There was an exemption for brocade and tapestry cloth.  That exemption was designed to exclude from the scope of the Order furnishing fabrics of a kind which was not produced by the Irish mills.  It was reported, however, that bedspread material of synthetic composition was being imported under that exemption and the effect of the amending Order is to bring within the scope of the control of the No. 13 Order brocade and tapestry cloth which exceeds 56 inches in width.  Bedspread material which is similar in type to the material being imported is being manufactured by a couple of firms here.</P>
      <P>There is a customs duty on made-up bedspreads and on bedspread material and, of course, bedspread material is subject to the import restrictions on another quota Order.  That protection is being rendered ineffective by the importation under that exemption in Quota Order No. 13 of these synthetic brocade materials up to 90 inches in width, which is described as material for making into bedspreads and quilts. Furnishing fabrics and tapestry cloths do not normally exceed 56 inches in width and therefore the <i>bona fide</i> importation of such materials will not be affected by the change made here which limits the exemption in the Order to brocade and tapestry cloth less than 56 inches in width.</P>

      <P>There are two short points arising from this proposal. I notice that the original Order was apparently not drafted in such a way as to meet the situation, and that some of what the Minister himself described as &ldquo;sea lawyers&rdquo; in the commercial world soon found a way out. The second point is that when, just now, I suggested that a certain Order was not sufficiently clear, the Minister assured me in tones of sarcasm that the Revenue Commissioners were quite competent to see to that, and that they are extremely good at detecting this and that type of attempted evasion. Within five minutes, he comes before us and tells us that there was originally an exemption in this Order for brocade and tapestry cloths, and that the commercial people interested found a way out and evaded the provisions of the Order, and now he comes back with an amendment.  I am not denying that an amending Order may be necessary, but it rather lessens the Minister's right to suggest that the previous Order is couched in such language that <Col N="347" /> the Revenue Commissioners are quite certain that it cannot be evaded.  Here, we have an example of an Order which was so evaded.</P>

    <Title>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to redefine the investments in which trustees may invest trust moneys, unless expressly forbidden by the instrument (if any) creating the trust. It does not amend the general law relating to trusts, but merely that section of the law which affords guidance to trustees who, in the instrument of trust, are given no specific direction or authority regarding the investment of trust funds.</P>
      <P>The basic statute relating to trustee investments is the Trustee Act, 1893, as amended and extended by subsequent British and Irish statutes and by the rules of the High Court and the Supreme Court.  At present a wide range of statutes, and the rules of court, have to be consulted to ascertain what are trustee investments, and there is doubt about the trustee qualifications of some of the securities mentioned in the earlier British Acts. Furthermore, some investments included in the authorised trustee list are not appropriate to the circumstances of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, consolidates the list of authorised trustee securities and, at the same time, amends it so as to make it more appropriate to current Irish conditions.  It takes into account, where appropriate, various points raised by interested bodies, including the Central Bank, the Irish Banks Standing Committee, the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges, the Federation of Irish Industries, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Chief Justice, <Col N="348" /> the President of the High Court and the Superior Courts Rule-making Committee.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains the amended and consolidated list of authorised trustee investments.  This list is, broadly, the 1893 list, as extended and varied by subsequent enactments, with the exclusion of foreign securities, other than British Government securities inscribed or registered in the State, and with the addition of certain Irish investments such as deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Banks, certain local authority stocks and debentures or debenture stocks of certain Irish industrial and commercial companies.</P>
    <P>Foreign securities have, in general, been excluded from the authorised list because they are outside the jurisdiction and because it is inappropriate that trustees should have statutory authority for investing trust funds outside the State, particularly when capital for domestic needs is scarce and there is an adequate range of Irish investments suitable for trust moneys. British Government securities registered or inscribed in the State have, however, been retained in the list in deference to the view expressed that their inclusion would provide a more gradual approach to the intention of the Bill and would enable trustees to avail of the convenience of a local register.</P>
    <P>Since 1922, the nominal value of British Government securities on the Irish Register has diminished from £100,000,000 to its present figure of £40,000,000 and, as no new securities are being added, the existing securities will eventually disappear from the register.  The retention of these securities in the list does not therefore involve a departure from the principle that, ultimately, foreign securities should not have trustee status.</P>
    <P>The total nominal value of the quoted securities included in the new authorised list is about £314,000,000; this total does not cover items which are not quoted on a Stock Exchange, such as bank deposits, savings certificates and real securities.  In recent years arrangements have been made to improve the marketability of governmental <Col N="349" /> and certain other securities in the revised list, and I am satisfied that it will provide trustees with adequate investment outlets.  If, however, this expectation is not realised, the Bill provides machinery in Section 2 whereby the list can be varied, as considered necessary from time to time. Variations will be effected by Orders which will be made after consultation with outside bodies and which will not come into effect until they have been approved by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill relates to the investment of moneys under the control of the courts.  The power of the courts to add to the trustee list was provided in the 1893 Act, and, while this power was restricted by Section 13 of the Approved Investments Act, 1933, the courts were left authority to invest court moneys as they saw fit to prescribe.  Given an adequate range of trustee investments specifically authorised by an Act of the Oireachtas, there is no case for a separate court list, and Section 3 of the Bill accordingly prescribes the same investment list for court moneys as for trustee funds.  The section preserves, however, the existing jurisdiction of the courts to apply court moneys to the running of a family farm or business or in the purchase of securities issued <Col N="350" /> on favourable terms to existing security-holders.</P>
    <P>Section 4 enables trustees to effect redeemable bond insurance policies, and to charge the premiums against income or capital, or partly against income or partly against capital.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains a saver for existing trustee and court investments. Provided they comply with the present authorised list, they need not be disturbed merely because they may happen to be excluded from the new list.  Previous enactments which conferred trustee status on certain investments are repealed by Section 6.  Section 7 provides that the Bill will not come into operation until three months after it has been passed.  This waiting period will give adequate notice to trustees with money in course of investment.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration, and passed.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.50 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 16th April, 1958.</P>
