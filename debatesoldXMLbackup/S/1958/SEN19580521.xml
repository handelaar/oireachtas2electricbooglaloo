    <P>Bill received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill passes, there are a few observations I wish to make.  On the Second Reading, I called the attention of the House to the fact that a decision was reached <Col N="439" /> in the Supreme Court which had a direct bearing on many provisions in this Bill.  The Minister for Health in reply to the debate on the Second Reading, referred to the points which I had raised and made some observations which, I think, should be commented upon.  I do not think this Bill, which, in its Long Title, is expressed to be a Bill for the improvement and development of the greyhound industry and for the better control of greyhound race tracks and coursing grounds, will achieve that purpose.  I had hoped the Minister would consider it more seriously than he did, for, in my view, the Bill will lead to confusion.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Oireachtas has only such powers as are given to it under the Constitution.  The Constitution is the Constitution which the people have given themselves, and in that Constitution it has been ordained, as I said, very specifically what the powers of the Oireachtas are in regard to legislating.  I do not think it would be easy to find a more positive obligation in the whole of the Constitution than that which is laid on the Oireachtas in Article 15, paragraph 4, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to this Constitution or any provision thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>However, the Minister for Health adopts the view that the Oireachtas can legislate in any way it likes.</P>

      <P>Matters contained in the Bill itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This relates to the Bill.  The Bill provides certain matters which are in conflict with the Constitution and it is proposed, therefore, that this Bill should be considered in the light of the provisions in the Constitution, and, in particular on this occasion, in the light of the provisions of the Article to which I have referred.  I do not think <Col N="440" /> it is any answer to say that there is a procedure by which defects and deficiencies in a Bill can be remedied.  On the basis of that argument, if I took the Minister's car, I could say to him: &ldquo;I can do that all right, but you have a remedy.  You can go to the courts and prosecute me for larceny.&rdquo;  That is the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister.  He says: &ldquo;It is unconstitutional. That is all right.  There is a procedure provided in the Constitution to remedy that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill will give rise to a great deal of confusion in the greyhound industry. I have considered whether it was possible to amend it on Committee Stage, but it is so honeycombed with unconstitutional provisions that I found it would be quite impossible to put down any amendments to it.  I regret that the Minister for Health did not adopt the course of revising the Bill in the light of the constitutional requirements to which I have referred.  I think that, far from improving the greyhound racing industry, a stage will be reached when there will be utter chaos and confusion among those associated with that industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have listened to a rather unusual pronouncement.  We are told that certain provisions of this Bill are repugnant to the Constitution.  We are told that by a member of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas has nothing to do with the interpretation of legislation.  We have the right to legislate and, naturally, we must legislate with due regard to the provisions of the Constitution, but we are not entitled and we are not expected as judges to interpret the provisions of the Constitution or to limit our legislation by what we, as individuals, may think is or is not repugnant to the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what is being done.  There was no argument. We were told that this Bill was honeycombed with unconstitutional provisions. <Col N="441" /> There was no attempt to argue what particular provision was repugnant to the Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to accept what Senator O'Quigley may say as if he were the judge in this matter, then of course Senator O'Quigley can dominate the whole Legislature.  He can say what is or what is not repugnant to the Constitution. He can determine for himself what this House or both Houses of the Oireachtas will or will not do, and even what the President will not do.  That is not the conception of the relations between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary which is embodied in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I in earnest?  At least I did not burn the midnight oil preparing my speech.  I am dealing with the point raised with Senator O'Quigley.  He thinks that the Bill is repugnant to the Constitution.  That is his opinion.  I am saying: &ldquo;Very well; that is no reason why this House should be bound by the opinion of Senator O'Quigley.&rdquo;  Now we have got to this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor by the Minister's opinion, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If there is a difference of opinion between the Minister and the majority of Dáil Éireann and perhaps the majority in this House on the one hand and Senator O'Quigley, on the other&mdash;I do not know about the majority in this House; I cannot speak for the majority of this House but I can speak for the majority of Dáil Éireann&mdash;if there is a difference of opinion about the provisions <Col N="442" /> of this Bill, the difference as to repugnancy cannot be settled in this House.  The Constitution provides a tribunal which can settle this matter. In spite of what Senator O'Quigley has said about the Bill being honeycombed with unconstitutional provisions, after all there is the Supreme Court to decide the question and I have legal advisers to advise me in regard to it. I am sure they are just as competent to interpret the law and construe the provisions of a statute as Senator O'Quigley.  They have advised me that there is nothing in this Bill which is repugnant to the Constitution.  I am not saying they are infallible, but they are certainly less likely to be wrong, having regard to their knowledge of the law and their background of legal training, than a member of the Oireachtas is, no matter how august he may be.  On that basis, there is no point in the argument which has been raised here.  There has not been any other objection to the Bill, except that one point.  I do not think there is any reason why the Seanad should hesitate to pass the Bill in the form in which it is now before it.  If it should happen that any of the provisions are repugnant to the Constitution, I am perfectly certain that those affected by the Bill will be in a position to bring their case to the Constitution Tribunal and have their doubts resolved there.</P>

    <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, I wish to say the amendments Nos. 1 and 2, standing in the names of Senator <Col N="443" /> Burke and Senator Barry, are out of order and may not be moved.  Both these amendments are in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been given to understand that if a tea wholesaler wishes to become a member of this company, he must subscribe £2,500 in £1 ordinary shares.  If that is so, does that not effectively keep out of the company most of the traders we know in the provincial towns who have traditionally been in the tea trade for several generations?  Furthermore, why has this very high figure been put in? Perhaps the Minister can give me some information on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator misunderstands the intention of the Bill.  Traders in provincial towns were never importers of tea.  They purchased their requirements from tea wholesalers.  The purpose of this company is to organise the tea wholesalers of Ireland so as to ensure that the importation of tea will be organised and its resale to the retailers will be conducted in the normal manner.</P>
      <P>It is to be assumed that any person who will engage in the business of purchasing tea in the countries where it is produced and shipping it directly to this country will require to handle fairly substantial quantities, if he is to do so economically.  Consequently, the minimum shareholding prescribed&mdash; which is also the maximum&mdash;is not out of line with the volume of business which they will be doing.  I should point out that the constitution does not provide for £1 shares.  It provides for shares of £2,500.  No person can hold more than one share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says, in essence, that anybody who wishes to take part as a shareholder <Col N="444" /> must subscribe £2,500.  That is the appointed amount he must subscribe. I disagree with the Minister entirely. I know people who have been importing tea for generations.  They have been buying the tea on the biggest market in the world, in London, where slightly more than half of the entire tea of the world is landed.</P>
      <P>As I understand the meaning of the language we are using here, if the tea is bought in London, it is certainly imported.  One of these people said to me that this legislation means that if he has not, loose, a sum of £2,500, he will be ruled out of that business, although he might require the money for some other purpose.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister that this Bill will give an unfair advantage to the bigger business people as against the smaller business people.  We ought to lean over in favour of the smaller business people, some of whom have been doing this business for two, three, four or five generations.  I think we should lean over in their favour rather than in favour of the bigger people in the bigger towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister does not want to hear me on this Bill again.  However, Senator Burke is of course quite right in what he says. The provision in relation to the £2,500 has already effectively diminished the number of registered tea wholesalers in this country by 50 per cent. as only 50 per cent. of the existing registered tea wholesalers have agreed to come into the new scheme.  However, that is part and parcel of the legislation and I shall not object at this stage.</P>
      <P>What precise difference will there be between tea merchants who do not join this company and who import tea from the East and who have to import it through the company machine? What precise difference will there be in the advantage or disadvantage that will accrue to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Barry has available to him information as to how this company, which has not yet been formed, will operate.  I have not that information.  He tells me that half of the existing tea wholesalers of the country will not become members of the company.  That may be so; I do not know.  The register has not been opened yet and therefore I cannot give him any precise information.</P>
      <P>Any tea wholesaler who wants to register may do so.  He can join this company if he wants to, but there is no compulsion on him to join it.  So far as his operations in the future are concerned, the company will give him the same services, and is obliged to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company will have no interest in charging excessive fees in order to make profits because the distribution of dividends is limited. So far as it is possible for legislation to impose safeguards against misuse of the company's powers, the safeguards are there.  The company will consist of the registered tea wholesalers of Ireland who will elect their directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not difficult to believe that a person who subscribes £2,500 to become a shareholder of a company and to be on a register will be in precisely the same position as a colleague who does not?  To a person who does not know anything about tea except to drink it, that argument does not make sense.  People I know who have businesses and keep shops are not like that.  Even professors are not like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to people who keep shops, and to whom Deputy Burke referred also, I have this to say: the people who are concerned with this legislation are tea wholesalers, people who import tea in bulk from the country in which it is produced, blend it and sell the blended tea to retailers.  The ordinary tea retailer <Col N="446" /> of this country is not concerned with this arrangement.</P>
      <P>For a number of years past, the position in this country has been that all the tea is imported through Tea Importers (Éire), Ltd.  They sell that tea in an unblended condition to the registered wholesalers, who blend it and subsequently resell it to retailers. Therefore, no retailer has been buying tea in London for years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the types of dealers to whom Deputy Burke referred in provincial towns have been importing big quantities through markets in which they are sold by the countries of origin.  That source is now denied them.  I shall be satisfied if we can get to a stage here where the importer will be enabled to buy to his satisfaction.  We want to import our original teas and to do our own blending. I do not care where we get the tea so long as I can taste it first, before I buy it.  That is my only objection to the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are people all over the country and they import more than half the total quantity of tea imported into this country: I am thinking now of towns such as Clonmel, Galway, and so on&mdash; apart altogether from Cork&mdash;where there are substantial buyers of tea. If you look at the list of registered tea wholesalers, you will see that quite a number of them are in those towns. Surely those people cannot be expected to find £2,500 as well as the £15,000, the £20,000, the £30,000, and so on, which they will require in order to get into this eastern market.  They will be injured.  To what extent will they be injured?  What advantage will there be to those who come into this new company?  Only 50 have come into it so far and that 50 will diminish until they can be counted on the fingers of one hand after one year.  Eventually, the three big English firms here which will remain here will control imports into this country.  I do not want the advantage given to them by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Barry says that only 50 per cent. of the registered tea wholesalers of this country are on the list so far as he <Col N="447" /> knows, he is putting the facts in a false light.  Any tea wholesaler can become a member of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is referring to the fact that, of the existing register of tea wholesalers, 50 have already declared their intention of becoming shareholders; but, if the other 50 or 40, or whatever additional number it may be, want to become shareholders, they are entitled to become shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to permit, under the powers given to him in Section 2, that wholesalers be allowed to become members of the company at a fee, say, of £500.  No one is going to lodge £500 with the company in order just to be registered as a tea wholesaler, if he is not doing that business at present.  I am afraid the conditions that exist among the people in country towns have not been sufficiently considered in this Bill, and I do not think it was the Minister's intention to exclude these people.  As Senator Barry has said, they have been buying original samples and have been blending tea for generations.  I know one man whose father established a firm 50 years ago.  He was approached by a big firm to sell packaged tea some time ago and he told them that, while the sign which his father had put up over the door remained, he would continue to sell his own tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big blenders will have advantages over the smaller men in the country towns.  I am afraid the smaller men are being done a serious disservice under this Bill, and I am asking the Minister to see if he could substitute that figure and arrange, under the powers given in Section 2, that tea wholesalers be allowed to become members of the company for £500 rather than £2,500.  The larger subscription is keeping a number of these people out.  We can all imagine family businesses who may have to consider <Col N="448" /> £2,500 a considerable sum of money, particularly at the moment because banks and credit institutions are inclined to tighten their belts.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this matter seriously and I think he would be doing a great service if he met this point.  We should be determined to protect the smaller man.  In this country, he is not being protected. Every single piece of legislation helping enterprise is in favour of big business.</P>

      <P>The company must get capital to carry on its business somehow.  It has to get that capital from its shareholders.  It was estimated that £250,000 would be required in subscribed capital to enable the company to operate.  We know there are not quite 100 tea wholesalers in this country.  The shareholding provisions were drawn up on that basis, that, if every single tea wholesaler elected to become a shareholder, the full capital required would be met.</P>

      <P>If it is to be limited, what is in the Minister's mind as to what these people will earn on their investment of £2,500, that is, the people who have the big money?  At all events, it means that some people will be excluded because they have not got that much money.</P>

He said he could invest it better than in this company. It is only reasonable in any group that the bigger people should be expected to put in more, but the jumps should not be put too high.  I must press the Minister to consider that.  I have not spoken to anyone who has been traditionally in the tea trade in the Provinces who was not against that provision.  It is not that they dislike the Bill.  Most of them say they want to buy tea wherever they can and in the best way.  They want freedom of action, but this precludes many of them from being members of the company.  I do not see any reason why larger people should not put up £5,000, if they think it necessary, if they think it will be of advantage to the trade and, being in the trade, will be an advantage to them.</P>

The dividend limitation about which Senator Baxter is talking is not in my mind; it is in the articles of association&mdash;a dividend of 2 per cent. in excess of the rate charged to their customers by Irish banks, or 10 per cent., whichever is the higher.</P>

People outside the company will get the same service as those in the company are entitled to get.</P>

      <P>Let me put it this way. I buy 100 chests of tea in Calcutta which cost £25 per chest.  I have to hand the importation over completely to this company to bring it home.  I cannot find yet what the company propose to charge me for their services for bringing it home.  I want to find out am I buying at a disadvantage in not being a member of the company.  I know I am putting it clearly and that the Minister can understand what I am saying.  I want to know do I suffer a disadvantage in not being a member of the company, and using the facilities which the company provides.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the articles of association to which the Minister referred have been laid on the Table of the House and I may not have looked them up; they may be there, but I have not seen them.  Arising from that, there is this point, that there can be further alteration in the memorandum of association with the permission of the Minister, and the Houses of the Oireachtas may know nothing at all about the matter.  We are giving power to the Minister to control this company.  We are creating a monopoly.  Probably it is appreciated by the majority in this House that there is a need to control the tea trade in the national interest.  We are doing so by the device of a company which is in fact a co-operative of the main tea importers; and the Minister is taking power to control them.  The Minister, in turn, is not to be in any way responsible to the Oireachtas in the matter.</P>
      <P>When we give power like this to a Minister under legislation, we usually require that any orders he makes shall be laid on the Table of the Oireachtas. If this section goes through, the Minister may allow a change in the articles of association at any time and the Houses of the Oireachtas would not be any the wiser; it would not be drawn to their attention.  I wonder would the Minister say whether there is any provision in the Bill, or would it be his intention, that any changes would in fact be drawn to the notice of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of creating a monopoly, I am ending one.  The present situation is that there is a complete monopoly in the importing of tea in the hands of the existing organisation.  I am bringing that to an end.  There is being substituted for <Col N="453" /> the present system a new system that allows any tea merchant in the country, retailer or wholesaler, to buy his tea wherever he likes, provided he buys it in the country in which it is produced. This, however, establishes another organisation which will be set up by the tea trade, controlled by the tea trade and which will have the obligation of organising the bulk shipment of that tea direct to this country.</P>
      <P>So far as the future is concerned, the Minister and the Government will be completely out of the tea business and there will be no Government supervision or control exercised at all in relation to the tea trade.  That situation will continue as long as the company set up by the tea trade conforms to the articles of association which they have now prepared and which have been published to the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the articles may be changed with the permission of the Minister later without anybody knowing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that I said the company would act unfairly. I did not.  I did not even suggest that the company would act unfairly.  They would be very imprudent and foolish to act unfairly; and if they did, they would be very likely to draw on their heads the Minister's displeasure.  However, I am firmly convinced from the people who have spoken to me whom I know are in this trade, that the Minister should allow the smaller people in the country to take part. They have been traditional wholesalers, traditional purchasers of original samples of tea.  They are people whose business has been established in country towns and which has grown up traditionally there.  One must have regard to these people.  I would hate to see the country in the state where all the important business people were in Dublin.  That would mean looking on Dublin as a sort of economic &ldquo;Pale&rdquo; with people outside to whom things would be sold, rather than that those people would do the original work themselves.  Some of those people are experts in the handling of this trade and it is a traditional business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy said this would be a <Col N="454" /> co-operative society.  It struck me that one might as well say, in the case of a co-operative society for dairy farmers, that the only men allowed in would be the men with 100 cows.  That would not be a co-operative and in the tea business, this only allows in the man who has £2,500 ready for shares.  I say to the Minister that, in the interests of all, and so that this trade may be preserved and expanded, I would rather see it expanded in the country than in the city.  These country wholesalers or merchants who wish to come in as wholesalers cannot be let in under £2,500.  Undoubtedly the bigger people who would see the benefits which the Minister says will result from this Bill would have no objection, in my opinion, if the benefits are there, to providing or putting up twice the amount they are putting up at the present moment.  We all have a duty to protect the smaller trader, the smaller capitalist or whatever you like to call him.  In my opinion, he is an important man&mdash;not the big operator here in Dublin, Cork or some other city.</P>

The Minister has had considerable experience in business and he knows if business people attend some business meeting, no matter what vows of secrecy there may be, they all talk about business and that is one of the advantages of business meetings.  The smaller people in the country will be kept out and this is to be kept in a little select group in Dublin or Cork&mdash; and I dislike that.</P>

      <P>I am interested only in the proposition that it is in the interests of the consumers of tea in this country that we should do our own buying of tea where it is produced and ship it into our own ports, and not buy where the London wholesalers would be the predominant influence, on the English market.  The only figures I can give in relation to costs either in Britain or here are average figures, and Senator Barry will be quick to point out that in relation to tea an average import price can be misleading, without having information as to the influence of quality on that price, but average prices will do for my purpose in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average price of tea imported into this country from the countries of origin in 1956 was 5.8d. per lb. less <Col N="457" /> than the average price of tea imported into Britain.  That, at least, suggests that Tea Importers Limited were buying as advantageously&mdash;I will not put it any stronger&mdash;as the British merchants.  The figure I want to compare with that is the average price of tea which was exported from Britain, and I find that it was 1/3½d. more than the average price at which tea was imported here from the countries of origin.  The difference between these two figures is interesting.  It means that the British wholesale merchants were charging for the service they rendered to the people who bought tea from them 10d. per lb.

      <P>I do not think that the Minister has been well informed.  There are classifications of tea, not vague and loose groupings, and I know that &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; were available on the English market at 1/6 a lb. under the Irish prices a month ago.  I have been able to identify every chest I bought by its markings, and I never paid more than 2d. a lb. to any dealer for bringing it from London.  The Minister can give those figures but I can quote figures as well.</P>

      <P>The Minister has sidetracked the point that Senator Murphy and myself made, arising from the information he gave us on the Memorandum and Articles of Association.  When the banks in this country subscribed originally to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, there was a guarantee of 5 per cent.  In the thirties, that was regarded as excessive when money could he had for 3 per cent.  Here we have a company getting 2 per cent. more than the bank rate, or 10 per cent., whichever is the higher. I am not suggesting that this is a big thing in relation to this transaction, <Col N="458" /> an import of tea amounting to £5,000,000.  It is the principle that I am speaking about.  In the case of Cement Ltd., perhaps I did not agree altogether with the people who went up to 10 per cent., and I wanted it limited to 8 per cent.  The circumstances were rather different from these, where there is a specific guaranteed dividend handed to a State monopoly company.  You can twist words as you like, but that is what it means.  If we are to pay 10 per cent. for purposes of this sort for State companies, let us have it that way. Everybody will then know what the cost is, but if it was 1 per cent. over the bank rate, or even 2 per cent. over the bank rate, I do not think anybody could have any serious objection to it. If and when the Labour Party come back into power in Britain, as they very shortly will according to the forecasts I read in the Sunday papers, the rate will come down to 5 or perhaps 4 or 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>This is trifling.  So far as I am concerned, my interest was to ensure that there should be no incentive to this company so to operate its business as to maximise its profits, and therefore I insisted on some limitation of its dividend distribution.  The limit proposed is quite reasonable from my point of view.  My concern is to ensure that this company will have no interest whatever in operating its business except to facilitate the trade. Might I say a final word in that connection? I am prepared to proceed on the assumption that the great majority of the tea traders of Ireland are honest men.</P>

      <P>Really, this is ridiculous.  This is the second time to-day we have had this kind of thing.  I did not intervene before because I did not think it was my territory.  This is just chasing around the mulberry bush.  What does it show?  It shows the complete change in outlook, and proves that the Government Party has become a right-wing Tory Party up to the hilt.  It is the principle that I am interested in, not the quantity of money involved.  The Minister is right when he says it is 10 per cent. of <Col N="459" /> £250,000, but there is the fundamental principle that this co-operative monopoly have the dividend fixed at 10 per cent., whereas in co-operative companies the dividend is not in excess of 5 per cent.  I would prefer that he should say that the rate would be 1 per cent. or perhaps 2 per cent. over the bank rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate what Senator O'Donovan has said. He has rather helped me.  I have got information which has surprised me. He has borne in upon me that my comparison with a co-operative society is fairly sound, and that co-operatives have a legal maximum of 5 per cent. This is a co-operative and I think that in the very same circumstances the dividend which should be payable to the shareholders in this company should equally be limited to 5 per cent. If it is limited to 5 per cent., instead of taking the money in dividends will they not equally benefit as ordinary tea importers, as people in the trade? The Minister is right in taking a measure of control over them and in seeing that they, as shareholders in the company, should not be in too advantageous a position over the other tea merchants.  I would again press the Minister about this question of the dividend.  Ten per cent. is pretty high because it is&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;a co-operative.  There is no risk that I can see.</P>

      <P>Let us get down to mathematics.  Senator Barry is right in one respect.  The information is that about 50 wholesalers will become shareholders and the total subscribed capital will be about £125,000.  Assuming they paid a maximum dividend they will be paying out £12,500 per year less tax.  The trade we are talking about runs into millions of pounds and at the moment the Government, I think, has guaranteed the overdraft for Tea Importers Limited for almost £5,000,000.  Is not this a mere bagatelle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  If C.I.E. increased their fares by a halfpenny, you may say to the ordinary person it is a bagatelle, but they can get a lot of money then from such an increase, and everyone, in effect, is a consumer of tea.  It should be in the Minister's interests to keep the price as low as possible.  I could not accept the argument that it is a mere bagatelle. It is still 10 per cent.  I suggest that it is too much to take out of a business which cannot in fact lose any money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this company can charge only for the service it renders.  Ten per cent. is rather high and I think they will not have to impost to get that.  The Minister has reassured me that there will be no danger that they will put those who are not members of the company at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister between now and the next stage to examine the position with regard to the wholesalers in the country.  I should like him to consult some of them.  Taking the long view, I think it would be shocking to think that tea will be handled by a small group in <Col N="461" /> Dublin or Cork who have the £2,500 to put down, while people in other places, such as Kilkenny or Clonmel, have not.

      <P>This section provides for the cancellation of the register of registered tea traders and the cancellation will be effected by the Minister. I should like to ask the Minister what kind of rules he is going to apply, or what will the Minister for Industry and Commerce apply in satisfying himself that a person is financially assisted or that that person is ordinarily resident outside the State.  There could be circumstances where the small family concern might require some financial assistance, perhaps of a temporary nature.  If a tea trader were assisted by some relative ordinarily resident outside the State, would that be a circumstance under which the Minister would cancel the registration of the tea trader?  As it stands, it would appear if a person carrying on business as a tea trader were even temporarily financially assisted by a person ordinarily resident outside the State, the Minister would be obliged under the <Col N="462" /> section to cancel his registration. There are a number of other points which I should like to raise and perhaps it would be more convenient if I dealt with them separately.</P>

      <P>The registration of a tea trader who is already in existence will only be cancelled if he goes out of business.  For the tea trader who is now in existence, there is no qualification required whatever.  Some of them are subsidaries of outside concerns, outside the State, and as they are in the tea trade now, they cannot be put out, except on going voluntarily out of business.  In relation to those not now in business, the Minister must be satisfied before he registers them that they are bona fide Irish-owned and controlled firms.  It is only where he finds that their status has changed subsequently, having accepted them as registered newcomers to the trade, that he can cancel the registration, having given notice.</P>

If there was a temporary need on their part to get some financial assistance, would that be a circumstance which would move the Minister to cancel the registration? As the section stands, I think the Minister might feel obliged, in order to comply with sub-section 2, to cancel the registration.</P>

It is the type of thing that would normally come within the purview of the courts.  The Minister is aware that the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; connotes the exercise of a judicial function.  It is a judicial function in relation to the property rights a tea trader would have.  That phrase is used in relation to Part IV of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It was found that where you have that phrase in an Act of Parliament, it is a judicial function. That invalidated Part IV of the Offences Against the State Act, and there was another Act passed in 1940 which substituted a new phrase: &ldquo;is of opinion that&rdquo;.  That is a matter which the Minister might consider on Report Stage.  It could well be that the Minister might consider the section with his legal advisers.  It might give rise to the constitutional difficulties about which I was talking earlier to-day.  The Minister might look into the matter on Report Stage.</P>

It is physically impossible for me to get a sample of that tea and to give instructions before the auction takes place.  What will happen in future is that branches of Mincing Lane firms will probably try to cater for the Irish trade in the East and buy tea and store it there, although Calcutta is very unsuitable, for climatic and other reasons, for the storage of tea.  They will send small samples by airmail.  If they suit me, I shall buy them at their prices.  The only difference between what will happen in the future and what has happened in the past is that you are sending me 6,000 miles farther East to a comparatively small tea market.  The figures of sales in Calcutta in respect of the season that has just closed were 169,000,000 lb. while the landings in London were 594,000,000 lb.  We are going around with a very small shopping basket.  We could buy very swiftly in the 600,000,000 lb. market, but you <Col N="466" /> are sending us to the 169,000,000 lb. market and you are therefore limiting the choice and the price.</P>

Unfortunately, I was not able to speak on the Second Reading of this Bill as I was giving evidence at a marketing committee. However, I have taken the trouble to find out what would be the position. The best scientific test I could get was to consult two persons engaged in the wholesale tea business on both sides of the Border.  They are Irish Nationalists and people who would not have a bias in favour of other orders across the Border.  One of them happens to live in the Republic and trades on both <Col N="467" /> sides of the Border while the other man lives in Northern Ireland and also trades on both sides of the Border. Their opinion was that, with the difficulties of trading, with the delay in getting tea from the East, and for other reasons, to say the least of it, on balance, the people here will have to pay more for their tea as a result of this measure.  They cannot understand why this company does not trade in tea and sell it to anybody who wants to buy it from them.  Why must they have a complete monopoly?</P>

      <P>Regardless of the technical difference between handling and selling, I am informed by reputable people I know for many years&mdash;that is why I consulted them&mdash;that we shall have to pay more money for tea as a result of this measure.  They cannot understand why people will not be allowed to purchase tea in whatever quarter of the world they can buy tea at the best price.  Therefore, I believe this measure is not in the best interests of the country.  I believe this Bill is particularly against the small family wholesale business in this country.</P>

      <P>The suggestion has been made that as a result of the enactment of this Bill the people of this country may have to pay more for tea than they would otherwise pay.  My advice from the majority of the trade is the reverse.  All the available statistical information shows that, in fact, by reason of the policy of direct purchases of tea in the country of <Col N="468" /> origin and direct shipments to this country in recent years we have been getting our tea at a great deal less than the price for which we should otherwise have got it.  I presume the comparable figures are those which would relate to the average landed price of tea shipped direct from India here and the average price at which tea was exported from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a dangerous figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that: qualities come into the picture.  In so far as certain allowances must be made, they are in favour of the present arrangement. The average c.i.f price of tea shipped from English ports would not include the freight and insurance charges involved in bringing it here but, over all these years, the average price of tea landed in this country was one shilling or more below the price at which the same tea, brought into England, was reshipped from English ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite the same.  You have only to compare the tea which we get in the Twenty-Six Counties with that which they get in the Six Counties.  On the average, their quality is higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede it to be possible that the difference in the landed cost of tea here and the landed cost of tea in Britain&mdash;and our figure is much lower than the British figure &mdash;might disclose that tea was being bought here to more advantage than by the British wholesalers or it might disclose that, on the average, we were buying a cheaper grade of tea than was being brought into England.  If that is so, any resulting complaint about the quality of tea goes back to the tea merchants because Tea Importers imported what the merchants wanted and in future it will be what they themselves actually buy.  Therefore, any complaint about quality will not be the direct responsibility of those importing the tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The English merchant had an advantage which we had not. You could buy tea at exactly the same <Col N="469" /> price from one man as from another man: both cost the same.  But one type would be much more suitable for the water.  What you might call bad tea would be just unsuitable.  We have been buying tea blindly and in bulk for years.  It has not been tasted for years.  Senator Carty said that any man who does not taste the tea before buying it is a fool but you cannot do that in the East as they do not open tea there.  Unless, as I shall probably try to do, we get samples by airmail, the position will be unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>Some dealers out there can buy tea in Calcutta and send samples by airmail. If I cannot taste it, I cannot take part in this great bulk purchasing with some of the bigger men.  The small man cannot do that successfully and so he will be crowded out.  What might be a minor parcel of bad tea to a very big dealer would be a catastrophe to a small dealer.  It would injure his whole trade.  It is not necessarily that they were buying worse tea but rather the type they got.  We did not know what we had bought until we received it and that was four months afterwards.</P>

      <P>There are two points I should like to make.  One is a minor point.  Paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) says: &ldquo;The company shall not import tea unless the company either imports it under and in <Col N="470" /> accordance with an authorisation given by the Minister.&rdquo;  This &ldquo;authorisation&rdquo; is also mentioned in paragraph (b) of sub-section (4), but I do not think the power to give such an authorisation is mentioned anywhere else in the Bill. I am just wondering is this a usual way for the Minister to take power to authorise certain people to do certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is intended to be an emergency escape clause, in the event of circumstances arising to prevent the company bringing in tea from the countries where it is produced.  In such an event, the Minister can authorise the company to buy tea wherever it can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just wondering has the Minister power, by mere reason of these clauses, to make the authorisation.  One section says the company shall not import tea, unless in accordance with an authorisation given by the Minister, but no other section actually gives the Minister power to authorise.  I am just wondering does the Minister consider that these two indirect references to &ldquo;authorise&rdquo; will be sufficient to give him power to make such authorisations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point is the difference between the position, as at present, in which we buy in bulk, and the traders get tea which has been bought in bulk at what I would suggest would be very lo prices, and the situation which will arise as presented by Section 7 in which individual traders must go to the countries of origin and bid against one another for individual items, but can only import tea through the company. If Irish nationals bid against one another in these auctions they will be putting up the price on one another. Instead of buying as at present in bulk for Irish needs, you will have Irish tea buyers competing against one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this question on the Second Stage, and suggested that it was like a man bringing his wife to an auction under the mistaken impression that if <Col N="471" /> both bid for the same article, they will get it at a better price.  The Minister's only answer was that though Irish nationals might be bidding against one another, they would not be the only bidders, that there would be others bidding, too.  I do not feel that that is a proper answer.  I think as a community we would get better value by bidding and buying with one voice, and I am strengthened in that opinion by the Minister's present statement that we have been getting tea cheaper through the operations of Tea Importers, Limited, than we did before that body was set up, that we have been getting it at something like 1/- a lb. cheaper because of bulk buying.  It seems to me that this Bill does away with that valuable factor in the low pricing of tea in Ireland, as compared with before the war.  I feel that Senator Burke is right, therefore, and that we shall be paying more for tea by reason of this change from bulk buying to a system of individual Irish traders bidding against one another in the countries of origin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Burke, starting from two entirely different points, have got the same result.  The price cannot go up for both reasons.  If there were only one buyer for all our tea that buyer would have some commercial advantage, some capacity to shade the price, because of the size of the orders he would have to place.  I do not know that that advantage could be very great having regard to the fact that the whole world is at these auctions seeking to obtain supplies of tea and bidding for the tea that is available. I know, however, that that commercial advantage, such as it may be, involves the disadvantage that Senator Barry talked about, the limitation on the varieties available to traders by reason of the fact that all tea is purchased by one agent.  This measure is aimed to get away from that disadvantage, to create a situation in which merchants will be able to buy whatever individual varieties they like, the varieties they think their customers in their own localities will like, having regard to <Col N="472" /> the quality of the water and all the various other factors that influenced trade in one district as compared with another.  My answer to the Senator is that the commercial advantage would be very slight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for the Minister to tell me that a through bill of lading would be accepted?  He used the words &ldquo;import direct.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim at any rate is to secure the economy in freight which shipment in bulk will yield.  The object of the tea importing company will be to organise cargo loads, even though the ingredients of the loads are the consignments of individual merchants.  This will mean freight economy in bulk shipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no danger of monkey business, if there was a through bill of lading.  It would have this advantage.  The credit position is going to be very important for the importers.  Bulk shipment might mean that a man would have to wait for several weeks and the delay might be more than an Irish importer could cater for.  Usually there would always be vessels available on routes from the East, even though they might call at various other ports along the way.</P>

      <P>We said we would give the Minister all the stages, but on the Final Stage I must say that, in my opinion, this is a thoroughly bad Bill. In my opinion, it is all running in favour of big business and against the small business; it is for the big importer against the small importer; it is going to favour Dublin against the provincial town.  I do not like to make use of any pious thoughts here in the Seanad, but this is contrary to what I have read in Catholic social principles&mdash;that is that we ought to be in favour of anything which would help the small man rather than the big man, of anything that would strengthen the small business man as against the big business man.  I would like to have that on the records of the House.</P>

      <P>I should say I was predominantly concerned, in working out the arrangements which the Bill enshrines, to ensure that the smallest trader in the country would not be prejudiced in his future operations by reason of these arrangements; and I think we have secured that.</P>
      <P>My concern in framing the Bill was threefold&mdash;first, to keep the wholesale trade in tea in so far as it is feasible to do so, having regard to the existing situation, in the hands of Irish-controlled firms; secondly, to maintain the policy of buying our tea requirements in the countries of origin; and thirdly, to establish effective arrangements which would ensure direct shipment to this country.  Subject to these three aims of policy, we framed the Bill in consultation with and in agreement with the organisation which is representative of all the tea wholesalers of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is certain that the tea wholesalers, who have been working on the preparation of this scheme for some years now, will be trying genuinely to make it work in accordance with the general aims we all <Col N="474" /> have in view.  If it should prove to be so, that the fears which Senator Burke has expressed are well founded, that the small trader is not getting a fair crack of the whip as he should get under these arrangements, then I will certainly revise the arrangements.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been prepared against the background of the present pressing need of the country to expand industrial activity generally, but particularly industrial activity leading to exports.  Its main objective is to facilitate external capital investment in industrial projects related to exports.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding, I should say that Irish concerns have tackled the problems of the export trade in an energetic and effective manner and have, indeed, achieved considerable success.  I express also my belief that a large part of our hopes for industrial expansion in the future rests upon the continued development of these Irish concerns. The indications are that the number of established Irish firms entering the export business is likely to rise, as there is now fairly general acceptance that, with the help and guidance supplied by Córas Tráchtála and the financial incentives now available for exports, the special efforts now required for export development are rewarded by increased turnover, lower unit cost of production and increased earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, externally promoted concerns geared for export could make a substantial contribution to the development of our trade, which is so essential to the country's economic well-being.  It is necessary to make it clear&mdash;to advertise the fact, as it were&mdash; that that type of development is welcome and that the necessary foreign <Col N="475" /> investment which can make it possible will be facilitated.  Accordingly, in preparing this Bill, we have not only tried to remove actual impediments to external capital participation of the type which we are anxious to encourage, but we have endeavoured also to emphasise that external participation in export projects would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Control of Manufactures Acts, there is power, as Senators no doubt know, to issue new manufacture licences for externally promoted industrial projects.  That power could be and has been used in the past to facilitate desirable projects of that kind.  It has, indeed, been argued that the existing power is all that we need and that no amendment of these Acts is necessary.  The new manufacture licence procedure does not, however, meet the requirements of the situation in which we find ourselves, a situation in which export development is a very pressing need.  I think it is necessary to make it known by the enactment of a Bill of this kind, that a change of policy is taking place and that the restrictions which were applied in the past are considered no longer to be appropriate.  It is desirable also to have arrangements by which externally controlled concerns can, in certain prescribed conditions, get into manufacture without any licence, without any conditions attaching to their operations and even without contact with any Government Department or without being under any obligation to declare their intentions to any Government official.  The Bill, therefore, takes outside the scope of the Acts companies which carry on business primarily for export and whose home market sales are incidental only to their export trade.</P>
    <P>Again, where the promoters of industrial projects of which export business is a principal object, afford Irish investors a reasonable opportunity of investment in the ordinary share capital, such projects will not in future have to comply with the existing provisions of the Acts; at least they will not be under any obligation to comply merely because Irish investors <Col N="476" /> to whom the shares were offered failed to avail themselves of the opportunity of subscribing for them.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill excludes from the scope of the Control of Manufactures Acts all companies incorporated in this country which are managed and controlled here, which have export business as their principal object, which set out in their memorandum of association and in all documents published that export business is a principal object; and which offer not less than half of their voting shares in a <i>bona fide</i> way for investment by the Irish public.  Provided companies comply with these conditions, they will be free to transact business as if the Control of Manufactures Acts did not exist.  They will be under no obligation to approach any Government Department for approval or for authority of any kind before commencing business.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that once the Dublin or Cork Stock Exchange grants a quotation for their shares, the company will be regarded as having complied fully with the requirements of the Bill in regard to the issue of shares.  That is an important provision, and likely to appeal to external interests, particularly large concerns who are familiar with stock exchange procedures.  I should like in this connection to express my deep appreciation of the co-operation which the committees of the Dublin and Cork Stock Exchanges have freely extended in that matter.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a possibility that a concern which is free from the requirements of the Control of Manufactures Acts under that proposal might not in fact develop export business to the extent visualised, and might find itself obliged to sell its products exclusively, or almost exclusively, in the home market.  Any provision which might be designed to provide absolute safeguards against that contingency would be unduly restrictive and would, I think, seriously lessen the prospect of large-scale industrial units being established here for the purpose of conducting export trade.  In view of the urgent necessity to increase exports, and as the Irish public will <Col N="477" /> have been given an opportunity of investing in each case, this is a risk which I think has to be taken.</P>
    <P>These two proposals which I have outlined&mdash;the exclusion from the scope of the Control of Manufactures Acts of companies which are established to do export business primarily and of companies which make that <i>bona fide</i> opportunity of investment in their shares available to the Irish public&mdash; are designed to meet the needs of large concerns primarily, that is, concerns the promoters of which would normally have recourse to public issues for securing capital.  These provisions would not be suitable for smaller projects which would be financed otherwise than on the basis of public issues of shares.  They would not meet the case of a company intending to postpone the public issue until a later stage of development, when its capacity to make profits could be demonstrated to potential investors, nor would they meet the case of a company in which the promoters prefer to operate solely on their own capital.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to deal with these cases by providing for the issue of certificates of exemption where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that export trade is a main object.  The certificate would, as the expression implies, exempt the company concerned from the requirements of the Acts in regard to the activities covered by the certificate.  Once a certificate is granted and business had commenced, it could not be revoked.</P>
    <P>Apart from facilitating external investment in new concerns, it is desirable also that established Irish companies should be facilitated in securing external capital for developing export trade.  The Bill accordingly proposes that, where the shares of an Irish company have been quoted on the Stock Exchanges for five years, there should be power to issue certificates of exemption to a company of that kind, when the Minister is of opinion that the company intends to engage in export business or to extend its operations in the export market.  The effect of that proposal will be to create a freer market for shares in established Irish companies proposing to engage in export trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> As a further means of facilitating export development, the Bill provides that where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is of opinion that a particular commodity is either not being manufactured or not being manufactured to a substantial extent, he may, by Order, declare it to be an excepted commodity, in which case the Control of Manufactures Acts would not apply to its manufacture.  As I stated in the Dáil, it is likely that difficulties may arise in the operation of that provision, and it is not yet certain that it will be of very great significance.  However, there may be cases in which it would be helpful and it has accordingly been included in the Bill on that basis.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is primarily designed to facilitate external investment in industrial export projects, it also contains a few provisions to remedy defects in the Control of Manufactures Acts, in so far as they relate to manufacture for the home market.  Under the Acts as they stand, as many Senators know, it is possible to get around their intention by forming a company with a very small share capital held in such a way as to secure nominal compliance with the Acts, while effective finance is provided by loans or credits from outside parties who, in effect, completely control the company.  To prevent that device, it is proposed that companies, to comply with the provisions of the Acts, will be required to have a minimum paid-up share capital equal to at least half the value of the company's fixed assets used in the business.  Allowance would of course be made for genuine reserves, for hire purchase liabilities, for loans from Irish persons, or other similar items in determining the value of the assets.</P>

There is provision also to make it clear that existing companies which do not comply with these requirements can carry on such business as they were carrying on at 1st May of this year, but they will not <Col N="479" /> be free to engage in new lines of manufacture, unless they bring their capital structure into line with the requirements of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Another defect in the existing Act is that a section in the 1934 Act, which was intended to permit manufacturing companies which operated prior to 2nd June, 1932, to extend their range of manufacture has in practice been held to enable firms who were on that date merely engaged in distribution to undertake manufacturing operations. It is proposed to remedy that position and give effect to the intention of the legislation by providing that the benefits of the section will apply only to firms actually engaged in manufacturing business.  The new provision will not, of course, affect any pre-1932 firm which has already commenced manufacturing operations.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is also being availed of to make a number of changes designed to simplify the administration of the Control of Manufactures Acts and reduce their scope. It is proposed that the Acts will no longer apply to businesses owned by private individuals or partnerships.  Businesses which do not use mechanical power will also be excluded and repairing will no longer be regarded as a manufacturing operation covered by the Acts.  In addition, the Acts will not in future apply to companies where the value of the fixed assets used in the business are less than £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  It formally confers upon all Irish citizens the same rights in the holding of shares under the Control of Manufactures Acts as the classes of persons mentioned in the existing Acts.  These existing Acts were passed before the Nationality <Col N="480" /> and Citizenship Act was enacted.  The Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956 dealt with that point in a general way, but it was felt desirable, in the interests of clarity, to make suitable provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also terminates the power to revoke the reserved commodity licence procedure.  That procedure has in fact been used on one occasion only. Another provision has been inserted to remove doubts regarding the position, under the Control of Manufactures Acts, of shares held by a Minister of State in his capacity as Minister and a provision has also been included to remove some doubts regarding the format of new manufacturing licences.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that the stage has now been reached in industrial development at which it is necessary to consider and amend the policy enshrined in the Control of Manufactures Acts.  These Acts were devised at a time when the primary aim of industrial policy was to secure the establishment of factory capacity to supply home market needs of goods previously imported.  To encourage investment in industrial enterprises for that purpose, it was considered necessary to give an assurance to potential investors that they would not be required to meet, in the early and difficult period of their development, competition from branch factories set up by powerful external companies.  It was considered that if such branch factories were forced reluctantly into existence by the tariff policy, it would not be a very healthy or progressive type of development and that the ultimate growth of industrial activities would be better sponsored under the aegis of independent and, if possible, Irish-controlled firms.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Control of Manufactures Acts can, I think, be said to have fully justified itself, and if we were concerned solely with production to meet home market needs, there would be little occasion for any fundamental change in it now.  There is, however, still an obligation on us, as we see it, to maintain the protection which those Acts gave to firms which came into existence because of the assurance that it gave them in relation to <Col N="481" /> activities which are limited in scope to the home market.  So far, therefore, as further development of industry for the purpose of supplying the home market is concerned, when there is for any reason neither the possibility nor the intention to export, the policy of the Government will remain as it was up to the present, to give preference to developments sponsored by Irish companies and to operate the new manufacture licence provision where circumstances justify another course.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the aim of industrial policy now is to encourage development for export trade, and for that aim the present Control of Manufactures Acts are unsuitable and could possibly be a serious impediment.  That is why it was decided to change them.  On that basis, I recommend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>This is a very curious Bill with a very ambiguous Title. The English of the Title has, I think, two meanings, but the person who translated it into Irish opted for one clear meaning which I think is the one the Minister has in mind.  The Minister's mind is not very clear on this matter and that is why the Bill is not clear and why the Title is not clear and why the Bill has such a peculiar history. The Minister is trying to do something which he cannot do&mdash;to square politics and economics, to direct economics by a political process. It is doubtful if that can be successful. We have a pressing need for more capital and it would appear that we cannot get that risk capital here. Therefore, the Minister proposes to take steps, in spite of the fact that the Irish manufacturers have done well, to bring in foreign investors.  He is taking rather curious steps to do it, and, as well as purporting to bring in more foreign investors, he has taken the opportunity to remedy what he regards as defects in the Acts of 1932 and 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us for a moment examine the history of this legislation.  By the Act of 1932, the Control of Manufactures Act, and by a further Act of 1934, the Minister endeavoured to curb investment by foreigners in Irish industry. Now, by his speech to-day, and by <Col N="482" /> speeches he has been making for some time, he appears to have changed his mind and appears to be convinced that all the risk capital we require&mdash;this particular capital we require is called risk capital&mdash;is not available here.  If that is so and if we really want foreign investors, as the Minister said, and as his predecessor said, then the question arises: does this Bill provide machinery whereby we can attract these investors?</P>
    <P>The Bill is not realistic at all because the fact is there are not people battering at our gates to bring capital in.  The difficulty is we have got to attract capital, and I wonder is there anything attractive in this Bill.  In the first place, the Bill is not easy to understand or read.  It was brought in originally as the Control of Manufactures Bill&mdash;in other words, as a continuation and an amendment of the Minister's policy of 1932 and 1934&mdash; whereas in fact it represents, not an extension or an amendment of that policy but a radical change in that policy.</P>
    <P>When the Minister had got a Second Reading of the Bill in the other House, he brought in a number of amendments in Committee, and also amended the Title by adding the words &ldquo;Encouragement of External Investment&rdquo;. He had a process in the Dáil whereby he had two Committee Stages.  I do not know why he did not withdraw the Bill and bring in a new Bill.  We should not have this extraordinary, extravagant and confusing legislation by reference.  We should begin from the very beginning and scrap the 1932 and the 1934 Acts and put them into one Bill before the Oireachtas and before the foreigners and show precisely what we mean to do.  That would have been very simple and quite feasible.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who think that legislation can be in simple language. I have too much information and too much experience to the contrary.  You cannot bring in a simple Land Bill because land tenure and land Acts go back a great many years&mdash;indeed, hundreds of years&mdash;but in this instance, in the case of these two Acts &mdash;the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, and the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934&mdash;surely it would have been <Col N="483" /> possible for the Minister simply to repeal them and pass another Act to show what his mind is like now and to show foreigners who want to invest, if they do want to invest, and those whom we are trying to attract to invest, what the position is now.</P>
    <P>He does not do that and the result must be very discouraging to foreigners.  First and foremost, the very Title of this Bill&mdash;the Control of Manufactures Bill&mdash;is surely repellent to a person who is a manufacturer.  I am not a manufacturer or a capitalist at all, unfortunately for myself, but I am perfectly certain that manufacturers object to control.  They would object to the very word and idea.  This Bill should have been drafted in quite a different way.</P>
    <P>External investment, when anyone says it to me, means investment by Irish people outside Ireland.  Our external investments are the investments we have outside the country. There was a lot of talk about our external assets.  These were the assets we held outside the country.  Here the term is used in an entirely different way.  If we look at the Irish Title, we will see that the Irish is a translation of what is in the Minister's mind.  The Irish means investment by outsiders in Ireland and the Bill should have some such Title in English.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to have no legislation by reference.  The reference is most curious.  In order to find out what Section 5 means, you have to read another section more than five pages long&mdash;Section 9 of the Act of 1934.  When you come to the end of Section 5 in this Bill, you find that the bulk of Section 9 of the Act of 1934 is being repealed.  Surely it would have been much simpler for those foreigners who are not simple but who like clarity, to draft the Bill in a different way altogether, and show them in one document what it is they have to expect.  One has to read Section 5 of this Bill, Section 9 of the Act of 1934 and the most complicated, obscure and difficult Schedule 1 to this Bill all together to find out what the position is going to be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> I do not know why that obstacle should be placed in the way of people we are trying to attract to invest money in this country.  It seems to me to be purposely difficult and purposely obscure.  It seems to be done to make it unintelligible.  To some extent, the Minister made the Bill much clearer than it is on its face, but it seems to me that the Minister's own mind lacks clarity on this matter.  He has not quite made up his mind and that is reflected in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Schedule 1 of the Bill is most extraordinary and paragraph 3 of Schedule I involves one in the most amazing calculations. To me, at any rate, perhaps because of my ignorance and lack of knowledge of manufacturing industry, it suggests all kinds of difficulties. For instance, it speaks of a calculation that &ldquo;the share capital must not be less than half the following sum, the then value of the fixed assets used in the business.&rdquo;  Does &ldquo;fixed assets used in the business&rdquo;&mdash;let me give one example only&mdash;mean assets owned by the company or used by the company? Would a building leased by the business be a fixed asset used by the business? I do not know.  I wonder could the Minister tell us?  There are all kinds of extravagant calculations to be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister is endeavouring in this Bill to get his own back&mdash;that is really what it amounts to&mdash;on people who, perfectly within the law, formed companies since 1934.  I have no interest in that.  I am certainly not one of them.  But I am acquainted with the principles of legislation. I think it is a most objectionable thing that we should say to a person who, perfectly within the law, invested his money in a particular place: &ldquo;We are going to get you now for what you did in 1936.  We are going to prevent you doing certain things you might do but for this Act.&rdquo;  It is a bad thing, having passed certain legislation, to try to penalise the people who, under that legislation, quite legally formed companies.  I have no brief for them.  I have nothing to do with them, but they have rights.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that the Acts of 1932 and 1934 were quite useless <Col N="485" /> and, unless I am greatly mistaken, this very complicated document may be found to be just as useless to accomplish the Minister's purpose.  It is true, as a principle, that, when people start a business under the law, the law is not as the Minister conceives it but as the courts declare it.  Only the courts can tell you what the law is.  Neither I nor the Minister can do that.  If you start a business within the law, you should not be penalised later on.</P>
    <P>It is a very bad principle and it is a principle that should not be applied to industry at a moment when, according to the Minister himself, we have a pressing need for more capital.  It seems to me&mdash;I will deal with the matter later on in Committee Stage&mdash;that purely Irish companies may be hurt by the First Schedule to this Bill.  We can see that later on.</P>
    <P>On the mere matter of general knowledge, is it possible, is it normal or feasible at all to get a company to say they are going to set up a factory here and that they are not going to sell in the home market?  I think that that is a very doubtful proposition.  It is very doubtful if anybody is going to do that.  I may be misinterpreting the Minister, but I gathered from him that, when people come in on these terms, he would not worry as to manufacturing for the home market later on. I can understand the Minister's anxiety not to hurt our own investors but is he really avoiding that.</P>
    <P>It we want foreign investment, could we not say so in a simpler way than it is set out in this very complicated Bill?  I should like to go as far as this. We are in a very desperate position. The Minister is ignoring certain things. &mdash;our unemployment and our emigration. I, unfortunately, know quite a number of people who had to go to Birmingham for work.  They go to Birmingham and work in an English factory operated by English capital and under English control.  They live under English conditions.  They really, in effect&mdash;whatever the legal position&mdash; become British citizens and pay tax to Britain.  Above all, their children go to English schools and grow up as English people.  Would they not be <Col N="486" /> better off here working for a Birmingham-owned factory, if it were here? Perhaps that is a foolish idea but I wonder if they would not be better off here.  They would be living an Irish life.  Their children would be going to Irish schools.  They would be rearing Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>We have not any clear view as to what we want to do about this business.  This Bill is a rather unintelligible and difficult hot-potch with confused thinking.  The Minister would have been much better advised to withdraw the original Bill.  He might have lost a certain amount of face, but what harm.  He should have withdrawn the Bill he brought into the Dáil.  His change is quite recent.  He changed his mind since bringing the Bill into the Dáil not so long ago.  He would be much better advised to withdraw the Bill, to scrap the 1932 and 1934 Acts and put what he wanted to say about investment by foreigners in Irish industry, into one document.  I think he should do that yet.</P>
    <P>The whole business of licences and arrangements, references to safeguards, and so on, will not bring the Minister the change he really wants.  It is possible that the result of this Bill will be to create more unemployment and perhaps to attract no foreign capital or no foreign capital that is worth while.  I am far from desiring that should be so.  The Minister would have been much better advised if he had faced clearly the position that he wants foreign capital to come in and made simpler and clearer conditions for it to come in. The Bill as drafted&mdash;with its curious references, and so on&mdash;seems to me to be very cumbersome and I am afraid it will prove a very ineffective weapon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the purpose of this Bill is to introduce capital into this country, I hope the Chair will not rule me out of order if I make one or two remarks about the desirability of introducing foreign capital and the best way to do it before I come, as I shall soon, to the terms of the Bill itself.  It is generally agreed by all Parties and by everybody here that foreign capital is desirable.  A drive <Col N="487" /> has been made by the Government to attract foreign capital.  Several Ministers have visited foreign countries. The I.D.A. have issued quite an excellent brochure to attract foreign investors by showing the advantages of this country.  A full-time representative was recently despatched to the United States to further the same object.  Generally, the energies of the Government are being directed towards attracting foreign capital into the country.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that the attraction of foreign capital is very desirable at present.  Ireland is late in starting in the industrial race.  Although a great deal has been done since the setting-up of Irish self-government 35 years ago, a good deal still remains to be done.  Emigration is causing anxiety. It is almost inevitable that there will be a draining away of population from the rural areas.  It is taking place in every other country as well as this.  It is most desirable that there should be secondary industries to absorb the people so moving.</P>
      <P>The Irish home market is small and, therefore, industries that rely on the Irish home market cannot expand beyond a certain point.  The Irish home market has to a large extent been fully developed by the existing protected industries and therefore further industrial development now depends on export markets.  I think that on that everybody will agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times, the balance of payments has been depending too much on agricultural exports.  It is most desirable that our agricultural exports should be fortified by industrial exports to help to balance our balance of payments at a high level.  The present moment is a time when the attraction of foreign capital is particularly important, owing to the discussions regarding the future of the European Free Trade Area.  I want to say, however, that, even if there had never been any discussion about the European Free Trade Area, a Bill of this kind would have been necessary, because, even if there are no additional openings into the Free Trade Area, exports of industrial products will be quite essential if the population <Col N="488" /> is to be kept up at all and if the balance of payments is to be balanced at a high level.</P>
    <P>The trouble about industrial exports is that they have to be very competitive and very efficient.  They cannot shelter behind protection and therefore they must have large supplies of capital, very high managerial capacity and a great deal of technical skill.  They must move with nature and not against nature, that is, they must be based on whatever natural resources and advantages the country possesses.  Therefore, in order to attract foreign capital into this country, we must be able to show that we have a great many advantages and resources and that we have done nothing to injure them by unwise legislation in the past.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles about this whole programme of foreign investment is that, in order that an industry shall export and compete, it has to be very highly capitalised.  I do not think that perhaps the public, discussing this matter, sufficiently realise the very large amount of capital necessary to-day to put people into employment. In order that industries may compete abroad, they have to be highly mechanised.  There has to be a great deal of machinery, automation, and so on, and, actually, the labour content in these industries is very often disappointingly small.  Therefore, in order to build up export industries, capital is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The supply of capital in Ireland, unfortunately, has not been very great in recent years.  The current savings have been absorbed mainly by the Government and by existing businesses. The number of capital issues in Ireland has been very small and very disappointing.  Therefore, there is no question, I am afraid, that in order that industries should develop for export, a certain amount of external capital is urgently required.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat something I said on the Finance Bill earlier this year, namely, that we should not seek foreign capital with fixed interest rates, that if we borrow abroad&mdash; either the Government or, private businesses&mdash;with fixed interest obligations, we are tying millstones around <Col N="489" /> the necks of future generations.  At present, interest rates are very high. The international lending corporations are charging up to 7 per cent.  Therefore, if we borrow abroad&mdash;if the Government borrow abroad&mdash;the taxpayer may have to find a lot of interest to be paid abroad and if private business is borrowing abroad, it may have to meet high fixed interest charges before making any profit.  Therefore, we must agree that the thing to seek for is risk-bearing capital, equity capital.  We must try to attract investors from the United States and elsewhere to invest in Ireland, to use their own capital and to take the risks of investment.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to admit that, in spite of all the efforts which have been made in the past two or three years by the Government and by private people, the concrete achievements so far have been rather meagre.  In spite of the number of inquiries we hear about&mdash;the number of people who, we were told, are looking for openings in Ireland&mdash;no great investment from abroad has, in fact, been achieved.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is, perhaps, the psychological moment to try to present to the world whatever attractions we do possess, because, if the Free Trade Area proposals develop the location of industries in Europe will be to a large extent changed.  The type of location that may develop in the next few years in the Free Trade Area may tend to become permanent and, if we cannot get on a favourable footing in the early stages, it may be too late. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to try to attract foreign capital at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>In order to attract a foreign business man, we have to show him that he is likely to make a profit and we have to show, not only that he is likely to make a profit, but that he is likely to make a bigger profit here than he would anywhere else.  He has the whole world open to him and it is not sufficient for us just to show that there are openings for investment in Ireland.  We have got to show that we have better openings than other countries have, because it must be remembered that other countries are <Col N="490" /> competing with us to get foreign investors at the present time.  Therefore, it is most important, from the point of view of Government policy, that the whole policy in relation to public finance and that fiscal policy should be designed to this purpose.</P>
    <P>This is really the point I am working up to.  The Government must be consistent in the whole of their policy, if they wish to attract foreign capital. They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot try to attract foreign capital, on the one hand, by minor tax exemptions and, at the same time, raise costs of production owing to measures internally, which may be perfectly legitimate and justifiable in themselves, but which cut right across the programme for attracting foreign investment.  In order to attract foreign investment to Ireland, an effort has to be made to bring about low costs of production; but Government measures have raised costs in other directions which simply neutralise the programme for capital investment.  It is very important that that should be realised.</P>
    <P>This Bill does very little in itself. It simply opens the door.  It does not open it very wide, but it does open it; and, when the door has been opened, it is incumbent on the Government to produce more measures besides this Bill to attract the foreign investor. Above all, it is its duty to avoid other measures which, however justifiable in themselves, may have the effect of frightening off the foreign investor. The Banking Commission, which, I am afraid, I am accustomed to quote perhaps too frequently, in 1938 in its report discussed problems in connection with industrial development, and in particular the question of finding capital for industry.  In that report which is still very topical and which bears reading, the need for avoiding conflicting policies is very strongly emphasised.</P>
    <P>The Banking Commission pointed out that policies that raise the cost of production in agriculture by undue subdivision of holdings, that protective policies which raise the price of industrial commodities, that social services ahead of the productivity of labour, all <Col N="491" /> had the effect of raising the cost of production in Ireland.  It is in that connection now that I am coming to the subject of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Banking Commission referred to the Control of Manufactures Acts which were passed in 1932 and 1934, I have no intention of reopening old controversies in this debate.  I can see the reasons why these Acts were passed at the time they were passed.  Ireland was backward industrially.  The world depression which had taken place had spread widespread lack of confidence all over the world.  The economic war and the slowing down of emigration intensified the necessity for secondary industries.  The Party which had come into power in 1932 had openly pledged itself to a protectionist policy before they came in.  When they did come into power, they appeared to find some justification for their policy, in the spectacle of other countries suffering from the world depression imposing protectionist tariffs.  Therefore, the Control of Manufactures Act was a natural enough measure to pass in 1932.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that, before the Control of Manufactures Act was passed, there had been quite a considerable degree of industrialisation after the Treaty.  When Ireland was set up as a separate customs union, the British import tariffs, the McKenna duties in particular, had an immediate effect.  They applied to Ireland automatically and a number of industries were attracted in under low tariffs.  The Tariff Commission and the Fiscal Inquiry Committee, which aroused as much unpopularity as the Banking Commission, warned the Government of the danger of going too fast in this direction.  As a result of that report, and as a result of the reports of the Tariff Commission, the policy of industrial protection was pursued cautiously and experimentally.  A number of valuable industries were opened in Ireland in those years, but they were mainly financed by foreign capital.  In the 1920s, foreign capital was coming into Ireland in quite a big way, in a way that would be very welcome now, if it were to be resumed.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, in 1932, the <Col N="492" /> world had gone through a great depression. There were peculiar difficulties in Ireland.  The Government that came in had a more protectionist outlook than its predecessor and, therefore, the Control of Manufactures Acts were passed.  They represented a point of view, repeated by the Minister this evening, that branch factories opened by foreign industrialists will not extend their activities beyond the capacity of the home market.  They will be the first branches to close down in the case of a depression.  That is the official justification for these Acts.</P>
    <P>I will not reopen old controversies. I can see that there was something to be said for that point of view, though I disagreed with it at the time and I think, perhaps, the Minister exaggerated its merits.  These Acts did in fact raise the cost of capital in Ireland, according to the Banking Commission. Owing to the fact that foreign investors were not free to come in, a rather high rate had to be paid on debenture and preference shares and, if one looks at the lists of the Dublin Stock Exchange, the preference capital of many of these companies does carry high rates of interest.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, these Acts were largely evaded.  The result of that was that some of the more desirable foreign companies did not wish to take advantage of legal evasions, and some of the less desirable foreign companies managed to come in by these evasions. I do not wish to go back over all that. I simply want to quote one sentence from the Banking Commission Report in paragraph 424 which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question would seem to merit examination whether the stringent provisions of these Acts do not go further than is reasonably required in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that many valuable industries grew up under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  If these Acts had not been there, certain industries would not have come into being.  Possibly, if they had not been there, other industries would have come into being, but the fact of the matter is that, behind the Control of Manufactures Acts, a number of secondary industries did come into <Col N="493" /> being.  A great deal of employment was given and they were useful during the war.  As I have said, however, many of them have already reached the limit of their capacity because they were designed mainly for the home protected market.  It is only fair to say that some of them have struck out and exported and have far exceeded the hopes of people at the time they were founded.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, it is perfectly clear now that a new policy has been substituted for the policy of 1932.  The circumstances have changed again and, with the changing circumstances, the attitude of the Government has changed.  The dislike of foreign capital which characterised the Control of Manufactures Acts, has been displaced and now, instead of foreign capital being discouraged, it is being actively sought.  The very Title of this Bill is significant.  As Senator Hayes said, the Title has been changed&mdash;and changed, I think, in the right direction.  The original Title was &ldquo;Control of Manufactures (Amendment) Bill.&rdquo;  It is now called &ldquo;Industrial Development (Encouragement of External Investment) Bill.&rdquo;  That indicates a change of emphasis and a change of policy&mdash;one which is wholly desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the question of whether it would have been better to scrap the Control of Manufactures Acts and start afresh.  It is only fair to remember that some vested interests have grown up under these Acts and that these vested interests must be protected.  I agree with what Senator Hayes said, that anything in the nature of retrospective legislation is very undesirable and that, therefore, whether one entirely agrees with the Control of Manufactures Acts or not, people who invested capital behind them and on the strength of their continuing are entitled to protection. Therefore, it is necessary for the Minister to effect some sort of compromise between the protection of existing industries and the attraction of new exporting industries by foreign capital. It is the necessity for that compromise which, in my opinion, has led to the rather complicated terminology in this Bill, which is, perhaps, unavoidable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> The fact of the matter really is that the Minister has been rather caught in his own toils.  In 1932 and 1934 he was warned in the debates in the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;which I read recently&mdash;that the Control of Manufactures Acts would involve future Governments in difficulties and that vested interests would grow up behind them which would call for continued protection and that their amendment might be difficult. That was said in the debates 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Banking Commission was critical of the Acts and of the policy which they represented.  The fact is that they were a success for the purpose for which they were passed. They did encourage a number of industries catering for the home market and a large number of vested interests grew up behind them which now really have come home to roost.  The Minister must find himself in considerable difficulties in devising a Bill which will protect the industries already protected and not frighten foreign investors who wish to come in in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to criticise the Minister for this, because he is rather paying the price for his own, if I may say so, mistakes in the past.  These complications were all predicted in the debates on the Control of Manufactures legislation and he now finds himself in these difficulties under a Bill which he himself would probably admit is not entirely easy to interpret. It contains a great deal of legislation by reference; the intention does not always spring to the eye; and, as I am going to suggest later on, it requires that a simplified explanation be issued very widely as soon as it is passed.</P>
    <P>However, if one penetrates through the jungle of the parliamentary draftsman's jargon, the Bill does contain, as the Minister says, liberalising clauses.  I would like very shortly to say what seems to me has been done positively in this Bill.  If I am wrong, the Minister can correct me.  There has been so much said about what the Bill does not do that it might be no harm for someone here, other than the Minister, to say what the Bill does do.  As I read this difficult Bill, I find <Col N="495" /> quite an amount of liberalisation in it.  First of all, businesses carried on otherwise than by companies are exempt from the Control of Manufactures Acts.  Companies with fixed assets worth less than £5,000, or with manufacturing operations that do not involve the use of mechanical power are exempt altogether from the Acts. What is more important is the principle of what is known as the &ldquo;excepted commodity&rdquo;&mdash;if I am using the right terminology&mdash;that articles which are stated by the Minister to be &ldquo;excepted commodities&rdquo;, that is to say, not manufactured in the State, can be manufactured by foreigners without any licence or permission whatsoever.  There also seems to be a distinction, if I am not wrong, bebetween companies manufacturing entirely or almost entirely for export and other companies which aim at export, though not principally.  As I understand the Bill, companies which manufacture entirely or almost entirely for export are free to enter on operations in Ireland without any licence or permission from the Minister.  Other companies which may do exporting, though not exclusively, are enabled to engage in operations provided they offer a certain part of their capital to Irish investors.  I hope I have got this right.  That seems to be the gist of the liberalising part of the Bill.  It is only fair to say that these liberalising provisions have been very successfully obscured by the terminology of the parliamentary draftsman which, as I suggested, may in part reflect the difficulties of the Minister in not opening the door too wide to let foreign investors come in on top of the vested interests that he himself brought into existence in the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to blame the Minister for this rather complicated terminology, but I want to suggest to him that it is most desirable that the world outside should have the Bill explained in simple language, that the Industrial Development Authority's brochure should contain a simple account of the positive sections in the Bill and that foreign investors should have put to them in simple language what they can <Col N="496" /> do.  I think it is possible to do that. I have tried to do it myself and I think the Minister agrees with what I have said.  If it can be put in plain language in that way and widely circulated abroad, a good deal of the criticism of the Bill would disappear.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by repeating the note on which I began these observations? This Bill opens the door, but merely opening the door will not attract people to come in through the door, unless the room inside is made warm, comfortable and attractive.  Therefore, it becomes very essential that the Government should do everything it can to indicate to outside investors that this country does possess certain advantages.  A lecture was delivered in University College last week by the Assistant Secretary-General of O.E.E.C. in which he made a remarkable statement about the advantages that Ireland possesses inside the Free Trade Area.  I might suggest to the Minister that that section of that gentleman's speech might be included in the brochure explaining the Bill.  He said a great deal to encourage people here.  His whole tone was very optimistic, and I suggest that the Minister should get the text of that speech and quote what this very high international authority said about the natural advantages that Ireland enjoys.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Government must really try to be consistent.  It must try to avoid every cost-raising measure.  It is no use giving tax exemptions to foreign investors and pointing out the attractions of the country if with the other hand it takes away some of those advantages by high taxation, high deadweight debt, high costs of production of one sort or another. Furthermore, of course, the Government must assure foreigners that they will be free of red tape and bureaucratic interference, that there will not be changes of Government policy which are liable to defeat their expectations. That is why, although I did not agree with the Control of Manufactures Acts at the time, I do agree now with the Minister that it is right to protect people who invested behind them, for nothing is more fatal to a country's credit than rapid changes of <Col N="497" /> policy where legitimate expectations are defeated and vested interests are sacrificed.</P>
    <P>But more than that is necessary.  A mere negative policy of avoiding costraising measures is not enough.  Positive measures must be taken to attract the investors in.  There must be an attempt to increase the supply of managerial ability and technical expertise. There must be education at all levels to supply a good labour force.  Good labour relations between employers and employees are very important. That is a matter in which the employers and the trade unions have a great responsibility.  A country that gets the reputation of being hagridden with strikes will not attract foreign capital.  Taxation must be kept down.  The monetary and banking systems must be such as to inspire confidence. Anything in the nature of unwise credit experiments, unbalanced budgets, and accumulation of deadweight debt are all calculated to terrify a foreign investor.</P>
    <P>Above all, the Government must make up its mind to what extent it really wants to rely on private enterprise. It must ride one horse or the other.  It cannot have State interference in all sorts of directions and then blame business men for not getting on with the work.  The two worlds of State control and private enterprise are very largely mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>Might I, finally, quote again the Banking Commission on this very point, in paragraph 425: &ldquo;The power of the State to encourage or deter the flow of capital into industry is most effective through the impression made on the minds of owners of capital by the broad aspects of public policy... The most useful step which the Government could take towards promoting the investment of capital in industry is to give confidence to private enterprise by maintaining those conditions of reasonable freedom which are essential for its success.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That passage was written in 1938. I suggest that it has lost nothing in relevance or truth in the last 20 years, and, having said that, I wish the Minister every success with his new Bill. I do ask him to try to advertise his <Col N="498" /> product to the world in rather less complicated language than that in which he has introduced it to the legislature.</P>

      <P>This Bill is in some ways rather an extraordinary measure.  It was debated at length in the other House.  It was amended in Committee, recommitted, amended on recommittal and I think amended on Report Stage.  Even the Title is not the same as when the original text first came before us.  Apparently it was thought injudicious to talk about &ldquo;controlling&rdquo; manufacturers, and so now it appears before us as the Industrial Development Bill, with the words &ldquo;Encouragement of External Investment.&rdquo; It has been pointed out to me that it is not really &ldquo;external investment&rdquo; at all.  It is not we who are investing externally, but we who are asking people to come in and invest here.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien, in a very compelling speech, gently but firmly criticised the whole present situation and touched lightly on some of the past matters that have led to the present situation.  I do not agree with him by any means as to which of the two horses we ought to back&mdash;he mentioned two horses and said that he would back one of them, but I would be inclined to back the other.  Apart from that difference of opinion as to the conclusion to be drawn from the evidence he put forward, I think his evidence was very clearly and cogently put.  The pattern of industry here contains one major defect and that derives from the great and continuing error of maintaining a uniform and unchangingly continued level of protection, long after the need in a particular industry for that initial high protection ought to have disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the point many times, and I do not want to elaborate on it overmuch now, but it is obvious that for new industries starting here a measure of protection is required and perhaps a high measure of protection. It should also be obvious that after the first five years or so that industry should have learned and should have <Col N="499" /> improved and overcome the initial obstacles to such an extent that it no longer needs precisely the same degree of protection.  Yet nine times out of ten it continues to get precisely the same degree of protection, if not a higher degree, for ten, 15 or 20 years.  I claim that if at the end of five years an industry still needs all the initial protection that it was originally given, that in itself is, if not proof, at least a strong indication that that industry is inefficient.  If it still requires, after the initial years, exactly the same protection as in the beginning, then I think it is proof it has not learned, and has not improved.</P>
    <P>Apart from the protection of tariffs, our industries had also, under the Control of Manufactures Acts, protection in relation to ownership, or a degree of controlled ownership, by Irish nationals&mdash;another type of restriction, if you like, and protection, for our Irish industrialists.  Both those forms of protection, I think, have had a bad effect upon our industry.  I believe that the Minister is well aware of these two facts, but has not yet been able to face them squarely.  I think his recognition of them is shown by this Bill, but I do not believe that the Bill will meet the situation as it should be met, because, as a result of these two forms of continuing a high level of overprotection, we have a large number of small but unhealthily bloated industries suffering from the weaknesses and the lack of resilience resulting from years of over-coddling.</P>
    <P>We have as a further result that such firms by their protection-encouraged inefficiency are to-day, in the main, incapable of selling to any great extent in foreign markets, incapable of building up a strong export trade. That they are so weak in facing competition in foreign markets is due, I would submit, in large measure to their having been recklessly, for political reasons, pampered at the expense of the Irish consumer, by successive Governments, all of which have been afraid of gradually lowering those protective tariffs, or of relaxing the conditions demanding &ldquo;51 per cent. <Col N="500" /> national&rdquo; ownership.  They have been afraid to lessen these restrictions for the purpose of encouraging the growth of sturdier industries, or making sturdier our existing industries.</P>
    <P>Now the time has come when we must be prepared to export and to change our attitude.  I quoted the Minister before as saying, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 6th March last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is right, therefore, for us to decide even now that if and when a European economic arrangement, embracing all the countries of Western Europe, including Britain, comes into being, it is more likely than not that we will elect to go into it, and to begin now the reconsideration of economic aims and policies which such a decision would force on us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, to be prepared to change our attitude, and be prepared to export on a far larger scale, both because of economic necessity, the adverse balance of trade and so on, and because of the prospects, as the Minister says, of opening European markets, and the gradual progressive lowering of European tariffs, including, presumably, Irish tariffs, if we join it, as I believe the Minister wants us to do.</P>
    <P>So what do we do?  We try now to persuade foreign investors and manufacturers to come in and build up our export trade for us.  Non-nationals are now being invited.  I am inclined to say: &ldquo;Well, well!  What about self-reliance? What about our own industries? What is the matter with our own industrialists who have been so carefully nurtured and protected in the course of the last 20 or 30 years?&rdquo;  But even if we recognise this new departure, perhaps, as a courageous step, a courageous admission of past mistakes, we find to our dismay that, even as we invite in these non-nationals to build up our export trade for us, we consider ourselves bound to tie them up, when they do come, pretty firmly.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to lasso foreign investors to get them to come in here and do what our over-protected and somewhat flabby industrialists&mdash;51 per cent.  Irish national&mdash;are apparently almost totally incapable of doing; but <Col N="501" /> we will not give these non-nationals, these foreigners, a free hand.  We want apparently not only to rope them in but also to rope them up when they get in.  I believe the Minister is desperately trying by this Bill to reconcile valuable and valid economic aims with Party political considerations which are not so demonstrably in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>If we look at the details of the Bill, I think we shall find several points&mdash; we will have to discuss them in more detail on the Committee Stage&mdash;where restrictions are put on or implied which would have the effect of discouraging rather than encouraging foreign investors.  I should like to point to Section 4, sub-section (2), which deals with companies which can be &ldquo;excluded companies&rdquo; to which the Acts do not apply.  I notice paragraph (b) provides: &ldquo;that it is managed and controlled in the State&rdquo;.  I cannot help wondering what kind of test you put as to whether a company is not merely managed but &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; in the State, controlled in theory and in practice.  A particular company in theory can be controlled in the State but in practice the control may well lie elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Again, according to paragraph (c), the memorandum of association and the prospectus of such companies must provide &ldquo;that the carrying on of a manufacturing process in relation to a commodity intended for export is a principal object.&rdquo;  Export of a commodity must be &ldquo;a&rdquo; principal object&mdash; not &ldquo;the&rdquo; principal object.  It does not have to be the principal object. You can have apparently several principal objects of which one must be to export.  The Minister referred in the Dáil on another occasion to &ldquo;sea lawyers&rdquo;, for whom he did not apparently seem to have great respect, but it seems to me that this kind of clause must have been drafted by submarine lawyers, bringing us to murky depths, because it will be extremely difficult to prove or disprove that a particular commodity is &ldquo;intended&rdquo; for export, and that that is a principal object, one of the principal objects but not necessarily the principal object.</P>
    <P>Again, paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) of Section 4 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" />&ldquo;that, of each class of shares carrying voting rights issued by it, not less than 50 per cent. have been <i>bona fide</i> issued for public subscription in the State and have been made available primarily to Irish citizens or Irish companies which are managed and controlled in the State,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Primarily&rdquo;: what exactly is meant by that, and how can you prove they were primarily &ldquo;made available&rdquo;, and so on?  Does that mean first in point of time, numbers or percentage?  What exactly will have to be proved in that connection?</P>
    <P>Section 5 admits that it shall be lawful for a company carrying on business, despite anything said in Section 9 of the 1934 Act, to indulge in a manufacturing process, provided certain things &mdash;(a) such company carries on business primarily for export....  It goes on, at the end of the same paragraph &ldquo;... sales by it on the home market of each commodity in respect of which it carries on any manufacturing process are incidental only to its export trade in that commodity,....&rdquo;.  The home market must be merely an &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; thing.  The question arises: by what standard is that to be judged?  To some extent, the answer is given lower down in sub-section (3) of the same section, because there we are told that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a commodity in respect of which it carries on any manufacturing process shall, for the purposes of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of this section, be deemed to be incidental only to its export trade in that commodity, if, taking one year with another, the quantity of that commodity sold by it on the home market does not exceed 10 per cent. of its total output of that commodity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I foresee difficulty there again in testing, &ldquo;taking one year with another&rdquo;&mdash;not merely taking last year with this year but presumably also taking next year with this year.  How will you test in fact whether the amount exported amounts to 90 per cent. and not less?  What does it mean, <Col N="503" /> in legal terms, &ldquo;taking one year with another&rdquo; over that period?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, arising from the point that certain manufacturers will be allowed in, provided only 10 per cent. of their products are marketed at home, what will happen if, for example, a first-class product is being manufactured by one of these new factories which produces here, mainly for export, this first-class product that beats anything comparable we can get on the Irish market, and the Irish consumer is consequently told that it is for export only?  I imagine that the Irish consumer, feeling that he is denied something that is being exported, may feel injured if he is told that the Irish market can have only 10 per cent. of this output, that it is mainly for export and that the Irish consumer must put up instead with a second-rate job, a second-rate substitute because this Bill lays it down that only 10 per cent. of this product, however good, may be marketed on the home market.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with certificates of exemption.  The Minister can exempt certain Irish companies from the application of the Bill if he is satisfied that a main object&mdash;not, again, &ldquo;the&rdquo; main object, but &ldquo;a&rdquo; main object&mdash; of such a company in doing so or in intending to do so is to develop an export trade.  &ldquo;A main object&rdquo;, not the main object.  There could be three or four, presumably, &ldquo;main objects&rdquo; of which one must be export. The Minister can then give these certificates of exemption.  As I read this, I wondered under what circumstances could the Minister rescind these certificates of exemption.  I was surprised to notice that in sub-section (5) of the same section it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may at any time alter or revoke a certificate of exemption upon the application of the holder thereof, but not otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, he can give a certificate of exemption but he cannot take it back again unless he is asked to take it back by the person to whom he gave it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> I may be misreading this, but this seems to imply that the Minister cannot rescind such a certificate of exemption, even if the company in question, under Section 6, ceases suddenly to comply with the original conditions which were necessary for the granting of such a certificate.  If the Minister has power, under this Bill, in those circumstances to rescind such certificates of exemption I should like it to be pointed out, as I fail to find it here.</P>
    <P>I do notice in sub-section (7) of this same Section 6 that there is a whole series of paragraphs pointing out under what circumstances the certificate shall &ldquo;cease to be in force&rdquo;. However, none of these mention the possibility of a sudden failure, perhaps, to comply with the original conditions which were required for the granting of this certificate of exemption.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal with further details now but I would suggest that this Bill, which is supposed to be removing restrictions, retains so many restrictions that it may well prove to be offering foreign investors a singularly uninviting welcome.  Several Senators have made the point that foreign investors may not be at all tempted by the conditions abumbrated by this Bill: they may not feel that this is a genuine welcome.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am not particularly enamoured of private investors or private vested interests, Irish or foreign. I believe we could, as a community. find by our own credit the national capital required for a socialist planned home investment policy in the national interest and thus build up a real solid home industrial structure. I realise that even the word socialist is a frightening one here, and that therefore we find that we must turn from our own capitalists, who apparently have not enough money, drive, initiative, or whatever else is lacking, and, instead, try to tempt the foreign investor.  Since Irish enterprise is apparently too soft, unresilient, flabby, to build up our export trade to the level now increasingly required, we have to invite the foreign industrialists to come and <Col N="505" /> save us&mdash;the non-national investors whom, for years, we have been holding at arms' length.</P>
    <P>Yet we are afraid even now, even in this situation, to let them in freely for fear they will show up some of our home exponents of private enterprise in the industrial field.  Therefore, we surround our so called invitation to the foreign investor with a host of restrictions, regulations, provisions and requirements, to such an extent that, by attempting to reconcile the irreconcilable, the Bill may well, in my opinion, defeat its own only avowed purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill can best be described as a very positive step in the right direction.  It should be viewed by the Seanad as part of the general pattern of Government policy which has emerged in the past year.  In particular, it should be viewed along with tax incentives which are being given under the Finance Bill, 1958, with particular emphasis on the incentive giving 100 per cent. income-tax and corporation profits tax remission on all profits derived from exports over ten years.  I think that provision in the current Finance Act, taken in conjunction with the measure before the Seanad, should show that the Government are taking a realistic attitude with regard to our problems at the moment.</P>
      <P>The real trouble has been mentioned by Senator O'Brien.  Whether we like it or not, we have a lack of risk capital, risk capital to expand the exports we need to rectify our balance of payments position.  We have a lack of risk capital to provide growing investment at home, and to provide more employment for our people.  There may be socialist solutions to provide more capital, but I do not think socialist solutions can provide risk capital, that capital which goes into exports and into competition on competitive markets abroad.  That is what is so badly needed to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes in his opening speech made some points about the difficulties in connection with this Bill.  I think they were really merely pleading points.  Nobody will expect that a <Col N="506" /> foreigner who is going to come in here will read this Bill; but he will want to know the idea behind it.  I think in that respect the recent brochure published by the Industrial Development Authority set a very good headline. There should be no difficulty in incorporating in future editions of that brochure three or four main headings which can set out the intentions of this Bill now before us.  The Minister, in introducing the measure, quite clearly set out the intentions of the Bill, and there is no need for any foreigner to go through the Bill, if explanatory literature is given to him.  In that context, congratulations are due to the Industrial Development Authority for the very fine publications we saw in recent months.</P>
    <P>Certain criticism has been made of the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932. We have to be realistic about the thing. This is 1958 and political measures are always taken in relation to the time in which people live.  If a certain political measure was opportune or apposite at a certain time, it does not mean that that measure should be opportune or apposite in this period. I think the measures passed in 1932 and 1934 were justified then.  The composite measure, the Control of Manufactures Act, did have the effect of putting the control of Irish industry for the home market into Irish hands, and, viewed in the context of things as they were in 1932, when this was a young nation which had only shortly regained its freedom, there was full justification for a measure of that kind. Circumstances have changed to-day.</P>
    <P>To-day we have a situation where the home market is pretty well provided for and our need now is for a rapid expansion in exports.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington may ask why has Irish industry not achieved that expansion.  The answer is quite simple. It comes back to the question of risk capital, and risk capital backed by technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;.  Irish industry has a small market and has not sufficient technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; or sufficient risk capital to provide the basis for expanding an export market in a vigorously competitive <Col N="507" /> world.  It is very wrong for Senator Sheehy Skeffington to come in here and use the privilege of this House to castigate people who have built up Irish industry during the past 20 to 30 years.  At the moment, Irish industry is starved of risk capital and this is a measure to try to induce some of the risk capital to come in from the United States or Britain, to expand industrial exports and exports based on agricultural production.</P>
    <P>At first, I thought that this measure did not go far enough, but we should bear in mind that the Minister is the man charged with the responsibility of negotiating this country's interests with regard to the European Free Trade Area.  He is the man in possession of the facts.  I think his attitude in this matter is that the time is not yet opportune to provide for a more complete repeal of the Control of Manufactures Acts.  Our position with regard to the European Free Trade Area is still very much in the air.  As things stand at the moment, the matter will not be finalised for another year or two and, even then, we will be allowed to stagger our tariffs over a reduction period of 12 years.  I do not think an argument for the full repeal of the Control of Manufactures Acts would be valid, unless we had a complete Tree Trade Area and we were an integral part of it.</P>
    <P>Until that day comes I think it is wise to reduce gradually the barriers and impediments that existed in the old legislation, and gradually liberalise the position.  I do not believe the argument for complete liberalisation would be valid until we have become a part of a completely Free Trade Area. Until that occurs, we must proceed, pace by pace, introducing gradual liberalising measures as this Bill does.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 are important sections in this Bill and I consider a most important provision to be in Section 5 which provides that a company which carries on business primarily for export shall be completely exempt from any control with regard to foreign investment.  An amending sub-section was passed in Dáil Éireann providing that an export <Col N="508" /> business be defined as a business which carries on all its business primarily for exports, but taking one year with another would have a business not exceeding 10 per cent. of its output on the home market.</P>
    <P>I should like to see that sub-section liberalised so that 20 per cent. might be substituted for 10 per cent.  It might provide a greater incentive and would make this a more liberalising measure, and I should like the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>Another important liberalising measure is the section in regard to &ldquo;excluded companies&rdquo;.  Here we have a provision where a public company whose memorandum of association sets out it is primarily intended for export and providing it offers 50 per cent. of its shares to the Irish market will also be free from the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act.  That is a provision which is not likely to be utilised, but it is a good thing to have there.</P>
    <P>In Section 3, we have the provision with regard to &ldquo;excepted commodities&rdquo;, which provision may not be utilised to any great extent, but it is no harm to have it in.  With regard to Section 6, which brings in the certificates of exemption, I fail to see why that section cannot be linked with the licence section in the old Act.  I can see very little difference between licences provided in the 1934 Act and certificates for exemption in this Act. I think a simplification might have been effected there by grouping certificates of exemption and licences, preferably by using &ldquo;certificates of exemption&rdquo; rather than the old word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; which has unfortunate connotations.</P>
    <P>At first reading, I thought the Bill was rather too complex, but I do not think that should be any deterrent. The important thing is to have its main provisions properly displayed and publicised in financial papers abroad and in brochures.  That is the important thing.  I do not think the rather complex nature of the Bill should act as any deterrent to investment.  In fact, in certain circumstances, it may be a good thing that there are embodied in the Bill provisions that cater <Col N="509" /> for a lot of emergencies or situations which may arise.</P>
    <P>I had an unfortunate experience recently in dealing with the Industrial Development Authority in regard to matters under the Industrial Grants Act.  That Act, passed in 1956, was, in my view, hastily drafted.  The result of the hasty drafting of what was intended to provide for grants outside the undeveloped areas to industry, was that, if my information is correct, very few grants were made by the Department under that Act.  It is one of the weaknesses&mdash;or it may be the strength of the Civil Service&mdash;that it interprets legislation rather rigidly.  These provisions in regard to excepted commodities, certificates of exemption and excluded companies may result in the same rigid interpretation which obtains so far in regard to licensing provisions.</P>
    <P>The criticism has been made that we should not have had those various provisions in the new Act, but a more liberal interpretation of the old licensing provisions.  I do not think that is quite true.  The plain fact of the matter is that the old licensing provisions&mdash;which still obtain of course &mdash;were rather rigidly interpreted.  The Bill itself was carefully considered and amended in Dáil Éireann.  The most important section is Section 5, providing for complete exemption of industries which are primarily exporting industries.  &ldquo;Primarily exporting&rdquo; is interpreted as 90 per cent. export.  I should like that altered to 80 per cent., giving a basis of 20 per cent. or something like that, year in and year out, on the home market.</P>
    <P>As regards the efforts being made by the Government at the moment to expand investment here for the export market, certain criticism can be made of the Department's structure at the moment in relation to grants and loans. I think there should be far greater liaison, under a single administration, of the Industrial Development Authority, An Foras Tionscal, the Industrial Credit Company and the Trade Loans Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  We have had indicated to us that the Trade Loans Section has been amalgamated with the Industrial Credit Company; but with regard to the Industrial <Col N="510" /> Development Authority and An Foras Tionscal grants-giving sections, and in regard to the Industrial Development Authority in its function of administering grants under the Industrial Grants Act, there should be far greater centralisation, so that a man could go into one office or one Department and ask an official what particular grant was available to him where he proposed to site his factory.  There is far too much running from Billy to Jack, from the Industrial Development Authority to An Foras Tionscal and over to the Department and back again.  That is the only suggestion I offer in regard to the present structure of the Department and the sections under it which are related to grants and loans.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome one and one which the Seanad should have no difficulty in accepting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all agree with the aims of this Bill, which are to attract new investment from foreign sources, to add to our own resources in operation at the moment and for the expansion of exports.  We have found that, since 1932&mdash;in fact, since the beginning of self-government here &mdash;we have been carrying on industries which cater mainly for the home market.  That home market is not increasing, but is actually declining, and it has become absolutely essential, from saving the national life point of view, to find exporting industries.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed, we are told, to meet the situation that exists now and to invite in foreign capital and also to increase exports.  I have talked to a lot of business people about this question of exports.  Undoubtedly, the Government is going out of its way to give incentives for export, but it seems to me that the suggestion in this Bill is that we can have industries here which are designed practically for exports alone.  I gather from my own experience and from what I have heard, that that is not possible, that no sensible person could go into a business designed completely or mainly for export, because the export market is the most dangerous of all things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan mentioned 10 per <Col N="511" /> cent. home trade.  I think an industry would be doing very well if it could export anything from 25 to 35 per cent. of its product.  I am sure the Minister has gone into this closely and I would like to know countries which have industries 90 per cent. dependent on export trade.  We have our own experience here in the past with the meat trade and we had it last year with textiles.  We built up what was for us a good export trade to France in textiles and the French Government just closed down on it.  Meat exports to America were also closed down.  I should hate to be a manufacturer, setting up in a big way and investing a lot of money and expecting to do almost the whole trade in exports, with all the danger of its throat being cut by some tariff or some prohibition by the country with which he was trading.  The Minister has not said anything about that.  That is a practical point on which the whole Bill and the whole situation hinges.  We all want exports, but my own feeling is that it would be much better to realise, as Senator Lenihan said, that this whole policy is tied up not only with the question of letting people in to trade and to bring in their money but of enabling them to trade profitably.</P>
    <P>The fault in our whole industrial set-up is that the permanent taxation system has completely destroyed the will and the wish to build big businesses, or even the possibility of building big businesses.  These two things must be tied together. This Bill is only something which opens the door, as Senator O'Brien said, to these people or to capital coming in here.  They must have a climate inside the door in which they would be able to live, grow strong and grow healthy.  These two things must go together.</P>
    <P>We have had people going backwards and forwards to America in recent years, under all recent Governments in power, and we see no result. I saw the Minister himself recently, when he came back from America.  He said that, as a result of extending the period in which there would be freedom <Col N="512" /> from tax in the free port area at Shannon, from six to 25 years, there were more tangible and more realistic inquiries.  They are still only at the inquiry stage, but at least that was a recognition of the basic thing in the direction of any industrial enterprise and the attraction of foreign capital.</P>
    <P>If taxation had been properly utilised here, and had not been used as a weapon to wreck business and make it difficult, not only would we not have these charges that private enterprise was not succeeding&mdash;they could not be made&mdash;but we would not have to look for money outside at this stage.  Our own industries would have been built up; they would be strong and able to carry their business into the export market, through their efficiency, through their strength, through their machinery, and so on.  Many of our industries have been only 25 years in existence, but from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;, they have been weighted down by taxation and by the miserable allowances for machinery and so on.  There should have been no tax on new machinery in a country like this starting off from scratch, but I am not going to stray into the realms of taxation.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to make conditions for people to come in here, and even inviting them to come in, until the climate is such that they can profitably carry on their businesses here.  This Bill might come first, but it is only a secondary consideration in the whole matter.  We all agree with the aim of this Bill, to attract investment for expansion of exports, but the question we are asking ourselves is: is this the right Bill, and the kind of Bill to attract people in?  I wonder is the Minister himself really satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>One of the deterrents to people coming in here in the past has been not only the fact that this is not a very good country in which to operate financially, in which to get a good return for your money, but it is also a country in which our conditions are not as good as we seem to think.  The framers of legislation since we got self-government again seemed to assume always that we have large <Col N="513" /> queues of people, Americans and people like them, with money in their hands, all waiting to come in here, and that we had something they all wanted and that we did not want to give them. There were all sorts of conditions surrounding anybody coming in.  That is not the case at all.  Very few people want to come in here, and to have a lot of regulations about five years' residence and so on is quite unrealistic.</P>
    <P>There is no lack of capital available for investment, and this is the best time for a country like this to hold out a hand of friendship to those people, because the areas for investment in the world to-day are shrinking.  We know what is happening in the Near East, in the Arab countries, in Indonesia and other places.  The areas for investment of capital are getting much smaller, and we have a marvellous opportunity, but we must grasp it, not by way of insisting on ten years' allowance on profits but by making a basic change in the whole taxation structure and liberalising our whole economy and life.  The Swiss have made Switzerland, with very little resources, one of the richest countries in the world through their taxation system and other methods.  If our taxation weapon were properly used, we could build up our own businesses strong enough to compete with any foreigners coming in, even through an open door, but we have to get that imaginative outlook.</P>
    <P>We have an outlook at present by which everything to do with manufacture and business generally is hedged in.  As Senator Lenihan said, people who come in here even when they only want to inquire about establishing industries, are sent from Billy to Jack.  They are sent to the Industrial Development Authority, to the Department of Industry and Commerce, to the Finance people and all over the place.  In the end, they get absolutely fed up, and then they are met with a string of Acts.  They are told about the Control of Manufactures Acts, and they will be told now about this Act.  Though it does definitely liberalise things a bit, I have not met anybody until to-day, when I heard <Col N="514" /> the Minister, who knew what the liberalisation was, who was going to be let in, and what were the conditions. Even solicitors who have been handling the Control of Manufactures Acts for the past 25 years did not know.</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere here is unbusinesslike and one into which I do not think any hardheaded business man would venture, because unfortunately it was necessary in our young State to build up our industrial economy behind tariffs and with Government and political impetus.  That was necessary in the beginning, and then, unfortunately, the war came at a time when there should have been a certain amount of letting people take responsibility, and competition and all those things.  The war necessarily put the Government solely in the saddle, controlling and directing, and on top of everything.  As a result, we have industries set up here which, because of their dependence politically and financially on protection of one kind or another, became sheltered and, generally speaking, became unimaginative. There was a stage when the Minister himself had to castigate them at their annual dinners that unless they woke up and did imaginative things, and did not shelter sleepily behind those tariffs and protection, the Government would have to do something itself.</P>
    <P>We set up an industrial economy that was unimaginative because it was being sheltered and propped up.  Then during the emergency we got a mentality in this country based on that of the Housewives' Association which everybody, including the Government, played up to&mdash;that prices were too high and that there were to be no profits.  The word &ldquo;profit&rdquo; was turned into &ldquo;profiteering&rdquo;.  That is the climate which we must now get out of.</P>
    <P>I feel that something strong and imaginative must be done instead of a Bill like this which is hedged around. I know that the Minister had great difficulties, and I sympathise with him. He had built up this Irish manufacturers' group and had given them certain shelter and promises, but he is now faced with the position where, in <Col N="515" /> the interests of the economy of this country, we must get in wealthy people who know their job to promote industries able to export.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if the fact were faced that we cannot have it both ways.  We are trying to back two horses.  We are trying to hold on to the 1932 Act and, at the same time, coming into the new world where we simply must get foreign capital.  We are displeasing many of the Irish manufacturers and making them frightened, and on the other hand, we are not going to get in the other people.  We are failing both ways.  I do not know what we can do now, when the Bill has gone so far.  My only concrete suggestion&mdash;I do not want to make a purely frustratory speech&mdash;is that if this Bill is to be of some good, it may perhaps achieve its aim if, first of all, it is clearly and simply explained to the people who come in here under it what will be done.  It must also be said that in future there will be a policy of liberalisation in all these matters, that this is only the first step to get the picture clear and the whole climate clear for real private enterprise where we will have our own manufacturers set up.</P>
    <P>Our manufacturers have been here for 25 years, and they ought to be able to breathe on their own and face people coming from outside.  Anybody should be let in from outside, provided he is decent and obeys the laws of our country, its currency and company laws.  If we do that, we will get a climate in which we will have a dynamic private enterprise system.  I agree sometimes with the critics of private enterprise because what we have here is not private enterprise.  If I am in business as an Irish manufacturer, I do not want to be loaded down by restrictions.  Private enterprise must not be propped up by the State. There must be free competition and so on.  It should be like West Germany and America, where you have to be able to do your own business and to compete with others and they are in the same position.</P>
    <P>The State must allow an Irish manufacturer to do these things, and make <Col N="516" /> the atmosphere such that he can do them.  The fault we are suffering from it that you can never build up any capital, and if you do not, we are not able to have decent industries and pay decent wages.  The trade union movement is claiming the same sort of wages as in England because they have the same sort of organisation.  They are quite right to do that, but we cannot pay at the same rate because our economy cannot stand it and never will until industries and individuals here are allowed to become rich.  We are afraid to say that to-day.  Everybody must be kept poor.  If you want that, you can have it, but you are not going to have an industrial economy employing large numbers of people and stopping people from emigrating to England.</P>
    <P>One thing which I welcome in the Bill is that it takes the power of arranging for setting up industries out of the bureaucratic machine.  I do not say that in slight of civil servants. They are bound by so many regulations that any business man who comes to set up a business here&mdash;I met one in my office to-day and he was absolutely fed up&mdash;is sent from Billy to Jack and treated like a beggar man.  These are people who want to start industries here.  One thing we have been slack about is making arrangements for double taxation agreements with certain countries who want to come here. No reciprocal arrangements have been made with them.</P>
    <P>I know of one case in Sweden where they are asking again and again for some such arrangements, but in vain, and the reason given is that we have not got enough staff in External Affairs.  What is the good of asking people to come in here if that sort of situation exists?  We could get afforestation experts from Sweden and afforetation is a thing our own people will not undertake.  They have a natural aptitude for that in Sweden.  I know of one family in Sweden who own a great deal of land there and they want to come in here, but they are frightened. They are people who are willing to come here and put down forests which will not mature for 25 or 30 years.  Yet <Col N="517" /> our State cannot afford afforestation here.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was young every political Party which started out started with afforestation on their programme.  When I was young, I did not know what this was but it was in every programme.  This Bill is going to pass, whether or not we like it, or whether or not the Minister likes it, or whether or not he is satisfied that it goes far enough.  I suggest that on top of what it does, we should do other things.  Let us have incentives and liberalisation and get away from controlling manufacturers. Another thing that people are frightened about is the setting up of tribunals, although I think we are getting a lot of them out of our blood now.  We do not hear so much about people proving that the halfpenny which they put on their goods was not profiteering.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Act was carried too far.  It may have been necessary to a degree but decent, honest people were brought up before what was a public circus for people writing to the <i>Evening Mail.</i></P>
    <P>I see the Minister's difficulty in this Bill but I am sorry that we are not able to go further and faster.  I hope we will do these things in the course of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill aims to set our course for many years to come, just like the Bills of 1932 and 1934 were the first stages, one might say, in our economic development.  It is to be regretted that a general review of our industrial position has not preceded this Bill, so that we could have a clear cut evaluation as to how far protection has served our industries in the past and whether, after many years of protection, they are now reaching a stage where that protection can be lessened and where they are prepared to face competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard a good deal in the debate about vested interests and it seemed to imply a continuation of the high level of protection that many industries have.  I should suppose that in a dynamic economy, the aim would be to lower protection as fast as possible and get our industries on a competitive basis.  I regret this general review of <Col N="518" /> industry has not preceded this Bill, even in a short term commission, that would have given us some valuable information as to what we have achieved in past years.</P>
    <P>Judging by figures, we have created about 50,000 new positions in industries after 30 years' effort.  That does not seem to be very encouraging, especially when we face the position at present that emigration is flowing at the rate of 50,000 people a year.  If we are to stem emigration, it would seem that we need 50,000 new jobs a year but we have been able to accomplish only 50,0000 new jobs in 30 years of sustained industrial effort.  The emphasis now is, quite rightly, on the necessity to export, that is, for competitive firms.</P>
    <P>Surely we must face the fact that agriculture still offers the greatest single possibility we have for exports. We must face the fact that the policy of both Governments is one of the most serious handicaps to efficient agriculture. We speak of tariff protection, but to-day there is a penalty against efficiency in marketing of dairy produce. As long as creameries continue to jog along and make butter from their surplus milk, they can hand it over to the Butter Marketing Committee and get their share of the subsidy. If they are enterprising, if they strike out and make other and more valuable dairy products, like special cheeses, milk powders or any other products, they have to sell them for what they can get and there is no provision made to give them any of the money which the taxpayers provide.</P>
    <P>At present the situation is that the creameries can get say 1/5 per gallon for any milk they care to turn into butter, which can be sold in England for only 1/-, whereas there are many specialist dairy products for which they could get 1/2 or 1/3 per gallon of milk. If a creamery makes a specialist product at 1/2 a gallon, it loses 2d. or 3d. a gallon, as unlike milk converted into butter, the creamery cannot get any subsidy on such products.  We cannot have efficiency and we cannot get on with proper dairying expansion while such an outmoded attitude prevails, and that has been there over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> We are concerned here with emigration and with unemployment.  These are two major national problems and nobody can raise any other problem higher.  It is right that with those two problems the desire over all should be to set up industries that will have an employment content, but there again agriculture comes to the fore as the industry capable of absorbing more than all the others put together.  I have been making some calculations recently and I have found that if you were to increase the level of agricultural production by 50 per cent., it would call for a labour force of anything from 50,000 to 60,000 people.  These are the facts we get from the farm survey.  You can find the numbers employed by the farmers and if you use that as a yardstick as to what should be an efficient labour utilisation, you will find that if we increase our production by 50 per cent., we would need an additional 50,000 to 60,000 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was just taking agriculture as one of the manufacturing industries, interpreted in the widest sense.  I want to ask whether corporations set up specifically for the export of agricultural produce will come within the terms of the Bill.  Will they be allowed the tax exemptions that are to be granted? After all, the crying necessity at the moment is to set up a body that will tackle this energetically and in a businesslike manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I would suggest that the present laws are framed in favour of co-operatives because these are exempt from income-tax.  I would suggest that private enterprise should be placed on the same level as co-operatives in the development of this export.  In regard to attracting external investments, our efforts at present are directed towards attracting companies and our concessions are to companies.  We should consider the private individual investor.  We should recognise the fact that in England, America and elsewhere we have an empire of Irish people both born here and their descendants&mdash;<Col N="520" /> people who, with a little encouragement, would be prepared to invest here.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire raised the question of the double taxation concession.  I think we should make some concession to the private investors outside this country.  Could we have a tax convention by which a person would be liable only for income-tax deducted at source here?  There should be some means of giving some reliefs to that investor here.  If the investor was prepared to spend the dividends in this country, either by way of investment, holidays or in any other manner, we should, if possible, seek to relieve these dividends from income-tax.</P>
    <P>I have very little else to say except to stress that we must keep the whole picture before us.  Capital formation is just one aspect of the matter.  A nation is great in the modern age strictly in proportion to the way in which it develops the skills of its people.  That is what we are selling. That is what we are bartering with one another and in industry nothing compensates for management.  Professor Carter, writing in an issue of <i>Studies</i> 12 months ago, rightly summed up, in their proper priorities, the essentials for economic development. Put at the very head were improvements and management; secondly, the discovery, adaptation and spread of new technical knowledge.  After that came capital investment of a productive type.</P>
    <P>In other words, capital investment, even if attracted from abroad, will resolve nothing, unless we are prepared to develop the skills of our people.  Our people have shown their skills whenever they got a chance.  If we utilise properly our vocational schools, our agricultural schools and our universities, we will succeed, with adequate capital, in making spectacular economic development in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one or two small observations to make.  I did not intend to speak at all on this measure, were it not that Senator Quinlan reminded me of one or two points.  The Minister said he would encourage small <Col N="521" /> industries to start here.  I take it that private individuals starting in industry without being a company will not need to receive a certificate.  It is a peculiar anomaly that if a private individual establishes a company in this country and exports the whole of its products, the private industry would get no tax relief whatever.  Many of us in Houses like the Seanad have hobby-horses to ride round.  That is one of my hobby-horses.  For some reason or another, the private individual is nearly always forgotten in the framing of legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan also mentioned that the private individual ought to get the same facilities, if he started an organisation for export, as co-operative societies get.  I doubt if these matters are relevant to this Bill in the strict sense, but this is the type of legislation that is being enacted at the moment, whether a Finance Bill or a Bill such as this to assist manufacture.  I would ask the Minister to bear these matters in mind when there is suitable legislation to deal with them on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>For years we have been told about inviting foreign capital.  I regret to see at the moment that some industries are threatened with short time.  Some have, unfortunately, closed down.  I refer to flour milling which is just one of our industries.  Since Fianna Fáil came back the flour mills in Rathdrum have closed down and the employees have gone.  That is a sad state of affairs.  Yet we hear so much about inviting foreigners in here.  I believe the Government and the Minister&mdash;I know he is interested in local industries&mdash;will try to do something for the industries which are starving to-day for the want of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foundry in Enniscorthy town, which was established years ago, is on short time.  Some of the tradesmen, the fitters, and moulders and their families, have emigrated.  That is a sad condition of affairs.  What have the Ministers who have gone to America or Canada done to bring back industries?  We hear a lot of talk about new factories being started. Where are they?  When the previous Government was in power and when <Col N="522" /> Canadians were brought in to exploit the Avoca mines, the people in power to-day said we were bringing in foreigners.  Of course, they have been proved wrong.  The industry in Avoca will, I hope, pay dividends in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Everyone welcomes a Bill&mdash;certainly I will from the trade union point of view&mdash;which will put people to work in their own country because everybody is waiting for the day when some industries will be provided.  The Minister said in his election campaign he was able to provide 1,000 jobs or more.  I should like him to fulfil that promise.  We in the trade union movement, and being a worker myself, meeting the people in my constituency, are waiting and hoping for an improvement.  Consider the position of young men, some of whom have just left school.  There is no prospect and no hope for them.  Every Saturday night, the boat from Rosslare takes the cream of the country away to work in factories in Britain, in some of which there is sweated labour.  I have had experience of that myself, as I did it, too.  I had to emigrate before we had our own freedom.</P>
    <P>There is a threatened redundancy in the whole flour milling industry.  Two weeks ago, representatives of flour milling workers were called to Dublin for a national conference.  What are they faced with?  They are faced with redundancy.  That is the position in the flour milling industry to-day which is next to agriculture in importance. We all know that in his early days the Minister brought back the production in the flour mills.  Now, after all the years, are we to fall back again?</P>
    <P>We hear people talk about the land. Machinery is putting the workers off the land.  A tractor is now run probably by the farmer's son or daughter, and there is no employment.  He is doing his own work and then he goes over and does that of his neighbour. That is the reason why we have so few persons on the land.  There is no employment, as machinery is putting them out.  Every industrial man here, every man who is manufacturing anything, is going to the far ends of the earth to find machinery for mass production <Col N="523" /> which, in effect, means mass unemployment.  That is really happening.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire said that the workers want the same as workers in other countries.  We have a long way to go before we come up to America or Britain so far as wages are concerned in some of our industries.  I do not think that is the right view.</P>

      <P>I understand we can discuss everything that is manufactured. Our main industry in the country to-day, if properly used, is agriculture and next to that is Guinness.  That is a great industry.  If we had a few more like them, we would have less unemployment in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience of going on a deputation from Enniscorthy to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, about the establishment of an industry.  One man was prepared to put down £25,000. We met the Minister.  What were we told?  We were told, in effect: &ldquo;We cannot do anything for you.  You must go to an undeveloped area.  You must go to the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;  That is the position that exists to-day, and that is why Southern Ireland and other centres are getting nothing.  It is all because of that clause.  People were prepared to go to Waterford or Wexford, where they would be near a port&mdash;but no: &ldquo;You must go to the West.&rdquo;  That <Col N="524" /> attitude has been taken since the passing of the Act in question.  We had people who were interested in our district, but they could not come in. If they had gone to the west of Ireland, they would have got more money and capital than by going to the south.  That will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>We are talking about getting foreign capital.  What are we doing here?  We are actually subsidising the British to eat our butter.  That is a sad state of affairs.  We are paying for the exportation of our products.  What have we to export?  Could the Minister tell us what we manufacture in our factories that we export?  I can see nothing. Our best export trade is cattle and agriculture.  What else do we export? I hope the Minister will tell us all that will be exported when this Bill is enacted.  If we do not look after the industries which are already established, and give them capital where they need it, there is no use in asking foreigners to come here and promising them all the money they want to start industries because they will not come. They require a guarantee.</P>
    <P>If we go into the Free Trade Area, what will happen?  Talk about protection: if you had an open Free Trade Area to-day, our industries would be closed as we could not compete against the mass production of foreigners.  They could flood the City of Dublin inside 48 hours, if they were allowed to do so and if the tariff wall were lifted.  It would be a bad job if that wall were lifted, so far as people in industry are concerned, because we cannot compete against these other nations.  Just reflect on the toy situation at Christmas.  Toys are dumped here.  Vans are travelling all over Ireland with foreign-manufactured goods.  What can we do to stop it?  Nothing, because we have not the machinery or the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;.  We have to get the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and the skill to carry on.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Dáil from 1943 until I became a member of this House. Listening to and reading debate after debate, my opinion to-day is that we have never been in such a bad position with regard to industry and the giving of employment.  If the Minister can <Col N="525" /> remedy the present serious situation, he will be doing a great day's work, not only for himself but for the Government of which he is a member.  However, if he does not succeed in remedying the situation, then, when his term of office comes to a close, if there is anybody left in the country to vote, the people will show their disapproval. There may not be anyone left in the country to vote except the capitalists because the working classes are fleeing across the water as they cannot live here.  It is sad to have to make that observation to-night after all our years of self-government and after all our talk about industries and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall welcome this Bill if it will do what the Minister hopes it will do, but I wonder if we still need these restrictions, with the possibility of a free market in the future?  I should like to hear the Minister say what he expects the position would be in this country if the 1932 Act, the 1934 Act and this Bill were swept away. Does he not think that what we would gain by that would be more than what we would lose in respect of the entry, perhaps, of foreign capital?  Somehow I think the restrictions in these other Acts or in this Bill may be inclined to keep foreign investors out of our country.</P>
      <P>Take also this much-discussed clause in the Bill about the 10 per cent. production&mdash;&ldquo;taking one year with another.&rdquo;  I should like to know how many years the Minister proposes to take when examining the affairs of a company under that section.  Take a company which is started and which is not exporting 90 per cent. of its produce.  What will be the position if the Minister finds that they are not exporting 90 per cent. of their goods and are, in other words, possibly selling more than 10 per cent. on the home market over a number of years? Will he be in a position to close down or penalise that factory in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes directed attention to Section 9 of the 1934 Act in relation to this Bill.  It is in a sub-section of Section 5.  Later on at the end of that section we find that the whole of this Section 9 is repealed, apart from about three lines, or something like <Col N="526" /> that, at the beginning of the section, and the usual penalty clause at the end.  I think that four times throughout this Bill we get these words used: &ldquo;Section 9 of the Act of 1934, as amended by Section 5 of this Act.&rdquo; I feel that would be one way of slightly simplifying this Act.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should consider putting a clause in this Bill whereby he could prohibit a foreign manufacturer coming in here and manufacturing goods for export to a country of a certain character, perhaps unfriendly to this country or to some of our good neighbours.  I have seen where such a position created difficulty between the United States and Canada. Canada, I believe, was the country to blame for exporting goods manufactured by a branch of a United States company set up within its boundaries, to a country to which the United States had prohibited the parent company exporting.  I could visualise a possibility where a factory would start here on receipt of a certificate from the Minister and, perhaps, export goods which the United States or Great Britain would not want exported to any unfriendly country. As far as I know, the Minister has no power in this Bill to prevent that happening, and I ask him does he not think it necessary to include such a prohibiting clause in the Bill?</P>

      <P>The Control of Manufactures Act was one of the weapons which was devised in 1932 for the purpose of initiating at that time the industrial drive designed to develop manufacturing capacity to supply the requirements of the home market in goods that were previously imported. Other weapons in addition to the control of Manufactures Act were the Control of Imports Act, the Industrial Credit Act, the Imposition of Duties Act and some others which it is not necessary to name.  These weapons were forged for a specific purpose, to achieve the aim of industrial policy at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial policy at that time was, as I said, aimed at the limited objective of producing here in Irish factories the manufactured goods that were capable of economical manufacture on <Col N="527" /> the basis of home market sales, and that process is now at an end.  We have developed here, by and large, the manufacturing capacity which is required to supply our own needs of goods which are of a character which can be economically manufactured on the scale of operation which the limited demands of our home market necessarily impose.</P>
    <P>We are now entering into a new phase of industrial development. If our industrial progress is to go on, it clearly must involve manufacture for export.  In so far as we are meeting our home market requirements of nearly all the things we can economically produce here, further progress must mean the extension of these industries in every way, so as to permit of their engaging in export business, and the bringing into being in this country of the industries it was not possible to establish here before, because home market sales were not sufficient to give them an economic basis of operations, but which can be established for export sales entirely or for export sales supplementing home market sales.  In the second phase of our industrial development, with this new policy objective before us, we need new weapons.  The weapons of 1932 are no longer fully applicable.</P>
    <P>At that time, we were using the weapon of protection, the control of imports, the imposition of duties, the measures which were designed to ensure that manufacture here would not have to meet undue competition from imported production.  These weapons will become less and less effective.  They have not become completely useless yet, because many industries can be established here only on the basis of some home sales. Security on the home markets is often the only foundation on which export markets can be built, but, nevertheless, these weapons will be becoming less important in the future.  Similarly, the Control of Manufactures Act requires adaptation to the new circumstances, revision so as to encourage the emergence of industries which have export possibilities.</P>
    <P>In 1932 we had to face a main issue of policy and it was this: should we <Col N="528" /> seek to get manufacturing industry established here by any and every method even if it took only the form of branch factories established by externally controlled firms and operating by remote control from the parent houses, or should we decide to build up industries which were, so far as we could secure, under Irish control.  We decided on the latter course and I do not think we would have got any worthwhile development at all if we had taken the other decision.  Irish controlled companies would not take the risk of engaging in manufacture here with the threat hanging over their head that the previous suppliers to the market, after the Irish firms had started, would set up branch factories here which would exploit their established trade connections and even, if necessary, undersell the Irish companies until they had driven them out of business.  On the other hand, the branch type of factory development would not have taken place unless the threat of the development of Irish companies was there, unless there was a prospect of losing the Irish market to a new industry set up here at home.</P>
    <P>The record of that period establishes beyond doubt that without the protection given by the Control of Manufactures Act we would not have got the industrial development we have already achieved.  Let us consider that situation in the future.  Has that situation ceased to be true as far as industrial activities confined to the home market are concerned?  Clearly not.  In the context of a European Free Trade Area, this Bill or any similar Bill might be completely inappropriate. Indeed, it is not at all unlikely that the provisions of a free trade agreement will require the removal of the restrictions for which this Bill provides. But we are not into that situation yet and we will not be into that situation, no matter what emerges from the negotiations going on, for many years to come.  We still have to think in terms of the measures we should adopt in relation to a situation where the home market would still be protected against competition from outside.</P>
    <P>Most of the export trade development <Col N="529" /> we have secured so far has come from the initiative of Irish industrial firms.  Consider the position of any one of these firms at the present time, if it had to face now the prospect of having to meet competition in the home market from branch factories set up by powerful and wealthy external concerns.  In 1932, the boot and shoe industry of this country produced, I think, about 3,000 pairs of boots and shoes per year.  There were one or two small concerns and that was the total output.  To-day that industry is producing something like 6,000,000 pairs and its output substantially exceeds our internal requirements and the surplus is exported.  Many of the firms in that industry are considering the possibility of further extensions into export trade.</P>
    <P>Do Senators think they would go on with that, if they were now to face, because of the repeal of the Control of Manufactures Acts, the prospect that they would be attacked in the home market by branch factories set up by powerful and wealthy external firms? It is still necessary to maintain the restrictions which the Control of Manufactures Acts imposed, in respect of operations on the home market, if our industrial progress is to go on. This idea that we can help industrial promotion by a repeal of those Acts is a complete illusion.  It ignores all the realities of our situation here.</P>
    <P>Let me say that, in circumstances of free trade, in circumstances where the competition will come anyway, either in the form of goods imported from abroad or goods manufactured here, clearly this legislation would have little relevance, but in the conditions which exist now and which are likely to exist for some years, these restrictions are still required, and it is by maintaining them that we will bring these firms, stage by stage, into the development of export business which will ensure their survival in circumstances of European free trade.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration in that regard which certainly applied up to now, which still applies, and which will probably apply for some years to come, that is, the instability of industrial development through the <Col N="530" /> branch factory.  We are getting an object lesson in this in other parts of Ireland at the present time.  A branch factory set up and controlled by a parent house is always a marginal production unit.  It will be fully employed only in times of boom; it will be the first to be curtailed in times of recession.  That is why we see in Belfast at the moment the present recession hitting that area more severely than it is hitting Britain itself &mdash;because of course the marginal units are the first to be affected.  We do not desire that type of development here.</P>
    <P>That is why even in this Bill the restrictions that are being removed are being removed in respect of companies that are mainly controlled in Ireland, which are independent units capable of following an independent policy and not merely the subsidiaries of companies elsewhere.  It is inevitable that any concern with branch factories in foreign countries will, in times of trade recession, shut down those branch factories first and concentrate in available business in its parent establishment, keeping that in full production with full efficiency, and only spread its business into branch factories when the capacity of the parent house is fully utilised.  Therefore, I think it would be very bad policy indeed and would have a most detrimental effect on our present industrial situation and future industrial prospects if we were to repeal the Control of Manufactures Acts altogether.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have to recognise this need, that in so far as further industrial expansion involves export business, we want concerns here that are capable of doing export business.  Our existing businesses are bit by bit finding confidence in themselves and in their capacity to export, they are accumulating reserves and increasing exports which will enable them to extend in the future.  We have every reason to be proud of our achievement and the disparaging remarks about Irish industry here this afternoon are by and large completely unjustified.  No one is going to give a blanket certificate of efficiency to all Irish industrial concerns, but a <Col N="531" /> blanket condemnation is equally preposterous.</P>
    <P>We have seen quite a number of Irish concerns urged to explore export possibilities, assisted in doing so by market researches carried out by An Córas Tráchtála or in other ways, finding themselves&mdash;often to their own surprise&mdash;capable of standing up and beating competition from longer established firms in many of the markets of the world and finding their enthusiasm for the effort to expand their exports increasing as their confidence grows also.  We recognise that all these existing firms to which I am referring were firms set up, in the main, primarily with the idea of supplying the home market, and over and beyond the range of industries which were regarded as practicable on that basis in 1932, there were other industries which were never capable of being established here on an economic basis merely to meet the home market demand, where export trade was from the beginning essential to their successful operation.</P>
    <P>In the establishment successfully of industries of that kind, we require something more than external capital. We require the experience, the technical knowledge, the capacity for organisation, and the market contacts. We believe, in many of these cases, that can best be done by associating with this development firms already engaged in these industries elsewhere which have all the knowledge of what is required for their successful development.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire seemed to say that it is foolish to be thinking in terms of industries doing export only, that is, the third rank of the industries we are contemplating.  The fact is that there are being set up at the moment a number of industries of that kind. There is an engineering industry being established in Kerry and a chemical industry in Sligo.  The important position in respect of these concerns and some others which I have not yet mentioned is that the internal home market demand would be less than 10 per cent. of their production. <Col N="532" /> There is no question of &ldquo;limiting&rdquo; them to 10 per cent. &mdash;they could not find in Ireland a market for 10 per cent. of their products.  One firm came to me quite recently, a firm setting up a new industry here to which I had undertaken to give a Control of Manufactures Act licence and who said: &ldquo;We will not need that licence now; we have seen the new Bill and will come under (a) of Section 5, because we will not be selling 10 per cent. of our production in the home market; there is no sale for 10 per cent. in the home market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely it must be possible for us to contemplate the setting up here of other industries of that character.  I do not want to get fanciful; but we could contemplate, say, a manufacturing firm making aeroplanes or shipbuilding or other types of industry which, of their very nature, would have to find a world wide market for their products and where home sales would be of no significance to them.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at the Bill in relation to that picture of our situation.  In this Bill, we set out to achieve two objectives.  One was to liberalise the Control of Manufactures Acts, to remove restrictions and provide inducements to firms coming into Irish industry to do export business of the kind I have been referring to, to put as few impediments in their way as possible, and to let it be known that we were encouraging external investment in industries of that character.</P>
    <P>We had the other objective&mdash;to preserve the protection already given in respect of home market operations to existing firms, to continue the policy of the Control of Manufactures Act of 1932 for the time being in regard to developments which are confined to the home market and which do not contemplate or involve any export trade at all.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the effort to combine these two objectives has led to any confusion.  The Bill achieves both these objectives quite clearly.  Some Senators suggested that we should have repealed the Control of Manufactures Acts altogether and re-enacted them so that all the law relating to the carrying on of industries in this country would <Col N="533" /> be in one Bill.  I think that would have been a bad idea.  The Control of Manufactures Acts are quite elaborate and deal with various possible eventualities, many of which never arose.  I thought it much simpler to take this Bill and set out in it the changes we are making. The references back in this Bill to the original Acts are really only of concern to companies already in business. So far as new companies are concerned, they can find in this Bill alone all the conditions that will apply to their operations here.  These conditions are set out, in the main, in Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I urge Senators not to read that section as if paragraph (a) were the only part of it.  My main trouble in getting the Bill through the Dáil was because Deputies insisted on dealing with the section as if it consisted only of that paragraph, which says that a company doing business primarily for export, whose home market sales are only incidental, does not require any sanction of licence or permission or even to come down to any Government Department and tell them what they were going to do.  That was just one of the provisions of the Bill, and one obvious provision having regard to the policy behind it.</P>
    <P>May I say in that connection that the assumption that external firms coming in to establish industries here dislike coming to Government Departments and telling a Government Department what they propose to do is not always well founded?  Indeed, only quite recently, I had discussions with representatives of another firm who told me their plans and I said: &ldquo;There is the Bill.  You are entitled to do it, and you do not need any permit or certificate.  You do not even have to tell me.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;We will not be satisfied with that.  Give us at least a letter telling us that you approve of what we are going to do.&rdquo; It has been our experience that some firms prefer to have some licence or certificate or authority which is evidence that their advent into this country and their plans for development here are known and approved by the governmental authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> However, so far as the law in future will be concerned, certain companies will be in this position, that they can start into any branch of industry without any permission or authority, and without even having to inform any Department of the Government what their intentions are.  Senator O'Brien was quite accurate in reckoning the firms that will be in that category.  All undertakings carried on by individuals or partnerships will henceforth be completely outside the terms of the Control of Manufactures Acts.  A very large proportion of the licences that were issued under the Control of Manufactures Act were of that kind. It was never intended to impose restrictions upon a refugee coming in here and starting to repair watches or something of that kind.  Quite a number of individuals in one way or another started small little repairing or manufacturing operations and found that they required a licence, and we had to go through all the formality of granting them one.  In future, they will be completely outside the terms of the Acts.</P>
    <P>The Control of Manufactures Acts will apply only to companies which are in business in a fair way; where the fixed assets employed in the business are less than £5,000 in value, the firms will also be outside the scope of the Acts.  Hence, while these must be re garded as changes to improve the administration, they will have the effect of reducing very considerably the number of licences, and they indicate also the intention to confine control in future to concerns which, through their operations, are making a fairly substantial impact upon the industrial position here.</P>
    <P>Outside these firms, there are others which in future will be entitled to engage in any manufacturing operation without any permission of any sort being necessary, without having to inform any Government Department, as if the Control of Manufactures Acts were not there at all.  They are those concerns doing business primarily for export.  Some people have questioned the definition set out here.  I would be against too rigid a definition.  I think that the phrase &ldquo;where home market <Col N="535" /> sales, taking one year with another, are not more than 10 per cent. of output&rdquo; is good enough.  I would dislike increasing that percentage, because that could be the occasion of difficulties to some existing Irish concerns and might be damaging to the whole prospect of industrial development. Indeed that suggestion of increasing that percentage arose only from this consideration of the Bill as if that paragraph (a) of Section 5 were the whole Bill.</P>
    <P>A company will be outside the Acts, and entitled to proceed as if they had never been passed, if it goes through the process of making an offer of shares in a <i>bona fide</i> way to Irish investors.  We do not stipulate that Irish investors must take up 50 per cent. of the shares, for if they do it is outside the Control of Manufactures Act anyway.  If they make a <i>bona fide</i> offer of shares, and the stock exchange committee are satisfied that it is <i>bona fide</i>, and that they made a genuine attempt to offer shares under fair terms to Irish citizens, and otherwise complied with the conditions of that section, then again the decision of the stock exchange committee puts them in the clear.  They are entitled to engage in manufacturing business of any kind without any authority or sanction from any Government Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, provided they comply with all the conditions set out in Section 4, even though they are going into competition with firms already existing.  In those circumstances, such a company which makes an offer of shares to Irish citizens will be so entitled.  I was asked about the significance of the term &ldquo;made available primarily to Irish citizens.&rdquo;  It means that, if the issue is over-subscribed, when they are coming to allot the shares, the obligation will be on them to give preference in allotment to people who are Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a second class that will be outside the terms of the Bill.  There is the company that engages in the <Col N="536" /> manufacture of goods that are excepted commodities under Section 3.  I have deliberately toned down the significance of that section.  In framing this Bill originally, I proceeded along the lines of having a schedule which would list the commodities to which the Control of Manufactures Acts would not apply, but I found the difficulty of defining those commodities was such that it was impracticable.  Section 3 is the nearest approach to what was in mind; it is quite obvious that the same difficulty of definition which prevented the scheduling of commodities in the Bill will operate to limit the operation of that section, but it could be the easiest way of handling a particular proposition, if and when that proposition is made to us.</P>
    <P>Of course a company which is a qualified company within the operation of the Control of Manufactures Acts will also be entitled to operate freely without any restriction or licence. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of Section 5, on which Senator Hayes commented because of their referring back to the original Acts, are of course of interest only to existing companies.  Their purpose is to make it clear that a company now in business is entitled to continue in that business and that nothing in this Act will operate to prevent it from doing so.</P>
    <P>That did not cover the whole of the situation.  That condition, for example, that a company could become a qualified company free to operate by offering shares to the Irish public for subscription would not mean the more typical type of case that arises, the company that intends to offer shares to the public at some future stage but was planning to get into production first and of proving its capabilities.  It is to meet that case that we brought in a certificate of exemption.  Such a company can come, before it starts operations, and get a certificate.  It can qualify itself under the other arrangement by making the proper offer of its shares later on, which it probably intended to make from the start.  We know there are many companies which started that way.  They did not try to raise money from the public because <Col N="537" /> they did not think they could get it, but went to the public later when they could present a number of satisfactory balance sheets.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of an existing Irish company which is at present under the obligation to control the transfer of its shares, though its shares are quoted on the market.  When they are transferred from one person to another, the buyer must certify that he is a qualified person under the Control of Manufactures Acts; otherwise the transfer can be invalidated.  In order to enable them to get additional capital from external sources, they are entitled to come along and seek a certificate of exemption.  That certificate can be given to a company which is 100 per cent.  Irish-owned.  They get this freedom in respect of transactions of their shares and the possibility of negotiating with external interests for new capital for the extension of their operations at some future time.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill and they represent a fairly complete liberalisation of the Control of Manufactures Acts, as far as companies which intend to get into business for the purpose of exports are concerned. In so far as companies which are externally controlled want to come in here to engage in operations solely for the home market, the position will be the same as before.  They are excluded from doing so, unless they get a licence.  They will get it if it is clear that they are adding something to the industrial organisation of the State, but otherwise they will be refused it.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows, what is likely to emerge from these Free Trade Area negotiations yet.  I said, and Senator Sheehy Skeffington quoted my remarks, that we must at present frame our policy on the assumption that it is more likely than not that we will go in.  I think that none of us could face with any enthusiasm the prospect of the rest of Western Europe being combined in a Free Trade Area arrangement and our remaining outside it as an isolated economic unit.  I do not think our prospects in that situation would be very bright.  Facing a situation in which a Free Trade Area is going to come anyway, and it would <Col N="538" /> not be in our power to stop it, I think we will have little option but to go in. If that is to be the prospect, we must start thinking now of the measures which will build up for us industrial units capable of maintaining themselves in that situation, of meeting the stronger competition which will come and availing of the wider opportunities which will then be open.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the philosophy of Senator O'Leary who thinks that increased efficiency and techniques will result in less employment.  The whole of the world's history shows the opposite.  Every improvement in the technique of production has not merely raised the standard of living of the population, but added enormously to the employment possibilities for the people, whatever temporary dislocation may be caused.  Improved techniques and machines will, in the long run, increase our capacity to employ people and develop our ability to keep down production costs, so that we can compete on the world's markets with the products of other countries.  The most hopeful indication that we are going to face the future in a realistic way, in recent months, has been the growing acceptance of that philosophy by the leaders of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, in view of the remarks by Senator Hayes, that there is no retrospective condition of any sort in this Bill.  There is no company now in business which will have its continued operations prejudiced in any way by any provisions of this Bill.  It is true that in future it will not be possible to get around the requirements of the Control of Manufactures Acts by the device of setting up £100 companies and financing operations by loans or credits from abroad.  No company already set up in that way will be prevented from carrying on the business it is now doing, but in future no new business of that kind can be set up.  I wonder what would have been said if I had brought in a Bill containing elaborate arrangements for amending the Control of Manufactures Acts and leaving that situation unchanged?  I am sure everybody would say: &ldquo;This Bill is a farce <Col N="539" /> because everybody can resort to the old device of setting up a £100 company and getting their finances by various unusual methods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are stipulating as one of the requirements which must be met by a company which wants to carry on business without a licence in the future that the fixed assets should not be less than half of its share liability.  That is the best safeguard that I can think of, but if anybody can produce a better device I shall be very glad to hear him on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington talked about Party political considerations dictating this Bill.  I do not understand what he is talking about.</P>

      <P>I support that hope. Some Senators have urged that there should be a review of tariffs and Senator Quinlan wanted a general review of the situation and a justification for tariffs in operation.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington also, I think, was arguing that industries which got high tariffs to start with should now be able to carry on with lower tariffs and that the lower tariffs should be brought into force.  I cannot think of any more inappropriate time to start a general downward review of tariffs when negotiations for the Free Trade Area are still in their present stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGuire about the importance of double taxation agreements.  Indeed, this Bill must be taken as only part of a general scheme designed to bring about the expansion of industry we require.  The tax concessions already made and the arrangements which have been completed for expanding the resources of the Industrial <Col N="540" /> Credit Company are all part, of one scheme designed to facilitate and encourage the industrial expansion at which we are aiming.  I would agree that the question of double taxation with countries is most important.  I have been pressing strongly for them. I think it is not unfair to say that the pressing work on staffs in other Departments is a delaying factor.  I hope to find a way out of that without adding to the cost of the Civil Service at some stage.</P>
    <P>I would agree fully with Senator McGuire that the prospects of a general taxation reduction would be as good a stimulus as anything.  Perhaps at some stage that may be possible but let the House not take that as a promise.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that we might prohibit companies here manufacturing goods for export to Iron Curtain countries where these companies were not allowed to do that business in their own country.  There are at present a number of export restrictions in force by international agreement on what are known as strategic materials to these countries. They are in force here as well as elsewhere. If there is a problem there, it must be dealt with by control of exports rather than by control of manufacturing.  So far as I am concerned, the companies can come here and manufacture anything they think they can get sale for.  If there are now in operation, or should at any future time come into operation, restrictions upon any types of trade, then they will, so far as we are concerned, be similar to those in force elsewhere, so that no Irish concern will be unduly affected thereby.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that many of the points raised in this Bill will be raised again in Committee, because, while the Bill has a general purpose behind it&mdash;and it is that general purpose we are discussing&mdash;the particular provisions of the Bill are open to examination. Senators must not find fault with me because I amended the Bill quite a lot in Committee in the Dáil.  I made it clear that I was open to consider suggestions not merely from the members <Col N="541" /> of the Dáil but from organisations and individuals outside the Dáil interested in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it was first presented to the Dáil, had certain defects in it, of which I was quite conscious.  I felt it was better to let it be circulated and let the comments and criticisms come in.  I got some very valuable comments, criticisms and suggestions from people who studied it.  As a result of hearing all their observations, the various amendments were produced.  I do not think they changed the Bill fundamentally nor did the change in Title alter the Bill fundamentally.  It was a fair comment to say that the use of the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; in the original Title was likely to be discouraging to persons reading the Bill as a preliminary to putting up a proposal for an industrial proposition in Ireland.  That is why I took it out.  I do not think anybody is likely to read the Title as meaning that the Bill is one to encourage Irish people to invest abroad.  It is, after all, an Industrial <Col N="542" /> Development Bill.  It is clearly Irish industrial development we are thinking of.</P>
