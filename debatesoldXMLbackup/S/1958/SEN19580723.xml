      <P>During the course of the debate last Thursday on the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Bill, I made a certain statement which the Chair asked me to withdraw. In the heat of the moment, I refused to withdraw it and I realise now, Sir, that in not complying with your request, I transgressed the rules of the House.  I now wish, in deference to you, to withdraw the statement, and to express my regret to you, Sir, and to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have liked to have spoken on the different sections of the Bill, but, first of all, I have been abroad and have only just come back and I have not had time to go into details as I would have liked to do. Secondly, I cannot help feeling that proposals and suggestions on the Committee Stage of the Bill in this House are rather futile.  Therefore, I shall not delay the House very long and I have taken the line of speaking on the Final Stage on the matters contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>One would expect from a Finance Bill, which is the translation of the Budget into law, that its provisions would go further than merely collecting taxation from the citizens and the business community.  It is always felt, and it should be a fact, that the Finance Bill should be an instrument not only for collecting taxation but also an instrument of economic policy, something that would enable the country to expand its economy and create wealth from which more money could be derived by the Exchequer at a lower rate of taxation.  If our economy were expanded sufficiently to give a larger national income, we would be able to get the money required to run the State at much lower rates of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you ask anybody to-day what he thinks of this Finance Bill or its contents, he will probably say that what strikes him is that it is a further tightening of existing methods of collecting taxes and an extension of the ways of doing it.  First, there is a greater squeeze on individuals; there is to be a more rigidly-imposed form of assessing taxation and the Revenue Commissioners are to utilise further the ordinary citizens and business people to do tax collecting for them. That is the broad picture most people see in the Bill.  There are reliefs for exporters and industry and some other <Col N="1121" /> minor reliefs, but on the whole these reliefs are unimaginative and not the type of thing we in our present circumstances require to create national wealth and achieve the increase in national income we need, if we are to keep our people at home and employ them here.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of this Bill also is that it seems to be copied straight from the British Finance Act, except that we seem to select the rather penal and petty side of the British Finance Act, without giving the imaginative side or the really broad and visionary side any consideration. To take one outstanding item&mdash; surtax&mdash;we start surtax at £1,500, whereas in Britain, at present, it is £2,000.  There is talk&mdash;and serious talk &mdash;in financial and business circles of extending the £2,000 to £5,000.  I am sorry to say it is an indication of the small-mindedness that we bring to bear on financial and business matters in this country, that it was thought not only by this but by other Governments, that it would be unpopular to extend surtax beyond £1,500.  Anybody having £1,500 is supposed to be wealthy and supposed to be able to bear this penal taxation.  I would submit that is not correct.  I think the surtax figure should have been raised here from £1,500 to at least £3,000.</P>
    <P>My point is that we are disappointed that on this occasion, as on every other occasion, no imaginative approach was made through the Finance Bill to bringing about the dynamic industrial economy here which we so badly need.  In fact the boot is on the other foot; we have a running-down economy; we go abroad to Paris and elsewhere telling the people we are an undeveloped country, that we are only starting.  We cannot always be &ldquo;only starting&rdquo;, especially after 35 years.  This approach is rather pathetic.  Western Germany had to start in 1945 having been beaten to the ropes and yet we now find her with one of the most dynamic economies in the world.  That is because she used finance weapons imaginatively and by using private enterprise instead of trying to carry on with a half-baked socialist, state-run economy.</P>

      <P>On the Fifth Stage, the Senator must confine himself to the contents of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, Sir, I am confining myself to the contents of the Bill, and to the provisions in it.  It is admitted by everybody that a Bill of this kind must be aimed not only at the collection of taxes but also at the direction of our whole economy. I say that the provisions in this Bill are not such as to create the incentive and the opportunity to provide the kind of economy that we need in order to pay the taxes imposed by the Bill.</P>
      <P>I did not make any suggestion on the Committee Stage because it is my experience&mdash;and the business community and vocational bodies feel very strongly on this also&mdash;that though representations were made in regard to many of the sections in the Bill, those representations achieved practically nothing whatsoever.  The views and suggestions of these bodies were listened to, but I can see no indication in this Bill of their views and suggestions having been acted upon.  There is, therefore, a sense of futility and disappointment among our citizens generally, and there is a feeling that among the higher authorities in the Government there is a sort of self-satisfaction and unapproachability.  Even if the Minister for Finance happens to be a rather nice person, and meets representatives of the various sections of the community, one may be sure he will not act on anything that is suggested, even by chambers of commerce, and I think it is my duty to draw attention to this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will say that he is awaiting the report of the Commission on Taxation before he gives us a different kind of Finance Bill next year, directed not only at tax collection but at creating a better and sounder economy.  If that is so, well and good, but I hope we shall not receive a report from the commission which will not be of much use.  Whether it be good or bad, I hope the Minister will have enough experience to do the right thing, without being told by the commission what he should do.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1123" /> the terms of reference of the commission make it almost impossible for it to make any constructive or imaginative suggestions for the future. I am frankly disappointed, as are business people and citizens in general, with the contents of this Bill.  It is a very long Bill but nine-tenths of it is taken up with squeezing more taxation out of fewer people than ever before. Unless we change this conception of Finance Bills, and this mentality, I am afraid we shall not have any improvement in our national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind Senator McGuire that the Finance Bill deals with taxation.  I do not know what exactly the Senator has in mind with regard to providing some kind of economic policy in it.  The only way it could be done would be by changing the incidence of taxation.  If any Senator goes through the Bill, he will find there are more reliefs given than new taxes imposed.  In fact, no new taxation is imposed.  There is, however, provision made that people who are avoiding and evading income-tax will have to pay in certain ranges, if the Bill is successful.  It is more rigid in that way, as the Senator says, but I do not think any Senator should object if an attempt is made to make the incidence of taxation more equitable all round.</P>
      <P>As I said before, we all detest paying income-tax but it is at least a little more tolerable if we feel everybody has to pay it, and that some people are not getting away with it.  The greater part of this Bill is devoted to that end.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned in the Dáil, as well as in the Seanad, that surtax commences here at £1,500 and that in Britain it begins at £2,000.  There are only a few isolated instances like that where British taxation is more favourable than ours.</P>

      <P>If a man has a wife and two children, it starts at £2,500, but not otherwise.  We have also been criticised for pleading in Europe that we are an undeveloped country.  If our delegates had gone across to Europe and said we would be able to stand the full implications of the Free Trade Area, I am afraid we would be criticised also.  The reason we are pleading that we are an undeveloped country is to allow ourselves a little more time to make the adjustments necessary.  It was done in the interests of this country because our manufacturing industries are mostly new and, in some lines, manufacturing business has not yet started.  That plea was made so as to give a chance to the business people here to develop their businesses.</P>
      <P>It is quite true, as the Senator said, that I did receive representations from chambers of commerce and other organisations of that kind.  We discussed the provisions in this Bill and they did not like some of them.  I did not see they had made a very good case why those provisions should not be put in the Bill, and I do not see how that matter can be resolved, unless you let the Minister for Finance have the last word.  If we were to agree here, by legislation, that the Minister for Finance should not have the last word, I do not know where it might end.  I certainly would be very pleased, indeed, if I could do what Senator McGuire says, that is, to give some relief in taxation in the next Budget.</P>

      <P>The Appropriation Bill is a recurrent annual measure and follows stereotyped lines.  The present Bill does four things: (a) it authorises the issue from the Central Fund of a balance for 1957-58 which was granted too late to enable it to be covered by the Central Fund Act, 1958; (b) it authorises the issue from the Central Fund of the <Col N="1125" /> balance of the amount granted for supply services for 1958-59 (i.e., the full amount less that already authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1958); (c) it empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the limit of the issues provided for in (a) and (b); and (d) it appropriates to the several supply services the sums granted by the Dáil since the Appropriation Act of 1957.</P>
      <P>The explanation of the individual sections and schedules of the Bill is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 1 authorises the issue of £271,860 from the Central Fund to cover seven Supplementary Estimates for 1957-58 which were taken too late to enable them to be covered by the Central Fund Act, 1958.  The Supplementary Estimates in question were:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Section 2 authorises the issue of £73,502,220 from the Central Fund thus supplementing the issue of £36,500,000 already authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1958, and bringing the total of authorised issues to £110,002,220 which is the amount shown in the Estimates Volume as required to meet the cost of the supply services in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Section 3 empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to £73,774,080 being the total of the amounts authorised by Sections 1 and 2 to be issued out of the Central Fund.  The Minister is already authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1958, to borrow up to the limit of the sum authorised by that Act to be issued from the Central Fund for 1958-59 (£36,500,000).</P>
    <P>The object of the provision about the Bank of Ireland is not to confer any special privilege upon that bank but to place it in the same position in the matter of lending to the Government as other banks.  Under Section XI of the Statute of the Irish Parliament <Col N="1126" /> (21 and 22 Geo. 3, C. 16, A.D. 1781-82), under which the Bank of Ireland was established, the bank is liable to forfeit any moneys advanced or loaned by it to the Government unless the advance or loan is specifically authorised by Parliament.  Section 4 appropriates to the specific services set out in Schedule B the sum of £118,329,717 which is the aggregate of the amount required for the supply services for 1958-59 (£110,002,220) and the Supplementary and Additional Estimates of 1957-58 (£8,327,497) which have not yet been appropriated because they were introduced after the passage of the Appropriation Act, 1957.  The section also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts as appropriations in aid of the specific services mentioned in Schedule B.</P>
    <P>Schedule A gives particulars of the issues out of the Central Fund authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1958, and the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Schedule B sets out in detail the specific services to which the sums granted are to be appropriated and so forms the basis of the audit of the Appropriation Accounts carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have so accustomed ourselves over the years to watch the growth of the Appropriation Bill that we have come to the point that we cannot pretend to be surprised, no matter how large the demand made by the Minister for Finance.  However, when we come to the question of how that money is to be spent, there is an obligation on the Members of the House to express their views on the value the country is getting for the money.  We had the practice in this House some years ago whereby Members were enabled to give notification of the particular aspects of Government policy they desired to discuss, and Ministers were made available to the House to give replies.  As we all know, it is a very difficult matter to discuss Government policy on the Appropriation Bill.  Every Department of State has money provided for it in this Bill, and we are entitled to examine what is being done in each Department.  It is not a simple matter for any Member to jump across from <Col N="1127" /> one to another, from agriculture to health, to local government, to external affairs, and so on.</P>
      <P>In that sense, the debate on Government policy here is definitely restricted and, perhaps, to a certain extent, to the detriment of the House and the country.  I am saying that by way of comment because many Members of the House have wide experience in many fields.  There are members of the agricultural and industrial communities here and many Members have experience of health and local government. What they have to say and what they think about the situation in the country at the moment ought to be of interest to any Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In the first place, I want to make a few remarks in regard to our agricultural industry.  This is an opportunity for the Seanad to review what we have done in the past and to look to the future.  I have no desire to be unduly critical.  After all, perhaps the only people who ever succeed in bringing about reformation in any field are the people who are critical of what is being done or what is not being done.  The comment I have to make is that I do not know quite what we are after.  I just do not know what the policy is. I get the feeling it is rather a policy of standstill and hesitation, not knowing whether we are to march straight along the road or go to the right or the left.</P>
      <P>The country cannot afford that.  The Minister cannot permit such an attitude of mind to be cultivated here.  We can cultivate that attitude of mind by a policy of just doing nothing or remaining as we were.  We know the difficulties in the dairying industry to-day.  Those of us engaged in it are bound to be hesitant about what we will do in the future.  There is no clear vision and no leadership.  There is no pointing out what we are to do. There is no feeling of confidence amongst our farmers and governmentally we are not getting a lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a great defect.  If people are in a difficulty in an industry, if they cannot see the light themselves and if their own leaders cannot see the light, in so far as the Government can aid <Col N="1128" /> them, it is their responsibility to do so. Milk prices were reduced because of the world situation in regard to butter. That has created an attitude of mind on the part of the dairy farming community where there is hesitancy, doubt and fear about the future.  That is not good for progress.  This country cannot afford to rest on its oars or sit still.  We must go ahead all the time and get more out of our factories, our fields and our cows.</P>
    <P>I have said in the past, and I repeat here to-day, that I do not think we have anything like enough cows in the country.  We do not know the view of the Department of Agriculture on that point.  If they have a view, we do not know it; it has not been expressed. My judgment is that we ought to set our faces towards increasing the number of cattle in the country&mdash;cows and dairy cattle.  Whether or not we will process the milk into human food products, whether we will produce more live stock or eventually beef and dead stock, that is the aim we ought to have.</P>
    <P>That ought to be tackled immediately because, concurrently with that, there must be a development in regard to grassland farming in the country.  We are glad to see that development taking place all over the country, not to the extent we would like, but to the extent that we grow more and better grasses.  It is much more popular to grow good grass now than it was 20 years ago.  It was not the thing we wanted to cultivate at all then.  We can only turn that grass into good money when we have beasts to eat it.  All that must go hand in hand.  Unless the Minister for Agriculture gives a lead in this matter&mdash;a stronger and more direct lead than has been given&mdash;the farmers are disposed to be hesitant.  Many of them rest on their oars because they do not know whether to turn to the right or the left.</P>
    <P>The country is in a sort of doldrums about wheat.  This is not a problem about which I propose to talk a great deal to-day.  In years gone by, I expressed my view.  I think the Minister present was Minister for Agriculture at the time and I am sure he will recall what I said.  I am not going back to the <Col N="1129" /> records and I do not want to weary the House with that sort of story.</P>
    <P>The point I always tried to emphasise, in the early years, in regard to wheat-growing was that at best it meant 300,000 or 400,000 acres of land and that, as there were 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 arable acres, it was not what mattered with the wheat that was the most important point but obviously what mattered with the rest.  The propagandists were too effective from the point of view of their own wellbeing&mdash;from the point of view of Party policy&mdash;but were too effective, also, from the country's point of view.  We now have a sort of crisis about wheat which is affecting the people's capacity to concentrate on the remainder of the arable acres in the country.</P>
    <P>As I see things, there is a lack of balance of thought, action and direction in regard to agricultural policy.  That has to be put right.  There ought not to be muddled and confused thinking. This is something which ought to be above Government.  Farming policy should not change with changes of Government.  In that sense, I think the country is growing up and that some of the political leaders have grown up and are appreciating that errors of thought and errors of policy in the past are now something we need not talk about or analyse unduly.  We can accept that there were errors of thought in regard to Government policy and in regard to what was said about live stock in years gone by.  We have learned our lesson but let us learn it all round.  That is my plea.</P>
    <P>I say to the Government as I say to the members of my own Party and to everybody in the country that what you do with 400,000 acres of land, highly productive and well-cultivated, does matter in the country's economy.  It may matter a very great deal in certain circumstances, in times of emergency, and so on.  Nevertheless, it matters much more what you do with the other 10,000,000 acres.  There is too little thought about that.  My plea is that there should be more thought and concentration on the policy we should pursue with regard to these acres.</P>
    <P>I want to point to this fact.  I have <Col N="1130" /> said we ought to increase the number of cows in the country and at least bring them up to 2,000,000.  There are many reasons which I could advance for that doctrine.  The price of store cattle to-day is extraordinarily high. We in this country are benefiting from the fact that the British are paying an enormous subsidy on beef and on the production of live stock generally.  The small farmers of this country are benefiting by the £7 and £8 subsidy which is paid across the Border or in Britain for sucking calves.  It is fabulous.  When you examine it rationally, it does not seem that the economics of it can be sound.  However, it is being done and pursued as part of a national policy.</P>
    <P>It must also be remembered that, in Britain, they have developed their agriculture and, indeed, have gone far beyond us in their development.  A big industrial community has subsidised the agriculturists to the extent of hundreds of millions in the year.  Probably two-thirds of the farming income in Britain to-day comes from Government sources.  That figure may not be correct but the fact is that it is an enormous amount.  Therefore, their output has developed to something like 60 per cent. above the pre-war level.  That is influencing our economy and it ought to influence our desire for development.  It is definitely having an influence on cattle prices in this country.</P>
    <P>To the extent that grassland farming has developed across the water and to the extent that they are not able to supply from their own herds the young animals to eat that grass, the demand must come from across the sea to us. We must be ready to meet it.  It may prove to be a tremendous factor in our economy if we face up to it.</P>
    <P>At the last sitting of this House, I referred briefly to one of the disabilities under which our farming community&mdash;and the nation as a whole&mdash; labour at the moment and will labour under in the year immediately ahead unless the problem of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis from our herds now is tackled.  I addressed myself briefly to this point on the last sitting day inasmuch as it seemed to me that it could create a difficult problem in regard <Col N="1131" /> to our balance of payments in the future.  It could, if we have not the animals available for export, and by &ldquo;available&rdquo;, I mean available from the point of view of health.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I do not want to make a difficult situation more difficult than it is.  However, I have no use at all for the situation in which we find ourselves to-day with the Minister for Agriculture and, indeed, other Ministers, and all of us, if you like, talking about the eradication of T.B. from the herds of Ireland which at the moment, altogether, would be 4,500,000 when we have no veterinary staff dealing with the problem in the country.  Whatever the difficulties may be, I urge the Minister for Finance to give every assistance. He can give one a knock but he can also&mdash;I will say it for him&mdash;be a mollifying influence.  I urge him to take this problem in hands at once. Whatever the difficulties may be, whatever difficulties are turning veterinary officers out of the service of the Department into private practice to-day, and leaving me and my likes without a service and without veterinary officers in the county if we want to have our herds put under test by the Department, they must be surmounted for all our sakes and for the sake of the nation.</P>
    <P>This is 1958.  Next comes 1959 and then 1960.  If our herds are not then clear, will somebody tell me what will happen to our small farmers if only half the cattle that should be available are available for export because of health conditions?  It is a matter of the gravest importance for us all to-day.  It is grave because we have not in our employment a sufficient number of veterinary officers to tackle this task with the energy and knowledge requisite, if we are to do the job in the time left to us.</P>
    <P>It seems clear to me that the Minister will not have to pay out by way of subsidy anything like the amount which he has budgeted for towards maintaining the price of our bacon exports to Britain.  It looks at the moment as if, bacon prices having risen there, he will have a surplus in hands.  I would urge on the Minister that, rather than <Col N="1132" /> take back that amount by way of Appropriations-in-Aid, or whatever you like to call it, into the Exchequer, it ought to be utilised to assist in sustaining life in other branches of the agricultural industry which are to-day in dire straits.</P>
    <P>I refer especially to the poultry industry.  There, we have a branch of our agriculture which in days gone by was worth millions to our country.  It is just barely living now.  Nobody knows what its future will be.  If there is to be a future for it, it must be kept alive in the interregnum.  If the Minister is not prepared to help directly, I would urge him that, if savings accrue as a result of the price at present secured in Britain for our bacon, the funds ought to be made available for sustaining the poultry industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to our cattle, I was present at a gathering at the Spring Show when a representative of one of the dairy breeds from England was speaking to one of the herds societies here.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;We are up against two problems in Britain.  If we import from the Argentine we run the risk of importing foot and mouth disease.  If we import from Ireland, will we import T.B.?&rdquo;  He asked: &ldquo;Which will we choose?&rdquo;  Let us ponder on those words.  That is the choice they will have to make for the future.  If we get our cattle herds clear and free, it could very well be that the attitude of the British farmer, if his raw materials are to be available to him from this country, would be to close down on foreign imports of meat to a very considerable extent.</P>
    <P>I should like now to go on to another topic which is somewhat removed from what I have been speaking about but is yet linked up with it.  We will all have noticed that a considerable number of views have been expressed with vigour, emphasis and understanding on the importance of having more trade representatives in British cities.  We all know that there are many who criticise the moneys we spend on our representatives abroad and there are some who would have us contract or close down our embassies and consulates abroad.  I do not know quite <Col N="1133" /> what is in their minds, but I do not belong to that group.  I am all for this little island making its presence felt in the world.  Heaven knows, we had a paper wall in front of us for too many centuries, and if we spend a little bit more than we can wisely spend, that is understandable and is something for which we do not have to apologise.</P>
    <P>It is our responsibility to the past, and our obligation to the future, to be represented among the people abroad, who know of Ireland and respect the opinions of the people of Ireland, who have a great admiration for many of our achievements and perhaps value our worth and place a higher estimate on our competence than sometimes we are prepared to do ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are spending a fair amount of money on our representatives abroad and I think they do us credit, on the whole.  I think they are worthy of the nation and it is only fitting that that should be said.  In Britain, and I say this from my own experience and judgment, there is room for improvement in regard to the number of representatives in the larger cities.  There are possibilities of trade development there which we must tackle and which we ought to tackle, and there are other possibilities as well.  Hundreds of thousands of people have left this country over the years and recently we heard a figure mentioned of something over 57,000 Irish men and women who procured national health insurance cards in Britain last year.</P>
    <P>These people are still a portion of the capital assets of the Irish nation and they ought not be neglected. Unfortunately, we know that many of them, far too many, are unequipped for the life into which they are catapulted in English cities.  Too many of them are uninformed and have not got fully developed characters.  Indeed, cities anywhere in the world are not the most suitable places for the development of young people who come from another land.  In England, there are hundreds of thousands of our race, and if we had representatives in these cities who would act in part as trade representatives and as well as rallying centres <Col N="1134" /> for the young Irish men and women, it would be extremely helpful.</P>
    <P>These men would be a sort of magnet and would attract the best of our people in these centres and build up a sort of community existence which, in turn, would draw in from the outer fringes those who are inclined to drift away from their traditions of nationhood, their religious traditions and their traditions of home life, as they know it here.  Such a step could achieve an immense amount of good for our people in Britain and for Britain as a whole.  I feel that that is a point of view that should receive consideration.</P>
    <P>We know that to-day the Catholic Church is sending missionaries to Britain to speak to the young people of our Faith, to keep them on the road which they trod when they were here, but it should not be left to the Church alone.  These people belong to the Irish nation; they are our brothers and sisters, and our sons and daughters; and I believe that if they were handled as they should be, they would be of immense strength to the Irish nation and to Britain itself. They would have great possibilities of providing informed opinion and thought in Britain.  They could educate the millions of people in Britain who are ignorant in regard to this island, and let them know what our people are like.</P>
    <P>There are just two other points on which I should like to dwell for a moment or two.  Various Ministers have piloted a number of Bills through the House during this session.  We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce here on a number of occasions when the Industrial Investment Bill was going through.  The policy enshrined in that measure is to attract foreign capital to this country, for its development.  Senator McGuire takes exception to the point of view presented to Europeans in regard to conditions of industrial development in this country.  Senator McGuire has been a little further than his own townland and can speak with some knowledge on the reactions of Europeans towards declarations like that from this island.  I do not know <Col N="1135" /> myself if they fit in too well with the kind of statements made on other occasions because it is difficult to harmonise the point of view of one who will speak with pride, and justifiable pride, of the achievements of this island in the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries, when its missionaries traversed Europe and brought civilisation and Christianity to areas where they were not known, and the point of view of one who rises up to-day and says we are undeveloped.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that in ways we are not developed.  We are not developed industrially.  However, it would be a great mistake to suggest that industrial development was the only sign or mark of a developed people.  That would be quite untrue.  If it is the type of civilisation which is to be found in industrial cities in Britain that we want to have here, then I think there would be quite a number of people who would not be at all enamoured of that idea.  I should like to hear Senator Stanford's opinions on that.  It is a good thing, and quite justified, to attempt to get on with the work of development, but it is not at all simple, and we do not seem to be building the foundations we expected and we are certainly not getting the returns after all the words that have been expressed. This matter has been spoken about both in this House and outside it, in the U.S.A., Britain, Germany and practically every country on the Continent, but the fruits have yet to be gathered.  The seeds have not yet started to sprout.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that with the orientation in the whole matter of world travel, and the attitude of nation to nation, we should give more attention to making a much greater investment of our share of capital assets in the development of the tourist industry than we have thought of giving up to the present.  I believe that there are vast areas in this country&mdash;there are areas in my county&mdash;which have never been touched by the foot of a tourist.  Senator O'Reilly comes from an area not very far from me&mdash;some 20, 30 or 40 miles away.  There is an area stretching from North Longford, Leitrim and down through the County <Col N="1136" /> Cavan to which tourists never dream of going.  It is visited by none of those fishermen who catch tons of fish in a week.  That area is completely undeveloped. It could be developed out of the resources available to the people in the area.</P>
    <P>If some of the hundreds of thousands with which we seek to employ 200 or 300 people in some of our small towns were spent over a vast area, I am convinced it would do a great deal of good and would confer lasting benefits on the country.  The benefits would be distributed over wide areas.  Business people, the farming community and the country would benefit.  It would benefit the country's sense of progress and its concept of what development is would not be perverted by the idea that you have only got to invite foreign technicians in with their money.  We cannot wait much longer for the sort of development I suggest. We should turn our thoughts upon ourselves; ascertain the assets available to us and try if we can to provide ourselves with the capital to develop these assets.</P>
    <P>There is a Minister in the Cabinet who is a very active and, I would say, an intelligent Minister.  He talks a great deal about fisheries and forestry. I will not make any comment on fishery policy, except to say that he is putting very hard work into it and eventually good will come from it.  The point I want to make is in reference to the development of our forests.  At times, it is difficult to know what exactly is our policy in this connection.  The area is up one year and down the next.  The Minister has changed the policy somewhat.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago, I suggested to a previous Minister that at least some thought should be given to the idea of interesting the small farmers and hillmen in the more remote and hilly areas of the country in afforestation. The people who reside in areas where forests are to be developed should be given a share in the forests by the State.  It might be only a small share.  I am convinced that the wisest national policy for us to pursue would be to invite those people to become shareholders in the forests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Although such a policy would not be easy to operate, it would do two things.  If you are to have forests and operate them when they are developed, manpower must be available.  It would be far sounder economics to have the manpower living reasonably adjacent to the forest.  Such a scheme is in operation in Sweden and I think it is in operation in Norway also.  Furthermore, if men have shares in the forests, they will have a sense of duty and responsibility in regard to what is their own.  They will do their utmost to protect their property against that most disastrous thing of all&mdash;the forest fire.  They will be interested to see the wanderers and the strangers who might come amongst them and they will be interested to see what they are doing with the property.  The development of forests in the more remote parts of this country always provides a problem in regard to fire.</P>
    <P>I should like to spend some time discussing problems of health and local government, but I feel that the points I have made are ample for one member of the House.  I hope the Minister will give some attention to the suggestions and I hope that the people on the opposite side will not think that I have been too critical of the defects in their agricultural policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I want to raise is, I think, not particularly appropriate to this Bill, but I have had no other opportunity of raising it.  I think it is of such serious import that it must be raised before this House goes into recess.  I am going to criticise a member of the Government&mdash;a Minister.  I refer to the specific undertakings given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce during the passage of the Tea (Purchase and Importation) Bill, 1957, through this House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce gave a public guarantee that certain things would be done.  His undertaking has been broken.  I failed to get any satisfaction from the Minister and I have met with nothing but evasion and delaying tactics, so much so that the first opportunity upon which I could get the matter raised was in the Dáil on the night of its recess, but the Minister refused to answer any question there. <Col N="1138" /> Now this House is about to rise and this is the only opportunity I have to raise the matter.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will bear with me as I have some rather extensive quotations to make.  A very large sum of money is involved but what is involved more is the dignity of this House and the system of Parliamentary Government, as we know it.  I now refer to Volume 49, No. 5, column 444 of the Official Reports.  I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What precise difference will there be between tea merchants who do not join this company and who import tea from the East and who have to import it through the company machine?  What precise difference will there be in the advantage or disadvantage that will accrue to them?</P>
      <P>Here is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. S. Lemass: None that I know of.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me quote from column 448:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Barry: Would the Minister indicate in figures, so that I could understand, what disadvantage it is to those who do not become members or shareholders?</P>
      <P>Mr. S. Lemass: They suffer no disadvantage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At column 450, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... I am trying to convince Senator Barry that it makes no difference to traders if they are in this company or not...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later in the same column the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What the Senator will be charged will depend on the services which the Senator requires.  If the Senator requires this company to act as his agent, presumably they will charge an agency fee.  Alternatively, he may buy the tea himself anywhere he likes &mdash;in Timbuctoo or anywhere else&mdash; and the company will recover for the service of shipping the tea in bulk to him only the proportionate cost of the freight.</P>
      <P>Mr. Barry: At precisely the same rate as it charges its own members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> Mr. S. Lemass: At precisely the same rate.</P>
    <P>Mr. Barry: I want that clearly understood in this House.</P>
    <P>Mr. Baxter: That is the Minister's answer on that point?</P>
    <P>Mr. S. Lemass: Certainly.  I have been saying that for the last five minutes.  I am glad it has penetrated.</P>
    <P>Mr. Baxter: The Minister did not say it clearly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me quote from column 455:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Barry:... I am accepting the Minister's statement that there is no disadvantage whatever in remaining outside this company&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That ends the quotations from the debate.  I think they are very clear.  I was very pleased at the clearness with which the Minister answered my questions. I felt he was rather peeved at the pertinacious way I followed him in this matter.  At any rate, I got the information I required.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, a firm of tea merchants in the south-east of this country wrote to me.  They were large wholesale merchants and they had apparently followed the course of the debate.  They said that the Minister's undertaking was not being carried out, that the company in question, Tea Importers (1958) Limited, had made a proposal to them that if they wanted to get tea shipped from the East, as well as paying the freight, carriage and insurance charges, they would also have to pay a tax to the company of 3d. per lb.  I wrote back and said that could not be so, because I had the Minister's firm guarantee that such would not happen.  However, I was worried and I wrote to the Minister; and I must quote now the letter I sent.  It is dated 30th June, 1958, and reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Minister,</P>
    <P>A paragraph in a memo from Tea Importers (1958) Limited, dated 20th June, says that &lsquo;where the company is called upon to act for a registered wholesaler who is not a shareholder of the company, an agency commission of 5 per cent. On the f.o.b. purchase price will be charged&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> This would run into a fabulous amount of money and directly contradicts your undertaking to me in the Seanad that non-members would not suffer disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It would add threepence per lb. to the other charges being made by the company for handling.  This would, in turn, be added to commissions paid to firms in Calcutta who buy on behalf of non-member firms in Ireland and would, efficiently, render such importers non-competitive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I dated that letter 30th June, but I had to wait 12 days for the reply from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter will be made available in the Library?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will lay all the letters before you.  I received a reply from the Minister, dated 10th July.  I got it on the 12th, but too late to get a parliamentary question put down before the Dáil rose.  It said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I received your letter of the 30th June&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I may skip that paragraph, as it is a requotation.  He goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It does not seem to me to be an unreasonable proposition that a non-shareholder in the company should be expected to pay a fee to the company for acting as his agent and I said in the Seanad that an agency fee would be charged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am going to leave that letter there. I felt that the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; was ambiguous, and I wrote to the Minister on 12th July:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>Will you please clarify the following:&mdash;If I purchase tea independently of the company, do I understand clearly (as stated by you in columns 450 and 451 of the Seanad Debates) that no charges will accrue to me outside the common charges for transport insurance, etc?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to wait another seven days for a reply to that.  I got it on last Monday evening.  There was no reply whatever made to the point, but it repeated the first letter and it was&mdash;I am saying this deliberately&mdash;a completely evasive reply, not signed by the Minister but signed by his secretary. <Col N="1141" /> I have given the appropriate details and I feel the House should be interested. My main purpose is to comment on the breaking of a public undertaking by a Minister.</P>
    <P>As to the proposal itself, that this company should levy a tax of 3d. per lb. on its competitors who are enterprising enough to do what the law requires of them&mdash;to buy from the countries of origin&mdash;it is an impertinent proposal that any citizen should oppose.  It was a custom in the Middle Ages that the king rewarded certain of his subjects, for services rendered, by bestowing on them the proceeds of certain taxes on imports. In 1958 surely this Parliament is not going to give a Minister power to bestow similar privileges on a small group here&mdash;to allow that small group to levy taxation on a larger group and effectively on the entire community. That I will resist and that is the reason for my insistence on this point during this Bill's progress.</P>
    <P>This company has obtained from this House power of monopoly in the matter of transporting and insuring this tea&mdash;and for that service they are allowed a State guaranteed gilt-edged profit of 10 per cent.  Surely they do not want more?  The Minister, who stated in this House that the company should only get reward for the services it rendered, now states that he does not think the proposal unreasonable. Thus, he denies a specific undertaking. I would ask the House to regard this matter as of grave public importance which reflects on the dignity of this House and on the integrity of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to get the Minister for Industry and Commerce here by hook or by crook, but he has failed to come and he has stated publicly in the other House that he would not receive me in his own office.  I think Senators and people outside should ask the reason why.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not very much to add in this debate to what I said on the Vote on Account and on the Finance Bill.  The simple truths which I attempted to enunciate on those occasions gain nothing by <Col N="1142" /> repetition.  At the same time, it may be important to keep repeating them, because, if repeated sufficiently often, they may carry some weight in certain quarters not yet convinced.  I shall give a few examples of what I might call elementary propositions which I think it necessary to emphasise in these debates.  One, for example, is that a Government or a country must live within its means.  Another is that no country can spend itself into prosperity. The third is that high taxation may have undesirable effects on a community by the disincentive effect on saving, investment and work.  The fourth is that high taxation is inevitable, if Government expenditure is high.  The fifth is that the best way to increase employment in a country is to keep down taxation to the minimum level.</P>
      <P>These are a few of the truths which seem to have received widespread acceptance in political circles to-day. At the same time, I think it necessary to keep on repeating them, in order to give the Minister for Finance moral support against the ever-increasing claims which are made from various quarters upon the public purse.  The Minister for Finance has started the present financial year with the best possible resolutions.  The Budget is balanced&mdash;at least, on paper&mdash;but, of course, between now and the end of the financial year, it is very likely that there will be a number of Supplementary Estimates.  I know the Minister finds it impossible to resist all the claims which may result in Supplementary Estimates; but I ask him very earnestly, from the point of view of the public good, to resist claims and to refuse all claims for Supplementary Estimates, except for expenditure of a productive kind, of a kind that will tend to increase the wealth of the country and not merely redistribute it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this attitude on the part of the Minister is necessitated by the economic background of the country at the present time.  As the Minister himself said in the Dáil, introducing the Estimate for his Department, the country at the moment is in a position of stability.  It is neither progressing nor declining.  The year 1957 was, by all the accepted criteria, a year of <Col N="1143" /> slow progress.  Agricultural production, industrial production, employment and savings all increased slightly during the year.  The external assets of the country also increased.</P>
    <P>As far as one can see, the prospects for 1958, though not bad, are not quite so good as for 1957.  In the first six months of the year, the increase in imports was greater than the increase in exports but the damage done to the balance of payments on that account was reduced by the improvement in the terms of trade.  I think it is not unreasonable to forecast that the present year will end without either a surplus or a deficit in the balance of payments.  If that forecast is correct, on the one hand, no restrictive measures of a kind which might cause unemployment will be necessary, but, on the other hand, no measures of expansion which might cause disequilibrium in the balance of payments are justified.</P>
    <P>When the balance of payments is just barely in equilibrium, as it seems to be going to be in this year, a domestic expansion would lead to a deficit.  A deficit in the balance of payments is generally agreed to be something which should, if possible, be avoided because it would result in a drain on our external assets.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might not be out of place on this last occasion before the recess to say a few words as to why this loss of external assets is regarded generally by economists, bankers and financiers as a very undesirable thing. It might be argued that, in view of the very large external assets held in the Irish Republic, the country could afford to run a deficit on its current account.  I think a very important distinction must be made between the liquid external assets in the banking system which are available for making current payments and the very large external investments, for example, stocks and shares in British companies, which are held by private people.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficiently appreciated in some of the discussions on this subject that the only external assets immediately available for paying for imports are the liquid assets in the <Col N="1144" /> banking system.  The privately-held investments are not at the disposal of the banks or the Central Bank or the Government, and anything in the nature of compulsory mobilisation of those assets would inflict a great injury on the credit of the country.  It would be a war measure which would be justified only in circumstances of extreme urgency.  Therefore, we must rule out anything in the nature of a raid on private investments and we must emphasise that the only assets available for meeting deficits in the current balance of payments are the assets in the banking system.</P>
    <P>Those assets have, by general agreement, sunk to a dangerously low level. It is true that, as a result of the better year in 1957, they ceased to decline and they later increased; but, even at the present level, they are a great deal less than they were some years ago and nobody, I think, would suggest that their level is not rather dangerously low.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that, as long as the present monetary arrangements in this country prevail, a further loss of external assets will necessarily lead to an internal credit restriction.  As long as the basis of our monetary system remains what it is, the capacity to expand internal credit depends on the possession of liquid external assets. Whether that is the best of all currency systems which could be devised in this country is a matter of opinion and a matter of another day's debate; but, taking things as they are and taking the currency, banking and financial structures as they are and as they have to be worked at the present time, a further loss of external assets would lead to a restriction of internal credit which would result in unemployment and, probably, further emigration.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes argued that a deficit on current account caused by the importation of capital goods would justify further depletion of the external assets.  That is an argument with which I do not agree.  In the first place, if that principle were accepted, the door would be open to some very dangerous evasions.  It is extraordinarily difficult to draw the line in the import list between capital and consumption goods.  The same physical goods may be <Col N="1145" /> capital goods, if they are used for certain purposes and consumption goods if they are used for other purposes. If raw materials are to be used for the building up of exports, they are entitled to be regarded, I suppose, as capital goods.  If on the other hand, they are to be used for domestic consumption, then they are consumer goods.</P>
    <P>The same is true of stocks.  The same physical commodity may either be coming in to be immediately consumed or may be coming in to rebuild dealers' stocks.  By any definition of investment, accumulation of stocks more rapidly than stocks are being consumed is equal to adding to the liquid capital of the country and, therefore, the same goods that sometimes might be regarded as consumption goods at other times might be regarded as capital goods.  Therefore, my first objection to this argument is the extreme difficulty in distinguishing between capital and consumption goods in the import list.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if private investors in the country, that is to say, the people who build up capital, want foreign capital goods, they can liquidate part of their sterling investments in order to pay for them; or, if they do not possess sterling investments themselves, they can induce other people to liquidate part of their investments if they issue a prospectus or otherwise hold out the hope to investors that such an exchange of foreign investments for internal investment would be a profitable proposition.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if the Government or other public authorities wish to expend money on a capital programme, they, of course, have to issue loans.  If those loans are on attractive terms, if the purpose of the loans and the terms on which they are issued are such as to appeal to private investors, such persons can decumulate part of their external investments in order to subscribe to the loans.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to suggest is that, if there is an importation of capital goods which will be used for investment in Ireland, which is financed by the sale by private investors of external securities or by their subscribing <Col N="1146" /> to Government loans to which they subscribe partly by the liquidation of external securities, such an importation of capital may cause disequilibrium for the time being in the balance of payments.  Imports will tend to exceed exports while the capital goods are being imported.  But such a deficit will not cause any drain on the liquid assets in the banking system because those assets will now be replenished and reinforced by the sale of the external securities.</P>
    <P>The same is equally true of investment by foreigners.  If foreign investors decide to invest capital in Ireland, the requisite currency for the purchase of capital imports will be provided by the foreign investors in foreign currencies, without making any raid on the liquid assets of the Irish banking system.</P>
    <P>If that analysis of the situation is correct, it seems to me that there should be no difficulty in the way of obtaining external capital in this country, without any pressure on the liquid assets in the banks.  If attractive investment opportunities present themselves, there is a sufficient amount of external capital in the country, outside the banking system, to enable people to raise large amounts of sterling and other foreign currencies to purchase all the capital goods they require.  A swap of that kind&mdash;because that is really what it comes to&mdash;will not take place unless the people with the external capital assets come to the conclusion that the return on the new investment of capital in Ireland will be greater than what they lose by the decumulation of their existing capital assets.  In other words, they will be motivated by the perfectly correct business desire of increasing the return on their investments.</P>
    <P>If external capital assets can be used to purchase capital goods which, when invested in Ireland, would give a higher return than the return on those capital assets from abroad, then everybody has benefited and nobody has lost.  All that would have happened would be that the owners of the capital would have decided to exchange their investment from one direction to another and, as I said, working under the impetus of <Col N="1147" /> private self-interest, they presumably would be exchanging them, or at least trying to exchange them, from a less profitable to a more profitable form.</P>
    <P>That is what, I think, is meant by saying, as is so frequently said, that there is no shortage of capital in Ireland to purchase capital from abroad.  In the sense that I have tried to explain it, I believe it is true.  However, to say that there is no shortage of liquid assets in the banking system to purchase either capital or consumer goods is not true.  There is not sufficient abundance of liquid assets in the banking system to do more than just pay for what is paid for by the exports of the country.  The only part of the external assets of the last two or three years that could be legitimately invested abroad by the purchase of capital goods would be, in my opinion. the small surplus of last year.  That small surplus could be used for that purpose, but it is not very likely to be repeated this year and, therefore, in its absence, the correct way to pay for caital goods is by the sale by private people of existing external securities.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Appropriation Bill, because I am trying to be relevant to this debate, if the Government&mdash; after all, we are discussing the policy of the Government&mdash;wishes to increase investment in this country by the importation of capital goods from abroad, the best way the Government can do it is to create a favourable atmosphere for investment.  The Government has the power within very wide limits to alter the business atmosphere of the country.  This matter was fully discussed a few weeks ago in this House on the Bill for the encouragement of external investment and I do not intend to go over that field again.  The only thing I want to repeat is that it was generally agreed, nobody dissenting, that the atmosphere for investment in Ireland will depend to a very large extent on the level of taxation and on the incentives in the taxation system, many of which in recent times have been specially designed, successfully I hope, to encourage investment for the production of exports by Irish and foreign investors.</P>
    <P>If capital came in in that way, if <Col N="1148" /> Irish holders of external assets were to liquidate them in order to import capital goods, that would be a true repatriation of Irish capital in the strict sense of the word.  The savings which have been sent abroad in previous years would now come home.  It would be exactly the same as if emigrants who went abroad to earn their living decided that the opportunities of earning a living here were better and came back to the country voluntarily.  It would be an entirely healthy sign.  If, in addition to that, foreign people were investing in Ireland, stimulated by the business prospects which, as I said, can be very largely affected by Government policy, the situation would be even better.  In addition to the emigrants returning we would have a number of immigrants as well.  In either case there would be no pressure on the liquid assets in the banking system and, therefore, no need for anything like a restriction of credit.</P>
    <P>These are some of what I have described as the simple principles, which seem to me to be correct.  These are the kind of principles that economists and bankers believe and feel they should preach.  It is the duty of the Minister to translate these principles into practice.  All that can be done by Senators, by members of the Dáil, by bankers or economists is to try to enunciate what we hope are sound doctrines, but it is for the Minister to put them into practice.  I know that he has a great many difficulties to overcome, that he is being pressed on all sides for further expenditure, but, as I said here last year, the Minister is in a very strong position.  He has a majority and he has security of tenure as far as we can see.  Therefore, it is his duty to put principles before popularity in the finances of the State.  These principles have been consistently proclaimed for many years by the Banking Commission, by the Central Bank, by the chairmen of the commercial banks and by the majority of the students of economics in the country.  The Irish patient has not lacked the advice of many physicians.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see that new foreign consultants from O.E.E.C., the International Monetary Fund and the International Finance Corporation, are <Col N="1149" /> being called in to deal with the patient. I should be very much surprised if the advice of these external consultants differs from that of the old family doctor who has been attending to the patient for so many years.  We all know from our own private experience that very often the consultant who is called in may know a great deal about some narrow subject, but that, when it comes to dealing with the patient, he does not know as much about the background, habits, circumstances or constitution of the patient as the family doctor does.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister for Finance not to be bemused by new-fangled drugs, panaceas and nostrums prescribed for the patient by these external advisers.  The old family doctor very often knows as much about medicine as the consultant and he knows more about the patient. Finally, what is not to be overlooked, his fee is a good deal lower and for that reason, he is not to be despised.</P>

      <P>On all these problems about economics, you can divide men into two camps, the men who want to do something and the men who do not.  I am in the camp of people who want to do something.  Let us have no doubt about that.  If Senator O'Brien, my senior colleague in the college, appears to me to be in the camp of men who do not want to do anything, I suppose that is a matter of opinion.  When he tells us that the liquid assets had sunk to a dangerously low level, when they were equal to one year's gross imports, we may ask how does the sterling area survive when the total liquid assets of the sterling area are equal to about ten or 11 weeks' imports of Britain alone? How does Britain survive in those circumstances?  How does it carry on 50 per cent. of the trade of the world in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice my colleague did not use a single figure during all his statements on general principles.  That is fair enough.  Sometimes an excessive use of figures is very bad and I do not disagree with him on that, but when you are discussing monetary matters, it is essential to consider the figures. Senator O'Brien may say to me: &ldquo;Well, <Col N="1150" /> look at the dangerous position the sterling area is in.&rdquo;  Senator O'Brien's statement was unreal when he said that we must rule out anything like a raid on private investments abroad.  Who has ever suggested it?  He has stated that you must rule out something that nobody has ever suggested.  I have never seen a suggestion that private investment abroad should be raided by anybody.  Never anywhere in the proposals of the wildest currency crank was this suggested.  Accordingly, as Deputy Costello said in the Dáil the other day, it is like driving nails into a fog when you deal with these proposals.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask a question about a development I have noticed over the last three or four years.  Why is it that in this period of three or four years back we see such a tremendous accretion of new volumes, quarterly volumes, reports from the Central Bank and commercial banks?  They are all designed for one purpose&mdash;to defend the existing system and to support the idea of our liquid assets being kept in British Government securities.  That is what I am speaking of and nothing else&mdash;the system of investing our liquid assets in decaying securities.  I did not hear one word to-day from my colleague, Senator O'Brien, about the immense real loss this country has incurred over the last 20 years&mdash;certainly since 1938&mdash;through the fact that our liquid assets are invested in these decaying British securities.  I have never been contradicted by anybody when I make the statement that these securities are decaying continuously&mdash;never once.</P>
    <P>The British over-taxed this country in the last century to the tune, it was calculated by a British Royal Commission, of £2,500,000 a year.  The native politicians calculated that 100 years at £2,500,000 would be £250,000,000, but the statisticians and financiers said it would be the equivalent of the interest, whatever the £2,500,000 represented in terms of interest over the period.  In other words, you should capitalise the £2,500,000 and multiply that by ten or whatever number of years it may be.  Anybody can make up that and decide for himself whether it is £250,000,000 or not.  I am prepared <Col N="1151" /> to allow anybody to decide that for himself.</P>
    <P>In the present century, we had a major political feature, in the late 20s and 30s&mdash;the land annuities&mdash;which were £3,000,000 a year.  It became a major political question whether or not they should be paid to Britain for the remainder of their life-period &mdash;30 or 40 years.  They are not being paid to Britain, but instead we are paying Britain every year the devaluation, which is 4 to 5 per cent., on this investment in British Government securities, on £200,000,000, or whatever is the excess over a reasonable amount wanted for trade.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, to a certain extent but not too arbitrarily, threw some cold water on what I said on the last occasion about how much a reasonable amount would be for trade.  But I shall come back to that again and refer to what he said was my reference to a speech in the Dáil on a previous day.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I did my colleague an injustice, owing to the strong views I hold on this subject, because he did say that we might use the small surplus accumulated on our balance of payments last year.  That &ldquo;small surplus&rdquo;, as Deputy Costello pointed out in the Dáil, means that commercial banks and the Central Bank have accumulated £28,000,000 in London over the past 28 months.  Somebody might take that up statistically and say that it did not start 28 months ago but only 23 months ago.  I make them a present of that point.  Much of that surplus was accumulated at a time when most other countries were pulling out of London.  It may be that the British will be kind to us as a result of this and say that we are among their supporters or they may feel, as I do, that it is useless to expect a mouse to hold up an elephant.  The British may feel they are the elephant and they may not even notice the mouse.</P>

I notice among the most conservative people&mdash;except in this matter I might number myself amongst them <Col N="1152" />&mdash;the continuous reference to the idea that if we use up more of these liquid assets to develop our own country, it will result in further unemployment and further emigration.  I may be asked what is my proposal and I shall come to it later and develop it at some length.  I have heard it suggested many times that if we used up these external assets, we would have mass unemployment.  But what have we had twice in the present decade but mass unemployment?  What does one want in relation to mass unemployment? We have had over 11 per cent. of our insured workers unemployed twice in the last decade, once last year and again in 1953.  If one takes the year as a whole, the figures were higher in 1953 than last year, despite the fact that everything was supposed to be right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I feel it is necessary to retort to them on some occasions.  I think we must be honest with ourselves.  I cannot help feeling the fact that what the Banking Commission reported in 1938, when sterling was the strongest currency in the world, and British Government securities the strongest in the world, has no more to do with the problem that faces the country to-day than <Col N="1153" /> whether a man could get some kind of wheelless cart to take his family home from Mass on a Sunday.  I am sure there was a time when a man did take his family home from Mass in a wheelless cart and that the man who first used a cart with wheels was regarded as an extraordinary figure in the neigh-bourhood. That is how I feel about it.</P>
      <P>There is one further statement I wish to make on this subject.  We have had all this talk about reducing our external assets.  The Minister for Lands has said that we have reduced our sterling assets by £200,000,000 in the past ten years, but if that is so, how is it our income is no less?  Could anybody answer that?  The income from the country's foreign assets appears to be still as big as&mdash;if not bigger than&mdash;in 1947.</P>

      <P>Figures produced by the Central Statistics Office show a decline in our gross external assets of £225,000,000.  If there was a decline of £225,000,000, why has not our income from investments abroad gone down by an amount equivalent to the income from £225,000,000?  Nothing of the kind has happened and for the very good reason that these assets have not been spent.  I got the capital values from the Central Statistics Office with great difficulty a couple of years ago. I had to prise the information out and the Department of Finance tried to prevent me getting it.  These capital values were calculated for me by the then Director of the Central Stastistics Office and the Department of Finance complained because I had got them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did I find?  I gave the figures in the debate in the Dáil that year on the Vote on Account.  There was no <Col N="1154" /> decline at all in our external investments; they were of the same value. Of course, it was different money and there was a plus.  There was an amount we borrowed on the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  There was that as a plus and there was also an increase in the value of investments in industrial securities in Britain to offset th investment in British Government securities.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak on another matter in connection with the provisions in this Bill.  I spoke previously here about the necessity to spend more money on university education.  I could argue it would be essential that in many parts of the country we should spend more money on what is called in Britain, grammar education, on what is called in America, high-school education, and what we call secondary education, but, to my mind, our primary requisite is in the institution to which I am attached, University College, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant to the Faculty of Agriculture in Dublin is the same as it was prewar, except for the increases to meet the cost of living bonuses given to the staff, due to the rise in prices.  That grant was fixed in 1926, 30 years ago, when there were about 30 students in the Faculty of Agriculture and 30 other students were attending a one-year course, which was not worth much then, and which has gone since.  There are now 400 students and the grant is still the same, that is, the Government grant.  Last year, it was necessary to build new laboratories in the college and they were built out of the depleted resources of University College, Dublin, and cost somewhere in the region of £15,000 to £20,000.  At the same time, the Department of Agriculture was spending £250,000 on Johnstown Castle, <Col N="1155" /> fixing up dry rot and half a dozen other things.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Estimates for the year 1957-58 there was an allocation of £30,000 for private agricultural schools, and this year there is an allocation of £60,000 for private agricultural schools. Why the remarkable difference?  Why is no more money allocated by any Minister for Agriculture, no matter what Government he belongs to, to University College, Dublin, where the only Faculty of Agriculture in the country is?  A more important question is that of the grants to the university as a whole.  The President of University College, speaking at the last graduation ceremony a couple of weeks ago, pointed out that Queen's University, Belfast, with 3,000 students, had an allocation of £1,000,000 a year, and that the grants to all the Irish universities given here in the Republic are £670,000 a year, while there are 8,000 students in the combined universities and colleges of this country.  Those 8,000 students have allocated to them two-thirds of the amount of money, in parity of value with sterling, which is allocated to 3,000 students in Queen's University, Belfast.</P>
    <P>Of these 8,000 students, half attend University College, Dublin, and, not alone that, but the more expensive faculties are in University College, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, the Faculty of Architecture, the Faculty of Agriculture and so on&mdash;all the more expensive faculties.  It is easy enough to run a liberal Arts College.  They exist by the hundred, almost, in the United States and they do excellent work, and I am not decrying their work.  I am just saying that they can carry on more easily. The grants were readjusted two or three years ago on a purely mechanical basis, a 20 per cent. increase to each institution, and no increase was made to University College, Dublin, though it had 1,000 more students than when the grants were previously allocated in 1950.</P>
    <P>Let me put it in blunt terms.  Do we want to starve the Catholics of Dublin of university education?  That <Col N="1156" /> is what we are doing.  This fight has gone on for more than a century.  First and foremost, do we believe in university education, or do we want to starve the Catholics of Dublin of proper university facilities?  I hope, and I believe, that the Government will look after that, but I think it is right and proper that it should be stated in the bluntest terms.</P>
    <P>I come now to the point Senator Lenihan was asking me about.  I believe that one of the fundamental needs in this country, to keep the rural part of our economy going and to push it ahead, is a proper system of agricultural credit.  Let me start with the report of the Agricultural Credit Corporation &ldquo;to be presented to the shareholders at the 31st annual meeting at 11 Kildare Street, on Wednesday, 30th July, 1958, at 3 p.m.&rdquo; What does that show?  It shows that if you add together the loans guaran teed by the Minister for Agriculture and other loans last year, you get a total of approximately £2,400,000 made available to the farmers and outstanding at 30th April, 1958.  What do you find for the previous year?  You find nearly £2,600,000.  There was a drop of something of the order of £200,00 in the last year.</P>
    <P>During the Central Fund debate in this House, the Minister, although I had not raised the matter at all, came back to the House and decried the steps taken by the previous Government, just before they went out of office, to attempt to put a proper system of agricultural credit in operation. I notice that the Minister's mind is on this subject a great deal and I will await with great interest his proposals on this matter.  He has referred to it on a number of occasions.  At column 320 of the Seanad Debate on 27th March, 1958, the Minister outlined the scheme under which a person might get a short term loan, if his valuation did not exceed £50&mdash;that covers the great bulk of our farmers&mdash;a loan equal to ten times his valuation, subject to a limit of £250, and providing the farmer is prepared to consult the agricultural instructor.</P>
    <P>I think it was a well rounded-off <Col N="1157" /> scheme.  What happened when it got into the State Departments? What did they do with it?  The scheme was launched.  The number of applicants in the first month or so&mdash;nobody would apply after the first month in view of what happened&mdash;was 707 and the number not qualified was 516.  At that time the Minister said he did not know anything about it&mdash;he learned it only that morning.  He learned it only that morning when provided with these figures: loans sanctioned, £17,560; number of loans refused, 43.  In other words, 120 applicants were sanctioned out of 707.  Why were they not qualified? For the simple reason that the Department of Finance put in the stipulation that any man who ever got a six-day notice for his annuities was not a qualified person.  Is that kind of thing honest?  I do not think it is, and I am not afraid to say it here or anywhere else.  To be quite frank, I could not say what I really think about it in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Let me just add this much.  I notice that the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has been changed. I must say I regret very much one remark made by the Minister during a discussion elsewhere about it.  I thought it was a shameful remark to make, but let us pass that.  If the Minister's new chairman does this job well by this time next year, I certainly will clap him on the back.  I do not mind if he is a first cousin of the Minister's the Minister's brother or the Minister's son, if he does the job well, he will do good work for this country.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the question of my analysis on the second last day in this House of the figure of national income.  I took the figure of national income commonly accepted as such in ordinary discourse.  That was the first figure in the table that Senator Lenihan subsequently took out of the volume of the <i>Statistical Survey.</i>  I deflated it by 6 per cent.  Strictly speaking, if I were being accurate, I could have deflated it by more because the value of money declined in the early part of last year.</P>

      <P>I did not ask for the interruption.  If I got it, I am entitled to answer it.  I take it it is answered? I did refer to the cost of living, not at great length.  A few other people also referred to it, not at great length.  The cost-of-living index went up by 11 points in three years while the previous Government were in office.  It went up by 11 points in one year when the new Government came into office.  That ought to be enough to say about that, except that I have an important point I should make.  When replying to the debate the last day, the Minister suggested I had not been accurate about a matter to which I referred.  Before I go on to it, it would be better if I dealt first with the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate in the Dáil.  In the Dáil on 17th July, Mr. de Valera said in relation to the volume of the <i>Statistical Survey</i> to which we all referred the last day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This volume indicates that the year 1957... was, as I have more than once described it, a year of economic recovery in many respects.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, the same as the <i>Quarterly Review</i> of the Irish banks and the same as all the speakers, he gets bogged down:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The real national income increased; agricultural output increased.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He can produce no other statistic.  I produced a flood of real things the last day I spoke here&mdash;the huge increase in emigration, the fantastic increase in the number of people unemployed, the decline in the number of people employed, a decline of 100,000 since Deputy MacEntee came into office.</P>

      <P>Senators asked for it.  I shall read it out for them.  The reference is column 850 of the Official Report.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;When you have not got any accurate figures, anybody can stand up and say that the rate is 10,000 more than it was before, or 10,000 less than it was before.&rdquo;  Not at all.  I did not say that.  It was 20,000 more than it was before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and hear from the Taoiseach's own words.  I am quoting from the same column of the Official Report, Volume 170, No. 6, of the 17th July of this year.  He said: &ldquo;We have no means of knowing definitely what emigration is at present.&rdquo;  Note the word &ldquo;definitely&rdquo;. <Col N="1161" /> In other words, to the last digit&mdash;you know that kind of game&mdash;to the last digit of accuracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going through it accurately.  It is no harm that I should edit it a little, as I go along. The Taoiseach continued: &ldquo;The passenger balance figures, while unreliable on previous occasions, seemed to be fairly accurate for the period 1951-56,...&rdquo;  That is the most recent period when they were verified by the census: they were accurate. &ldquo;... but one does not know how far there is a correspondence since 1956 between the passenger movements and emigration.  There was certainly no such correspondence some years ago.&rdquo; Of course, there was not.  There was no correspondence when people had to have identity documents, and so on, and when people who wanted to move backwards and forwards did not carry them for reasons best known to themselves.  &ldquo;However the indications, in so far as we can get them, indicate that emigration is still running at a very high figure,...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator just said that the Taoiseach said 20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said 20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that emigration is still running at a very high figure, meaning that it has increased to an enormous extent; that is the plain meaning of the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach dealt with the position which obtained in 1956 and he had this to say about external assets, as reported at column 850 of the Official Report: &ldquo;We all admit that that was a situation which had to be dealt with, but the question was whether the methods used were actually the best.&rdquo;  When the levies were being imposed, I do not remember that anybody on the Opposition side of the House at that time came <Col N="1162" /> up with any proposition.  I do remember noticing that one important Deputy was not in the House.  I took it that he had been silenced by his Party.  I took it at the time that that was why he did not come into the House at all but merely came in for the Division. However, I suppose that made up for the House.  I suppose that made up for it.  Later, in his speech, as reported at column 851 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Our aim, of course, is not to build up foreign assets.... Even with the greatest care in trying to forecast, nobody can be absolutely certain about those things, but, if anything should appear to be going awry, we would have to take immediate action.&rdquo;  It sounds like the oracle at Delphi.</P>
    <P>In fact, and there can be no denial, the present Government&mdash;no matter what their proposition may be or no matter what they may pretend whether to themselves or to anybody else; no matter what appearance they may put on things&mdash;are systematically building up these liquid external assets.  Here is a typical example of the kind of thing we get.  It may have been a slip; it is possible.  However, at column 1043 of the Official Report of Thursday, 17th July, 1958, the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, read out, as the index of import prices from 1952 onwards, the index of export prices&mdash; the case being that import prices had gone up substantially and export prices had gone down.  He said: &ldquo;The index figure of import prices ....&rdquo;  In fact, it was the index of export prices which he read out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be a printer's error in that particular way. On the 26th March last, I raised the matter of the cost of living in this House.  The Minister for Finance interrupted me to say that I was wrong and was doing him an injustice.  As reported at column 195 of the Official Report of Seanad Eireann, I said: &ldquo;I noticed the Minister made one other slip in his figures.  He spoke about the cost of living having gone up 11 points under the inter-Party Government and <Col N="1163" /> that now it has gone up seven points. Actually, it has gone up nine points.&rdquo; The Minister denied that most vociferously. I did not dash out of this House to check up on his statement but it did by chance happen that I came across the truth.  On the 20th March in the Dáil, as reported at column 685 of the Official Report, in reply to a question by Deputy Donnellan on the subject of the cost of living when he asked: &ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; the Minister for Finance replied: &ldquo;It is 142 now, up seven points.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I withdrew on the 26th March and I apologised to the Minister although I had grave doubts about the accuracy of what he told me.  On a matter of accuracy, I do not like to be put in that position and I shall not ever again withdraw anything the Minister suggests I should.</P>

      <P>The index for February was published in the newspapers on the 15th March&mdash;and we were discussing this on the 26th March.  What is one to take from the Minister's statement to me that he asked about it?  He said: &ldquo;It came out the next day.  I asked for it and they said it would come out &lsquo;to-morrow&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;and it was out on the 15th March.  I have the papers here.  I shall pass them to the Minister if he wants to look at them.  The Minister may have been mistaken, but he shoved it down my throat on that occasion and I apologised to him.

      <P>I was considerably embarrassed about it because I had thought it was out before the Minister spoke.  I have given all the references. The Minister convinced me that he was right.  I do not know whom he asked what, when.  However, it is in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 15th March.  &ldquo;There was an increase of 2.07 points in the Consumer Price Index between mid-November last and mid-February this year, the Central Statistics Office stated yesterday&rdquo;&mdash;bringing it up to nine points.  That refers to the 15th February and we were debating this matter on the 26th March.  I did not dash off the next day, but I came across the matter and I was perturbed. My memory is not so good that I could be certain that I was right but, at the time, I was surprised I was wrong.  I do not think the Minister should have interrupted me and pushed the matter down my throat.  He said, as reported at column 197 of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann of the 26th March last, when referring to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;On to-day's figure, he was right... I used the latest figure we had.&rdquo;  What is the use of that?  If we are to have that kind of discussion in this House then anybody can have the House as far as I am concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow the last speaker along all the roads he has travelled because in my view such a course would not be very helpful to this debate.  The Senator again referred to such things as the cost of living, unemployment and emigration although, to be candid, I thought that such things should not arise on a debate of this kind because we are concerned here to-day to ascertain the best way in which the finances of the Exchequer can be expended and to make any suggestions we think proper as to how the existing position could be improved.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the tendency on the part of certain politicians, and certain people outside at the present time, is to belittle what has been done over the years in this country, to throw cold water on the efforts made to advance the country's cause in every direction. I think that is a very damaging attitude for people to take up.  They sometimes draw comparisons between what has been done here and what is being done elsewhere but it has often been said that distant cows wear long horns and distant fields are green.  If we look more closely at our own fields, we shall find that they are fairly green too.  I was surprised to hear Senator O'Donovan say that there was no increase in the value of agricultural output.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from £133,000,000 to í147,000,000 that is, an increase of £14,000,000.  That is not bad for one year.  Let us hope that there will be a similar increase in the coming year and, if there is, we shall all be quite satisfied.  As I said last week in another debate, it is gratifying to know that the trend in these things is upward, in the right direction and not in the wrong direction.  An increase of £14,000,000 is not a bad achievement but, of course, I am not a person to over-emphasise that figure.  That is not my policy.  I think it only right that we should give most of the credit <Col N="1167" /> to the farmers of this country for having brought about that position.</P>

      <P>They are up against difficulties now I know, but these are difficulties over which none of us has any control.  Indeed, if we might occasionally make a mess of it, there are others who might have even made a worse mess of it.  As I said before, there is too much pessimism in this country.  We have a tendency to belittle the efforts that are being made. We are inclined to be too critical of our own country.  That is one of the weaknesses which emerge at the present time.</P>
      <P>After all, it is not an unhealthy sign of the country to be able to produce surpluses in the economy of this country.  We have a surplus of milk and butter and now we have a surplus of wheat which is presenting us with something of a problem.  Those people who say that agriculture has made no advance in recent years should realise that we have actually arrived at the position now when we are up against surpluses, when we have these commodities surplus to our own requirements and that our difficulty now is to provide a market for these surpluses. That is the chief difficulty.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to our external assets.  We have heard references to these over and over again and nobody seems to be in a position to give us the actual figure for these external assets.  If the Senator were to develop his argument to its logical conclusion, we should not have any external assets at all.  I hope I am not misquoting the Senator now when I say that.  I would ask any sensible person who understands these things whether it is better to have external assets with which we can purchase capital goods from abroad or to be without them.  I think it is better to have them.  The Senator also referred to what he called investments in British securities.</P>

If they do not invest at home, are we to bring compulsion to bear on them? I should like to get the Senator's view on that some other time when he is speaking in this House.  As I said, we have no cause to complain in this country, so far as I can see.  There is an increase in our agricultural produce. There is an increase in the output from our factories over the year. Our national resources are being developed; perhaps with the passage of time they will be developed more, but there again the question of capital comes in and there cannot be more development of our national resources than what the amount of capital we can get for that purpose will allow. Our health and social services are as good as they are in most countries.  Our housing policy is ahead of that of most countries.  There is plenty of food in the country for our people and the standard of living is as high as it is in most countries.  Therefore, we have not got a lot to complain about.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donovan also referred to the question of university education and he finds fault with the Government for not making more money available to increase the accommodation for an increasing number of university students.  That is not an easy matter, either.  It is a question of capital.  If I were to give my view on this question of university education, I should be inclined to say that there are too many people being admitted for university education at present because the difficulty afterwards is for those people to get jobs in their own country.  If they do not get jobs in their own country, they will have to emigrate and then the Senator, and other Senators, will be complaining about the increase in emigration.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation with which he found fault for not making more money available and for having turned down application.  Surely to goodness, they are in duty bound to examine these applications as they come in.  The money they deal with is not their own money; it is the people's money and they have to be careful to examine the <i>bona fides</i> of the applicants as they come along.  Therefore, I do not see what fault can be found with that, but sometimes we are very apt to advocate the expenditure of other people's money.</P>

      <P>As I said, I do not propose to follow the Senator along all the roads he travelled in this debate.  Senator Baxter referred to the present number of cows and said that it was very desirable to increase the number of cattle.  With that I am <Col N="1170" /> in entire agreement, but at the same time I would put in the proviso that the cattle should be of the proper kind.  What we want is a better type cow.  I, for one, would prefer to have three good cows to four bad ones and I am afraid that at present we have a good many uneconomic cows in the country and it should be the policy to eliminate them as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that on this Bill we may speak on Government policy.  As an ordinary individual, looking back over the period since the Government took office, I think that the poor people, the working class people, were never as badly off as they are now.  Senator Ó Ciosáin can talk about butter production.  We are subsidising butter when our own people in the City of Dublin and in the country cannot afford to buy it because of the Budget.  They are buying margarine instead.  Can any Senator deny that? Let us face the matter as we should. I know that Senators on the Government side will get up and try to defend the policy of the Minister and the Government, no matter what it is, but they know well enough that they are not doing the right thing as far as the majority of the poor people are concerned.</P>
      <P>We talk about bringing in foreigners and foreign capital, but I know that since this Government came into office, some of our own industries have closed down.  One of those industries was allied to agriculture, the flour mills in County Wicklow, and its employees have gone to Britain.  In my own town of Enniscorthy, a foundry has a skeleton staff working for want of capital and the owners cannot get capital, if they go to the banks or to the Government.  People are talking about giving facilities to firms to go to the West of Ireland.  There is no increase in employment, but there is an increase in unemployment, no matter what the figures say.  The figures have gone down in the labour exchanges. Why?  Because the men have emigrated. There is no one working on the land to-day.  There are fewer employed there, naturally, because the use of machinery has put the men off the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> Industrial development is at a standstill. I know from my experience, living in a community of poor people, that out of 24 houses there are not 12 wage earners working.  They are unemployed and trying to exist on unemployment assistance.  The Minister comes from that constituency also and knows the position in his own area. We should face up to the facts.  The Government have done nothing&mdash;they may say what they like&mdash;but set up new boards.  Everything to-day is a board and they have money to pay the boards.  I understand the majority of boards are very well paid.  They can find the money for that.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to do something for the people.  They promised the people that and that is why they got a majority.  We gave certain promises to the people when we joined in 1948, in the inter-Party Government, to which I was proud to belong and which brought peace to the country at that time.  Have we that peace to-day?  No.  We have these young men back in the concentration camp, which ceased to exist in 1948. They were there up to 1948 and I suppose they would be there still if the present Taoiseach were in office at that time.  That is not a very satisfactory state of affairs for this country.  They are some of the best young men in Ireland.  Are they to remain there until this Government is put out, with not a word about those people?  That is a part of Government policy about which everybody was silent and afraid to notice.</P>

      <P>Let them attack away &mdash;I can take it and I am used to it, because I had to fight my way in politics and on public bodies, on behalf of the people I represent.  The attacks will not cow me down.  I think that public policy is a scandal.  The Government are there since 1957 and now the Dáil has finished up and gone away in 1958; yet what hope is there for the unemployed, what hope for emigrants? None.  The present Government have no policy and the sooner they tell the people that the better.  They should not hoodwink the people by telling them that there is something around the corner, that new industries are to start here when they bring over these foreigners.  They know well enough that all that is not true.  The Government have failed badly to keep the promises they made.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Wexford County Council and I know that never in the history of the county had we fewer employed.  There are crowds of men at the exchanges and those not there have gone to Britain.  That is not a good policy for the Government to boast about.  They told wives to vote for the Fianna Fáil and put their husbands back to work.  Coming down to my own county&mdash;and I challenge the Minister on this, as he comes from Wexford&mdash;I ask are there as many working there this year as there were under the inter-Party Government?  He knows what I say is true, as he is the Minister for Finance and he withdrew the money from the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That Act had kept unemployed men working during the slack period. He caused the cost of living to go up by withdrawing the food subsidies, although he told the people at the election that he would not do so.  Those are hard facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> I meet people every day of the week who ask me what the Government are going to do, whether there is any sign of work starting, and whether there is any chance of getting money from the Government.  The unemployed say that the Government are willing to give money to foreigners to go over to the Gaeltacht where the fellows talk Irish, but they are not to come south of the Border or they cannot get the money. That is more of the spoon-feeding that certain sections are getting.  All should be treated alike.  This Government say they are a Government for the Twenty-Six Counties, but they are handing out all the nice things to the fellows in the West.  I do not begrudge it to them.</P>

I do not accuse any Minister of saying this, but their canvassers told the people there would be a guaranteed price for wheat.  I see that in the other House they denied it.  Their canvassers went from farmhouse to farmhouse telling the people: &ldquo;Put out the Coalition Government, put back Fianna Fáil and get back what Deputy Dillon took off you.&rdquo;  That was said in every farmer's house in Wexford and on that they got a majority.

Would Senators believe that?  They are all saying they did not say it.  There is a Fianna Fáil Deputy saying it in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>It is about time the people outside woke up so that they will not be humbugged all the time by politicians.  I am speaking as a worker who had to go the hard way.  I can say to members of this House that they do not know what is happening outside.  The real cause of all the evils in this country is that the Government are shutting their eyes to the main issues.  That cannot go on forever.  There is no use in saying that everything in the garden is rosy when it is not or that everyone is living in the lap of luxury when there are people starving in the midst of plenty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may not like it, but the truth must be told and we are here to tell the truth of what is happening to the people I belong to, the general working-class poor people.  They are <Col N="1175" /> suffering under this Government to a very great extent.  They are unable to buy the necessaries of life because of the high prices imposed by the Minister for Finance.  Never before has the stone of flour, the loaf of bread or the pound of butter been as expensive as it is now.  How are the people to exist?  How is the old age pensioner to exist on 25/-?  How is the unemployed man or the widow or the orphan to exist on the allowances they receive?  Is there anyone here who will deny that these people are not getting the necessaries of life?  They are deprived by the Government who gave 12 coppers to compensate for the increase in the cost of living.  I do not think that has been mentioned in the debate.  That would not buy four ice-creams for four children, not to mention four pounds of butter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should earnestly endeavour to do something for the people and not just sit back because his Party has a majority and can carry on for the next four years.  For how long will the people stand it?  That is the burning question.  The nations of the world are holding summit conferences and all the rest, gaining time, waiting to get ready to strike.</P>
    <P>This country is going through a great depression.  There is grave unemployment. Local authorities have stopped building houses.  Other works have ceased.  Land reclamation schemes and other schemes that gave employment in rural Ireland have been stopped since 1957.  Let Senators who are listening to me defend the Government's policy and we will see what they will say.  They should not just sit there looking like&mdash;I do not know what to call you.  I would not like to say.</P>

If another 12 months are allowed to elapse, there will be no one left in rural Ireland but the old people.  The young men and women will have gone.  Every Saturday night in Enniscorthy, one would think an excursion was leaving the railway station.

    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Before taking up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, I should indicate that there are two amendments&mdash;amendments Nos. 4 and 9&mdash;standing in the name of Senator Donegan, which I consider out of order.  These amendments are out of order as they tend to impose a charge on State funds.  The Senator has been informed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) As soon as practicable in each cereal year, the board shall recommend to the Minister a national percentage of native wheat to be included in the flour-millers grist.</P>
      <P>(ii) In arriving at this figure the board is empowered to incur all reasonable expenses.</P>
      <P>(iii) The Minister shall have regard to this recommendation.</P>
      <P>The present percentage of wheat included in the grist is, of course, not a permanent figure.  Nobody would be naive enough to say that in our climate we will not have our difficulties, and that perhaps there may not be a reduction from this figure.  However, the hope of everybody will be that there will be an increase on the present percentage of native wheat included in the grist.  When speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill, I said that not enough effort was being made to use more Irish wheat in the grist, that the Department of Agriculture was not conducting enough research and that it was necessary that growers' representatives and representatives of other interested bodies should have some forum in which they could air their views, reach decisions and have some machinery available whereby they could set up research to find out just how much Irish wheat can be included in the grist from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this board does not take into consideration not only the disposal of surplus wheat but the disposal of wheat for flour milling, it is completely <Col N="1178" /> valueless.  Therefore, in all seriousness, I commend this amendment to the Minister.  There are many things that can be done and should be done.  There are firms of milling consultants in Britain, and I think one or two of them have offices in this country, who as far as I know will undertake work of this kind.  It is possible by blending to include far more of the wheat in the grist than is the case if blending is not employed.</P>
    <P>I believe the consensus of opinion favours my view that every avenue is not being explored and everything is not being done that should be done. The cure-all of foreign wheat is being employed to the maximum.  A good deal of this is just taking the easy way out, but I would prefer they should take the difficult way out and that a board as autonomous as possible&mdash;and it will be noted in my further amendments that I have endeavoured to make this board as autonomous as possible, &mdash;should be set up and should be empowered, by incurring any reasonable expense, to see if we can increase the amount of native wheat in the grist. I commend this amendment to the Minister and I think he should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, this amendment has no merit whatever.  The board envisaged and the purpose of its establishment are well known.  It is being set up to implement an arrangement by which it is hoped surplus wheat over a stated amount will be marketed at the expense of the growers.  The board's task, therefore, is to collect the levy and then proceed, if there is a surplus of wheat, to market that wheat to the best advantage from every point of view.  We shall, perhaps, deal with this aspect of it later, but before the board is established at all, I think it will be conceded that on any body set up for the purpose of collecting a levy from the growers and disposing of a surplus through the use of that levy the growers should be strongly represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it seriously contended that a board such as this would be a suitable body to do what is set out in this amendment?  If it is, it does not carry <Col N="1179" /> any conviction to me.  After giving the board this power, you end up by saying: &ldquo;The Minister shall have regard to the recommendation&rdquo;.  Of course, the Minister will have regard to a reasonable recommendation made by a board without this amendment.  I have tried to state clearly the purpose of the board and its task.  Apart from that, should the board wander into other fields as a result of their deliberations and activities and decide that some contact with the Department or with me personally is required and say that it is the opinion of the board that the policy should be such and such, if it were a sensible recommendation, I would have regard to it just as much as if it were stated in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I think it was never the intention in the minds of those who conceived this scheme that this task should be given to a board such as this.  If such a task were to be given to a board, it would certainly not be composed in the manner in which I hope to compose this board.  If this amendment were accepted, it does no more than place the onus upon the Minister to &ldquo;consider&rdquo;, something that the Minister will do in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The board is established to implement arrangements for the marketing of wheat and dispose of surplus wheat and here I think the Minister becomes a trifle naïve because what better way is there of disposing of surplus wheat than in seeking to use more of it in the millers' grist at a higher price to the advantage of the farmers?  The Minister says the composition of the board would not be suitable. He implied the other night, I think&mdash;he may correct me if I am wrong &mdash;that farmers' organisations will be represented on the board and that he would consent to that.  Does the Minister not agree the board will have responsibility for disposing of surplus wheat not only by the extremely non-advantageous way of disposing of it at feeding stuff prices, but in the very advantageous way to farmers of disposing of it by the research which they will be empowered to conduct and to spend money from the grain fund to <Col N="1180" /> conduct?  These men would be empowered to dispose of some of the surplus wheat advantageously, and I submit that is their function and in the case of the growers' representatives on the board particularly, it would be a most pleasant function.  In fact the board as constituted, if the Minister constitutes it properly&mdash;I do not imply he would do anything else&mdash;would be a suitable board to carry out the functions set out in this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister made great play with the point that regard would be had to all recommendations.  I do not want to say he would not have regard to recommendations but ordinary recommendations from ordinary individuals or boards are not as strong as they would be if accompanied, in the case of this board, by evidence of research carried out at the expense, mark you, of the grain fund set up by the board. Not enough research is being done and there is not sufficient investigation and not sufficient blending of Irish wheats. I submit that the disposal of wheat in the most advantageous manner is the work of this board just as is the disposal of wheat in a non-advantageous manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a well-known expression to the effect that those who pay the piper should have a right to call the tune.  The growers will pay the piper, so far as this levy is concerned. The levy is designed to enable surplus wheat over a stated amount to be disposed of without cost to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other questions of determining the amount of native wheat to be used in the grist, or the extraction rate, are surely ones that you could not, in fairness to other sections of the public, give to a board that will be constituted. I hope, on the basis that those who pay the piper should call the tune.  That ground alone, apart from the other grounds, could be advanced to show that this would be a most unsuitable body.  I am not saying you are proposing to give it any real power or authority in this amendment, but there is no purpose in proceeding to insert an amendment like this that purports to do something that, in fact, it does not do, and, if it did do what it loosely <Col N="1181" /> suggests, it should not be given the right to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is the man who is to nominate this board and, while further amendments in my name try to see to it that better representation is given to other bodies in this matter, there is nothing wrong in the Minister so constituting the board that it would fairly approach a problem of this kind.  Those who pay the piper are quite entitled to call the tune and those who pay the wheat levy, through their representatives on the board, are entitled to see by research what other means they can use to increase the amount of wheat to be disposed of at full human-use prices.  Perhaps the recommendation might be an embarrassment to the Minister.  Ministers have been embarrassed before and lived, and I do not think the present Minister would lose any more hairs, or that any further hairs on his head would become grey, because of embarrassment.</P>
      <P>There is something in what the Minister says but there is nothing wrong in a flour miller being on the board, if the Minister so decides.  There is nothing to stop the Minister putting a flour miller on the board and, in my view, it might not be a bad thing because millers are men with wide experience, not only of flour milling, but also of the disposal of wheat.  With the advice of such a man on the board, and with the research that could be carried on, greater happiness and friendliness could be engendered in the production of wheat and its disposal in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The board's task will be the disposal of surplus wheat. Would the Minister agree that market research should be part of that task? Obviously, to dispose of surplus wheat abroad, the board has to get information on marketing and, therefore, is drawn into market research.  I would also ask would there be any further market research aimed at producing a product more suited to the home market?  If so, it would seem that the main purpose of this amendment could actually be met in the Bill itself.  The question of advice is another one, and <Col N="1182" /> I take it that if the facts are available, the growers' organisations and others will see they are brought to the notice of the Minister.  The Minister presumably is as anxious as anybody else to use as much wheat at home as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of mind that has arisen amongst a number of people who have approached this problem more or less in the same way as Senator Donegan has approached it, is that, because a board is being set up to dispose of surplus wheat, if that board were given the task of, if not determining, at least recommending on matters such as the amount of native wheat to be consumed in the production of flour, or the extraction rate and all the rest, it might be able to manipulate and recommend in such a way as to reduce the problem of the disposal of surplus wheat.  I do not think a national question of this magnitude should be given to a body of people, and there can only be eight according to this Bill, a body of people, one which, according to the old saying which I have quoted, would be composed on the basis of those who pay the piper calling the tune.</P>
      <P>That conveys that the body would be influenced.  If I were a miller, and not a Minister, and found myself on a body where I was in a minority, my knowledge of the subject of milling and my knowledge of the difficulties of the provision of a loaf from flour manufactured from Irish wheat, and all that, would have very little influence on the minds of those whose main purpose was to get out of the difficulty of the surplus wheat in the easiest way possible, and with the least expense possible to those whom they really represented, not in a technical sense but in a practical sense, on a business body.  There is not anybody who really thinks of that seriously who would say that such a board would be a suitable board to investigate, from a national point of view, this question of the problem of reaching the position where an all-Irish loaf might be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, those of the growers' representatives&mdash;and I have been listening to them and have been watching what they have been saying&mdash;have not been half as extravagant in their demands <Col N="1183" /> as members of public bodies and members of the Dáil and Seanad have been.  They seem to appreciate the difficulties however much some of them would like to find even more alleviation of the problem of surplus wheat.  At no time, was it ever suggested to me by any of these bodies that they should have the right to examine into this question of an all-Irish loaf.  It would not be fair that research work should be carried out by this body.  The expenses that will be incurred in the disposal of the surplus wheat will be provided by the growers, and under this amendment we are to ask them further to undertake research work at the growers' expense that should be carried out in a national sense.</P>
    <P>There are several arguments in addition to the ones I have used that could be used against the acceptance of anything approaching an amendment like this.  The line I am taking, that I am expected to take as far as my understanding goes of this scheme, is that there was an appreciation, even on the part of those who will be affected, that the taxpayers are not likely to continue providing heavy subsidies for the disposal of wheat grown here in excess of what we require.  As a result of that appreciation by the Government, speaking for taxpayers and growers, this scheme has come to light.  The task is one of collection and disposal.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan talked about investigating market conditions for the disposal of surpluses.  I do not know in what way we could assist.  I have told the Seanad of the amount of wheat disposed of since I became Minister. The only organisation I had to make that disposal was Grain Importers. They just proceeded to dispose of wheat on the same basis as it is disposed of in other countries.  I do not know that any sort of research will make any contribution in regard to the price for wheat.  You have to depend on ordinary trade channels.  It would be a source of great relief to a Minister and his Department to have an organisation such as this acting on behalf of the people who have contributed the money by way of levy.  I hope <Col N="1184" /> it will give greater confidence to the growers.  I am not saying they will be able to get more satisfactory prices for any wheat they may dispose of, but I hope it will convey to the growers who have paid this levy that decisions on matters of sale&mdash;when and where to sell&mdash;will be determined by a body in which they will have a substantial say.</P>
    <P>I found myself with 100,000 tons of dried wheat on my hands.  I was offered a price for a quantity of it. I knew of no other means by which we would be likely to be able to dispose of the quantity in time for next year's harvest.  However, the price was so low that I had to take the risk and say: &ldquo;No, we will take a further risk and hold on longer.&rdquo;  That is not a task I want to have.  Therefore, the introduction of a board like this will, I hope, bring greater confidence to the growers, in the sense they will feel that decisions, one way or the other, are being made by a body largely composed of men from amongst themselves who have felt the pinch of making the necessary contribution to make this scheme effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot find myself at one with the Minister.  Who in this country is undertaking large-scale research work to try to increase the amount of Irish wheat in the grist?  I know of nobody.  The Industrial Research and Standards people can give you a tea-party with Irish bread. That is as far as it went.  I was informed to-day that the Sugar Company are conducting some experiments and I know there were some experiments at the Curragh Camp, but there is not enough large-scale experimentation in relation to Irish wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure for inclusion in the grist is 300,000 tons.  You hear it at every crossroads in the country.  It is a doctrinaire figure, dating right back historically to the decision of the Cabinet in December, 1953, the first year in which there seemed there might be a surplus of Irish wheat for disposal.  I see the Minister shaking his head.  What I say is true; I know it to be true.  Last year, when at one stage, early in the harvest, it looked as if there would be large-scale rejection, the flour millers undertook to <Col N="1185" /> take up for flour milling 300,000 tons of native wheat.  That was the bargain at a stage when it was necessary to get some agreement with the flour millers.  There we are with a doctrinaire figure.  Nobody in this country is doing large-scale tests.  Yet this board will not be allowed to direct any of its energies towards using more wheat at the full price.  I think it is disgraceful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to return to my questions.  First, a question relating to a very important general principle underlying all boards for selling surplus products.  You have the immediate task the Minister mentioned: a store of surplus calling to be sold. That is one question.  Obviously, you have to sell it as soon as you can and to the best advantage.  But the more important national issue is that of a surplus that continues year after year, where we are overproducing a commodity and where we have to find markets for it.  If that is the situation and if a board is set up to deal with that situation, then obviously that board, if it is to discharge its functions, must be able to engage in marketing research.  It is nothing more than finding out: &ldquo;For next year, what is the trade need abroad likely to be?  Can we advise our people as to how best to tailor their products to that need?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to feel that any board charged with marketing any surplus product should be its own judge as to whether it is to engage in marketing research or not, and provided that board is properly representative of the producers, then the board will spend money on marketing research only in so far as it judges that that will pay a dividend to its members.  I should like to feel that there is no clause in this Bill that would prohibit this board from engaging in marketing research, if it thought that advisable, for selling the surplus of next year, the year after and the year after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that form of research is entirely different from research having to do with the use of Irish wheat in our flour?  There is nothing in this Bill which would prevent the board from doing anything, in the <Col N="1186" /> way of exploration outside or inside the country, as to the most effective way of disposing in the most profitable fashion of any surplus with which they are charged.  That is an entirely different question from an examination of the Irish loaf and the all-Irish flour. In the one case you have a board that must be weighted on the side of those who pay.  That board is naturally entitled to spend money in the way the Senator has indicated for the purpose of disposing in the most profitable way of any surplus with which it is charged.</P>
      <P>The matter of the all-Irish loaf affects us at home in a very intimate sense.  It affects not only the growers but the consumers, the millers, the State, the Exchequer.  It is seriously contended, in relation to that problem, that a board, weighted in the way I have described, is a board that should be charged with that task?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot subdivide research.  It is supposed, first and foremost, to be objective.  I do not envisage any board with the capacity to conduct research, the capacity to put money aside to carry out research.  The Minister has conceded my first point that it obviously has the capacity to conduct marketing research, to advise the growers in future years as to the best type of wheat and to have their plans laid well in advance as to where to sell that surplus abroad.</P>
      <P>I think there is confusion in relation to the second point in saying that the board is weighted.  Research is not worth tuppence if it is not objective. Any scientist who would prostitute his skill to bring in a report to back up what that board would like to have is not worthy of the name of scientist.  It should be axiomatic that we would produce products to cater for the home market to the fullest extent possible. In the case of wheat at home, if we are satisfied we can produce a wheat that will satisfy the home market then we want a home market for that wheat. An essential task in that is objective research.  I do not mind who finances it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we can use only 80 per cent., as at present, we want to know if there are other strains or special ways of <Col N="1187" /> harvesting, or some special extra wheat that could be added to that 80 per cent. to enable us to use more at home.  I cannot see any distinction between research conducted with a view to satisfying the requirements of the home market and research conducted with a view to satisfying the requirements of the market abroad.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time this matter has come up for discussion in this House.  The question of the Irish loaf has been debated here. I remember when the Minister's predecessor came into this House with a Cereals Bill.  I raised the matter myself.  I tried to ascertain if the time had come when the Minister was satisfied it would be possible to use all-Irish wheat in the make-up of the Irish loaf.</P>
      <P>At the time, I referred to the sample of wheat sent out to the Swedish experts. The Minister said we should not take any notice of that but that we should fall back on our own experts here.  He then told me that the matter had been referred to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  I took it then that the matter was to be considered by them.  It is a highly-technical matter and a matter of that technical nature would not be an appropriate one to submit to a body of this kind which is being set up under the Bill.  Therefore, I suggest it would be just as well to wait until we get the report on this matter from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to find out the exact position.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify my mind on this matter.  This might be different from the interpretation other Senators put on the position.  Whose duty is it or who is the individual or organisation that will fix for the next year and other future years the percentage of extraction&mdash;and the lesser or the greater the percentage of extraction from Irish flour, the less or the more you will have of any other foreign grist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The all-Irish loaf is being demonstrated at agricultural shows throughout the country.  I presume each individual member of the Seanad received <Col N="1188" /> a loaf, as I did, through the good graces of the National Farmers' Association.  If we can produce an all-Irish loaf, I do not know what specific extraction it will be because they do not know the extraction in the case of this all-Irish loaf at present.  Whose function is it at present to designate what percentage of extraction is to be taken for Irish wheat, and what percentage of this foreign strong wheat, as they call it, is to be added to our native wheat?  We do not know the definition of these words, but they speak of strong wheat.  It is not clear to me whose duty it is.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should be the duty of this board to do this business.  I know that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have been working on it.  Whose duty is it to do this and whose duty will it continue to be during the coming years to do it? If we could produce an all-Irish loaf, this amendment would not come in at all.  I should like the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>If we have an all-Irish loaf, this problem will not arise at all.  We are getting confused on definitions.  You can dispose of surplus wheat on hands without research and I understand money is being devoted to that at present.  Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, are working for the industrialists as well as for the all-Irish product.  It is not research, to my mind, to try to find out in what foreign market you can dispose of some 50,000 or 60,000 tons of surplus wheat, if we have that surplus in future years.  Research on marketing is different from research on the percentage extraction and the percentage from this allegedly strong wheat which we can mix with our native wheat.  I think these things require research.  The millers say one thing: others say something else.  We all have eaten the all-Irish loaf.  We do not know what the percentage extraction in that case was but we have eaten far worse bread in our time.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides for a contract with the growers.  It is a contract between the Government and the growers that we will pay a certain price for a certain quantity.  Whether or not that quantity may be in excess of what will be required, having regard to the consumption rate of flour and the percentage extract, does not arise here.  The fact is that we will have to keep that contract with the growers, and that is to pay the guaranteed price for that quantity, irrespective of whether it is too much, having regard to the factors I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>This Bill concerns itself with the disposal of what will be in excess of that and therefore many of the questions which are being raised here do not, in fact, arise.  There are ways and means, as I have said, by which the investigation of the provision of an all-Irish loaf can be carried out at State expense. Matter such as the varieties that are suitable can be determined and the steps that would need to be taken in order to give effect to any such conclusions that might be arrived at on that basis.  To my mind, however, and according to my reasoning, it has nothing whatever to do with this question which has arisen here in recent times, that is, the appearance of a surplus over and above our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could argue about this for a long time but I do not see that there is really any purpose to be served by our doing so.  In this measure, I am merely implementing a set of suggestions that were made as to the most equitable manner of disposing of a <Col N="1190" /> surplus at the expense of those who provided it.</P>

      <P>The more I hear the Minister speak about this board, the more convinced I am that this board is not necessary.  If its only duties are to dispose of the surplus grain, I am afraid it will not be overworked, especially if they take a headline from the sales which were effected by the Minister and his advisers during the past year.  It would be very easy to dispose of grain on the home market, back to the people who grew it, at the price of £18 10s. per ton. That price was received by the Minister and his advisers for the amount of wheat exported during this year. Every bit of that wheat could be absorbed on the home market at that price.  The Minister has stated that he does not think the board will succeed in getting a bigger price than they got for wheat.  If that is the case, I do not see why this further burden should be inflicted on the already overburdened grower.</P>
      <P>As regards wheat, nobody knows more about the all-Irish loaf than the second last speaker, Senator Ó Donnabháin.  Where he comes from the people were used to that.  As a matter of fact, the farmers' families were reared on the brown bread.  It was made from wheat grown on the farm and milled in the nearest miller's premises, and there were plenty of them through the country at that time. I can guarantee, and I am sure Senator Ó Donnabháin will join with me when I say it, that bread from Irish wheat was better than any bread being sold or delivered to-day.</P>

      <P>I feel that another question to the Minister may clarify the position.  The Minister has agreed that there is nothing in the Bill that prohibits this board from conducting marketing research.  Marketing research is much wider than Senator Ó Donnabháin's definition.  Not alone have you to answer the question where can you sell the product this year but you have also got to answer the question where can you sell it next year, and how can you produce that product. It is there that the real research angle comes in.  I would have great confidence in a board fully representative of the producers, if they adopted a realistic approach to that and we all know that research pays.</P>
      <P>The question I should like to put to the Minister to clarify the second point is this.  The Minister mentioned trials being conducted and said various Government Departments were interested. Now, is there anything in the Bill that would prohibit this board from making a grant, say, of £2,000, next year to some outside body, a university or any other body, to conduct such trials?  In other words, the State Departments at present are apparently the sole bodies charged with financing it.  Can the growers play their part or can the board, if it wishes, make a grant for carrying out research at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood, like Senator Quinlan, that there was nothing in this Bill to prohibit the board from carrying on market research. That, of course, is not the point.  A statutory board can do only such things as it is empowered to do and it has to be specifically empowered to do certain things.  I should like to know whether, in this Bill, there is a specific power for marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely to goodness even the Department, which is not a body <Col N="1192" /> equipped for or suited to that type of research, has engaged in that sort of mental activity of marketing research, as defined originally by Senator Quinlan, when he said there was nothing in this Bill to prevent their employing somebody to study markets abroad, to see what is French wheat costing, which has been imported to Britain; what wheat from other lands is costing; what is the most favourable time to sell and so on.  Businessmen and millers, bent on making a success of their business and making money, have to take risks in these matters.  They have to take a gamble in these matters. Sometimes, as a result of the use of their judgment and after studying all these factors, they win.  They also sometimes lose.</P>
      <P>I was trying to give the Senator an assurance in that limited sense.  The board should, of course, keep an eye upon markets and marketing conditions at the disposal of a customer and whether it was a customer who would use our surplus wheat for feeding purposes or a customer who would use it for other purposes, they would use their intelligence and seek advice on questions of that nature.  To that extent, there is nothing in this Bill that I know of to prevent them from doing so, nor would they be fully discharging their responsibilities, if they did not do that.  But to think that merely because the term &ldquo;research&rdquo; is used that should be interpreted in the broad generous way of going into all these other avenues is something to which, had I been asked for an opinion on it there would be no doubt as to what the answer would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the board not to be allowed to carry on ordinary research at home at its own expense in order to see how much extra Irish surplus wheat can be included in the grist to give a palatable loaf?  If the board is properly constituted, it would be biassed in favour of using more Irish wheat in the grist and what could be better than that such a board should set up research and report to the Minister?  What use is anybody who indulges in research who is prepared to bring in a report to the board for transmission to the Minister which is <Col N="1193" /> not true?  Suppose that winter soft white wheat and a greater amount of Irish wheat could be used in the grist and that it was suggested an all-Irish loaf should be put on the market over a period and tested against other wheat, is it contended that the board should not take the opportunity of having this bread manufactured in large quantities and put on the market to see what the result would be?  This board can send a man to Egypt to buy wheat.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will forgive me for intervening again but I feel that an important general principle is involved.  As a scientist, I believe it is impossible to spend too much on research.  This being a practical board, representative of the growers themselves, they will err on the side of spending too little rather than too much because they will look for a quick return for every pound they spend on research.  The Minister speaks about having power to explore the markets abroad.  Surely the Minister is not setting a limit to the means this board can take to sell their surplus products?  Suppose they find that we can sell in the years to come a special variety of wheat, have they then the power to come back and recommend to the growers that we could do with a certain acreage of this?  Can they make their findings known to the growers before the sowing season comes in?  That is research, to my mind.  It is channelling the growers' products into channels we can market in the future.  Otherwise, a marketing board is of no use as their duties could be discharged by a few clerks in an office.</P>

      <P>The arguments put up by Senators Donegan and Quinlan are <Col N="1194" /> rather unreal.  This is a board which is set up to do a very limited job&mdash;to dispose of a wheat surplus.  We have a Department of Agriculture serviced with a large Estimate from the Oireachtas.  The Department has plenty of research, advisory and other facilities at its disposal.  It is the job of the Department of Agriculture to examine the possibility of new brands of wheat, greater extraction rates and more Irish wheat in the grist.  That is the function of the Department of Agriculture set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is financed by way of money got from taxation and voted by the Oireachtas.  That is the function of the Department of Agriculture. This Bill is a very limited Bill with a very limited purpose, to dispose of a wheat surplus.</P>

I think the function of the Department of Agriculture is to encourage people engaged in agriculture to be so intelligent that the need for the Department of Agriculture evaporates.  We have reached a stage in agricultural education where a board is being set up.  It is being given very few powers.  I think it is being set up only as a sort of shock absorber with regard to any unpopularity that might arise in regard to the price of wheat.  I think the board should not be an emasculated body.  It will be a board composed of adults but they will not be given any function.  It should be the most important vocational body to deal with this matter.</P>

When there are investigations and research of this kind, why should we set up an Agricultural Institute if it is to serve no function in those matters?  Surely what is suggested in this amendment should be referred to the institute?  I would imagine that was the sort of work one would expect the institute to perform.</P>
      <P>Although we hear pious statements about State control and the power of Government boards taking things away from private business, we hear now about the number of boards established under Acts.  It all seems to me to be contradictory.  I have heard the people who are making that case now, arguing the opposite in regard to other matters.  I agree with Senator Lenihan that that form of investigation should be a matter for the Department of Agriculture and surely research should be a matter for the institute?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the blinds down.  There is a doctrinaire figure produced of 300,000 tons, as the amount of Irish wheat to be used for flour milling.  That is the amount which is to get the price fixed for wheat for human use.  The Minister can get a majority on the board to conduct any research he likes to try to dispose of surplus wheat, except to increase that doctrinaire figure of 300,000 tons.  It is like saying: &ldquo;Do anything you like, but hands off wheat for flour milling; <Col N="1196" /> you must not go within 40 feet of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the present time the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture&mdash; as has been told to us here to-night, though we knew it, of course&mdash;fixes the amount to be included in the grist. Why should not the growers, who will have the preponderance on this board, not have a right to make a recommendation to those two Ministers, a recommendation which can be aided and supported by research carried out at the expense of the wheat growers? Why should it be a case of: &ldquo;Hands off.  We want to dispose of surplus wheat one way and hands off every other way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This board will be the only set up of people who will have at their disposal this year 100,000 tons of Irish wheat, at a price that has not been stated.  What is wrong with that board being empowered, by this amendment, to have that Irish wheat, without any extra cost to the consumer of bread, milled into all-Irish bread to be sold in competition with bread sold in this country with the admixture?</P>

I shall give two excepts from his speech.  They are taken from Volume 46 of the Seanad Debates.  In column 360, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our native wheat harvest should be fixed at approximately 300,000 tons a year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In column 361 he said:&mdash;</P>

      <P>There have been questions about this board being able to conduct research, which Senator <Col N="1197" /> Lenihan thinks is strange.  The most successful marketing boards in the world are those in New Zealand.  I would much prefer if our organisation had advanced to the point where we could have co-operative marketing boards.  Then they would be able to conduct research, to make for better sales and provide better markets.  Any other kind of marketing board would not be worthy of the name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, finally, that I am not entitled to object to a discussion with Senators around the question of the production of an all-Irish loaf on this section, but I really think that it does not offer the kind of scope necessary for a Minister to discuss that matter.  I am not suggesting that it is disorderly to have it, but it cramps one's style.  I have personal views, apart from the fact that questions of this nature are national questions and should be so determined.  We hear of this &ldquo;doctrinaire figure&rdquo; and all the rest; but the repetition of all these statements does not make sense to me.  This is a matter which is irrespective of the personal views of the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be from time to time.  It is a question for determination by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have views of my own about this matter.  However, I can express the Government view and give the reasons for it and I believe I could make myself clear on that point and probably convey a fair share of conviction on a number of points to which some attention has been given here.  I do not think this is the right kind of atmosphere in which to suggest that a board should have research responsibility, when you fit in that discussion with the disposal of what is assumed to be a surplus, because the public mind outside will say: &ldquo;You are talking about research; you are giving this board research responsibility.&rdquo;  Notwithstanding the assurance, which I accept entirely, given by Senator Quinlan, that a scientist would not prostitute his calling at the behest of anybody, the fact is that the public mind would associate the giving of powers unnecessarily to a body like this, for research purposes of the type he has mentioned, <Col N="1198" /> at a time when it is necessary now to dispose of a surplus, as meaning just research for the purpose of using more native wheat, irrespective of whether there is a case to be made for it from a public point of view or not.  That would be the public reaction to any such step.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say I could give a reason for the Government's decision on this 300,000 tons of dried wheat. Wheat growing was regarded by us at all times mainly as national insurance. We aimed always at trying to encourage the growing of a sufficient quantity of wheat to enable us to feed our people.  It was considered that, even if that were not done to the fullest extent, the margin would be so small that there would be ways and means of producing our requirements; there would be a stock of seed wheat; people would be accustomed to wheat growing and there would be other factors, which would enable us to get into 100 per cent. production.</P>
    <P>That is another question, the wider question.  I should not mind having a discussion on that matter, but I do not like to associate that discussion with this section of the Bill or with this board which is being set up for a limited purpose.</P>
    <P>If, as I have already indicated, scientists and their profession would not be prostituted at the behest or request of a Government or of any organisation such as the Institute of Research and Standards or the Agricultural Institute when it is set up, why should a body such as this be called upon to make a mere request to scientists to make a report on a matter of that nature?  That is a national question. Just as the question of the 300,000 tons of wheat was a question for determination at ministerial level, so too would it be a question for a Government to decide that we want information on this, that we want scientists to explore this matter and to give us a report upon it.</P>
    <P>I ate an all-Irish loaf 20 years ago that was baked in the Curragh by the Army.  There were no scientists there.  There was none of the talk about the production of an all-Irish loaf and there was not half the enthusiasm that is displayed now about <Col N="1199" /> all these matters.  This is a question that I did not mean to go into and will not go into.  I had intended to debate the amendment on the net question of the responsibility that we visualised the board should have.  Approaching the discussion on that basis, I felt I would not be entitled to cover all that wider field, nor do I think it is necessary, nor do I think it is at all advisable that the board, in any circumstances, should have the right to request scientists to do this.</P>
    <P>I felt that while I am here with my colleagues in Government, it is our job from time to time to seek the assistance of scientists on questions of that nature and, having regard to a number of other very interesting sidelights on that question, to determine what the national policy should be.  I took that line and am taking that line&mdash;not on my own; it is a line that represents the view of my colleagues and therefore Government line.  It is in that frame of mind and with these convictions that I am entirely opposing this amendment but I want to be reasonable. I want to argue the thing and try to induce those who put down amendments to believe that it would not be wise to accept them.  If I cannot do that, I can only do the other thing, that is, leave it to the Seanad to decide.</P>

I am not concerned whether the research is to provide more grain for the home market or whether it is to enable us to fill some rather lucrative market that is available, say, in Africa for wheat, but, suppose some members of the board report back from Africa that in a place there there is a market for wheat, provided it is of a certain variety and our question here is: can we produce that variety and can we produce it economically, it would be very wrong that the board should be prohibited from calling in a scientist or group of scientists, giving them the necessary money and asking them to conduct research to find out <Col N="1200" /> whether we can produce that wheat here or not.</P>

      <P>I am not to be taken as supporting the amendment as it is.  I am discussing the general principle in it and I feel that, provided the functions of the board were interpreted to give it power to spend money on research, the amendment would be unnecessary and that, whatever pressure it seeks to bring on the Minister, if the scientific facts were available, I presume the Minister would act without the pressure and, in any case, the growers would have the facts and that is all they need.</P>

Why could you not give it over to a board of eight persons?

    <P>In relation to the last few sentences <Col N="1201" /> of Senator Quinlan's statement, the important point about this statutory board is that they can do only the things set out in their charter and the charter is the Act under which they are constituted.  They can do no more. Therefore, you cannot read anything into this Bill that is not in it already and there is no way of doing it.  Therefore, there is no possibility of this board carrying out any kind of research and it will be put to the pin of its collar even to make inquiries as to whether there are markets anywhere, because Section 5, which deals with that, limits its functions very much.</P>
    <P>The Minister started off by saying that the discussion cramped his style in some way.  I do not think it cramped his style a bit.  He ended up by saying that he did not want to be unreasonable and he said the outside people he had met were not half as extravagant in their demands as the Dáil and Seanad.

If the board goes to the Minister and suggests to him that they would like to do a certain thing, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under Section 7 (1) (a) assign to the board such additional functions as he thinks fit in relation to cereals.  Paragraph (b) of the sub-section gives him the power to finance such functions.  I think that should answer Senator Quinlan's point.</P>

Now we have reached the stage where, according to the Minister, not according to me, for our own home needs we have too much wheat.  The people who are to bear the loss as a result of this miscalculation by politicians are now in the position that they are not to be allowed to investigate whether or not there is to be more Irish wheat used in the grist.</P>

    <P>Amendment negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>() (i)  On a day appointed by the Minister for Finance, such day to be at least three months before the fixing of the rate of wheat levy, the board shall recommend, in respect of wheat to be milled from the following crop&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Prices ex mill for shop and bakers flour.</P>
      <P>(b)  A fair price to flour millers for K.D. native wheat of 15 per cent. moisture or under ex mill or store, to be used for flour milling.</P>
      <P>(ii)  In making the recommendations named in sub-section (1) of this section, the board shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The cost of living.</P>
      <P>(b)  The cost of comparable foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>(c)  Rise and fall in national income, wage rates and wage agreements.</P>
      <P>(d)  Rise and fall in costs of production of the crop, including labour, seed, fertilisers, fuel oil, cost and depreciation of farm machinery, rates on land, and profits from other farming activities.</P>
      <P>(e)  Rise and fall in costs of handling, drying, transporting, insuring, and milling native wheat.</P>
      <P>(f)  Probable cost and percentage of foreign wheat to be included in the grist.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The Minister and the Minister for Finance shall have regard to recommendations made under this section.</P>
      <P>This section refers to the prices the farmers may expect for the amount of native wheat which is to be used for conversion into bread.  At present there is a figure and it is, of course, the figure of last year, when, in fact, the farmers were paid for all their wheat as if it were all to be used for conversion into bread and the Exchequer bore the loss.  In my view, the farmers are entitled to have the maximum amount of wheat used for human foods and also to have it used at prices which shall be fair and commensurate with the cost of living and the rise and fall in all their own costs and the other factors mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This board will have a preponderance of growers' interests upon it and the farmers have no way, except through agitation or making statements through their own organisations, of making representations to the Government on what price the ordinary consumer shall pay them for the wheat they produce. In the first amendment, we referred to the amount of wheat they would be entitled to sell for use as human food and <Col N="1207" /> this refers to the price at which they will be entitled to sell it.  I believe the board should be entitled to make a recommendation based on the factors set out in this amendment.  I shall not say much more about it now except that it is the only way in which it will be possible to have a fair selling price year after year.</P>
    <P>A national wages agreement was concluded since the present prices were fixed for the amount of native wheat to be used for human food this year. Yet the amendment does not ask that the people who benefit from that wages agreement shall have to pay more for bread.  Of course, in fact they must pay more because the subsidy was removed.  The national wage agreement must look after that, but the farmer is getting approximately the same price as before that agreement. That means that everything he purchases for the production of the wheat is dearer.  His raw materials cost more.  In view of these factors, he should be entitled to make his representations to the board which will dispose of his surplus as to what shall be, in his view, the price which the people should pay for the wheat they use.  We have been defeated on the question of whether or not he should have any say in the volume of wheat to be used for human food and I feel the Minister should accept this amendment to give the board, which will have a preponderance of growers' interests upon it, the very proper right of saying what they think the people should pay for their bread and flour manufactured from Irish wheat each year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what purpose would be served by so doing, since there is a recognition and admission on the part of the growers that they should be responsible for the sale of surplus wheat.  If the price that has been determined by the Government for a particular quantity of wheat has resulted in the production of an amount of wheat surplus to our requirements, what advantage would the growers derive from the fixation of a higher price for a stated quantity, if it <Col N="1208" /> were to result in a higher production, the cost of disposal of which they would have to shoulder?  That is apart altogether from the undesirability of giving to a board like this all the responsibilities and duties set out in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Since the withdrawal of the subsidy, flour is sold freely and, even if there were a fixed price for flour, I should like to hear members of the Seanad commenting upon the advisability of asking a businessman to put all his records before a board composed of all kinds of interests.  A businessman might place his full records at the disposal of a Minister, with the full knowledge that whatever revelations his books produced would be kept a secret, but that would not apply here.  For the life of me, I cannot see what advantage would come from following on that recommendation.</P>
      <P>As I stated on the Second Reading, there was full knowledge on the part of growers as to the certainty that there would be a reduction, in some form or other, in the price of wheat and, notwithstanding that knowledge and notwithstanding the announcement that was made before any spring wheat was sown, according to our calculations, which I do not claim are fully accurate at the moment, the acreage under wheat has increased this year. What advantage then would be derived, supposing a higher price had been fixed for 300,000 tons of dried wheat, so long as the growers were made responsible by way of levy for marketing the surplus over that amount?  In fact, the attractiveness of the price apparently induced them to grow more than we require and, if the price were made more attractive, one could assume the acreage would be still greater, and one could conclude that as a result of that the growers' contribution by way of levy would be still greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's line of thought is that when the price goes up, the acreage goes up, and when the price goes down, farmers grow less wheat.  That is not the situation at all. The position is that the farmer has improved his grassland&mdash;I will not diverge very much&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that the amendment to me seems to demands prices fixed for wheat, at various points, &ldquo;in respect of wheat to be milled from the following crop&rdquo;.  I would ask the Senator, and other Senators addressing themselves to it, to keep that in mind.  The whole question of the price of wheat is not, I suggest, open to debate now, nor is general farming practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I will say that many other factors govern the volume of wheat grown in the country, besides the one detailed by the Minister. The price of cattle is one.  In fact, farmers cannot afford to breed them when they want to get an immediate return.  Here we would have machinery whereby a board, on which there would be a preponderance of growers, could say to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture, who are charged, in consultation, with fixing the price, what they felt that price should be. They are charged with having regard to certain factors, certain factors which are set out in the amendment. Those factors are deliberately addressed to the present price, or rather the present price for the wheat to be used for human foodstuffs.  The idea is that the farmer shall not in future be tied to that price for ever and a day.</P>
      <P>If wage rates go up, if national income goes up and if the cost of raw materials goes up, then the farmer is entitled to sell that portion of wheat to be used as human foodstuffs at a fair price.  He is entitled to get more than he did get, and he is entitled to say so. Equally, all other sections of the community are entitled to disagree with him as soon as he makes his recommendations, but, at least, the farmer should have some machinery, or some body, charged with making recommendations on his behalf, now that he has been told for the first time that he shall bear all the cost of disposing of his surplus wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he did not know what advantage there would be.  The advantage would be a lesser levy.  If the suggested price were adopted by the Ministers, and if that suggested <Col N="1210" /> price were higher, 300,000 tons or whatever the figure would be, would be disposed of at that higher price and there would be less loss and, consequently, the levy would be less.  At the present moment, even though costs of production go up, the wheat grower has no guarantee whatever that cognisance will be taken of that by anybody, and he will always be working on the price in 1957.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Profits accruing to the board in respect of each crop, after the rate of wheat levy has been fixed, shall remain in the fund, and shall be taken into account by the Minister in fixing the rate of wheat levy the following year.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot be always right in fixing the amount of the wheat levy. That goes without saying.  Bad weather, an act of God and many other factors enter into it.  There will be times when the Minister will find himself in error and when the board will make a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 8, the board is entitled to do many things such as to purchase buildings and equip premises. I do not consider it right that from a profit made on the wheat harvest in one year &mdash;not through the Minister's intention but because he is human&mdash;premises should be built with money rightly belonging to the farmers in that year instead of passing it on to them in the following year. <Col N="1211" /> Section 5 deals with the fund and there is nothing in it to ensure that all profits made through an error in the fixing of the wheat levies are passed on to the farmer in the following year. I should like to hear the Minister on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention of doing anything other than leaving the sum that might be there at the end of the season.  It has been the intention all the time.  Questions have been addressed to me in the Dáil on this matter and I have deliberately stated that any sum of money over and above what is required, as a result of the levy asked at the beginning of the year, will in the year following remain in the fund for the benefit of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree.  After all, the Minister cannot live forever. Whereas he may give undertakings, there is no reason to expect that successive Governments will honour those undertakings.  The Minister will understand that point.  It is necessary that this amendment be included.  It would be very wrong to devote moneys to the purposes I mention.  Undertakings given by one Minister very often have been broken by the following Minister for practical reasons.  This would not be a proper practical reason.  The wheat grower should have that safeguard to ensure that moneys accruing could not be devoted to the purchase of equipment, provision of buildings and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Donegan has a point the Minister might consider.  Although the Minister has quite <i>bona fide</i> and honestly given a promise that any extra money will in fact remain in the fund, another Minister, not even of his own Government, as Senator Donegan says, might not in fact carry out his pledge, which is only verbal.  In fact, we have at present an example of that very thing. Deputy Sweetman, introducing the <Col N="1212" /> special import levies, undertook they would be used for capital purposes and would not be added to existing taxation. In fact, this Government have not carried out Deputy Sweetman's undertaking, which is on all fours with this.  If the intention is that these money should remain in, I cannot see why the Minister will not agree to have it inserted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator reads Section 5, he will see that power is given to the board.  No power is given to me or anybody else to take from them money in excess of their requirements. No matter what Government the Minister is a member of, so long as the Bill does not give him power to take money from the board and if Section 5 gives the board power to invest or re-invest money, surely that conveys, without any assurance from me, that it is the board has the power?</P>

      <P>Whatever may be conveyed, there is the danger still.  I do not believe the Minister would go back on his undertaking, but subsequent Ministers may.  The instance given by Senator McGuire is very valuable and deals with a much bigger issue.  Section 8 envisages the sort of thing I mention.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The board shall provide itself with such carriage, drying, handling and storage facilities for its wheat as it considers necessary.</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of sub-section (1)  of this section the board may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  arrange with the owners of such facilities for their use by or on behalf of the board,</P>
      <P>(b)  with the consent of the Minister, build, equip and maintain premises,</P>
      <P>(c)  with the consent of the Minister, purchase or taken on hire machinery, vehicles and equipment...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In later years, if the board could not get money to do some of the things suggested in Section 8&mdash;and also in Section 9, I think&mdash;possibly it would look for consent from the Minister, not the present Minister, to use the moneys <Col N="1213" /> accruing as a result of an error in fixing the wheat levy.  The following Minister might not live up to the present Minister's undertaking.</P>

I am giving the House the assurance that, according to our interpretation, there is no power vested in me to take money from the board.  The section we are discussing gives the board power to invest money surplus to their requirements from time to time and to sell and to buy from time to time.  Seeing that I am not given power, then there is no question of somebody following me breaking my word.

      <P>The amendment has nothing to do with that question.  The amendment was an afterthought to the amendment which preceded it and which has been ruled out of order by the Chair which said that any moneys in excess of what the levy provided in any year would be made good by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The amendment which we are now discussing followed that line of thought and said that should there be any money over and above in the hands of the board, in excess of what is necessary, the Minister has no power to take it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was collected.  In other words, as far as the State and the growers are concerned, it is a question of &ldquo;heads you win, harps I lose&rdquo;, whatever way you put it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 was ruled out of order and amendment No. 5 seeks to do something which the Bill itself fully <Col N="1215" /> provides for, namely, to ensure that moneys collected by the board by way of levy, and found to be in excess of the board's requirements to do the work entrusted to it, cannot be taken from the board by any means unless the law is amended.  When this Bill becomes an Act, no Minister will be able to take for any other purpose moneys in the fund unless he comes to the Oireachtas and provides himself with authority that is not there.</P>

His amendment <Col N="1217" /> is directed to the fact that they might build premises with moneys that accrue.  This is a perfectly reasonable provision in the Bill that the board should be able to meet expenses it may have, including taking premises or possibly building premises.  If that is the point to which Senator Donegan objects, he should have put down an amendment to delete that sub-section. What he has put down in irrelevant and does not cover the point he has in mind.  This is a very straightforward Bill and I think it would have remained so except for the efforts to confuse it.</P>

      <P>These legal eagles on the opposite benches annoy me.  If I have to teach these legal eagles on the far side, then it is a poor look out.  In Section 5 (2) (b) the moneys can be withdrawn from the fund for anything that can be defined as equivalent to the functions of the board.  I shall now take an example.  I have no objection in certain instances to doing what is provided in Section 8 (2) (b).  It is, however, provided in Section 5 (2) (b) that the board could withdraw money from the fund for this function.  In that fund, apart from what is destined to be used for paying for this surplus wheat by the various mathematical calculations, there shall only be money accrued through a mistake in the fixing of the wheat levy and the money can be withdrawn from that fund to buy, <Col N="1218" /> build, equip or maintain premises, no matter what the legal eagles may say. That is not correct.  The only possible thing that it could be used for correctly is to maintain a private premises; it could not be used to build one.  The farmer who grows ten acres of wheat and pays a levy should not be expected to provide moneys from the outcome of that wheat for capital expenditure for building.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;(excluding wheat imported for milling)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This specific exclusion of wheat imported for milling is, in my view, an incorrect thing to do.  At present, the cost of foreign wheat to a flour miller is 74/6 a barrel and the approximate cost of Irish wheat is 87/6 a barrel, so that any flour miller who would use one barrel more of Irish wheat in his grist than he is compelled to use, would not be a very good businessman. I had hoped that this board would endeavour to increase the <Col N="1219" /> amount of Irish wheat in the grist, but since other amendments were defeated, I am afraid there is not much hope of that.  If one looks at Section 7, one thinks that in later years the board could make it more profitable for millers to use more Irish wheat, than specified in the national percentage.  If the miller can produce good flour by using more Irish wheat, I think some sort of economic set-up would be possible whereby he would derive extra profit.  I think that the profit incentive is a most important thing.  So long as it works in the converse direction, so long will large mills want to use more and more foreign wheat in the grist.  I think in Section 7 when all the powers that are necessary are taken by the board in regard to the importation of other cereals, etc., and when the board does all the work at present done by Grain Importers, that it should take the right to import foreign wheat for mills. One could see a position where foreign wheat was one shilling higher in price than Irish whaet.  If that power were taken, this Minister or succeeding Ministers could consider such a scheme, and the profit incentive could be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument used in support of this amendment is an argument that has been used freely in support of amendments already.  As Minister for Agriculture, I have the right to restrict the importation of wheat by millers.  Every Minister for Agriculture has the right to do so.  Why then, since that right is vested in the Minister, should whatever wheat the flour millers are permitted to use, be imported by some other body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was necessary that such should be the case during the emergency years and such wheat as we were able to get was imported through the activities of Grain Importers, Limited.  After the emergency, that practice was continued for some time, but the millers have been agitating for a right, which I can understand, to import their requirements so long as these requirements are controlled by the Minister, having regard to the policy pursued in relation to wheat in the grist and the extraction <Col N="1220" /> rate.  There is no justification in the light of the remarks which I have made for this amendment and for giving to the board this power.  That power lies with the Minister for Agriculture from day to day.  In this particular setting, the people who are the owners of the establishments in which the flour requirements of the country are manufactured should have the right to import themselves, from whatever source they decided, the quality they wish to purchase, and so on, so long as I have the overriding right to permit by licence only that amount which is required to provide the loaf that has been determined as the loaf that should be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary exclusion.  If we address ourselves to Section 7, we see that those powers are being taken in relation to all cereals except those for use in flour milling.  At the moment, the Minister has the right to exclude cereals from the home market or he can grant import licences.  Yet in this Bill he takes powers to second to this board the importation of brans, pollards, barleys and maize for use by everybody all over the place but the holy shibboleth of the millers is not to be touched. Even though these powers may not be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has the power to admit or not to admit wheat for wheat or flour milling.  The Minister, through the agency of Grain Importers, Limited, has the power to fix the price of maize, barley and any other cereal he likes, simply and solely by the board fixing a price.  The Minister can do what he likes.  He can <Col N="1221" /> say the price can be the same at every railway station in Ireland as it is at the moment, but he has specifically excluded from the Bill wheat imported for milling.  At the present moment, the large port millers can suck this wheat at 74/6 off the mill floor.  The millers in the centre of this country have to pay storage charges and haulage charges; yet the price of bread and flour, which the Minister says is not fixed, is fixed by the flour millers themselves and is not undercut by any of them.  It must be fixed at a price which will allow the weakest to survive. Yet the Minister will not take the powers which he will probably never use to arrange the price of foreign wheat on every mill floor.  The power is one which might result at some time in the future in the use of more Irish wheat.  I do not see why it should be specifically excluded.  If the Minister is not so worried about it, why does he exclude it?</P>

      <P>The argument advanced in support of this amendment also is that we should provide some machinery that could be used directly and indirectly for a purpose about which the Senator has been speaking most of the evening, that is, the all-Irish loaf.  I told him in relation to this amendment that there is no need for it since the percentages are determined by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, and, following that, the Minister for Agriculture has the right to determine by licence the amount of foreign wheat that will be taken into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Senator suggests is that somebody should have the power to put a tax on that foreign wheat, but the Government have even that right, if they decide to use it.  I do not think that a Government would ever be so crazy as to take that course, but that right exists.  I have no objection, if the Senator wishes, to continuing this discussion about the all-Irish loaf all over the place and making every case <Col N="1222" /> on every amendment with that at the back of my mind, but I do not think it would get us anywhere.</P>
    <P>The position is clearly this.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce determines the national percentage, in consultation with me.  Therefore, the amount of foreign wheat is largely determined by that decision and that amount can be imported only as a result of a licence from me as Minister for Agriculture.  There is nothing left but the single issue of the taxation on foreign wheat and the Senator wants to give this job to the board so that the board will from time to time have the right to decide questions that could only be decided, in all justice and fairness to the people, by the elected Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests taxation.  I did not suggest taxation. What I suggested was a moving of moneys so that some time in the future, if it was found advantageous to the Irish wheat growers, foreign wheat would cost as much on the mill floor as Irish wheat so as to encourage the use of greater quantities of Irish wheat fixed for that particular period of time by the national percentage.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (b), line 46, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;purchase&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I will discuss amendments Nos. 7 and 8 together. In this section, power is given to the board to purchase premises and to use them for grain drying and storage.  In this country, there is a specific need for grain drying and storage at certain points.  While lorries have certainly enlarged the scope of any one grain drying and storage installation in any district, ten or 15 miles can mean the end of that scope.  The building, the equipping and the setting up of this sort of premises is something which is most specific.  It should be done in certain areas and it should be done, if possible, by private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendments suggest that the board should be empowered to set up these facilities themselves only where satisfactory facilities at normal and reasonable rates are not available or offered by co-operative societies and private enterprise.  We have too many Government-instituted boards and companies which are interfering with the business of private citizens.  I think that grain drying and storage must be stepped up.  A lot has been stepped up as a result of the Grain Storage (Loans) Act.  It must be done in a specific way so as not to interfere with the efforts of co-operative societies and private enterprise.  If the Minister allows these amendments to be inserted, they would be a safeguard and would ensure that the installations were built in the <Col N="1224" /> right places, if any are being built, and that there would not be undue interference with co-operative societies and private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of these fears arise at all.  I could not agree more with anybody or with any statement that this board or, indeed, any other board, especially a semi-State board, should not interfere in activities that are far more successfully and profitably pursued by private enterprise.  In preparing a measure of this nature, the draftsman must provide for every contingency.  This scheme could not work at all without the assistance of the millers and their agents, the facilities which they have in the way of stores, organisation and equipment.  We will be depending on these gentlemen, on their employees and their whole organisation.  This provision in the Bill is, like every other provision in this and other Bills, provided by the draftsman to give overriding powers and exceptional authority to deal with very exceptional situations which almost never arise and which we hope will never arise.  I do not see any need for amendment of this section.  What will happen is what has happened in the past.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment and the others that follow, we will have to depend on private enterprise and full co-operation in implementing this scheme.  That was one of the first things it was necessary to secure and I secured it.  Whatever would appear to be an indication in this Bill that a different course would be pursued by the board, there is nothing further from my mind.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in the Minister's mind, or what the Minister's mind may be to-day or to-morrow. I am prepared to accept his good faith, without a shadow of doubt; but I still say that the safeguard would not be any harm.  It would mean that, if this board in a certain area in the South, for example, decided to set up an installation to do a specific job, a co-operative society could say that the ramifications of the board might mean their business would be harmed.  They could come along and for reasonable rates&mdash;the same specific sort of commissions <Col N="1225" /> that are so absolute in the grain trade, as everyone knows&mdash;and they could offer to do the job for the same price as the Grain Board, so that private enterprise would have the first fling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section.  I think Senator Donegan is right; and I ask the Minister to consider his amendment.  I believe the Minister wishes to give us an undertaking and is sincere, but it could be written into the Bill.  The Minister can act in good faith only as long as he is Minister.  If the Bill empowers a Minister, another Minister will have the power.  We know that some State companies are engaging in trade which could well be done by private individuals.  I know of cases where private individuals were given facilities and State companies came along, right next door, with special privileges and competed against them.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is in accord with us on this, but I want to remind him and other Ministers that they act only for the time being. When he ceases to be Minister for Agriculture, it may be that a colleague of his or a member of a different Government will have different views.  This will be the law of the land and he should put in the safeguard now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it should be the law of the land.  I agree that a provision of this nature in a Bill of this kind is necessary, even if the policy to be pursued by the board, with the full approval of the Minister, should be as I have outlined.  After all, suppose the provision of that nature in Section 8 were not there, would not the fact that it was not there rob the board and the Government of the negotiating power it has with private enterprise?  I am a full respecter of private enterprise and realise to the maximum the advantages that private enterprise can confer.  I also can see what may happen when a State Department or a board is left without any protection in its negotiation with private enterprise to arrange for the storage of surplus wheat, the drying of it, the haulage of it and so on.  It is a useful thing to have something in the <Col N="1226" /> nature of the power conferred here. Then the board will not be absolutely at the mercy of private enterprise, which otherwise could say: &ldquo;You are depending upon us.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Bill should contain powers of this nature. I agree that I give only my personal assurance regarding their use, but I still agree that the Bill should contain the powers.  If the demands of private enterprise proved extravagant, the board could then say: &ldquo;If you do not try to meet us, we will resort to something to which we did not want to resort.&rdquo;  I certainly would defend that approach anywhere and everywhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The specific nature of the amendment is to see that what the Minister says would not occur &ldquo;where satisfactory facilities at normal and reasonable rates are not available or offered.&rdquo;  In other words, if they are not available or offered, then they can mill, buy, equip and maintain.  If they are available or offered, they should be availed of.  The minute they stop being reasonable in their rates, it becomes open to the board to build and maintain what they wish.  Without digressing, I may say that we all know the E.S.B. are selling flat irons in competition with traders next door.  One cannot see what alleys this Bill may traverse; one can only set up the board and be extremely careful as to the manner of doing so.</P>

      <P>The board has the right to determine what is reasonable and what is not.  None of us here could determine what is reasonable.  If the board finds that the demands of private enterprise are unreasonable, I say the board should have power to take other action.  That is what I am providing for and that is what I regard as entirely reasonable.</P>

      <P>Under my amendment, the board has the right to go ahead, where the rates are not reasonable.  It is only where the rates are reasonable that they are not allowed to compete with private enterprise.  The Minister refuses to allow his mind to assimilate and use the words and terms used in the amendment: &ldquo;where satisfactory facilities at normal and reasonable <Col N="1228" /> rates are not available or offered.&rdquo;  If a co-operative society built a grain storage and drying plant for use by the board and if, three years later, it could be proved that their rates were not reasonable, the board could leave them with that capital expenditure of no further use to them and could build for themselves.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4) (b), line 33, before &ldquo;be&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe the manager should not be a member of the board.  The board is appointed by the Minister and would have the manager always available to it.

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph 2 (1) to delete all words from and including &ldquo;such&rdquo; in line 8, down to the end of the sub-paragraph <Col N="1229" /> and substitute &ldquo;six members&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe the wording of the section which deals with the number on the board is far too loose and, if I might be blunt, gives far too much power to the Minister to see to it that the majority of the board are, shall we say, of the same mind as himself.  The provision with regard to there being no less than four or more than eight could mean that if a member of the board became ill, was unable to discharge his functions and that nobody else substituted him, the board could be manipulated&mdash;I do not imply that the present Minister would seek, by framing legislation, to give himself that power &mdash;so that whatever Minister might be in power could have a majority of the board of the same mind as himself.  An exact specification of the number of members on the board would be far better.  My amendment would bring about a situation whereby the board would consist of a chairman and six members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in this.  The provision in the Bill is that the board should consist of not less than four or more than eight.  On an earlier amendment the Senator was recommending that fairly wide interests should be represented on the board.  He mentioned the growers, naturally, as they are the people who will pay this levy; he mentioned the co-operative organisation, and although he may not have mentioned them as specifically as I am mentioning them now, I think he also had in mind the compound millers. There is no reason why, if you had places for them, you would not introduce, perhaps, pig-feeding interests as well.  Therefore, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask for not less than four or more than eight.  If the growers were to get reasonable representation on a geographical basis on a board of six, I would not have many places left to provide for the other interests the Senator himself, at an earlier stage, seemed to think it would be desirable to have on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that the whole scheme depends upon goodwill and co-operation on the part of those who may be affected.  While I have the right to nominate the chairman and all the members of the board and ignore every other consideration, the facts are that the more goodwill and co-operation we have the more likely the effort is to be successful. Therefore, whatever my own inclinations or feelings might be I would naturally have to take decisions based upon the desire to achieve that success.</P>

      <P>If the success of the board depends upon the co-operation of the Minister would it not be a better idea if instead of having, say, six members nominated by the Minister, to stipulate that three of those will be representative of the growers?  I would suggest that would provide a greater chance of getting the co-operation of those concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph 2 (2) to insert a new sub-paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> ( )  Before the formation of each new board, responsible interested bodies, the naming of nominated Minister for nominations to the board, and the Minister shall have due regard to the claims of such bodies the naming of nominated members to be by the nominating bodies themselves.</P>
    <P>My desire in moving this amendment is that representative bodies who should have representation on the board&mdash;representatives of the growers, the National Farmers' Association, and so on&mdash;shall have the right to nominate their own members, that the Minister shall specify only the number of members, and that these individual bodies shall have their rightful place upon the board.  This is most important because if we look for co-operation we should do everything to ensure that the bodies we hope will work on this board will not be people who, as often happens, are appointed because they are personal friends of the Minister or the Government of the time.  That is true not only of this Government but of all Governments.  I shall not give examples but everybody knows it is true.  It would be far wiser if the Minister merely specified the number of persons to be appointed on the board and allowed the bodies whom he named to nominate their own representatives.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that all bodies who feel they have a right to be represented on the board should have the right officially to make representations to the Minister that that right be accorded to them and it is better to adopt this way of dealing with the matter and that the Minister should follow the procedure laid down religiously because the nominated members will then go on the board knowing they are in no way tainted by their Government affiliations, no matter what Government may be in power.  Politics will not enter into it.</P>
    <P>I am not interested personally in this, and I am not interested in the persons who may be nominated, but I am interested in the matter of the persons being nominated by Governments and open to criticism later on and suggestions that they should not <Col N="1232" /> operate on that board.  I am not going to give any examples, except to say that the Minister would be most wise if he merely gives nominating rights to certain bodies and allows those bodies to fill the vacancies themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Donegan on this.  The Minister would save himself a considerable amount of trouble from time to time if he were able to say this action had been taken by a board wholly, or at least in majority, representing various outside bodies.  There have been boards in the past which have ceased to function and which when they were functioning, were subject to much criticism.  The Minister's predecessor in another case was subject to great criticism because the members of a board were nominated members, but at that time&mdash;many years ago&mdash;there were no farmers' organisations such as we have at present and that made it difficult for the Minister.  This amendment would protect the Minister.  He can ask the farmers' organisation to give him, say, six names and he can select three names, and in all cases these will be people suggested by the body concerned.  By getting a panel of names, the Minister will ensure that he can select the ones he prefers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No Minister, merely for the sake of freeing himself from the possibility of criticism, should desert his responsibilities.  If that doctrine is to be preached by members of this House or any other House, it will certainly be resisted by me.  I have said that, especially in a case of this kind, a Minister should consult closely with the bodies immediately concerned in this problem, but I have only eight places and a Minister must have regard to the interests that will be affected by the activities of a board like this.  There is no denying that these interests have already been making representations to me, not two or three, but many interests, and they claim the right to be represented on the board, a right which will be conceded to them but which cannot be conceded to the extent that they have the right to select the members of the board.  Who is to decide a question like this except the Minister?  Surely a <Col N="1233" /> Minister will not hand this whole business over to these bodies and say: &ldquo;You elect the board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that whatever persons are nominated by those bodies, it is the Minister who will appoint.  I shall appoint the chairman, however he may be chosen, but the overriding consideration is that this is a measure which requires the retention of the general confidence of those who envisaged this scheme.  It is my hope that confidence will be retained and I shall try to get the growers represented, having regard to the fact that they are the contributors to the fund, the compound millers and the co-operative movement, if I can.  I should like to give some representation if they would take it&mdash;but, incidentally, so far they have not shown they are anxious to take it&mdash;to the flour millers.  I think they should be represented on this board because I am depending on the flour millers and this scheme depends on them and the organisation which they have for the purchase, storage and drying of wheat.  For that reason, I should like to see them on the board, although they have said they do not want to be associated with this activity at all.</P>
      <P>Having regard to all these matters&mdash; and Senators have urged me to have regard to them&mdash;I do not see why I should accept an amendment like this which provides for something which is already there, something which is already happening, in that different organisations are submitting names to me from which to choose three, four or five.  I still have only eight places and in the composition of the board, I must have regard to what will be representative not only from the point of view of the trade interest but also the feeding interest and geographical interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister wishes to have the flour millers represented on this board and when a decision is being reached, I hope the Minister will give them representation, but there is a danger in this situation that the Minister describes, in which associations or bodies submit names to the Minister. He knows he can appoint only two or, <Col N="1234" /> perhaps, one and there is every danger that the appointment would be regarded as political.  I would think that the fair and proper method would be for the Minister, instead of saying that John Brown will represent the National Farmers' Association on this board, to write to the National Farmers' Association saying that he was giving them one representative on the board and ask them to forward a name within, say, seven days, or something like that.  That would be a far better way of doing it and the Minister would be certain that he would not be accused of making a political appointment. There would not be the slightest doubt about that.</P>
      <P>I think that the other method would be a very slovenly way of doing it. There is the temptation, if you like, in the case of any politician, where a number of names are submitted, for the politician to look at those names and to select from among them the man he knows agrees with his own politics.  I am sure the Minister will accept that; at least I accept it and I think everybody here accepts it.  Most of us are not saints, but we are politicians and that temptation, therefore, exists.  Why should the Minister allow people to think that he did not resist the temptation?  Why not set out by saying to the body concerned that it will have one representative and let that body name the man?</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about deserting responsibilities and said he would not do that but, unfortunately, that is exactly what he is doing in this Bill because it is setting up a board to do a job that he is not prepared to do himself&mdash;cut the price of wheat.  We know that if an increase in price were being given, the Minister would not set up a board; he would give the increase himself and he himself, his Party, and Senator Lenihan would claim credit for it.  In this Bill, the Minister is shirking his own responsibility and passing it on to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph 8 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(8)  Any member of the board guilty of serious misconduct may be <Col N="1236" /> named by the Minister, and on a majority of the board voting that he is so guilty, shall cease to be a members of the board forthwith.</P>
    <P>This paragraph of the Schedule is an extraordinary provision.  It states that the Minister may at any time remove a member of the board from office.  The Minister takes full powers to do that, but he is not bound to give any reasons for the removal of a member of the board from office.  I do not think any Minister has ever taken such power and I do not think a Minister has ever used such a power.  It is dictatorial and I believe my amendment is more in keeping with the ordinary privileges and dignity of the individual.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks that where there is serious misconduct on the part of a member of the board, he shall be removed only on being named by the Minister, and on a majority vote of the board.  If the original provision is allowed to stand, each member of the board will be afraid to express his honest views in public, in case his head may roll.  There is far too much of this in Irish life and I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary put a question to me as to the possibility of giving representation on the board to the trade unions which, he explained, were also interested in this matter.  I do not know in what way the interests of the trade unions could be affected. As I told the Seanad, I invited the flour millers to act.  We were asking them to purchase the wheat, to pay for it, to deduct the levy and to dry and store the wheat.  We asked them would they be interested in being represented on this board, but that is a different matter from that mentioned by Senator O'Leary.</P>
      <P>These flour millers would be very glad if the amount of flour required were to increase.  It would also be into their barrow if the consumption of flour were to increase.  It would also be into the barrow of the workers, in that it would provide more employment.  They would not be affected by the proposed activities of the board which would be the disposal, other than by conversion into flour, of any surplus wheat we may find ourselves with.  It is a question of the disposal of it as animal feed, or if not entirely needed for that purpose, the disposal of it otherwise, perhaps by export.  In that sense, I do not think there would be any point in giving representation to trade unions.  In my opinion, their interests could not be affected by anything this board would do.  The more wheat converted into flour, the better it will be for this board, for the growers and for the trade unions in which the Senator is interested.</P>

      <P>The amendments put down this evening by Senator Donegan, which he argued at great length and with great care, were intended to improve the actual contents of this Bill.  Although the House is being kept very late, we should like to express our disappointment that once more, as has happened many other times, the Minister has not seen fit to accept a single suggestion from a well-intentioned member of the House.  This is one of the things that bring this House into contempt and we are sorry.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 24th July, 1958.</P>
