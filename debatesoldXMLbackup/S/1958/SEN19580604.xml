    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the section, with its reference to the 1932 and 1934 Acts, discloses a certain lack of clarity.  The Bill as originally brought in was a Bill to amend the Control of Manufactures Acts of 1932 and 1934.  After it had a Second Reading, a great many amendments were brought into it, and the Title was amended, but this section to a large extent refers, not to industrial development or the encouragement of external investment, but to the Control of Manufactures Acts, 1932 and 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to repeat what I said on the Second Stage.  If we accept the Minister's view that there is a real need for foreign investment in this country, if we have a genuine desire to encourage that investment, we should say what we have to say about it in <Col N="544" /> some different way than that in which we are saying it here.  We should make it clear in one document.  In practice, a person who may be desirous of investing money in this country must read the 1932 and 1934 Acts, discover what &ldquo;qualified persons&rdquo; means in one Act, discover it means something different in the other Act, and finally discover it means something different again in this Bill, when it becomes an Act.  This type of legislation by reference is extremely ill-advised and the procedure adopted in this Bill indicates a lack of clear thinking, a lack of really knowing where we want to go.  It is most inadvisable in this instance, where it would appear by the Title of the Bill that we are aiming at encouraging foreign investment, that this kind of section should remain in the Bill and that we should legislate in this way&mdash; by reference&mdash;rather than that we should begin in 1958 and put what we have to say altogether into one Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the section is very cumbersome, very objectionable and will tend to make difficult the achievement of the purposes which it is alleged the Bill seeks to gain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is very much in that observation.  As far as a foreign company is concerned, a company which at some time in the future wants to engage in manufacturing operations here, it can get all the information it wants in this Bill.  The idea that it would be better to combine all the previous legislation in one Bill was considered and was rejected.  It would be a most cumbersome measure, and I think it is a far better and simpler procedure to set out in this Bill the conditions which will apply in future in respect of external companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister tells me there is something simple about this, he must be very close to a simpleton himself and must think I am a simpleton, too.  Nobody could agree it is simple.  This section shows there are two things in the Bill.  The first is the continuance of the Control of Manufactures Act, particularly in reference to certain Schedules which I will not be allowed to discuss now, and <Col N="545" /> the second is the encouragement of external investment for certain purposes.  If it was necessary, these two things could be divided.  We could give continued protection to people who invested their money under certain conditions, people to whom the Minister feels and we all feel we have particular obligations, and then we could deal with the encouragement of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>What is happening in this section? The two things are being mixed up&mdash; the control of manufactures, the preventing of foreigners coming in on the one hand, and inducement to foreigners to come in, on the other. If the Minister wants to argue that it is simple to put these two things together in one Bill, then words have no meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Manufactures Act was not for the purpose of preventing foreigners coming in.  It was for the purpose of regulating their entry in relation to national policy.  I do not see there is any point whatever in making this Bill, which the Senator thinks is complicated, still more complicated by cluttering it up with a lot of provisions which have very little reference to future conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If they have no relation to future conditions they should be taken out altogether.  I do not want to labour this point, but I have some experience of reading and understanding Bills.  I have been compelled by the nature of my work to understand certain Bills, but this Bill is most difficult to understand. There is no doubt about that.  The Minister is not in earnest when he says it is simple.  I know it is not simple and I find difficulty in understanding it.  I am not unintelligent about understanding legislation and I have a good deal of experience.  There is no use in telling me that it is simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only is it difficult to understand, but it is repellent to the person who wants to invest money, the foreigner who is anxious to come in here.  Legal people will find it very difficult to understand and, in fact, <Col N="546" /> some legal people of repute find it difficult to understand in its present form.  The Minister says he is doing this for the purpose of simplicity.  The reason is that he changed his mind while the Bill was before the Dáil. Section 1 remains because it was meant to accomplish one set of things, and the Minister now wants another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a measure like this, on the principles of which both sides of the House agree, it ought to be possible to get the type of Bill that will enable the Minister to get the job done.  I am quite satisfied that, when Senator Hayes says this Bill is difficult to understand, as many more people will take his word as will take any Minister's word, because he is as competent to understand the Bill as any executive in this country.  He is not saying this merely for the purpose of making an argument and contesting the issue with the Minister.</P>
      <P>Suppose you have a foreigner coming in here, not from America or Britain but from the Continent.  He comes over here and asks what is the legal position before he invests his money.  He cannot discover it for himself and he must go to a lawyer.  He will get a lawyer to interpret the law, but no foreigner is going to put capital into an industry here, unless he understands the law and what is its basis. His lawyer will produce the legislative enactments which give the particular set-up.  My opinion is, and I have some small experience in the matter, of which the Minister has some remote knowledge, too, that it is terribly hard to interpret our legislation to foreigners so that they will understand it and that it is terribly easy to scare them away, if they find something which is not perfectly clear to them. By devious processes, the Minister proposes to legislate to try to bring in capital here.  I agree with Senator Hayes and I am quite satisfied that a simpler method ought to be found by the Minister, if he really wants to make his policy effective, and we all want that done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had contact with Dutch people and there is great difficulty in making them understand what is the legal set-up with regard to the introduction of capital <Col N="547" /> to this country.  Nobody questions the Minister's sincerity in trying to accomplish his policy, but his methods are not always the wisest, and the Minister would perhaps be the first to admit that he is very headstrong and difficult to convince.  If he gets a notion that a thing is right, then he considers it is right, whether it is right or wrong.  That, in my opinion, is a mistake.  If it is not too late, the Minister should study the matter further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether this Bill is clear, or can be made clearer, is a matter which we can consider as we go through the sections.  My point is that Senator Hayes's suggestion to have one Bill not merely incorporating the provisions of this Bill but continuing the provisions of the 1932 and 1934 Acts would not make it simpler.  Legislation for the protection of companies in existence prior to 1932 and prior to 1934 can be of no interest to any new company starting up.  It is necessary to keep those provisions but why should we double or treble this Bill merely to re-enact those provisions?</P>
      <P>So far as new companies proposing to commence new operations here are concerned, they can, in this one Bill, get all the information they require. They do not need to go back to the earlier Acts.  The only provisions of them which are continued are those relating to the protection of companies in existence prior to those enactments and the definition of what constitutes a completely Irish company.  In the case of a foreign company, all the law they need to know is contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite unwittingly, I am sure, the Minister has not said what I meant.  I did not suggest that we should mix the 1932 and the 1934 Acts and the provisions for encouraging foreign investment.  I said quite a different thing.  The fault I find with this Bill is that it mixes the 1932 and 1934 Acts with the encouragement of foreign investment.  The Minister stated that the situation is now different, not only different but indeed desperate from the point of view of employment, compared with 1932.  The <Col N="548" /> Minister wants to change his direction from that which he took in 1932 and 1934.  We may all feel certain obligations towards those people who did certain things in the interval.  He should put their position into one Bill, amend the 1932 and 1934 Acts, and put the new requirements into another Bill.</P>
      <P>Let me quote the last sub-section of this section, which the Minister said is simple.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Act shall be construed as one with the Control of Manufactures Acts, 1932 and 1934.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;References in this Act to any enactment shall be construed as references to that enactment as amended by any subsequent enactment, including this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What human being who is a native speaker of English could say that is simple?  It is not.</P>

      <P>The Minister is empowered by this section by Order to except a particular commodity that is not being manufactured in the State, or manufactured to a substantial extent.  Then sub-section (2) goes on to provide that where such an Order has been made, in any other section of the Act the section shall be construed as excluding the commodity to which the Order made under sub-section (1) relates.  I do not quite follow what that means.  I think it probably means that a person trying to construe the remaining sections of the Act, when particular Orders have been made under sub-section (1), would want to know what commodities had already been made the subject of an Order under sub-section (1).  If that be the case, how are people to become aware of what Orders have been made under sub-section (1)?  It seems to me to be extremely difficult to understand what the meaning of sub-section (2) is, but if I am right in my interpretation of <Col N="549" /> it, there would want to be some machinery of procedure adopted to enable people to know what Orders had been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If an Order should be made under sub-section (3) excluding any commodity, that commodity is excluded from the Act completely, and any firm who wants to engage in the production of that commodity is free to do so without any reference to this legislation.  The wording of sub-section (2) is only a drafting device to simplify the wording of subsequent sections by making it clear that where the term &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; is used in any subsequent section, it is not meant to include any commodities excluded by Ministerial Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I already explained that I do not attach a great deal of importance to the section.  I approached the preparation of this Bill with the idea that it might be possible to schedule in the Bill commodities to which the legislation would not apply, but I found that drafting difficulties were such that that approach was impossible.  This section was the nearest I could go to meeting that idea.  Drafting difficulties were anticipated, that is, to define the excluded commodities in such a precise form that they would cover the goods which it was intended to cover and no other goods.  I should not like to suggest that this is an important section. I do not think it will prove to be so.  I nevertheless felt it was desirable to include it in the Bill because it gave a method of dealing with a particular problem which would certainly be the best method if it could be applied, and I should like to have that means available, even though I recognise it will be only in very exceptional circumstances that it can be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point arising on the section.  I do not <Col N="550" /> know what range of commodities the section might apply to, but, in referring back to the 1934 Act, we find in Section 17 that where the Government were satisfied that a particular commodity was not being manufactured here to any substantial extent&mdash;that seems to be the same kind of situation that is envisaged here&mdash;the Government could then make an Order declaring such a commodity to be a reserved commodity.  Furthermore, no Order under the section could become valid until it was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  What I am wondering is whether this type of commodity which is going to be an excepted commodity would be of the same order of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the reserved commodity Order was to confer a very definite advantage upon a particular firm.  By that device, a firm got a monopoly situation, or at any rate a situation tantamount to a monopoly because all companies except those that were undertaking manufacturing in precisely the same area or under the same disadvantages were excluded.  In this case, the aim is the reverse.  It is to open the field to everybody to engage in a particular manufacture and, therefore, there is no question of anybody getting a precise advantage such as they would get under that other section of the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister two questions. Sub-section (2) of Section 4 reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Act, a company shall be an excluded company if and so long as it complies with the following conditions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The third condition, paragraph (c), of this sub-section, reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That its Memorandum of Association and every prospectus issued by it after the date of the passing of <Col N="551" /> this Act provide that the carrying on of a manufacturing process in relation to a commodity intended for export is a principal object,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I want to ask the Minister is what exactly will the interpretation of &ldquo;a principal object&rdquo; be.  May it be one of a half dozen &ldquo;objects&rdquo;?  Will exports have to represent 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of production?  You could have as one of your principal objects the export of a product whose export represented 25 per cent. of production, which makes it a principal object, not the principal object.  How is it intended that that should be interpreted?</P>
    <P>The second question I should like to ask is in relation to paragraph (d), the fourth condition in sub-section (2) which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that, of each class of shares carrying voting rights issued by it, not less than 50 per cent. have been <i>bona fide</i> issued for public subscription in the State and have been made available primarily to Irish citizens or Irish companies which are managed and controlled in the State,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the official interpretation of that?  This does not lay it down that at least 50 per cent. of the shares shall be held by Irish citizens but that they shall be made available primarily to them.  I am afraid I do not follow what is intended there.  Do I take it that if it can be shown that these shares were originally made available to Irish citizens who did not take them up, then the company can have its shares held by non-Irish citizens and still fulfil the requirements of this paragraph? All this paragraph asks is that the shares shall be originally, not &ldquo;sold to&rdquo; but &ldquo;made available to&rdquo; and not made available &ldquo;exclusively&rdquo; but &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; to Irish citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator no doubt knows that the present law says that a company which has more than half its capital held by Irish citizens is entitled to manufacture freely any commodity it likes.  We are going further than that.  We are saying to a company that is financed by <Col N="552" /> means of a public issue of shares that it will satisfy the requirements, if a reasonable and <i>bona fide</i> opportunity of investing in its shares is offered to Irish citizens, whether or not that offer is taken up at all.</P>
      <P>There is no question of any Government supervision of the application of this section.  Under this section the police are the Stock Exchange Committees. A company which considers that it has conformed with those requirements goes to a Stock Exchange Committee to get a quotation for its shares.  If the Stock Exchange Committee accept that they have <i>bona fide</i> carried out the obligations, they give them a quotation.  Once they have done that, there is no going back. Even if the quotation given by the Stock Exchange is given in error, it is still irrevocable.  The assumption is that the type of people who will be engaged in manufacturing and seeking to finance their operations by means of a public issue can be trusted to put the facts plainly to the public and that in any event the Stock Exchange Committee will make sure they do.  As far as paragraph (d) is concerned, the intention is that there shall be a <i>bona fide</i> offer of shares and that if Irish people do in fact subscribe for them, they will get the shares in priority.  For example, if the issue should be over-subscribed, in allocating the shares Irish citizens will get preference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the point raised by Senator Donegan. The fault with the whole legislation is that it is preventing when it should be opening up.  If this does not open up the way, it is merely giving lip-service to the principal object which is to attract people to come here and give employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim is to liberalise this legislation we have had, as far as it is possible to do so, for two precise purposes.  One is to facilitate manufacture for export.  The other is to facilitate the manufacture of commodities not made here at the moment&mdash;some development which will add to the industrial organisation of the State.  Quite definitely, it is not the intention to facilitate the incursion of foreign companies into industries which are already fully established here, when no export is intended.</P>
      <P>A company that wants to avail of this section has to declare its intention to engage in export and to enter into that contract with those whom they ask to subscribe the capital to them by declaring that to be their intention. It is appreciated that circumstances might arise which might prevent them from doing so and that plans they made to that end might go wrong, but they would still be in existence and could carry on confined to the home market.  The idea of putting it in there is to make it clear that the facility given in this section is primarily intended for companies that have export as their aim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister, with all his experience behind him, say that he can visualise the establishment of an industry here that could make that declaration to produce goods for export and that would be competent to do so from the beginning?  I cannot see how we can expect a new industry, having to train operatives and having to produce below the level of efficiency of old established businesses, to do so. I cannot see how such an industry could hope to compete in foreign markets, except with the aid of some policy of subsidisation, but that is not the declared policy of the Minister.  It is inevitable that these people must get a share of the home market at the beginning.  They must have that at the same time as they are attempting to capture part of the foreign market.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what are his hopes and prospects in that regard.  It is a delusion, an error of judgment on our part and wrong from the national point of view, to be making declarations about our plans for export, only to find out later, through experience, that we were not justified in being so optimistic.  It is better to face the truth from the beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The company does not have to do this from the beginning. One of the considerations to be kept in mind is that very few companies do, in fact, in any country attempt a public issue of shares until they have already established their capacity to make profits.  There has not been a company formed in this country for years in the way contemplated here by an initial issue of shares to raise capital.  There have been shares issues undertaken by companies, but they were established companies already engaged in business and which could produce a number of balance sheets to show to prospective investors that the investment could be a profitable one. That is the way I contemplate this will happen in future.  Companies will be financed from private sources, with the idea that at a later stage a public issue may be attempted if the undertaking is successful.  I do not anticipate there will be many instances of companies attempting a public issue before <Col N="555" /> commencing.  It will be appreciated that this section relates primarily to external companies, many of which may have already an established reputation, so that they could proceed in this way if they wanted to do so.</P>

      <P>I could fill pages of this Bill with sections giving the Minister power to do this and to do that, power to examine, power to regulate. The delay in producing this Bill and a lot of the problems connected with it arose out of my desire to devise in relation to this section a simple procedure in which the Minister would not be involved and which did not require elaborate precautions.  Indeed, I think we were very happy when we found that the Stock Exchange Committee were prepared to act as policemen for us in relation to this section.  Anybody who has any knowledge of their work knows we can rely on them not to sanction an issue or grant a quotation to a concern which has not meticulously fulfilled all its obligations to the public.</P>

Only when they get that are they an excluded company under the section.  It is the Stock Exchange Committee have the job of seeing that there is a <i>bona fide</i> issue of shares, and that there is nothing attached to the issue conditions designed to discourage people from investing.  I think we can be sure that the Stock Exchange Committee will conscientiously discharge the duties they have undertaken to fulfil in this connection.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Minister on this.  If we do intend to get people to come in here and invest money, we cannot adopt the attitude that Senator Cole adopts of trying to stop every loophole.  This is not a Bill for stopping loopholes.

      <P>The Minister in this instance is trying to do a difficult thing and the method adopted seems to me to be sound enough.  It may not work perfectly, but, after all, very few human devices do work perfectly.  If the Stock Exchange has a controlling voice in this matter, I do not know what better phrase one could get than <i>bona fide.</i>  That gives the Stock Exchange Committees complete power to say: &ldquo;This is not a genuine offer; we will not take it.&rdquo;  If they think it is a genuine offer, then they will stand over it.  I realise that Senator Cole's anxiety is also <i>bona fide</i>, but, at the same time, those who are used to this kind of business and who act on Stock Exchange Committees will be the best judges of whether an issue is floated in such a manner that it is reasonably attractive in all circumstances.  I do not know that the Minister could have got a better phrase than this.  Anyway, the whole intention is to see whether we can get people to come in and, since that is the intention, this is a very good scheme.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what has been said by <Col N="557" /> both Senator Hayes and Senator McGuire.  I am quite satisfied&mdash;I raised this matter and I put the first question&mdash;with the Minister's reply in relation to this section.  It seems to me that what the section aims at is to make it look as if we want these new companies (a) to work mainly for export, and (b) to be mainly under Irish control.  In fact, what we really want is to let them come in pretty easily, and not to be as fussy as we used to be, not in fact to insist that they work for export mainly, and not to insist that they be mainly Irish. Consequently, I think the effect of this will be very good, both from the point of view of production and from the point of view of bringing a spirit of competition into various manufacturing circles in Ireland.  If the Minister feels it is necessary to make it look as if we are being extremely fussy, when in fact we do not intend to be so, then I am quite satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add to what I have already said.  We seem to be confused in our discussion of this Bill.  The Minister has told us this is a liberalising Bill.  There are two grounds upon which one can criticise it: either one agrees it is a liberalising Bill, and is not sufficiently liberalising or it should be more restrictive.  My own feeling about the Bill is that, as I said on Second Reading, I do not think the Bill is liberalising enough. The intention is not clear.  The way in which the Bill is drafted does not make it clear to the ordinary businessman or the ordinary legal man what the degree of liberalisation is.</P>
      <P>Senator Cole criticises the method of deciding whether or not people will be allowed to operate.  We are trying to get away from the old 51 per cent. Irish condition of the past and the Minister is quite right in giving a reasonable degree of chance to Irish investors to invest in order to retain the spirit of the old Act, but, if Irish investors do not take up the shares in a reasonable way and reasonably quickly, then other people should be allowed to come in and do what we are not able to do ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> We ought to clarify our minds now as to whether or not we are in favour, first of all, of the liberalisation intended in the Bill.  Do we think it is liberal enough?  Are we against liberalisation?  I am in favour of liberalisation and in some ways I do not think the Bill goes far enough. Consequently, it is not clear enough and on this stage we could, perhaps, clarify the sections and the general drafting in such a way as to make it clear to anyone who wants to operate the conditions under which they can come in and the fact that conditions in future will be more liberal than they have been in the past.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister has been in consultation with the stock exchanges, but certain difficulties may arise in the case of firms which might have difficulty in getting quotations from the Stock Exchange.  I do not know sufficient about the Stock Exchange to go into this matter in any great detail.  There is a possibility that a dispute might arise between a company and the Stock Exchange in relation to obtaining a quotation for its shares.  Has the Minister any procedure in mind through the medium of which such disputes may be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Stock Exchange refuses a quotation and if the company still wants to go ahead, then it must come in under another section.  I recognise that the refusal of a quotation on the Stock Exchange might arise on some ground other than those set out in the section.  It may be thought that the undertaking is not such as to justify the grant of a quotation. There will also be a condition, I think, that there must be a sufficient number of shares to create a market in them.  If a company cannot comply with these conditions, then it has to come in under some other condition. Section 5 sets out <i>seriatim</i> the different conditions under which manufacture can be carried on, and this is just one of the provisions of Section 5.</P>

      <P>My answer to the criticism of sub-paragraph (c) is that the section tends, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said, to limit.  I think <Col N="559" /> it will leave it wide open for anybody to have shares.</P>
      <P>What is the point in sub-section (3) (a) of Section 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the company shall in its application state whether it does or does not claim that it has in respect of that class of shares complied with the condition set out in paragraph of sub-section (2) of this section,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If it does not claim, the application is null and void.</P>

      <P>I shall look into that. I take it that it is intended to make it clear that a company which is engaged in some business to which the Act does not apply can still apply to the Stock Exchange for a quotation for its shares.  It is only in respect of companies which claim the advantages of the section that the Stock Exchange Committee will, in fact, carry out this policeman function for us.  A fun fair, a retail shop or a transport undertaking could also apply to the Stock Exchange for a quotation and it would not have to claim to qualify under this section.  It would not so claim.</P>

      <P>I am quite agreeable. I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any company which carries on a business by way of trade or for the purposes of gain, to carry on any manufacturing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every company which does any act which is a contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100 and, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £50 for <Col N="560" /> every day during which the offence is continued.</P>
    <P>(3)  Section 9 of the Act of 1934 is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to understand this Bill, I found I had to refer to the Act of 1932 and then to the Act of 1934. I have already given my view as to the curious way in which the Bill is drafted, but when I came to Section 5, I found that it purported to amend Section 9 of the Act of 1934, and then at the end of Section 5 of this Bill, I found that almost the whole of Section 9 of the 1934 Act had been repealed. I then looked at the Act of 1934 and tried to write out for my own convenience what was left, and it seemed to me to be very curious; so I first put in an amendment to repeal Section 9 of the Act of 1934, my object being to put everything the Minister had to say about the matter into Section 5 of this Bill.  Then it was pointed out that perhaps that might have some other effects which I did not intend, so therefore I took the method set out in the amendment standing in my name, that is to say, of putting into this Bill Section 9 of the 1934 Act as it will stand when, so to speak, the Minister is finished with it.  It will be a very small, weedy and emasculated affair compared with what it is at present.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Act of 1934 occupies a little more than six pages.  In this Bill, it is proposed to take out more than five pages, and to leave nothing but six lines of the first sub-section and the concluding sub-section, and even that first sub-section is amended.  In order to simplify it, I proposed in an amendment drafted as satisfactorily as I could in the circumstances of a layman to provide that we should insert a new section, and then I added the penalty sub-section which is the last one in Section 9 of the Act of 1934.</P>
    <P>Section 5, as the Minister said, amends Section 9 in quite a number of ways, and it seems to me to make for greater clarity and ease of reading and understanding if we put Section 9 in its new form into this Bill and cut out in this Bill all references to Section 9 of the Act of 1934.  Of course, I quite agree with the Chair that my other <Col N="561" /> amendments dealing with Section 9 of the Act of 1934 are consequential upon this.  It would be much simpler and make it easier for people who are proposing to come in under this if, instead of referring people to the remnant of Section 9 of the Act of 1934, we put that remnant into this Bill and then let the Minister say all that he has to say about Section 9 of 1934 in Section 5 of this Bill, that is to say, take something of this kind such as I am proposing now, and amend Section 5 in the way he pleases after that to get what he wants.  It would be much simpler and therefore I move this amendment.</P>

      <P>I supported Senator Hayes on the Second Stage on this matter and I do so again.  Senator Hayes has told the House that he read Section 5 of this Bill through to find the reference to Section 9 and then at the end found that Section 9 was practically all repealed.  I read it the other way.  I started to read Section 5 of this Bill.  I saw that it referred to Section 9 of the 1934 Act so I got the 1934 Act and waded through Section 9, and later found at the end of Section 5 that Section 9 did not apply at all. You would imagine that that is the way a stranger would probably look at the section.  This is the sort of thing that is general in Bills and I have supported Senator Hayes on this point on other occasions.  They could be far simpler if the amending Act or series of Acts were simply drafted for a person who had to deal with that Act alone.</P>

      <P>When this Bill emerged from the draftsman's office, it was in general accord with the directions which had been given to the draftsman by the Government, but I got it a week or ten days before the Dáil was due to meet and was rather upset by the legal form of it, because I felt that it did not look like the liberalising Bill it was intended to be. I decided, however, not to incur any further delay in getting it redrafted, but to circulate it to the Dáil and to make the changes I desired in the Committee there, which was done.  One of the things that intimidated me was the fact that the parliamentary draftsman following the precedent of the 1934 Act started off the section by saying: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful&rdquo; to do certain things.  I wanted the section to say: &ldquo;It shall be lawful&rdquo; to do all the stated things, and to get it in positive rather than in a negative form.  The recasting of the section was solely for that purpose, to set out in a positive form all the conditions under which manufacturing operations could be carried on, and when I found that change had been made the only thing left of the original Section 9 was the penalty clause, and I decided that, having regard to my main objective, the penalty clause should be left in the original Act instead of transferring it into this Bill.</P>
      <P>I still would urge that upon the House, that in so far as the purpose of the Bill is to indicate that a change of policy is taking place in this regard, with people being encouraged and invited to came in for manufacturing operations, that it is better to have it expressed positively in that way and to keep the penalty clause where it is now rather than bring it in here as evidence that we have sometimes to apply.  I do not see how you could do that without referring again to the 1934 Act.</P>

It is true, as he has said, that there is nothing left of that section except the penalty clause, but I still urge that it is better to leave the penalty clause in Section 9 of the 1934 Act rather than, merely for the sake of tidying up, transferring it here.  I do not see how you can do that either.  Section 9 is in a negative form, and starts off by saying that it shall not be lawful to do things, and if you do you are subject to a penalty.  I wanted the section to appear that it shall be lawful to do things without reference to a penalty, which is there in any event.</P>

I would have preferred him to proffer something of which he himself approved rather than something which he took from the 1934 Act.  We have had no explanation as to why it should be thought necessary that a company already in business for the purposes of trade should be prohibited from carrying on in manufacturing process, and we know that in fact a lot of such companies do exist.  Theoretically, they are two or three companies, one for trade, one for manufacture, one for financing loans and so on, but to all intents and purposes, they are the one company.  There may be some technical reason why it should be necessary to say that no company carrying on business for trade shall carry on a manufacturing process.  That means, if I am correct, that a business already in <Col N="565" /> existence for trade must start a fresh company if it wants to manufacture. Otherwise, it does not seem to me to have any justification.  I am wondering if it is essential.  I had sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, but I am not convinced that this portion of it remains necessary in present circumstances.</P>

      <P>If he did that, he would not have this extraordinary position that there is in this legislation an amended, emasculated, very curious section, remaining in force from the 1934 Act.  I do not see why it should be beyond the capacity of the parliamentary draftsman to do everything the Minister wants to do in Section 5.  The idea that the penalty section should not appear in this Bill because the Minister wants to conceal from somebody the fact that there are penalties here is not up to the Minister's usual standard at all.</P>

I would appeal to him, however, to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister admitted in his own words in introducing this legislation, and other legislation of a similar nature, that the main factor in preventing people from coming into this country to invest money has been the volume and complexity of legislation governing their entry.  That has been the case.  I could not make much of this Bill when it was introduced and I brought it to lawyers and to the heads of trade associations.  They all told me: &ldquo;It is the same thing.  There is <Col N="567" /> very little improvement here.  It is still complex and it is difficult to see what it is all about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes has produced an amendment which he does not say is perfect, which has been taken from the original Act, but I do suggest that the Minister, when he has a look at this again, in view of the fact that there is a genuine belief amongst all of us that this Bill could be improved, should consider redrafting the amendment in a way that would clarify the minds of business people coming in here.  I should like him to have another look at it.  It is not beyond the wit of man to turn any negative phrasing involved into positive phrasing.</P>

He wants to put a positive statement before foreign manufacturers and, under Section 5 as it stands, they know where they stand until they read down to the very last section and then this King Charles' head of the 1934 Act comes in.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept what Senator McGuire says and try to incorporate what Senator Hayes has suggested into the end of Section 5. I think a good draftsman could do that.  I should like to see this amendment of Senator Hayes, which begins with the monstrous statement, &ldquo;It shall not be lawful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

That is a thing which should appeal to the people who are teachers.  It is really a question of the Minister putting away the cane where it will not be seen; people may still know that it is in the teacher's press and may be brought out.

      <P>My aim was to get in one section a positive statement of all the conditions which apply to the carrying on of manufacturing operations. That is in Section 5.  Anybody interested in establishing himself here can look at Section 5 and see, <i>seriatim</i>, the conditions set out, the fulfilment of any one of which entitles him to engage in manufacturing.  It is true that in that section it does not say what happens to the person who tries to carry on without conforming to those conditions.  You cannot do that without putting in another section which would begin &mdash;&ldquo;It shall not be lawful to do this, unless these conditions are complied with.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not want to bring into this Bill an unnecessary section, which will have that intimidating appearance, because the section is in the 1934 Act.  Even though it offends against Senator Hayes's sense of appropriateness in the preparation of legislation, I say it is better to leave it this way.  If anybody comes in here wishing to engage in manufacturing operations, you can say to them: &ldquo;There is a list of conditions; if you meet any one of them, you are free to engage in manufacturing.&rdquo; It is better to have it that way than to have anywhere in the section the phraseeology: &ldquo;You will be liable to penalties unless you do this, that or the other thing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) (b), line 19, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any reasonable extension thereof&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of sub-section (2), Section 5, is a saver for existing companies and enables them, if they are in existence, whether they comply or not with the provisions of Section 5 or the provivsions of Schedule 1, to continue in business but only with such manufacturing processes as they are at present carrying on.  Looking through the 1932 and 1934 Act which I had perforce to read in connection with this Bill, I find in these Acts a similar provision, but in these Acts there were the additional words which I am trying to insert &ldquo;or any reasonable extension thereof.&rdquo;  That is to say that a company now in existence, which is doing a particular line of manufacturing, may continue in that line whether or not they fulfil the conditions of Schedule I to this Act.  I think they should also be allowed to continue in any reasonable extension of that business.  It should be extended to give them the concession we extended to companies existing before 1932 and before the enactment of the 1934 Act.  It seems to me to be analogous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could <Col N="570" /> not agree to that.  The fact we must recognise is that, by reason of defects in the framework of the 1934 Act, a number of companies did, in fact, commence manufacturing operations under circumstances in which it had been intended that they should not be allowed to do so and should be required to obtain a new manufacturing licence. How are we to deal with these companies in the future?  It is quite clear that it is undesirable to apply any retrospective penalties to them.</P>
      <P>My original proposal, when the Bill was circulated to the Dáil, was to give these companies a reasonable period of time in which to bring themselves into conformity with the requirements of the legislation.  Objection was taken to that, reasonable objection, I think, and therefore I presented this amendment that these companies can continue in the future to do any manufacturing process which they are now doing, but they are limited to the process which they are now doing, unless they otherwise come into conformity with the conditions of the Act.  It would be undesirable, having regard to the general aim of the legislation, to go further than that.</P>
      <P>In the cases I have in mind, there is no question of export trade at all; there is no question of adding anything to the industrial organisation of the country.  They are companies under foreign ownership which came into this market solely for the purpose of retaining certain market contacts they had and supplying the Irish market alone with certain products which were being produced by other Irish companies as well.  While I agree they should be allowed to continue, if they want to extend to new business, they must either bring their capital structure into conformity with the legislation or get the necessary permit to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the term &ldquo;reasonable extension&rdquo; has a very doubtful interpretation, and indeed it has been held already that that term in the 1934 Act permitted a company which was engaged only in distribution to commence manufacture.  That would not necessarily apply here, but the fact that that interpretation was put on the section in the 1934 Act creates doubt <Col N="571" /> as to the interpretation which might be put on the phrase in the future.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say to these companies: &ldquo;If you are manufacturing now, you can continue whatever you are manufacturing now, but if you want to extend your operations and enter new fields, you must make the necessary changes to come into conformity with the legislation or come and get the licence which you would require.&rdquo;  It will be appreciated that many of the companies concerned are quite small companies and the amendment of this Bill to exempt companies where the assets used are less than £5,000 in value will put most of them outside the scope of this legislation altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a point for clarification in the interests of persons who may be adversely affected in this connection.  A commodity is defined as follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;commodity&rsquo; includes any article, material or substance, and references to a commodity include references to part of that commodity.&rdquo;  The reference in the sub-section to a particular commodity unduly narrows the freedom of people who are intended to be liberated under this sub-section.  It could be construed possibly, without going against the spirit of the Act, that, if a person was manufacturing, for instance, some very narrow type of textile, owing to this adjective &ldquo;particular&rdquo;, he would be confined under the section.  I would suggest that, if a person is manufacturing some particular type of clothing or something of that kind, he should be allowed to manufacture other types inside the same general category or the same <Col N="572" /> class.  I suggest that the Minister should change &ldquo;a particular commodity&rdquo; to &ldquo;a particular class of commodity&rdquo;, which would not, in my opinion, endanger the purposes he is aiming at in the sub-section.</P>
      <P>On the section generally, there is another point in respect of which I did not put down an amendment, because I prefer to raise it in this way. It is in relation to the date mentioned in the same sub-section, (2) (b): &ldquo;The 1st day of May, 1958, or within one month immediately preceding that date.&rdquo;  May I suggest that that is unduly restrictive?  There may be companies which are seasonal in their manufacturing and would not be manufacturing a commodity on the first day of May or in the month before that date.  There are other companies which only manufacture to order and they might not have had an order during that month.  A month seems to be an extraordinarily narrow period to which to confine them.  If the Minister could consider widening that period it would eliminate these two possible injustices to persons dealing with seasonal production or persons engaged in production for particular contracts or orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point regarding the term &ldquo;particular commodity&rdquo;, I shall look at that.  The word &ldquo;particular&rdquo; in that phrase may be unduly restrictive.  The intention is, of course, that a company which is doing a manufacturing operation now can continue doing that manufacturing operation, and the purpose of the declaration is to ensure that there will be somewhere a record of the companies which under that dispensation are entitled to continue manufacturing operations here.  One can see that, in eight, nine or ten years, there may be difficulty in determining the facts in some such instances, and therefore there is this requirement that there must be a declaration on record now and that this declaration gives that entitlement to continue manufacturing operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know about the question of seasonal manufacturing, but I can look into that also.  However, I should say that if the company is in existence &mdash;<Col N="573" /> and that is the main thing &mdash; at this time for the purpose of this manufacturing operation, it is entitled to remain in existence.  I shall look at the matter to see if there is any need to clarify or modify it in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I would be in order in referring to the First Schedule.  In his speech on the Second Reading, the Minister referred to that. Under Section 5, companies who had evaded the provisions or the intentions of the 1932 and 1934 Acts, will be obliged to comply with them for the future, if they are to engage in manufacturing processes.  I have no strong view as to whether these people should be compelled to comply, but my general view would be that if the law was in a particular condition and people complied with the law, they should not be penalised.  I know the Minister's argument is that they will not be penalised, that they will be able to continue manufacturing but that they will not be able to extend their operations.</P>
      <P>The thing I am disturbed about is this.  The Minister stood out very strongly against Senator Hayes's amendment to Section 5, on the grounds of the psychological effect of having a positive declaration on certain things that would be lawful.  The Bill was amended after it was circulated in order to achieve that psychological effect of positive declaration and to show the liberalisation that was intended.  What I think about the provisions of paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) is that they will have the opposite effect to the general intention of the Minister.  It is quite clear from what has been said already on Section 4 that there are certain ways and means of enabling manufacturers to state that export is a principal object and that a degree of liberalisation will tempt them to establish businesses here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that, as a result of paragraph (d), people will <Col N="574" /> say: &ldquo;We thought we were entitled under the Act of 1958 to do certain things.  We now find that the people who thought they were entitled to do certain things under the Acts of 1932 and 1934 are not able to extend their business.&rdquo;  That may have a dampening effect on prospective manufacturers here.  On the one hand, the Minister may be handing out inducements to foreign manufacturers, but, on the other, he may be preventing people from extending.  I do not know whether or not I am right in this view, but that is the view I take from reading these sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point the Senator has referred to, in so far as these £100 companies, as they are called, are concerned &mdash; companies that were formed in that particular manner in order to engage in production for the home market, even though they were effectively owned outside the country &mdash; their position will be that they can continue in any business they are engaged in now, but if they want to extend they will have to do one of two things: either become qualified companies within the provisions of the First Schedule, that is to say, get in Irish capital to the extent that will qualify them in a <i>bona fide</i> way; or, if they want to remain under effective external ownership, they will have to seek the necessary licence or authority to engage in the new business.  Provided it is a new business and provided the country is gaining something by the extension, in the normal course they would be given that authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose for which these companies were constituted was of a different kind.  The fact is that most of them added nothing whatever to the industrial organisation of the State.  Some one or more Irish companies started manufacturing some commodity here.  At a much later date the foreign company previously supplying the market, realising it had lost its trade, decided to go into the market itself.  Normally it was refused the licence on the basis of the 1934 Act policy, and it then proceeded, nevertheless, by this device to establish <Col N="575" /> a legal right to engage in manufacture.</P>
    <P>The only effect was to upset or sometimes destroy the previously established Irish company.  If they were bringing something new into the State or supplementing an inadequate production or, particularly, contemplating export, they would have had no need to adopt that device at all. The necessary licence would have been given to them without any great argument in 99 cases out of 100.</P>
    <P>They will be in that position in the future.  If the extension they are proposing does in fact add to the industrial capacity of the State, then they will be facilitated.  It would be only where the extension was in fact doing nothing except intensifying competition on the home market against existing Irish firms that the restriction would apply.  Even in that case, the restriction would, perhaps, be less rigorously applied in the case of an existing organisation than in the case of a new organisation of the same kind coming in.  It will be appreciated, as far as Part I of the First Schedule is concerned, that it does not fundamentally alter the definition of a qualified company operating from 1934.  The same shareholding and directorate qualifications will apply.  The only real changes are to deal with certain legal problems which arose during the past 25 years, and which have never been put right until now.  These concern the operations of holding companies and such matters.</P>

Assuming we have no sympathy whatever for these people who evaded the intentions of the 1932 and 1934 Acts, I think the very fact of their now being brought to heel will have an adverse effect on prospective manufacturers who may fear that, if they do certain things which they regard within the law now, by an enactment at some future date, they might be brought to heel.</P>

      <P>As from the day on which this Bill becomes law, anybody can engage in a new manufacturing operation, including those people, provided they conform with the <Col N="578" /> conditions set out.  They are not in any sense put in a different position from anybody else.  The particularly privileged position which they may have established for themselves &mdash; that is, to engage in manufacture here without a licence, even though they were effectively foreign-owned&mdash;will not apply, but this legislation will not interfere with their position.</P>

      <P>It is a privileged position inasmuch as they are effectively foreign-owned, but they are nevertheless manufacturing here without a licence under the Control of Manufactures Act.  One of the aims of this Bill is to prevent that happening in future.  As far as these companies are concerned, they are in the position that, if in future they want to engage in some other business, they will either have to make their capital structure conform to the conditions to which everybody else has to conform or they will have to get a licence as a foreign company.</P>

The Minister is now repairing &mdash; that is his own word &mdash; an omission or breach in the 1934 Act and these people will, therefore, find themselves in a worse position when this Bill is passed than they are in now.  There is no doubt about that.  The only argument the Minister used is that they ought not to be in their present position.</P>

      <P>Sections 12 to 14, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">FIRST SCHEDULE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In Part I, paragraph 3 (1), line 12, to delete the words &ldquo;used in its business&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;owned by the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have had already on Section 5 a few words about the meaning of this First Schedule.  We will be coming to that in general afterwards, but sub-section (3) of the First Schelule exceeds everything else in the Bill in complication. It is the most complicated section I have seen for a very long time.  It provides for the most extraordinary and elaborate calculations. I asked the Minister on the Second Stage as to the meaning of a particular matter and he made no answer, so I have put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Schedule defines the method of calculating the share capital so as to enable a company to qualify.  It provides that the share capital must not be less than half the value of the fixed assets used in its business.  I do not know whether the expression &ldquo;fixed assets used in the business&rdquo; means the assets owned by the company or the assets leased by the company and being used in the business, such as buildings or machinery.  I understand that there are in some cases machinery which cannot be bought but must be leased. If machinery and premises leased are included in the fixed assets used in the business, then the capital will have to be extraordinarily high in order to enable <Col N="583" /> the company to qualify under this section.  For the purpose of getting my mind clear on that in the first instance, I have put down this amendment, and I should like to know what is the meaning of &ldquo;fixed assets used in the business&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It means &ldquo;used in the business&rdquo;, precisely.  That is how this evasion of the conditions of the 1934 Act was brought about.  Companies were formed with a nominal capital of £100 and then proceeded to acquire assets, machinery and plant, valued at several thousand pounds by the process of leasing them from the parent company which had promoted the whole operation.  When we set out to consider what conditions we could impose which would prevent that type of operation in future and ensure that there would be a <i>bona fide</i> industrial organisation which would be a qualified company in accordance with the definition or have the necessary licence or authority to operate, it seemed that the only real test was to relate the value of the fixed assets used in the business with the share capital of the company.  Therefore, the condition proposed here is that a company will not be regarded as qualified unless its share capital is not less than half the fixed assets.</P>
      <P>But when coming to calculate the value of the fixed assets, allowance has to be made, of course, for Government grants under the Industrial Grants Acts or the Undeveloped Areas Act, genuine reserves reinvested in the undertaking, assets purchased under a hire purchase arrangement, and all the other things set out in the Schedule.  The purpose is to ensure that there will be a recognisable relationship between the share capital and the fixed assets used by the company in manufacturing operations carried on by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Assets are regarded as something which the company uses but does not necessarily own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  What is the objection if employment is being given?  Does this mean that the Minister intends now to get after people, who, in his own private judgment, have not been fulfilling the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment is the acid test.  The intervention into the home market of companies which are really branches of external concerns covered up, which had no intention of doing anything in the matter of export trade and whose sole purpose was to hold on to the market even if they put out of business Irish companies that had competed with them and which might at some time develop an export trade, did not increase employment.  It is a question whether they were creating or destroying employment.  In the majority of cases, I know of, the effect of the intervention of these foreign companies was to put people out of employment, not to bring them in.  The effect was to undermine companies that were completely Irish owned and that could have developed at some stage into the export trade.  The result was a diminution in employment rather than an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might not all this apply to an entirely Irish-owned company that had leased premises or machinery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this provision may apply in fact to a completely Irish-owned company, apart from the companies the Minister has in mind.  I am not able from my own experience to say whether in fact they have or have not added to employment. I am at one with the Minister in desiring an addition to the sum of employment, but does this First Schedule, on the face of it, not apply as much to a company which is Irish-owned, <Col N="585" /> say, a company owned by Senator Ó Maoláin and myself, as to any other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should a company of that kind object to this provision? One cannot conceive of a <i>bona fide</i> company with share capital less than half its fixed assets when allowance is made for all the things set out in the Schedule.  In the normal type of business operations, there will be that very obvious relationship between the subscribed capital and the fixed assets employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 7 which seeks to delete paragraph 3 (1) (e), I put it down merely to draw attention to paragraph (e).  Again, I think it is this monstrous Section 9 of the 1934 Act coming in, and I do not know what the section really means at all.  For example, supposing an Irish company got a loan from an English insurance company, that would not be calculated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are trying to deal with the situation of which we have experience, where companies became entitled under strict interpretation of the wording of the 1934 Act to carry on manufacturing operations, even though they were effectively externally-owned and, but for the device they adopted, would have required a licence.  The most usual type of case was the establishment of a company here with a £100 capital, which borrowed the money required to engage in manufacturing and acquire fixed assets, that money being made available by the parent company.  But, in calculating fixed assets in this section you can discount the amount of loans to a company from a qualified Irish source, so that a company could obtain a loan from an Irish company already set up, or from an Irish insurance company, and it would not disqualify itself as a qualified company by reason of having resort to that method of financing its operations.</P>

This whole business, and particularly this paragraph (e) of subsection (3) of the First Schedule, is an astonishing example of legislation by reference.  It is, as Senator McGuire has just said, an effort to get after the people who found a way of getting in, whereas the whole purpose of the Bill, as defined in the Title and in the Minister's speech, is to let people in. The people who have got in are to be circumscribed and hedged around with conditions now, because they got in in a way of which the Minister did not approve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that this Bill will be welcomed by the Members of this House. It is a simple Bill providing for the recruitment of women police, the need for which has been pressed for a good number of years, particularly by organisations of women social workers as desirable in dealing with women offenders and matters affecting children.</P>
      <P>Immediately the Bill becomes law, it is the Government intention that arrangements will be completed for the recruitment of 12 women Gardaí for assignment in the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  After a trial period, if they make good, as I have no doubt they will, further additions will be made to the force and women Gardaí will be assigned to other centres such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, etc.  It is a little bit soon yet to be talking of what may happen in the years ahead but that is our intention if the experimental force of 12 to be recruited this year fulfil satisfactorily the police duties now carried out by the ordinary Gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, I should make it clear, I think, that women Gardaí will be ordinary members of the force substituting for men and their appointment does not mean an increase in the overall strength of the force.  Later on, as their numbers grow, some of them will probably get promotion to higher rank, but in all respects they will remain <Col N="590" /> part of the general police force and not as a separate entity within the force.</P>
    <P>The selection of women for appointment to the new force will be entrusted to the Civil Service Commissioners who will hold a qualifying written examination similar to that prescribed for male candidates.  The first examination will take place in the Autumn.  The final placings of the candidates will be determined by an interview board who will see each qualified candidate and assess their merits giving credit for any special qualifications.  It is also the intention that the candidates selected by the interview board will be required to pass a test in oral Irish before appointment.</P>
    <P>Candidates will have to be at least five feet six inches in height and to be between 20 and 25 years of age.  The pay will range from a minimum of £5 5s. to a maximum of £8 7s. 6d. and rent allowance, amounting to £46 9s. per annum, will be payable in addition. Retirement will be compulsory at 57 years of age, as for men, but a woman Garda may retire voluntarily, with appropriate pension, after 25 years.  This is more favourable than for the men, who have to have completed 30 years service and to have reached the age of 50 before they can retire voluntarily.  The woman Garda will be obliged to retire on marriage, but in that event she will, of course, receive a lump sum to help her on her way, on the same basis as a woman civil servant.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the other House were inclined to suggest that the age limits of 20 to 25 years are too low and that women of more mature years would make more suitable police. However, the expert advice at my disposal is all in favour of recruitment within the age-group mentioned and I do not propose to depart from it, at least in this initial stage.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that this is a development which is long overdue and that nothing but good can come from the assignment of women police to cases concerning women and children particularly where sex offences are involved.  I am sure that the Seanad are no less happy than I am in the <Col N="591" /> promotion of an enactment of this character and I confidently recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Minister that this is a most welcome Bill.  After the complicated measure we have been discussing for more than two hours, it is also a very simple Bill.  Simple as it is, it has taken a very long time to come.  I have always been in favour of such a Bill and I remember a long time ago in University College, Miss Mary Hayden was continually bombarding the Irish members of the British Parliament about the addition of women police to the old Dublin Metropolitan Police. She was absolutely right and this is a very desirable measure.</P>
      <P>It is worth remarking that the first movement in Europe which I know of which gave complete equality to women with men, without arguing about the principle at all, was the Gaelic League, which was established 65 years ago. That applies also to the Sinn Féin movement.  It is rather extraordinary that we have waited until now to establish such a force.  There is no doubt at all that in present conditions, or in any conditions, there should be women police.  That is not merely because they are more gentle, or more knowledgeable in certain ways than men, but rather because in a great many instances women are much less gullible, and are more penetrating and swifter-thinking than men.</P>
      <P>Nothing but good can come from the idea which the Minister has put forward. Like the members of the other House, I did think not so much that 20 was too low an age but that 25 was too low.  However, I take it that the expert advice which the Minister has received shows that in other cases where women police were recruited, this is the appropriate age group.  He is probably right in following that advice.  This Bill is merely an experimental Bill and when he has recruited some women, he can make up his mind what he wants to do in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision that on retirement they may retire with an appropriate pension is very sound.  I think also the provision that women get a marriage <Col N="592" /> gratuity on the same lines as in the Civil Service is also very good.  I hope the Civil Service Commission, when appointing these women, will have women on the board.  I myself would prefer married women on such boards. That is, of course, a matter of detail. I welcome the Bill and wish it well and I hope that the experiment will be extended to other places outside Dublin, but it is quite a good idea to begin in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my welcome to this Bill for the setting up of a women's police force.  It is a wise and much-needed measure and the Minister deserves our thanks for having introduced it.  As time goes on, I have no doubt the value of the force will manifest itself clearly and I am sure there will be requests for its extension outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>The call for the recruitment of women police in this country is not a recent one and over the years the need for such a force has increased, particularly for cases involving women and young persons, especially young girls. In other countries, where women have been a normal part of the police force for years, their work is highly valued in dealing with certain types of lawbreakers as well as in the detection of crime.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the recruitment ages, I feel, like the members in the other House, that the limits are too low &mdash; 20 years of age is rather young to begin and 25 too young to close recruitment: I would rather have seen the ages as 25 and 35 but the Minister has indicated he will look at this point later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the women police recruits will be given general police training and may be required to do police duties which women would be capable of doing.  He also mentioned, in the Dáil, that it was the view of the Carrigan Committee that while the duties of the policewomen would primarily be concerned with matters affecting children and young women and girls, they should be given wide experience and should, as far as possible, be employed on the same duties as their male colleagues.  The <Col N="593" /> Minister then said: &ldquo;We are, in effect, adopting the recommendations contained in the report of that committee.&rdquo; From this, it would appear that the new force will do largely the same work and bear the same risks as their men colleagues and I think it would be appropriate here to ask the Minister to apply, after the training and probationary period, the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
    <P>I do not know what training in psychology is given to the Garda Síochána but I would suggest to the Minister, if it is not already his plan to do so, that the recruits to this new force should be given special psychiatric training and particularly training in child guidance for which latter study there exist ample facilities in at least one clinic in Dublin where the student police women could attend for lectures and demonstrations.</P>
    <P>There is a very wide field in police work for adequately trained women, and, as experience is gained and recruitment extended, it will be found that the opening of the ranks to the women has had a good effect on young people.  Having experienced the sympathetic, understanding approach of properly trained policewomen, they will most likely turn to them for advice and guidance which will keep them on the right path in life.  I have always felt that if children could be taught to look upon the police as their friends and guardians, and not as a force for exacting punishment on all occasions, many juveniles would be saved from developing into undesirable citizens. I am convinced that this women's police force will manifest its value and that its work will show in a lessening of the number of young offenders coming before the courts.</P>
    <P>Mention was made in the Dáil that the street work of the women police would cease at 8 p.m.  I think it would be a mistake to make this regulation and to withdraw the women members from street duty at such an early hour. I realise that late street work could only be undertaken after the policewomen had been fully trained and had gained experience perhaps by working in partnership with a male Garda for a specified period, but 8 p.m. is too <Col N="594" /> early an hour to close the street duty of policewomen.</P>
    <P>Apart from the more obvious offenders who appear at dusk or in darkness, many children unfortunately roam the streets unaccompanied up to a very much later hour than 8 p.m. and many young girls attending cinema performances and dances start a long walk home at 10.30 p.m. or later.  If such an early ending of duty is contempleted, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the point.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn that the Minister is continuing in their employment the women police assistants who, working in co-operation with the ordinary Gardaí, have rendered valuable services to the force over many years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the members who have pressed for the provision of a smart, serviceable and distinctive uniform for the women police and great care should be taken to produce an outfit that will indicate and inspire respect for the vocation and authority of the wearer.  It is a most important matter that from their first appearance the new force should be well and appropriately uniformed because any opportunity for levity or ridicule about the uniform would have a devastating effect on the self-confidence of, and respect for, the new force.</P>
    <P>It is, I am sure unnecessary to emphasise that the materials used for the entire outfit, from cap to shoes, should be exclusively Irish manufacture and that the design should be that of an Irish designer.  If time permitted, designs might be asked from the tailoring trade sections of the various vocational schools throughout the country and perhaps a prize offered for the accepted design.  Our craftsmen can produce the materials and there are competent Irish hands to make the uniform.  We do a lot of advertising for Irish goods and I feel we should fit our Irish women police in a manner that will exhibit just how good are our Irish materials and workmanship.</P>
    <P>Tourist guide books could direct attention to the uniform of the Irish policewomen, stressing its wearing qualities and its eye-appeal.  This <Col N="595" /> would serve a two-fold purpose &mdash; to advertise Irish materials and Irish workmanship and, by impressing on the policewomen that their uniforms are under constant observation from visitors and others, to ensure a smart, well-groomed force.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I repeat our welcome to the Bill and our hope that before long the work performed by the women members of our police force will result in its extension to other areas with, as a result, fewer juvenile delinquents and better citizenship all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my support to those who welcomed the Bill.  I agree with Senator Hayes when he says it is long overdue, but I am a bit puzzled at his suggestion that he has no idea why it was so delayed.  He probably remembers as well as I do that under the Coalition Government questions were put down again and again, and the Minister said: &ldquo;The matter is still &lsquo;under consideration&rsquo;&rdquo;.  It came to the point when one of the Coalition supporters, a Labour Deputy, in exasperation said that if the Minister was not careful he would no longer be the Minister when the Bill was brought in. That in fact has come to pass.  Senator Hayes ought to be in a position to know what it was that so terrified the Coalition out of bringing in this admirable measure.  The present Government and the Minister are to be congratulated on having the courage apparently necessary &mdash; although I do not see why it required so much courage &mdash; to bring in this excellent measure.</P>
      <P>This is a civilised Bill and indicates that we as a nation are beginning to grow up.  Previously, we have been terrified by this kind of thing.  We hide our fears behind jokes about women police, and our attitude has been childish.  I hope the &ldquo;juvenile delinquents&rdquo; among our adult population will also benefit by the introduction of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure of success achieved will depend to a great extent upon the pay and the conditions offered.  I am afraid <Col N="596" /> the pay being offered is insufficient. The sum of 5 gns. a week during the training period may seem all right, but the grand maximum of £8 7s. 6d. for the fully trained woman police officer does not seem to me to be high enough, and I think the Minister will have to reconsider that at an early date.  Admittedly an allowance is added to that, presumably a uniform allowance, of nearly £1 a week, but I still consider that to make too low a maximum figure.</P>
    <P>On the question of conditions, I should like also to express the hope that the Irish language condition of service will not be pressed too severely. Seeing that for the appointment to other branches of the Civil Service, the Irish language qualification is considered necessary, it would be invidious to disregard it altogether in this new recruitment.  However, we ought to remember that many of us would be excluded from the Oireachtas were such a test to be applied to us.  Therefore I suggest that the Irish test should not be held at too high a level, lest women recruits of very high qualifications be excluded on grounds not immediately connected with the majority of the duties that will have to be performed.</P>
    <P>Linked with the question of pay is the question of conditions.  It is impossible for the Minister now to go into any detail about conditions of service, but on a previous occasion when we are dealing with the Bill to grant the Minister the right to hold prisoners in Civic Guard barracks for a maximum of more than five days, I took the opportunity of going around and seeing for myself the material conditions obtaining in some of these Civic Guard barracks, the Bridewell, Store Street, Pearse Street, Terenure and Rathmines.</P>
    <P>I think the new women recruits are in for a considerable shock when they see the conditions of squalor which our ordinary Civic Guards are expected to put up with.  The Civic Guards have a lot to do, and they do it well. I feel, however, that they have been too patient in regard to certain things. <Col N="597" /> My hope is that the women police will not be so patient, and will indicate to those concerned that the conditions under which the Civic Guards are expected to live, and have their meals, are not such as should be tolerated in the police force of a civilised country.</P>
    <P>I have seen dining-rooms and kitchens &mdash; I will not name any specific barracks as being extraordinarily bad &mdash; in which the conditions are not such as would make any member of the Oireachtas proud to see them tomorrow. My hope will be that the influence of the women guards on such things will be as beneficial as it will be upon our more juvenile delinquents. I am convinced that if in relation to conditions and pay we treat these women well, they will make a splendid addition to our Garda Síochána Force.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to training. I would hope that the opportunity will be taken to allow these women to get some of their training outside this country either in Britain or in some of the continental countries where women police have been operating for some years.  The British Women's Police Force is an admirable one, and I hope we shall not be ashamed to learn from them, when we are taking this first very valuable step.</P>
    <P>I was pleased Senator Hayes paid tribute to the work of the late Professor Mary Hayden.  Many of the women associated with her, and with the various Irish women's movements concerned would feel proud to-day, were they here, that an Irish Government has, even at this late date, introduced this measure.  We should not fail to mention the long and persistent work done by the Joint Committee of Women's Societies here in Dublin. They have shown almost infinite patience and understanding of the problem, and also very great persistence in trying to see that this very valuable measure would at last be put on the Statute Book.  I, therefore, conclude by congratulating the Government and the Minister, and by saying that I think he, they and we can feel justifiably proud of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this measure as <Col N="598" /> a very interesting experiment, an experiment on which we should have embarked years ago.  But it is better late than never.  I believe it will be a great success and will be of great assistance in dealing with certain cases which arise from time to time.  One of the faults I have to find with it is that it is being confined to Dublin.  It should be tried out somewhere else as well.  I should like to see it tried in every city, but at least it should also be tried in Cork.  It would cost very little more to train 24 girls instead of 12.  As the Minister told us, they are replacing Gardaí in the ordinary way and there would not be any extra cost.</P>
      <P>I am a bit doubtful about the age. I think it is a bit too low.  There may be some difficulty with such a low age limit.  You may not be able to get the proper type of girl.  I hope the expert advice the Minister mentioned is correct but I would fix the age limit a bit higher.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this measure.  We know such measures have been successful in other countries and I am sure that in a few years' time we will be able to look back on the success of the scheme here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is starting out with a completely new idea and I would urge him not to recruit fully his 12 members at the start.  Instead, he should accept a larger force for a long probationary period.  I am sure he will have a lot of applicants, and that will provide him with a golden opportunity of selecting a very fine force from the beginning.  I would urge him, even after recruitment, interviews and whatever tests there may be, not to make them fully-fledged members of the force for at least a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no experience here.  It will take some experience to train these young girls and to see how they will behave themselves, as it were, under fire.  The Minister should consider recruiting temporarily a larger force for the first year's training and then weed them out.  I take it the force will have ranks the same as in the ordinary Guards?  There will be sergeants and possibly higher ranks.  It will be only after long experience that it will be <Col N="599" /> seen which of the 12 can be picked out for superior rank.</P>
    <P>These girls will be under 25 years of age.  I take it that one or two of them will eventually gain higher rank and I think the Minister should put in a saving clause empowering him to recruit someone who might offer herself, having had experience in some other police force or in some capacity here which would make her an asset to the force. She might have the experience which would qualify her to become the leader of the force.  There should be at least one superior officer who would not alone control the force, but would act as a link between the women and the men.  I take it the Minister visualises the growth of the force and its spread to other cities and towns. From that point of view, he should recruit as many as possible at the start and provide for the appointment of a superior officer, an experienced woman officer, either in our own police force or in some other police force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Speakers here to-day have expressed very pious hopes in regard to it.  They have spoken of it as if it were born out of the mind of the Minister.  The truth is that this Bill was born as the result of very untimely and, in my opinion, very undignified agitation in Dublin in 1955 and 1956 &mdash; a period in which the agitators would have been better occupied in doing something worth while for the country.  At the time, we had an extreme balance of payments situation and were in the throes of the greatest economic crisis the nation has ever known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of helping the Government &mdash; let us forget which Government it was &mdash; these people, whom I describe simply and solely as crackpots, were agitating to stop the export of horses, No. 1, and for a women's police force, No. 2.  Now, let us be truthful, honest and fair.  Those are the facts.  I do not for a moment suggest that a bunch of crackpots cannot put up an excellent case &mdash; in my opinion, they did &mdash; but, at the same time, I am not hypocrite enough to come in here to-day and say this Bill is an excellent step, that it is <Col N="600" /> something that should have happened 20 years ago; that it is wonderful and that we must congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that, away back in 1956, the Cabinet were involved in much more serious considerations than the establishment of a women's police force.  In one constituency at least, these two issues were used to very good effect in a certain way.  Then a new Minister arrived and, in his wisdom, decided to bring in the necessary legislation &mdash; to make the mess of pottage and found the women's police force.</P>
    <P>Now, having said all that, I agree that this force should be established. At the same time, I think these things should be said.  This Assembly should not be a sanctum in which one's mind should never be spoken and in which everything that is all right is said and heard and everything that is wrong is forgotten.  We would not be deserving of our positions as Senators if we did not occasionally say what we thought.</P>
    <P>Having disposed of the origin of the force, I am nauseated by this business of an oral Irish test.  All things being equal, I would give the first position to the candidate who can speak Irish. Is it not a mockery to think that of all those who sit here more than 50 per cent, cannot speak Irish?  Thanks to Providence, I was young enough to have the advantage of learning Irish at school and I can speak Irish.  More than 50 per cent. of those who sit here cannot.  Yet, we take it upon ourselves to make provisions which might have the result of excluding the best.  If we think so little of it, why do we make these binding provisions on others? Let us, by all means, give ten or 20 extra marks for facility in speaking Irish.  Let us put up the jumps and let the girls take them.  But do not exclude people because they cannot pass a test in oral Irish.</P>
    <P>This force should have been established long ago.  Do not think that because I spoke as I did at the outset and said what I thought about its birth that I wish to hinder its establishment in any way.  Like other speakers, I think the Minister has not gone far enough with regard to the pay provisions <Col N="601" /> and with regard to promotion. I agree with Senator Cole on that point.  I am not, however, smug enough or hypocrite enough to allow the Bill to pass without saying what I think.</P>

      <P>It would be a very great pity if the House took Senator Donegan's remarks as the ultimate truth to be expressed on the origins of this force.  It would be most regrettable if they were accepted as fact.  The Senator's ebullient enthusiasm for his Party has led him to falsify history in a very marked way.</P>
      <P>The fact is that this force is partly the result, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has pointed out, of the devoted and very prudent efforts of women, and of men who supported women's rights, over the last 30 or 40 years.  It is not simply the result of an agitation in 1956, and it is utterly absurd to suggest anything of the kind.</P>
      <P>There is, too, the practical point that this is the Minister who has introduced this Bill.  I shall not go into any reasons as to why other Ministers did not do so.  But we are grateful to him and to the present Government for taking this desirable step and we regret that previous Ministers and former Governments did not take this desirable step.</P>
      <P>This Bill, together with the recent decision to allow married women to continue as primary teachers, seems to me to indicate something like what we were talking about earlier this afternoon &mdash; a liberalising tendency.  There seems to be some desire in this country to narrow such &ldquo;liberalising&rdquo; to matters of commerce and economics.  I think this is an example of the right kind of liberalisation, and the Minister, and those who have been working for so long outside Leinster House, deserve considerable praise for this success.  I hope we shall have other developments of this kind.</P>
      <P>I think this Bill had some hidden prejudices to overcome in various quarters.  I am glad those prejudices have been overcome and I hope that, where similar prejudices hold back other intentions of this kind or character, they will be equally successfully overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> As a practical matter, I should like to support Senator Miss Davidson's plea for equal pay for equal work.  If these women do as much work as the men, then they should get equal pay. It will discourage them if they do not. Their task will be a difficult one, and they need all the encouragement we can give them.</P>
    <P>I was also very glad to hear Senator Miss Davidson's plea for a really smart and effective uniform.  It is not a small thing.  It is the kind of thing that a completely male Assembly would be inclined to overlook.  But it will be a matter of great importance both for the morale of the women police themselves and for the prestige of the force amongst our own citizens and amongst visitors.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, though perhaps a feminine Minister might be more disposed to take trouble in this matter, to spend a good deal of time and trouble over the uniform.  It will be a very great help.</P>
    <P>Finally, having, I hope, disposed of Senator Donegan's theory about the origins of this force, I should like to end by once again congratulating the Minister and those who helped him to come to this decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail myself of the opportunity of joining in the welcome to this Bill so ably and so nicely expressed by most of the Senators who spoke here to-day. It is a source of considerable satisfaction to me that this Bill has at last been introduced, because although we were one of the first countries in Europe in the days of the Gaelic League and Sinn Féin to accord equal rights and status to women, we have, I am afraid, lagged a long way behind in the years that have passed since those days.  We have lagged behind, not because of lack of legislation in many respects but because there appeared to be, and still is, a very serious anti-feminist bias in our people and in many of our public movements and organisations.</P>
      <P>I, therefore, see in this Bill a further step towards according to women the full rights which are their due and a further step in educating our people into a realisation that the clock has gone around very swiftly since that Derby day many years ago when a suffragette drew public attention to the claims of women to the vote on the racecourse on Epsom Downs.  In recent years, we have all seen, in most countries of Europe, women taking their full part not alone in the factories but on the battle fields, on the war fronts and we have seen across the water, in our neighbouring island, schoolgirls, young women playing a most notable part in the defence of that island against air attack and the possibilities of invasion.  They relieved the men and thereby provided manpower for the British forces in their life and death battle in the Second World War.  They played a most creditable part in every country in Europe which was involved in the war and in the Far East, too.</P>
      <P>It is very pleasing to me personally, because I am a convinced believer in equal rights and opportunities for women, that we are to accord to them, in regard to one important public service, the right which they have been denied up to the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators here have spoken of the age limits in this Bill and have spoken as though nothing had happened <Col N="605" /> in the world in the past 20 years. They said the age of 20, or even 25, was too young.  They seem to forget that the women of this country in the days of the War for Independence, wherever they were called on to do so, or wherever they got the opportunity of doing so, played as good a part as did the men and showed no less competence and courage in dealing with the situations as they arose.  I have no doubt whatever that they will be quite capable of providing for our police force recruits and eventually trained women Gardaí of whom this nation can be proud.</P>
    <P>As I say, I regard this as a most important step forward, because we have to a certain extent to kill the anti-feminist bias which still exists.  I look forward to the day when we will have in our Government women Cabinet Ministers.  Every piece of legislation of this nature which accords women equal rights with men is a step forward towards an enlightened democracy in which all citizens will not alone be expected to accept responsibility but will be accorded the right to accept responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with Senator Cole in his suggestion that these Gardaí should be recruited on a temporary basis.  If I understood him rightly, he suggested that they should be kept on for six months and then, if found unsuitable, they should be let go.  I do not think he would make a similar suggestion in the case of men and I object to the discrimination which would be exercised in that way, if this new membership of the Garda Síochána were to be treated as suggested.</P>
    <P>I have to disagree, too, with Senator Sheehy Skeffington in his belief that the insistence upon an oral Irish test for recruits might lose us valuable material.  The age limits are from 20 to 25 and any girl of 20 at the present moment in this country who is not able to pass the moderate oral Irish test which is asked for in a public examination certainly, in my opinion, would not furnish the proper material for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that must be <Col N="606" /> said and it is time it were said.  I do not see for a moment why we should continue to tolerate the idea that Irish speakers must put up with English speaking officials.  If Irish speakers form part of this country and they do &mdash;and, please God, they will continue to do so in ever increasing numbers&mdash; they are as much entitled to get their business done through Irish and to have questions answered for them in Irish as the English speakers.  It is only right and proper that in every branch of the public service the officials should be competent to answer a question of an Irish-speaking citizen in the language in which it is addressed to him.  I have no doubt whatever that material will be found amongst those girls who have a competent knowledge of the language and who will possess the other qualifications that may be decided upon for membership of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>There was one unpleasant note struck in an otherwise very fine debate. It was struck by Senator Donegan whose remarks, in my opinion, were very correctly characterised by Senator Stanford when he said that Senator Donegan had falsified history in a very marked degree.  I personally protest in the strongest possible manner against the statement that this Bill was born as a result of untimely and undignified agitation in Dublin in 1955 or 1956 by a bunch of crackpots.  The ladies who formed the committee in Dublin and in other centres in Ireland, not in 1955 or 1956 but for many years before that, from the day Countess Markievicz was elected as the first M.P. to Parliament in these islands to get equal rights for women, were no crackpots.  They gave unselfish public service to bring to the notice of the people and the Government a want in our administration which they thought required to be filled.  It is most improper and undignified for any member of this House to use such an insulting term in regard to the committee which was urging the Government of the day to implement the proposal for a women's police force here.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan went a little further than that, however.  He made some veiled reference to the use in a <Col N="607" /> certain constituency in a certain manner of something connected with the women's police force.  He left it to be inferred that there was something &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; or &ldquo;hookey&rdquo; about the whole proposal.  I sincerely hope that if Senator Donegan cannot control his impulse to avail of every opportunity to make political capital or political speeches, at least he will endeavour on a Bill of this nature to apply himself to the splendid idea which the Bill embodies and leave out of the reckoning other questions which can be better dealt with on the many other measures of a political nature which come before this House.</P>
    <P>He also said in regard to the oral Irish test that he was nauseated by it. He is one of the people who criticise what he describes as the failure to make progress in the revival of Irish as a spoken language.  He is a young man.  He admits to a knowledge of the Irish language, and on every opportunity he avails himself of the chance to sneer at it and to ridicule it in public.</P>

It does not matter who introduced it or what Government introduced it, but I am very pleased it is the Fianna Fáil Government and that it fell to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Traynor, to do so.  It is a great step forward. It is particularly pleasing to me personally, having listened to Senator Donegan's remarks, to remember what a far cry it is from those days 21 years ago, when the Constitution was being put before the people, when people <Col N="608" /> like Senator Donegan were telling us that if it were passed women would be driven out of all public appointments and not entitled to work.</P>

      <P>I am naturally very glad and happy at the reception given to this Bill not alone in this House, but also in the Dáil upon the occasion of its introduction there.  It received the same acclamation there as here.  My pleasure at the manner in which it was received here was accentuated by reason of the fact that I am personally acquainted with the long and hard struggle which the women's societies referred to by Senators had in order to bring about this discussion.  The Bill itself is now almost an accomplished fact.</P>
      <P>I claim no recognition, good, bad or indifferent, for introducing the Bill. I am very happy to have been the instrument which brought it about.  The only thing I can claim is that from the beginning I was sympathetically disposed towards it.  I urged my colleagues in the Government to permit me to bring in this Bill and I am happy to be in the position I am in this evening of being able to say that the Bill, as I mentioned a moment ago, is almost an accomplished fact.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ó Maoláin, I feel that the women will succeed in making this force all that everyone of us here would wish it to be.  I have sufficient faith in the ability of women to carry out as effectively as men any task imposed upon them.  Therefore, I have no doubt that this experiment, which is all that this can be described as at the moment, will succeed.  I know I am expressing the belief of my colleagues in this House and in the House below when I say that the experiment will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes said that he hoped there would be a woman on the interview board.  It is my hope also.  That <Col N="609" /> will be a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners.  I have no doubt that they will take into account that the selection of women police is a matter in which women selectors would be particularly suitable.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson and other Senators expressed the desire that the women should receive equal pay with the male Gardaí.  There again I could say that I would be quite prepared to support that eventually but the position is that we have not yet reached that happy stage where equal pay for women and men has been accepted generally in the State.  It is something that will, perhaps, be achieved in time.  I have no doubt that if the same tenacity as the ladies displayed in respect of this Bill is displayed in respect of the right of women to receive equal pay, it will in course of time be successful.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not misinterpreting Senator Miss Davidson when I say that she thought that women should not be employed after 8 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my impression. Perhaps the most valuable work that a woman police force could participate in is work after that hour and if women are to be equal in pay, equal in other rights, they will have to be prepared to take equal risks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as Senators will notice, is a one clause Bill, which merely gives the State the right to recruit <Col N="610" /> women.  That is all that is contained in the Bill.  Everything else is governed by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations can be introduced to deal with any difficulties that arise or that should be dealt with from one point of view or another.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the uniform.  Everybody will be concerned about the cut and type of uniform.  It is my opinion and I am sure that of all members of the House that if the women Garda feel that they are well dressed, they will feel more efficient and more competent to do the type of work they are undertaking.  Already, there have been some experiments which have been unsuccessful so far. The types of uniform modelled have not been considered acceptable.  We are actually dealing with that matter. We have inspected the uniforms of a number of women police forces and we want to improve upon them, if possible. I think we will eventually improve on the uniforms at present worn in other forces.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to deal with Senator Sheehy Skeffington's remarks on the question of the language as they have been dealt with so ably by Senator Ó Maoláin.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington also said that he was not happy about the pay.  It is a good wage at the present time for a young woman who is not doing too badly with a wage of £7 10s. or so. There is nothing final about that.  In the course of time, I have no doubt that the pay will be increased, just as I hope that the same will apply to the male members of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very responsible work but, as I said in the beginning, we are in the experimental stage and will have to bear with a lot of petty difficulties until such time as we have established the force to such a degree that we can say that from our experience the wage is not sufficient and should be increased.  At the same time, <Col N="611" /> £8 7s. 6d., which is the maximum, is not a bad wage but there is nothing final about it.  It can be increased.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I visited a number of police barracks in the city.  I made a tour of quite a large number.  Like the Senator, I was very far from happy about what I saw.  I want, first of all, to disabuse the Senator of his fears that these ladies will be living in these barracks. They will not.  They will be living outside in their own homes or, like many business girls, in &ldquo;digs&rdquo; or hostels, or wherever they wish and in respect of which they will receive a lodging allowance.  I have already taken what I consider are appropriate steps to try to have the conditions in barracks altered and improved and have already mentioned the fact to the members of the Government in council.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also suggested that we should provide for training outside the country.  That possibility could be considered.  I have no doubt that it has been considered already.  It is something that probably will be adopted at a later stage, just as the Army officers are sent out on courses to various countries, not necessarily one or two countries, but wherever they can get the desired type of training. It does not matter whether they find it in England, France or America, wherever they get the type of training they need, that is where they will go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will always be in a position to learn wherever we can get the best training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators expressed the fear that the ages fixed are too low.  These <Col N="612" /> ages were fixed after long consideration at a conference of senior officers. It is believed the ages fixed are those at which recruits are most alert in mind &mdash; the candidates will not be long out of school.  They will be most impressionable and will be able to accept the type of training they will get and generally they will be more adaptable than if we were to go beyond the present age limits.  We must always remember that this is an experiment, one which I hope will succeed, but still an experiment, and in the course of time we shall see the weaknesses and the strength of it and profit by the knowledge we gain.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Cole who referred to the desirablity of having a probationary period.  There is such a period at present in the Garda Síochána.  After recruitment, a young Garda is trained and sent out and he has to do a period of two years during which, if he is found unsuitable and not of the type to make an efficient Garda, his services can be dispensed with.  The same regulation will apply to the women police force.  If it is found that anyone is unlikely to make a suitable policewoman, she will be notified in due course during her probationary period to that effect.</P>
    <P>The Irish language question has been ably dealt with by Senator Ó Maoláin, but the fact is that this State has now been 36 years in being.  The girls we are bringing in between the ages of 20 and 25 were born between 1933 and 1938 and to those of us who are pretty well advanced, those years are only a stone's throw away.  Surely those girls who were brought up in schools where the Irish language was taught them as part of the curriculum will have a sufficient knowledge of Irish to pass a simple written test and an oral test.  I believe it is absolutely necessary to have such a test to ensure that a young girl or man in the Garda Síochána should be capable of answering questions in Irish, especially when they are asked by people coming in from outside.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable fact that there are more American people coming in here than we might believe who can <Col N="613" /> talk Irish and these people love to demonstrate that they know Irish by putting questions in Irish to those they meet.  We have found that to be the case from experience and I think it would redound to the credit of the country if our women police are capable of answering questions of that kind efficiently.  I do not think anybody can say there is anything wrong in such a requirement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say how grateful I am for the remarks which have been made on all sides of the House.

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said in relation to equal pay, he has indicated the general position that we have not yet reached the stage here where we recognise that equal pay should be given to men and women doing the same work.  I think progress along that line has been made in the public services in Great Britain. But, as Senators pointed out, the work of the women Gardaí will be very onerous in the physical sense and equally so in the sense that it will involve a degree of responsibility.  They will be doing practically the same kind of work as male police officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in certain branches of the public service, if the Minister examines the position, he will find that if men and women are doing exactly the same work in a particular vocation, they are paid at the same rate.  I am going on recollection, but I think the Minister will find that happens in the broadcasting service, if I am not mistaken.  I believe women are paid at the same rate as men, for the reason that it takes a woman to do a woman's part in a <Col N="614" /> play, as it takes a man to do a man's part.</P>
    <P>In regard to the police force, the very intention in establishing it sprang from the desirability that women should do a particular type of duty and it seems to me if I am right in my recollection &mdash; and I speak subject to correction &mdash; that if this is so, there is a case here where the Minister could pay equal rates for men and women without prejudice to the general policy.  I would suggest that this matter should be looked into.</P>

      <P>Nothing at all.  We are recruiting men and women on the same basis.  Women will be entitled to all promotions available just as men are but, of course, because of the very small number of women it will probably be a considerable time before any of them are in the happy position of reaching the higher posts.  I want to do everything possible to see that the nucleus we start with will be extended to the various places I mentioned in my remarks, namely, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  Actually, I agree with Deputy Colley when he said that he thought the experiment would have been more suitable, if it had been carried out in Cork rather than in Dublin.  I agree, because of the compact nature of the population in Cork which is only about 80,000 or 90,000 as against our 500,000.  In that respect, it <Col N="615" /> might have been better to have carried out the experiment in the southern capital.  I hope it will not be long anyhow, until we have these other counties manned.  It would probably have been just as easy to have given training to 24 as, say, to 12.  However, Senators know the difficulties Ministers are up against.</P>

    <Title>Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1958&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in the Dáil, the main reason for the introduction of this Bill is to empower county councils to increase, where they so desire, the contribution which may be paid by them to county committees of agriculture beyond the present maximum which is equivalent to a rate of 10d. in the £ in rural areas.</P>
      <P>As the House is probably aware, these committees of agriculture have their statutory basis in the Agricultural Act, 1931, and that Act prescribes that the county councils should contribute to their support on the basis of a minimum rate of 2d. in the £ and a maximum rate of 3d. in the £ for agricultural schemes.  A rate of a ½d. in the £ was fixed as the maximum contribution for forestry schemes. Since then the educational activities, as well as staff costs have risen considerably for each committee and the maximum rate of contribution by county councils has had to be increased progressively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last increase &mdash; to 10d. in the £ &mdash; was authorised by the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1955.  In addition to the county council contributions the State pays an annual grant to each committee.  This grant forms part of the annual Estimate of the Department <Col N="616" /> of Agriculture.  Its sum total is roughly equivalent to the total of the contributions paid by county councils although in distribution the poor counties get some preference.</P>
    <P>The continued increase in salaries and other expenses as well as the increasing number of instructors employed by the committees will soon make it necessary for some committees to seek a contribution greater than that at present allowed under the 1955 Act.  The present Bill therefore increases the maximum permissive contribution to the equivalent of 15 times the produce of a rate of 1d. in the £ in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress, however, that this provision merely permits the councils to increase their maximum contributions where they consider that such an increase is justified.  It does not compel any council to do so.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill has given rise to some misunderstanding. This section relates to the making of a contribution by county councils of not more than half the produce of 1d. rate to committees of agriculture in respect of whose counties the Minister for Agriculture has made a Forestry Scheme Order.  Except for a change in phraseology necessary to bring the Agriculture Acts into line with Local Government Legislation, this sub-section makes no actual change in the position under the 1931 Act of committees of agriculture <i>vis-a-vis</i> forestry schemes.</P>
    <P>The 1931 Act provides that a Forestry Scheme Order may be made only where as a result of the joint representation of the county council and the committee of agriculture for the county concerned, the Minister for Agriculture considers it desirable that steps should be taken to preserve existing woods standing in such county.  In fact no Forestry Scheme Order has been made in respect of any county, nor is any such Order in contemplation.</P>
    <P>Advantage is being taken of this Bill to accede to requests made by committees of agriculture that they should be put on a par with other local bodies such as vocational education committees and county councils by being made <Col N="617" /> bodies corporate with the rights usual to such bodies.  The Bill also provides for certain other matters relating to salaries and allowances payable to officers of committees of agriculture and travelling and subsistence allowances to members of such committees.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are simply amendments of existing legislation consequential on the foregoing provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement has clarified the situation in a way that one could not gather from the Bill as it is drawn.  I confess I think there was a good deal of misunderstanding about sub-section (2) of Section 2.  It appeared to many that county committees of agriculture would have to carry certain responsibilities with regard to afforestation schemes and some of us had grave doubts about the wisdom of such a policy.  However, we gather from the Minister's statement that it is only in those cases where a joint demand is made by the committees of agriculture and the county council that this section will operate.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points in the Bill on which I am not quite clear.  We read, for instance: &ldquo;The council of a county shall, in the local financial year ... and every subsequent local financial year,...&rdquo;.  The Minister can enlighten us.  I take it the requisition ought to come from the county committee of agriculture, or does it?  Where does the thing start?</P>
      <P>This Bill is rather a different measure from the kind of measure under which the vocational committees operate. With the vocational committees, there is a sub-committee of the vocational committee which will meet, I think, in the month of November.  The members of the county council who are members of the vocational committee will make the rate and the vocational committee will make its demand on the county council and the county council has not anything to say to it.  In that respect, this Bill is to me rather vague.  I have experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that what really happened in the past was that the county committee of agriculture came to a conclusion, after discussing what they <Col N="618" /> wanted to do, on what they expected to spend.  Then it was a question of what decision the council would reach. Sometimes, there were differences on the council &mdash; not frequently, in my experience, I confess.  However, it is open to a council to repudiate a judgment of the committee of agriculture, if they want to.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear about how this machinery will work.  It is rather surprising to me that, while the vocational committee can make its demand which the county council has to meet &mdash; it is a body corporate with a seal, just as the committees of agriculture will now be &mdash; the county committee of agriculture will be placed in an inferior position in that regard.  There may be a purpose in that, but I do not know what it is and I should like it explained.  When the Minister tells us that we will not be made responsible for afforestation schemes, I am quite happy.  Apart from what might be done by way of assisting those committees who went into some afforestation on their own, by making larger grants available to them and encouraging individuals, I think it would be altogether outside the competence of committees of agriculture to take on anything more.</P>
    <P>The other sections of the Bill are clear.  There are certain improvements with regard to the position of some members of committees in respect of the travelling expenses they may claim.  The Bill is simple, and with the exception of those two points which I have mentioned the purpose of which I am not clear about, I have no objection to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point on which I should like to have information. As Senator Baxter has stated, the committee of agriculture comes to the county council and more or less says: &ldquo;We want so much money,&rdquo; and the county council can object or reduce the committee's demand, as it wishes. Under this Bill, we find in Section 5 that the committee of agriculture may, with the consent and subject to the conditions imposed by the Minister, borrow from a bank by means of overdrafts. Can they borrow without the <Col N="619" /> consent of the county council?  I looked up Section 27 and Section 28 of the principal Act and, as far as I could gather, they borrowed then, the wording being &ldquo;the county council acting by the committee of agriculture,&rdquo; but I would like to know does this Bill give power to a committee of agriculture to borrow without the consent of the county council?  I think a county council should have the final say in matters like this because they are the elected representatives of the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that I welcome the Bill and I think it is a step in the right direction.  I remember a time when the county council's contribution was very small &mdash; it was only a penny or twopence in the £ in the early days&mdash;but even in those days very good work was done.  The result was very striking, and I wonder if the work being done now bears the same relation to the amount of money spent on it.  It strikes me that the work done in the early days was better, but, of course, I am not an expert in such matters.  I did not hear the Minister say anything about recoupment, but I take it that some of the moneys spent by committees of agriculture will be recouped from the Central Fund.  The Minister, I expect, will probably refer to that when he is replying to the debate.  The general feeling about rates is that they are too high.  It would soften the matter a bit, if we were to know that a big percentage of the moneys spent by committees of agriculture would be recouped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time, I tried to get advice on forestry.  It was a long time ago and, though I looked everywhere, I was unable to get advice on forestry from any quarter.  I do not know if committees of agriculture employ forestry experts, but I do think that forestry advice would be necessary and it might not require the services of full-time instructors.  With reference to the taking over of land for afforestation, I remember that at one time Cork County Committee of Agriculture, or the county council, took over some land for afforestation.  The scheme went on for a long number of years, <Col N="620" /> but it never showed a profit and eventually, I think, it was closed down. I just mention this as a warning to other counties.</P>
    <P>Most of the money spent by county committees of agriculture is spent on agriculture, but I think it would be well that more should be spent on horticulture.  There is a good market for vegetables across the Channel, if it could be organised properly, and a lot of vegetables and fruit are being canned and bottled now, something which did not happen a few years ago. I think there is an opening for big development in the horticultural line, and I would like to see more development of it along our coastline, where the climate is mild and where such things as early potatoes could be grown.</P>
    <P>I think the greatest need in connection with agriculture at the moment is to keep up our live-stock population. A big number of cattle were exported last year, and they are still being exported, with the result that there is a danger that our cattle population may go down.  That would be bad from every point of view, but it would be particularly bad from our balance of payments point of view.  I do not know whether I could make any suggestion to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I will not pursue that line.  I only wanted to say to the Minister that he has 350 agricultural instructors in the country, and if it were put to them that that was one of the big needs at the moment, it might have some effect.  I think it would be in order to say that. The obvious solution would be to get each animal to have two calves instead of one.  That would not be within the bounds of possibility, but there are other ways it could be done, and I would leave the matter in the hands of the Minister and his experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, but I do not see that there are any far reaching changes contemplated in it. I heard Senator Baxter say a few <Col N="621" /> moments ago that agricultural committees were in an inferior position to vocational committees, as far as providing them with the money required for their various schemes.  I am a member of a vocational committee and am also a member of an agricultural committee, and there is very little difference in the procedure adopted in both cases.  We hold an annual meeting of the vocational committee and a number of the members of the county council, who are members of that committee, go into various details of the money required.  After consideration, a certain amount is agreed, passed, and is recommended to the county council.  An annual meeting of the agricultural committee is also held, and in our county we are favoured by the attendance of a member of the Minister's staff, from the Department of Agriculture, who comes down and discusses our annual estimate in detail with us.  We are free to recommend any figure we wish, as long as we keep within the 10d. in the £1 we are allowed under legislation.  I think it could not be a better scheme or fairer to everybody.</P>
      <P>I have heard some members speak about afforestation as if county committees of agriculture were going in for afforestation in a big way.  I do not believe the Minister intends that to happen at all.  Any committee can set aside £500 or £1,000 in their annual scheme and that money is very usefully spent in small amounts to pay 50 per cent. of the cost of the trees given to any farmer who wishes to plant a small shelter belt on his farm.  These shelter belts are a great asset to any farmer and in some counties where we have hilly districts, they are availed of by people to provide shelter for their stock in the winter months.  I do not believe there is any intention of proceeding to acquire land in a big way with a view to afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, the committees of agriculture are becoming incorporated bodies.  In other words, they will be entitled to purchase land.  That is the only part of the Bill with which I would have any doubt about agreeing.  I do not think <Col N="622" /> that committees of agriculture should be entitled to purchase land, except in very rare instances and that it should be done only with the sanction of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill affords something of an opportunity for inquiring into the position of committees of agriculture.  Their status is being somewhat changed and they are being made into bodies corporate.  It seems to me that committees of agriculture must find themselves in a difficult position.  They are a spending body and they have to secure the sanction of the county council for money which they require for their purposes, within the limits imposed by the Act.  On the other hand, they have to conform to certain regulations and have certain schemes approved by the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think that is an entirely happy position for a body which may have ideas, or provides a setting in which they can get their ideas implemented.</P>
      <P>There were certain things in this Bill which appeared very vague to me at the beginning, but in the light of the Minister's statement, certainly one difficulty has been cleared up, that is, in relation to sub-section (2) of Section 2.  It does appear that under Section 35 of the 1931 Act there was provision, upon the joint representation of the county council and the committee of agriculture, that the Minister might make a forestry scheme Order.  It does not appear from what the Minister said that that section was ever a very live section.</P>

      <P>That is all the more regrettable because the section was intended to enable committees of agriculture and the county councils to preserve the amenities of woods which, apart from their selling value, had a certain value for agricultural purposes, as I understand the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is a section which bothered a previous speaker who does not think the committees of agriculture should be empowered to own land.  I should have thought that, of all people, they <Col N="623" /> should be empowered to own land and experiment on it; that if, in their own county, they wanted to experiment, grow a particular crop, try out cattle or grow a particular type of grass, they would certainly need to be owners of land to carry out such experiments. In so far as they will now be able to own land, that is probably a very good thing.  I understand that the committee in one county has had to carry out experiments on other people's land which they could have carried out on their own land, if they had it.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate under what circumstances committees would acquire lands outside their functional area.</P>

      <P>I was wondering if it was outside the county altogether. That could happen in towns which are on a border.  I am glad to see that Section 6 gives power to enable retrospective payments of salaries, since it is the unfortunate position of local officials that they have to await the settlement of salaries for other groups of employees.  That is a welcome improvement in regard to these officers who give such good service to the country.  I think that sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 36 of the 1931 Act are not to apply for the future.  That being the case, I do not know why sub-sections (1) and (2) are not being repealed but perhaps there is some reason for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Quigley, I feel that this Bill provides one of the rare opportunities we have here of considering some aspects of the works of county committees of agriculture and how they can be made to function better.  The present Bill provides power to strike an increased rate.  That, of course, is very welcome, further to extend the work of the committees of agriculture, particularly in the sphere of advisory services.  Before granting these powers to county committees, and before making them bodies corporate, I should like to feel that the full development of the county committees was examined closely so as <Col N="624" /> to bring them into closer touch with the farming community and, above all, to make the county committees more representative of the farming community. I am not suggesting for a moment that the 100 per cent. membership of the county committee should be from the farming community, but certainly I think the opposite has been shown to hold in many counties. That certainly does not make for confidence in an essential institution of our democratic society.</P>
      <P>Two ways seem to suggest themselves that would make the county committee more representative of the farming community.  One is the increased use of co-options.  Many county committees have set a good headline and have co-opted leaders of the rural organisations.  Other counties have refused to deviate from the position that only the elected representatives of the people should sit on these committees.  There is a good deal to be said for that point of view because the urgent task of the moment is to safeguard democracy here.  We see quite frequently where Members of the Oireachtas are held up to ridicule as being incompetent and unfitted for representation and so on.  The same campaign is very often waged against the members of county councils and other elected bodies.  The answer to all that is that the critics, if they are not satisfied with those within, should accept it as a public duty, to offer themselves for election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies very much to the young farming community at present.  I do not believe they are pulling their weight as far as representation on public bodies is concerned. I know that organisations have a horror of being, as they say, drawn into politics, but I think that the horror is allowed go too far in regard to representation on county councils, county committees and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an essential duty to maintain the democratic system.  After all, the only alternative is some form of dictatorship. The young farming community, who have made such great strides in agriculture over the past <Col N="625" /> ten years, who have built up such a fine amount of voluntary education, will have to face their responsibilities as citizens of the future and contribute their full quota to manning the democratic institutions of the State.  Otherwise, those institutions cannot function and cannot be fully representative of all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The other way in which the county committee can be brought into close contact with the farming community has been very successfully shown in County Cork where a county advisory committee, drawn from the leaders of the rural organisations within the county, has been set up.  This has been set up to help and advise the county committee on problems directly concerned with the advisory services. It has organised the whole county into sections of two or three parishes, the area being served by an adviser.  They have set up a committee to work with the adviser in his area.  These are excellent arrangements.  They have brought the utmost harmony to the rural organisations in County Cork.  I am proud to say that whatever differences may appear at national level between some of our farming organisations, they do not exist in County Cork and do not exist within the county advisory committee there.</P>
    <P>There are other developments which, perhaps, could also be more widely known.  The county committee, by its very nature, must seek to give more or less uniform service to all the people in the county.  Consequently, it cannot give one adviser to 1,000 farmers in one area and one adviser to 300 or 400 farmers in another area.  That has been met in Boherbue, where the farmers themselves, 300 of them, realising that they needed more advice and help from scientific officers than they could expect as their share of the county service, have been putting up for the last four years half the cost of the services of such an adviser.</P>
    <P>I might say at this stage that their work has been closely investigated and costed by some of the staff of University College, especially by Professor Murphy.  When the results are out &mdash; and they will be out within a year or a year and a half &mdash; it will be one of the <Col N="626" /> greatest examples of what small farmers can do.  It will have a tremendous lesson for us here.  Make no mistake about it, the small farmers of Boherbue, with their intensive dairying and pig production, their own grain silo and dynamic local leadership, are setting a headline that is something to be proud of.  There is another group in the county at Barryroe also doing this completely independently.  They, too, are doing a wonderful job; but I believe such groups should have their share of the county rates.  It would be well that the county committees would at least consider that if they have an adviser to every 1,000 farmers, any region is entitled to its share of that service.</P>
    <P>There are a few rather disturbing things.  We are anxious to build up our democratic institutions.  We are anxious to build up especially our local councils, county councils, county committees, parish committees and so on.  But there were some happenings in the past that we should be careful about, because they tended to weaken and undermine the confidence of the community in their representative institutions.  I have four examples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly to county committees of agriculture.  I am dealing with their functions, which are being broadened in the present Bill. The first concern is the Parish Plan, which gave rise to a great deal of contention and a feeling &mdash; not without some justification, I think &mdash; that it was an effort to centralise the advisory services on the pattern of the National Agricultural Advisory Service in England, and thereby to by-pass the local control.  That danger has more or less passed, but we have at present overlapping services in many counties where there is a parish agent in the middle of a county and around him the ordinary advisers of the local county committee.</P>

    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it is his intention that these parish agents shall be incorporated as speedily as possible into the county services. <Col N="627" /> Otherwise, it will just lead to disintegration in the future and may encourage other Ministers to have a crack at county committees by putting in more parish agents and taking away from their jurisdiction.  It is high time we had co-ordination there.  In that co-ordination, the officers on local building schemes and so on could well be co-ordinated at county level.  Again, that co-ordination will be called for in the Agricultural Institute that is coming.  If it is to service these regions and provide good advisory services, then it will have to have its lines of communication.  I am certain that the county committee of agriculture, properly developed and extended, is the democratic medium through which the country can be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>The second point deals with the general council of county committees. Many of the recommendations made following this investigation which the farmers commenced three years ago and in which I had the privilege of taking part, have been implemented and the present Bill incorporates some of them.  They were put forward by representatives of the agricultural officers' organisation and by representatives of certain county committees as indicating handicaps and things that needed to be improved.</P>
    <P>Another thing which was obvious to us at the time was the fact that the county committees of agriculture needed to have some central body and it was, indeed, a great pleasure, to find that that body actually came into being within the last year or two. Certainly the need for it was felt.  We have got now the general council of the county committees and I submit that that body, if given proper responsibility and if helped by the Oireachtas and the Minister, will provide an indispensable means of raising production here and of keeping the whole process democratic.  I am, however, somewhat disturbed that the composition of this body was not officially recognised in the selection for the Agricultural Institute Commission.</P>

      <P>It was: just one in five &mdash; on a level with the beekeepers! <Col N="628" /> I submit that is not altogether the level we would expect to find for the general council of county committees, any more than for the National Farmers' Association.  I submit it was a pity that at least three of the five seats were not given, <i>ex officio</i>, to organisations which are undoubtedly at the forefront of our agricultural development, the general council of county committees, the National Farmers' Association and possibly some milk organisation.</P>
      <P>I have one further point to put forward. The county advisory committee, as it functions in County Cork, suffers from the handicap that there is no allowance made or no provision for travelling expenses for the members. I do not submit that travelling expenses should be paid in full, but there should be some grant from the county committee to the organisation concerned to enable the members to defray some of the cost of their taking part in the county advisory committees' deliberations.  If we develop our county committees along the lines I have suggested, if we are not afraid to experiment and not afraid to encourage local initiative, whether it be in Barryroe, Boherbue, or anywhere else, then I am sure in a very short time we shall have little or no complaints about county committees not being representative because our farm leaders will come forward themselves and we may, perhaps, see a system of three-parish advisory committees developed, which is, after all, the only medium by which one instructor can contact 1,000 farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I should be tempted to enter the wide field covered by the last speaker.  We could discuss the matter of the composition of county committees of agriculture and the way in which it is proposed to bring these voluntary bodies together for the purpose of electing certain members to the Agricultural Institute, but all I shall say on that matter is that, while a fair share of the wisdom may rest in the Senator as to the way in which the matter should be approached, quite a few others have some knowledge, too, of this matter <Col N="629" /> and have a fair idea also of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>Since the matter has been raised in the course of this discussion, let me say that I did go to the trouble &mdash; I do not use the word &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; in the sense that it was any trouble to me &mdash; to meet the representatives of the major bodies, in the hope that they would be able to give me, as a result of their combined wisdom, some suggestions that would be helpful in order to secure the most desirable method of approach in the selection of these people.  As a result of that effort, we parted on this note: &ldquo;Minister, we see your difficulty.  We have not been able to be very helpful to you.  We realise we have not made any suggestion that is of a worthwhile nature as far as the problem you have presented us with is concerned and all we can say is &mdash; just do your best.&rdquo; Now, an organisation can be big and powerful, or it can be small and weak. It does not follow that the weak organisation will not have in its ranks in some capacity, either as an officer or an ordinary member, an individual who may not have as useful a contribution to make as the best that can be found in the more powerful organisation from the numerical point of view.</P>
      <P>All I want to say then in my own defence is that, to whatever extent the decision is open to criticism, it represents a desire to bring into consultation and to give responsibility to the widest number of organisations, irrespective of their numerical strength and having regard to the utter impossibility of giving them in whatever groups they find themselves an influence in proportion to their membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that in the discussion both in the Dáil and here there should have been this confusion regarding this forestry question because there was nothing so far from my mind as to attempt in any way to encourage county committees of agriculture to embark on any sort of campaign of afforestation. Goodness knows, county committees have many matters with which to deal.  Their finances are limited and they have enough on their hands without <Col N="630" /> having to deal with that kind of expanding forestry programme.</P>
    <P>Indeed, apart altogether from this sub-section to which Senators have referred some of this Bill is designed to give county committees power to dispose of plantations of one kind or another.  County committees of agriculture in some counties, though not in many, have plantations and have the responsibility of looking after them. As everybody knows, they are not suited for that work, and my idea was to see to it that they would have power to dispose of such properties.  To find oneself, then, accused of amending the law so as to provide for extended activities in this field is surely interesting.</P>
    <P>The way in which this has arisen is, of course, that the 1931 Act provided that where a forestry scheme was adopted by a county committee of agriculture the council should strike a rate of a halfpenny in the £ for the purpose of that scheme; but no county committee adopted a scheme and therefore no rate was ever struck, and although certain county committees had the responsibility of looking after plantations, they still carried on under normal provisions and took it into account in preparing their annual estimates for presentation to the premier body.  The manner of expressing these things had been changed in some of the Local Government Acts, and it was decided to bring the phraseology of the Agricultural Act into line with the other Local Government Acts.  Therefore, this amendment was designed, not to make any change in the 1931 Act in this regard but to bring it into line in respect of the manner of expressing how a halfpenny or a penny in the £ or its equivalent was to be provided from the county rate.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that, apart altogether from any question of what is in the 1931 Act or the amendment here, I was myself in my early days a member of a county council and a county committee of agriculture, and I have had some experience of seeing county councils interesting themselves in those days in afforestation.  Any personal experience I have had has taught me that county councils are not <Col N="631" /> well equipped to engage in that business, nor are county committees of agriculture and, to use the old expression, the cobbler should stick to his last.  With that sort of mental condition, I would not be likely to invite them to ramble into that field on any wider basis.</P>
    <P>The county committees have been given power to borrow without any reference to the premier body, and I do not see that there is anything wrong with that.  They can borrow only with the consent of the Minister, and it seems to me that this is a power they should have.  Some objection or criticism has been made &mdash; I think by Senator Baxter &mdash; as to the distinction between the powers enjoyed under the Vocational Acts by the county vocational committees and the powers of the county committees of agriculture.  I was not really aware that that was the case, although years ago I served on both bodies; but in this matter of the county committees of agriculture, I think it is only right that if the rate is to be increased, the manner in which the estimate for the year is prepared is the same in both cases.</P>
    <P>County councils are composed largely of people who are representatives of rural areas, and they have to have regard to the capacity of the ratepayers and the cost of all the services. I do not see that there is anything wrong in asking a county committee of agriculture to be able to show cause as to why an increased rate is required for agricultural purposes. They are dealing with a jury, a council, composed of people who have everything in common with the interests that the agricultural committees are trying to promote, and therefore they should not have any difficulty, if the case is strong, in inducing the council to give them money where it seems that money is required and will yield good results.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Callaghan who mentioned the contribution that might be made by the State, in the event of the rates in certain counties being increased as a result of this enabling measure.  There are only about three counties where the maximum <Col N="632" /> rate has been reached and about two others in which the margin between the present rate and the maximum is very small.  As far as the rest of the counties, some 20 or more, are concerned, they are very far from having reached the maximum rate as yet. The basis of contribution as between the State and the local committee is roughly pound for pound, and of course, the State contribution will be made on that basis, should any county decide to increase the rate above the maximum now provided by law and by the amendment of the law as it exists now.</P>

      <P>The right to borrow on the part of the committee will have nothing to do with the maximum rate. That is an independent and separate matter.  Senator O'Quigley, I think, asked me about capital expenditure. They might want to purchase a site in Drogheda or Dundalk which would be outside the rural area.  They might want to build headquarters or buy property.  It is for purposes such as these that borrowing would take place and, as I have said, it can take place only with the consent of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As this Bill is rather complex in form, there has been circulated an explanatory memorandum to serve as a guide to what are its main provisions and what is the grouping of sections which are respectively consequential on those main provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject matter falls into five divisions and I shall deal with each of them in turn.  Taking first what may be described as the financial provisions, <Col N="633" /> Section 8 re-enacts as part of the fisheries code the Salmon Conservancy Fund Act, 1954, and Sections 14 and 15 and the Second Schedule are concerned with changes in the system of fishing licences and of the rates of licence duty to be charged.  These financial provisions have been entirely misrepresented as forming part of a scheme to relieve the Exchequer and transfer heavy burdens to those who engage in fishing for salmon.</P>
    <P>The simple facts are that the sources of revenue available to boards of conservators have for a number of years been proving less and less adequate to meet the cost of carrying out their protection work.  Notwithstanding that fishery rates have been increased and increased Exchequer subventions provided, the apparent increase of conservators' revenues from £28,500 in 1938-39 to £66,000 odd in 1956-57 vanishes when the figures are adjusted to allow for the change in cost of living and purchasing power of money which occurred in the interval.</P>
    <P>It has been evident for some time that despite the increase in revenues the conservancy service has been scarcely able to hold its own and no margin has been available to put the service on a more effective footing by reorganising the water-keeping staff and providing up-to-date means of transport and communication.</P>
    <P>There are two main reasons for reimposing the salmon export levy and introducing legislation whereby fishing licence duties may be increased, namely, to put conservators in funds to help them to reorganise their protection services, and, secondly, to provide moneys for development work.  In the latter connection a start has been made with engineering surveys of a number of rivers which are at present barren of salmon or carrying only a fraction of their potential stocks, due to the existence of natural barriers which impede the ascent of fish for spawning.</P>
    <P>It seems likely that the engineering works required in some such cases will be fairly costly but where increased runs of salmon can be adduced it should be possible to amortise the cost within, say, 15 years having regard to <Col N="634" /> the value of increased catch both by sporting and commercial methods. Each undertaking will, however, require careful study to ensure that the construction cost is in its proper relation to the increase in stock which can be forecast having regard to the extent of spawning grounds and availability of feeding for fry in the areas to be opened up.</P>
    <P>On re-enactment of the Salmon Conservancy Fund Act, 1954, by Section 8 of the Bill, the opportunity is being taken in sub-section (9) to make it clear that moneys in the Salmon Conservancy Fund may be applied towards the expenses of improvement schemes of the kind I have indicated.  Otherwise, the salmon export levy provisions of the 1954 Act remain unchanged.  The rates of levy reimposed by Order in May, 1957, namely, 2d. per lb. from 1st January to 31st May in any year and 1d. per lb. thereafter are identical with those originally imposed.  This cannot but be regarded as a modest charge in relation to a product which, in 1957, returned an average export price of 6/1 per lb. and the absence of any real protest during the past year may be taken as evidence that the industry recognises the need for such a charge and that it is reasonable in amount.</P>
    <P>Coming to the licence duty provisions, Sections 14 and 15, together with the Second Schedule, provide for re-enactment of the ordinary licence duties on fishing engines at the current rates with new provision in Section 15 for alteration of such rates by Order and crediting of the increase to the Salmon Conservancy Fund.  For the information of Senators, a statement has been circulated in the form of a comparative table showing what are to be the rates of licence duty as from the 1st January, 1959, as compared with those in force at present for fishing with rod and line. It is not my present intention to increase the licence duties for fishing engines other than rod and line.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the chief changes in licensing will fall under two heads, namely, the introduction of rod licences available in all fishery districts throughout the State at £4 for the whole season, £3 for 21 days or for the remainder of the season after 1st July, and £1 for <Col N="635" /> a seven-day licence and, secondly, the introduction of licences, available in the district of issue only, at licence duties of £3 for the whole season and £2 after 1st July.  The late season district licence is designed to cater for the angler whose chief interest is in sea trout fishing and it is my intention to authorise its issue in consultation with the boards of conservators having regard to the extent to which sea trout fishing predominates in the various districts in the latter part of the season.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was circulated, boards of conservators and angling organisations have had every opportunity of making known their reactions and I have had occasion to meet throughout the country a number of persons with intimate knowledge of the angler's point of view.  There has been no reasoned opposition to the new scheme of licence duties save in one respect. A fairly strong case was made for the angler who fishes only in the rivers of his own district and, acting on the advice received and following discussion in the other House, I introduced a series of amendments which brought in the district licence and late season district licence already mentioned. The final result is a scheme of licence duties which I am satisfied will be found reasonable by all concerned.</P>
    <P>The net outcome of these financial provisions is an estimated total revenue to boards of conservators of some £80,000 in 1959-60 as compared with the £66,000 odd already mentioned for 1956-57.  These figures include, in respect of grants from the Exchequer the sums of £6,000 and £13,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on this Bill in the Dáil there appeared to be some confusion of mind in regard to whether boards of conservators would actually receive in the financial year, for example 1959-60, a considerable addition to their revenues as a result of the maintenance of the export levy and the introduction of new rod licence fees.  I should like, therefore, to make it absolutely clear to Senators that, other things being equal, namely the number of visitors and the number of <Col N="636" /> fishermen as a whole remaining stable, the general fishing conditions in the year 1959-60 being comparable to those of 1956-57, there will be available for conservancy and improvement schemes £14,000 more next year than in the previous year named, that is, the year 1956-57.  The greater part of this increase will be received in cash by the boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that in the elaborate organisation of the boards set up by numerous statutes from 1848 onwards all the machinery exists whereby the boards can become as self-supporting as possible so that I need only apply to the Minister for Finance for subventions to supply particular needs relating to development or some unforeseen circumstances. This is a policy which is generally understood in relation to other productive operations where the whole industry is knit together in an administrative machine.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear that the need for these extra revenues arises from the fact that the amount of money available to boards of conservators is not any greater than that found in 1938 and 1939, allowing for the decrease in the value of money, whereas it is absolutely essential to develop the industry, to restock the rivers, to increase the exports, and to increase the number of fishermen coming here, hence the decision in regard to the financial provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is beyond doubt true that after these very moderate rod licence increases have been effected equivalent in fact to the catching of a salmon &mdash; weight 3½ to 7 lb. &mdash; extra in the year our salmon angling will still be far cheaper than in other countries.</P>
    <P>Further provision in relation to licensing is made in Part IX of the Bill where oyster fishing licences are introduced.  This has been found necessary in order that the conservators may be put in a position to undertake the effective protection of oyster beds which are threatened with depletion by illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>The other main provisions of the Bill deal with two forms of development &mdash; the introduction of fish farming <Col N="637" /> and the encouragement of eel fishing by the relaxation of certain restrictions.</P>
    <P>Fish farming has proved to be a highly profitable industry in some continental countries where the natural conditions are by no means as favourable as ours.  The fish farm established at Roscrea by the Inland Fisheries Trust by means of a grant from the National Development Fund is primarily engaged in the production of trout and coarse fish suitable for restocking of angling waters.  Some rainbow trout is, however, being marketed for table use and those interested in fish farming for profit can learn a good deal about the layout, equipment and operating technique by studying what is being done at Roscrea.  Arrangements are already in hand for the establishment by private enterprise of a large scale commercial trout farm and with such examples before them I look forward to seeing many farmers taking up trout farming as a profitable side line. The fish culture licences which are being introduced in Section 5 of the Bill to control this development will have the effect of enabling the fish farmer to net his fish for market at any time of the year free from restrictions as to close season which must be enforced for the protection of wild fish.</P>
    <P>The yield of our eel fisheries must be regarded as far below optimum catch, with exports of eels showing an average over the past three years of only 2,200 cwt. valued at £28,000 a year. Here again we seem to have much to learn from the continentals and in the immediate future an officer of my Department will be engaged on a study tour to get first hand information on the methods best calculated to develop our eel fisheries and expand exports. In the meantime, the proposals contained in Sections 19 to 22 of the Bill have been worked out so as to make it possible to relax certain statutory restrictions on the operation of eel fisheries subject, where necessary, to conditions which will ensure that satisfactory provision is made for the free passage of salmon.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would refer to the Fisheries <Col N="638" /> Consolidation Bill which I hope to reintroduce in this House following enactment of the present Bill.  Completion of the process of consolidation will prepare the way for comprehensive revision of the fishery laws and work will be put in hand without delay on an amending measure to deal with the more pressing problems, such as the election system for boards of conservators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity, first, of expressing the genuine appreciation of fishermen in many parts of the country of the Minister's energetic efforts on their behalf.  He has shown in his statement this evening a genuinely progressive policy.  I noticed especially with interest the projects for fish farming and such like.  The fact is, as the Minister very well realises, there is a great harvest to be won from our rivers.  It looks as if he is going to see that that harvest is well cultivated in the next few years.</P>
      <P>I still think, as I thought eight years or so ago when I spoke on this subject first in this House, that it is almost impossible for one man to combine the interests of the land with the interests of the water.  Again and again you find the waterman and the landsman are in conflict on fundamental matters.  I think the time will have to come, despite the energies of the present Minister and of previous Ministers, when we will need a special Minister for Fisheries.  It is too important to be shared by any other Department.  I would urge on the present Minister &mdash; and this is said in no sense of depreciation of his own talents &mdash; to keep in mind that the time is approaching when he or someone else must choose between the land and the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give one clear example of this conflict between the two elements.  It is well known to fishermen, and probably well known to the House, that these schemes of land drainage which are so beneficial to the farmers are sometimes of great disadvantage to fishermen.  I have here a letter from a very energetic fisherman in the West of Ireland.  He says that the rivers in his area are chocolate in colour and not fishable at the present <Col N="639" /> time, owing to the drainage schemes. Throughout the country, I have heard reports of a similar kind.  In many cases, these drained areas are bringing much profit to the farmer but much disadvantage to the fisherman.  In this there must be a clash of policy between the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture on one side and the Minister for Fisheries on the other; and it must be difficult for one man to resolve the conflict.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I should like to welcome the Minister's statement about the exploration of the possibility of opening up new rivers.  Once again, that is a progressive policy and I hope it pays the dividends it deserves.</P>
    <P>I should like, in passing, to direct the Minister's attention to this interest in another Bill which will come before the House very soon.  The Transport Bill will possibly ring the death knell of the canals.  If it does, the Minister for Fisheries is going to lose some valuable territory.  It has been pointed out again and again in the public Press that the canals, apart from other great usefulness, can be most valuable for coarse fishing.  In England, this is a most popular pastime.  Many tourists would come over here if there were well stocked canals in this country.  I would urge the Minister to do everything possible to preserve the canals, for that reason as well as for others.</P>
    <P>There is one particular point on the Bill which I should like to raise.  The Minister has heard it before: I hope he will be patient with me if he hears it again, expressed from a slightly different point of view, perhaps.  The Bill as I see it is almost entirely a beneficial and timely measure, but I still question the wisdom of the increase in the cost of rod licences under Section 15.  I know the Minister has gone a good way to meet objections on this, but I do not think he has gone quite far enough.  As I have said earlier, the fishermen at the moment are not enjoying as good fishing in the West and South of Ireland as they did some years ago, as a direct result of Government policy.  The drainage schemes have definitely disimproved fishing.  Is it just, at a time when the fishermen <Col N="640" /> are at a disadvantage in that way, to increase the cost of their licences? That is the first objection, and I think it is a just one.  Why should fishermen who are already getting less value for their money have to pay more money?</P>
    <P>Secondly &mdash; and I do not think this point has been raised before, and I hope the Minister may think it is a valid one &mdash; I am told by a reliable source that there is grave risk, if the cost of the licence is increased, that the licence fee simply will not be paid and illegal fishing will increase.  The extra £1 is not very much, but it may be just enough to make some very competent legal fishermen into very competent illegal fishermen.  I think the Minister should take that very seriously into account.</P>
    <P>A very experienced fisherman &mdash; and one who has had good experience also of the administration of fisheries &mdash; has told me that in his opinion if the licence fee is increased, many men will not take out a licence at all: it will increase illegal fishing for salmon and give extra work to the employees of the several boards of conservators; they in their turn will join the ranks of others who are looking for increased wages for extra work.  In other words, the increase may be a boomerang.  If illegal fishing increases, there may be a demand for higher salaries, and the few pounds gained by the increase in rod licence fees will be more than lost in the other way.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister that there is still time to bring back the proposed cost of the licence for local fishermen to the present sum.  It is not a question of amending the Bill. The Minister has power to do this.  Of course, his answer will be that money is needed for improvements and we must find it somewhere.  I think there is a very simple solution to that.  The visitors can pay much more than they are being asked to pay.  I am informed that they are unlikely to object to paying much more than they have to pay at present.  Fishing is much dearer in Great Britain and elsewhere than it is in Ireland, and if an extra couple of pounds were put on to their licences. I do not think it would deter a single <Col N="641" /> tourist from coming to this country. I suggest that the money can be found by this means if the Minister decides to keep the licensing prices at the present rate.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think over this just once again.  He has gone quite a long way in this direction. I think he might go the whole way.  He has a discretion in the matter.  I do not want to delay the House longer on this Bill.  I want to emphasise that it is a measure of progressive policy.  It is not merely a run-of-the-mill Bill.  It is a forward-looking Bill.  I just regret that if the Minister administers one particular section in the way he suggests, some harm may be done to local fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister devoted a good part of his statement to justifying the increased charges that will be made in consequence of the enactment of the Bill.  He mentioned that these were justified in relation to the cost of living in 1938 and the decline in purchasing power which has taken place since that time and that in consequence, if I understood his arguments correctly, there was a need to keep pace with the rise in the cost of living.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that, where the cost of living rises and the value of money declines, it is proper that the income of the people should keep pace with that rise. I am sure that is a statement which will often be quoted in the future in certain contexts.</P>
      <P>Let me come to the matter contained in the Bill.  I am afraid that a Bill of this kind must be considered against the historical background of our people.  Our rivers have been flowing since God made them and God never intended that one small, select set of people should be entitled to fish in particular parts of rivers, while everybody else should be regarded as trespassers. That is the background against which we must view any attempt made to protect our fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should think that a good deal of legislation which is designed to protect our fisheries will have as little effect as an enactment to ensure that <Col N="642" /> all the people should be honest.  There is a great temptation for people when they see some people entitled to fish and others not so entitled.  There will always be that difficulty in connection with the protection of our fisheries. People do not see any good reason why they should not be allowed to fish where they like.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people holding that view who do not realise the great danger they do to the fisheries by poaching and things of that kind. In addition to such protection as can be afforded by legislation, there is some need to educate people into what ought not to be done as a matter of civic duty and that if certain practices were allowed to continue indiscriminately great harm would be done.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister must have a certain amount of experience in that respect.  There are cases where unthinking people with factories pollute rivers.  I think Senator Stanford referred to that.  There is no concern for the fact that it will do great damage to our fisheries.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters which I should like to deal with specifically. I do not know whether the Minister is quite satisfied that elections to boards of conservators, in some areas at any rate, are conducted in the way they should be conducted.</P>

      <P>I take it that it arises on this Bill.  These boards of conservators are to receive increased funds for the discharge of their duties.  If we are to give them increased funds for the discharge of their duties &mdash; I hope I am not very much out of order &mdash; we ought to address ourselves to the question as to whether they are properly elected in all cases.  The very fact that a number of people feel there is a small coterie who become members of boards of conservators is another reason why there is not that respect for fishing rights and why there is not that protection given to fisheries about which I am talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a further aspect of the historical background.  I have been speaking about.  People have got this grudge <Col N="643" /> against anybody who wants to protect the fisheries, even though they may be sportsmen with no particular interest beyond an interest in sport.  If these boards of conservators are to get increased financial assistance, the method by which they are elected should be subjected to the closest scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford expressed doubt as to the wisdom of increasing certain licences.  I am inclined to think that one of the attractions this country has is that fishing is virtually free.  It is amazing how far people will travel to get anything free.  When fishing was virtually free in this country, it had an added attraction for English tourists. I am not at all sure that these increased fees will discourage them to any great extent, but I do not think they will encourage English tourists.</P>
    <P>It is like what I was talking about to-day on the Industrial Development Bill.  On the one hand, we are trying to encourage foreign investors and on the other, we are doing something which will frighten them off.  A lot of advertising and publicity by the Tourist Board is a positive step toward inducing people to come here to spend their money.  Then you have this kind of thing which would at least be a disincentive.  I think that in years to come, when we are better on our feet in the tourist world, this might be more appropriate.  At the present time we are trying to attract as many tourists as possible in order to increase our invisible exports.  This is an untimely point at which to introduce this increase in rod licence fees.</P>
    <P>Again, for a different reason, I think it is not wise to increase these licences. We have a commission inquiring into television at the present time and we see these deplorable tendencies among certain sections of our youth emphasising themselves in teddy boys, rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll and that kind of thing.  At the same time, we are doing everything in our power to prevent young people who might be interested in fishing from engaging in that kind of occupation by putting it out of their reach.  Anything that would encourage young people and <Col N="644" /> people with very little money to engage in the healthy pastime of salmon fishing should be done and we should be very slow to do anything which would have the effect of discouraging people from following these very desirable forms of entertainment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that up to the present time, quite a number of people have not been taking out licences and have fished for salmon without licences.  When they catch a salmon and sell it and get the price of a licence, they buy the licence.  That is not unknown.  There is very little hope that such people will bother to pay the increased licence that may be called for when this Bill becomes law.  Instead of having people conforming with the law, it will make it more difficult for them to take out licences and so comply with the law.  Disrespect for the law in one sense manifests itself in other senses and creates a rather bad type of climate for the achievement of the objects which certain sections of this Bill attempt to achieve.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter that I should like to mention to the Minister for his observations.  This Bill amends quite a number of older Acts.  In connection with the prosecution of offences, I would draw the attention of the Minister to Section 12 of the 1956 Act.  Certain Circuit Court judges have declared that the Act is so wide that it is quite impossible to say in any particular set of circumstances that a person is guilty of the offence which is sought to be created under the section.  I do not know whether the present would be the appropriate time for amending that section, with a view to defining the circumstances in which people can be successfully prosecuted.  There have been circumstances in which people have been found redhanded, but, by reason of the wording of Section 12 of the Act of 1956, nobody could say that they had committed a breach of the section. I do not know if the present is the appropriate time to amend that section but I would ask the Minister to examine that matter.  If it is examined it may be possible to amend that section so as to make enforcement of the fisheries law more effective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill when enacted should undoubtedly contribute to the improvement and development of inland fisheries as the whole of the proceeds of the increased rod licence fee and salmon levy export duty will be paid over to the boards of conservators. According to the Estimates for this year, an additional £7,500 is being provided by the State as a contribution towards the Inland Fisheries Trust which, in my opinion, is doing very excellent work.  Boards of conservators, whose members comprise rod fishermen, net fishermen and owners of several fisheries, are the proper people to develop and supervise inland fisheries, especially salmon fisheries.  These boards, which are a kind of co-operative society, are made up of men who are personally interested in the improvement of fisheries.  They serve in a voluntary capacity and are doing work which could not be done as well by the State and certainly at much less cost than if it were done by the State.</P>
      <P>These boards require increased funds if proper protection is to be provided against poaching and if the water-keepers are to be paid an adequate wage for carrying out their onerous duties.  The water-keepers have to spend a considerable portion of each night on the banks of rivers.  At present, owing to lack of funds, at least some boards find it difficult to pay an adequate wage to their employees or to engage a sufficient number of men for protection work.  Boards of conservators are also required to improve and extend spawning beds by the replacement of gravel, to arrange for the preservation of spawning beds, proper drainage schemes and the wise planning of afforestation schemes which will provide a more even flow of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, Senator Stanford has referred to the fact that the Minister is Minister for Lands and Minister for Fisheries and that the two do not mix well.  In his capacity as the Minister in charge of afforestation, he could do some useful work in the planting of an area which might be acquired.  Drainage could be effectively done by planting an area convenient to <Col N="646" /> a catchment area.  That would reduce considerably the rush of water at a particular time and avoid spates which are not so good from the point of view of fishing because they limit the time at which fishing can be carried on.  It is also important that spawning beds should be made as free as possible of ducks and sea birds which destroy large quantities of ova.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators, with their intimate knowledge of the area and their personal interest, are the most efficient organisations for the development of inland fisheries.  I understand that there are approximately 5,000 miles of rivers in the country and that only one fish now enters our rivers for every 100 that entered at the beginning of the 19th Century.  If that is true, the potentialities in connection with the development of salmon fishing are enormous.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that because of our temperate climate and the freedom of our rivers from injurious pollution, this country is more suited than any country in the world for the rearing of salmon.  Apparently, at the present time we earn £500,000 per annum from salmon exports.  Obviously, that could be increased many times by adequate protection and proper development of the spawning facilities. If the number of anglers is to be trebled, and apparently that is the hope of those in charge of the tourist business, considerably increased expenditure is required for the development of this valuable asset, namely, salmon fisheries.  At a time when there is such keen competition for the tourist trade, such an important attraction as angling facilities should be developed to the utmost possible limit.  It is particularly important because angling is decentralised and is, therefore, of great benefit to rural areas which at the present time are suffering so much from depopulation.</P>
    <P>I feel there is no surer way of attracting tourists and extending the tourist season than by increasing the supply of salmon and trout in out rivers, estuaries and lakes.  Anglers are certainly a most beneficial type <Col N="647" /> of tourist and are welcome everywhere, but especially in a country like ours with its high rainfall.  It is sometimes depressing to meet visitors and have to sympathise with them on the poor holiday weather they have because of our climate, but that does not apply to the anglers one meets. In fact, they are often disappointed when the rainfall is not sufficiently heavy for their sport.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to the development of civics and I certainly agree that something should be done in this respect.  I suggest the Minister should initiate a series of lectures and film shows in districts contiguous to salmon rivers for the purpose of instructing the people on the importance of the preservation of salmon and white trout supplies and inculcating in the people a proper disposition and a better sense of civic duty and responsibility. Too many people are prepared to purchase salmon which they know has been poached and hoteliers catering for anglers are certainly not beyond reproach in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a good case for the increased rod licence fees.  In view of the present value of money, this licence duty is still well below the real value of money in 1925 when these fees were first fixed.  I hope, however, that the proposed increase will not discourage anglers who are living convenient to the Border on the other side of it and who may have to pay fairly heavy licence duty on their own side of the Border.  I am glad that the Minister has agreed to cater for the poorer angler who fishes only after his day's work or at week-ends, by limiting the increase in his case to £1. I think that is fair and reasonable.  It is good to see factory workers and others, who may have been previously tempted to poach, becoming interested in rod angling.</P>
    <P>I think the export levy on salmon is reasonable in view of the Minister's assurance that the proceeds of the levy will be used for the purposes of the boards of conservators.  If, as the Minister said, the average price of salmon is 6/- per lb. the levy of 2d. means that only 1/36th of the price is <Col N="648" /> being retained by the Department for much needed development of salmon protection.  Few industrialists or business men would be satisfied to use only 1/36th of their income for the further improvement or development of their industry or business which could obviously be achieved.  The Minister has said that the levy is reduced to 1d. per 1b. from the 1st June which covers a considerable portion of the salmon season.  Consequently, it would mean only 1/72nd part of the price of the salmon is taken by the Department.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, might I ask the Minister to consider permitting salmon exporters to pay the export levy by cheque, even if it would have to be guaranteed, as the present stamp system is not always convenient?  It is sometimes difficult in country districts to get the proper stamp and have it attached to the sheets.  I have been asked by an exporter who has a considerable amount of experience to mention this and he feels that at times the present system is rather awkward. If the Minister would agree to have a cheque substituted for the stamp and have a deposit lodged with the Revenue Commissioners, it would be more convenient.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley spoke about the rivers being as God made them, but unfortunately the poachers are as God made them also, and if there were no adequate protection, our rivers would eventually be completely denuded of salmon.  Unfortunately a number of our rivers are at present denuded of salmon and for that reason I feel the increased funds now being provided will be spent to the best advantage by handing them over to the boards of conservators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister for the nice present he gave us in producing this Bill.  My only complaint about it is that it is too brief.  I was very interested in fish farming but he did not say enough about it.  He concluded by telling anybody interested that he could go to Roscrea to see it carried on.  It is not so easy to go to Roscrea particularly in the case of those who are &ldquo;people of the land&rdquo; as Senator <Col N="649" /> Stanford said.  These are not people of the water; they are of a different mentality.  If the Minister would consider issuing a leaflet on fish farming on the lines he mentioned but more elaborate, perhaps, I for one would be very grateful.</P>
      <P>The Minister also spoke about stocking rivers with salmon and I think he said it might be 15 years before we would see results.  I do not know if I followed him correctly and perhaps he would make it clearer when replying.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has received complaints about election to boards of conservators.  Senator O'Quigley referred to it and I have heard some complaints, but I do not know if they were genuine or whether they came from people who thought they should be conservators themselves and were disappointed.  If the Minister has not already done so, it might be well if he would examine the matter and see if the elections are in order and above board in every way.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Garda Síochána give any help in the protection of the rivers.  It appears to me to be a reasonable job for them to do.  I have never heard of them doing it.  I wonder what the position is.  I should like to hear from the Minister the actual position about the protection of the rivers.</P>
      <P>Somebody also spoke about the rivers not being free to everybody.  In my part of the country, trout fishing is free to everybody; salmon fishing is not.</P>
      <P>I know of a river which is being polluted from a source which I shall not mention.  I should like to know who looks after the river in that respect.  Do the conservators?  Are they the people whose duty it is to do so?</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to say except to ask the Minister to consider issuing a leaflet on the subject of fish farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters which I should like to mention.  One has been touched on by Senator O'Callaghan &mdash; the question of the pollution of rivers.  I have not in mind rivers where there are boards of conservators, but, in relation to the <Col N="650" /> pollution of rivers, I should like to know whose responsibility it is. Senator O'Callaghan said he knows of a river which is being polluted from a source which he did not name.  There should be a policy in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Many factories and creameries are located beside rivers.  They are located beside rivers, of necessity, because of modern tendencies, modern processes and modern factory plants. There are certain processes in which chemicals such as sulphuric acid, nitric acid and caustic soda are used. Caustic soda and sulphuric acid are used by creameries and in other processes. I fear we close our eyes to the fact that they discharge in to the rivers, without the use of any neutralising factor.  Some of these rivers may be the property of a joint drainage committee where, in practically all cases, there is coarse fishing.  Nobody seems to be responsible or, at any rate, nobody bothers in quite a lot of cases. The Minister should take steps to discover how far this evil exists and what can be done to remedy it.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell me, and others, so that he may have an opportunity of putting it on record, what steps might be taken, say, in the case of a lake that is suitable for stocking with trout, particularly.  I mention this because I know of one lake which is absolutely free, so far as I am aware, of pike and in which there is a species of trout.  It is a lake which should be developed.  I know there is not any board to look after it and that any fishing there is just a free-for-all. I often wonder about it.  Possibly steps might be taken by people, but I do not think they are even aware of what might be done to establish control over that lake &mdash; and there are other such lakes &mdash; and also to stock it and make it a valuable fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the Seanad for the very helpful and constructive observations made by everybody.  I shall attempt to deal with some of the points that were raised.  Senator Stanford, whose speech was most encouraging, referred to the effects of arterial drainage on salmon <Col N="651" /> development.  We maintain a liaison with the Board of Works and any other bodies who carry out drainage.  To some extent, we know that rivers recover under certain conditions fairly rapidly.  For example, the River Feale has made a very rapid recovery, although certain types of fishermen may claim that some of the pool has been changed.  The character of the river has been altered to some extent, necessitating some change in the regulations. There is still trouble in respect of the Glyde and Dee.  The Corrib has been affected.  However, wherever we can, we try to make arrangements to reduce the ill-effects as much as possible.</P>
      <P>When the drainage has been completed, I hope to have established a special hatchery designed solely for rehabilitating rivers which have been drained under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  Sometimes anglers' associations take part in activities &mdash; I hope with the Inland Fisheries Trust in the future &mdash; in connection with re-establishing spawning beds.  Sometimes it is possible, by consultation with the drainage authority, to prevent the worst from happening.</P>
      <P>The draining of a river, deepening it, can be designed in such a way that, whereas the agricultural effects can be positive, the worst effects on the spawning beds can be avoided.  I understand that a great many of the canals have uses other than transport.  I think they carry water to towns for filtration purposes.  Therefore, the water will have to go to the canals.  I should hate to see them disappear.  The Inland Fisheries Trust are taking steps to stock them with tench, for example, for which they are particularly suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford asked me to consider again the question of district licences.  I secure advice wherever I can on this matter.  In the first place, since the district licence was announced, boards of conservators have had quite a time in which to make observations to me.  Most of them seem to be content with the compromise &mdash; the £3 and the £2 district licences.  I have to rely on the advice of many <Col N="652" /> people as regards whether or not a fisherman who has to pay £1 more for a district licence will turn a poacher. I am told the vast majority of people who are likely to be poachers have never yet taken out any licences.  One cannot be sure of these things: I hope I have been informed correctly.  That deals with most of what Senator Stanford said.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley started the story, which I like to resist, that poaching is particularly an Irish trait and is related to our history.  I do not believe that.  I believe poaching takes place nowadays because salmon are anything from 18/- to 4/6 a 1b. and that it is a tempting thing to poach.  Poaching exists everywhere.  It is a terrific problem in Scotland and in certain countries on the Continent.  It does not seem to me to have anything peculiarly Irish about it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley spoke about the education of the people in regard to poaching.  I am doing my best.  I do not know whether we can manage films but we have had some broadcasts on the value of our salmon fisheries by Dr. Went, our scientific adviser.  I made a number of speeches pointing out the destructive effects of poaching.  This is an industry which employs 5,000 people in all&mdash;as many as the Forestry Department. It can be destroyed or enormously improved by the absence of protection or otherwise.  I have done all I can to make it clear that I will not recommend mitigation of offences for poaching.  Everybody knows it is illegal and that the law must be carried out.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke about the arrangements for election to boards of conservators.  That is going to be examined in connection with the provision of a second Bill which will come after the Consolidation Bill.  We are going into all those matters, and all the many representations that have been made to me, and to my predecessor, by boards of conservators and by the Salmon Anglers' Federation, will be taken into account.  In addition, we are going to invite the views of all the boards in this connection. Recently, boards of conservators formed a council of their <Col N="653" /> own, set up for the purpose of consulting each other, the meetings of which will take place in Dublin, to examine the many matters which require attention.  We are also dealing with the sections of the Fisheries (Statute Law Revision) Act, 1956, and we will examine the deficiencies in that Act referred to by Senator O'Quigley.</P>
    <P>Senator Louis Walsh also made a very helpful speech, and I should say that the total increase in subvention for inland fisheries development, in connection with the Inland Fisheries Trust and Bord Fáilte, is £20,000. Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust work together to improve inland fisheries, and between the two of them they have got £20,000 which will ensure that their work will progress rapidly.  I agree with Senator Walsh in what he said about forestry.  I find it extraordinarily difficult to coordinate forestry for the purposes of conserving waters and forestry as an industry in itself.  The offers of land do not frequently come in the order which is desirable from the point of view of treating an area as a whole in respect of the forestry, flood protection element, the fishery protection element, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I should also say that the voluntary work of angling associations is very important in the development of the salmon, trout and coarse fishing industry and I hope all angling associations will follow the good example of those who have already done much in this respect.  A great deal of work must be done voluntarily before the Government can be justified in contributing to the industry and, in fact, the combined work of boards of conservators, angling associations, Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust constitutes possibly the finest piece of co-operative development work which exists in this country to-day.  I can only hope that that sort of atmosphere would prevail in all other industries.</P>
    <P>We have groups of people all over the country scheduling accommodation, building boats, standardising fees charged for boats, preparing local brochures, scheduling the characteristic <Col N="654" /> fishing facilities in rivers and lakes around them, helping the Inland Fisheries Trust by doing initial surveys on rivers and lakes so that the Inland Fisheries Trust will have some information upon which to make their final survey, doing access work so that the fishermen can get close to river banks and lake banks, sometimes in advance of heavier work done by Government contribution through Bord Fáilte, the whole being co-ordinated through growing numbers of federations.</P>
    <P>Some absolutely splendid work is being done by hundreds of people all over the country, at their own cost in their spare time, and it is not true to say that co-operation is impossible in Ireland.  I was in Leitrim the other day and saw in that county evidence of the most splendid work being accomplished.  I met the secretary of the Carrick-on-Shannon Angling Association and heard from him that 450 people have booked into the town of Carrick-on-Shannon for the angling season, a number which, from my knowledge of Carrick-on-Shannon, would seem to be incredible, but that is a fact.  I should not single them out because there are many other small towns in Leitrim, Cavan Monaghan, Cork and elsewhere doing the same thing, and that spirit is spreading.  Sometimes they are disappointed because anglers do not all come in the one year, but gradually their numbers are growing.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that we should ask hotels to give more co-operation in inland fishery development. I should like to see more of them joining the Inland Fisheries Trust, and I should like to see more of them making sure that the salmon they purchase are not poached.  On the other hand, many hotels are doing fine work in this respect, many of them are co-operating, but I should like to ask those who have not just the same attitude to come over and help all associations to go ahead with the work.  I will consider the regulations for the export levy to see if a cheque is possible instead of stamps.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan spoke of the new fish farms but it would take too <Col N="655" /> long at this hour of the night to describe the operation of a commercial fish farm.  It depends on certain water conditions and certain soil conditions. It should be fairly near a bacon factory with deep-freeze equipment, and fairly near a place where meat offal can be obtained as food.  A leaflet has been prepared and we will have one sent to the Senator.  We are doing further work of exploration in regard to this, and I hope there will be a great future for commercial fish farming. When the first concern is opened, I hope it will have many visitors and one result that can be expected from this development is an increase in our exports.  Exports of deep-frozen rainbow trout to Great Britain from one country alone, where conditions of water and climate are far less suitable than in our case, in value are worth £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána have many duties but they give whatever help they can to fishery protection.  In some circumstances, people can become water-keepers with the consent of the boards &mdash; not paid water-keepers &mdash; but in many cases anglers can become water-keepers under the Acts and can help with protection.  I should like to foster the growth of angling associations, particularly if they are composed of responsible men.  The more men fishing who belong to angling associations, the more public-spirited is the attitude in their respective districts with regard to poaching.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the question of pollution.  Boards of conservators have the duty of prosecuting firms for polluting rivers and most of the rivers and lakes in the country come under the jurisdiction of one or other of the 17 boards, even in some cases where there is no salmon river. I should say that creameries on the whole are very good in their attitude towards the prevention of pollution, but if the Senator knows of one creamery which is bad in its attitude in this respect, he should write to me, or to the Department, and I will have the information conveyed to the local board of conservators and perhaps we can get something done voluntarily.</P>

      <P>If the Senator will give any information he has to the board in his area, or to the Department, we will see what can be done about it.  I think the question of stocking rivers and lakes does not arise on this Bill, but for Senator O'Reilly's information, he should get in touch with the Inland Fisheries Trust, give them the name of the lake, or lakes in which he is interested, and they will see if the lake can come into their five year plan for inland fishery development, if it needs restocking and what are the conditions in it.  I should say in that connection that people are often disappointed in the replies they get from the Inland Fisheries Trust in the case of lakes where the feeding is bound to be defective, where trout remain small and it is not worth putting money into its development. That does not apply to all lakes but it applies to some lakes where trout remain very small.</P>

      <P>I think that takes me to the end of the comments made by Senators.  Once again, I am very thankful for their co-operative attitude and I do assure them I have secured the advice of a great many people on the assessments of these rod licences and the money is very much required for the development of the industry.</P>
