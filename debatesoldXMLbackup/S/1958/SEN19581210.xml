      <P>It is my sad duty to ask you, a Chathaoirleach, to convey to His Holiness Pope John XXIII, an expression of the deep sympathy of Seanad Éireann on the death of the Nuncio Apostolic, His Excellency Dr. Alberto Levame.</P>
      <P>All who had the privilege of knowing Dr. Levame were impressed by his zeal in the performance of his mission, and by his attachment to this country. When he presented his Letters of Credence to the President, he said that the high commission entrusted to him by the late Holy Father filled him with legitimate pride.  During his all too short time among us, as the personal representative of the Supreme Pontiff, his every act showed how much he regarded his mission to Ireland as the climax to a long and distinguished career in the Diplomatic Service of the Holy See.</P>
      <P>The late Nuncio made a point of being prominently associated with all important functions, both State and Church, and himself consecrated a number of bishops for dioceses in Ireland and elsewhere.  He travelled to most parts of the country, journeys which served to make him better known, and to endear him, to the people as a whole.</P>
      <P>Dr. Levame was made a Freeman of the Cities of Kilkenny and Wexford, and the great esteem in which he was held was further shown only the day before his death when the National University, on the occasion of its Golden Jubilee, conferred on him an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, by his passing, has lost a <Col N="60" /> good friend, the Church a distinguished Prelate, and the Holy Father a most worthy and devoted representative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which is due to expire on 19th February next.  Under that Act, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to prohibit or to regulate the exportation of industrial goods.  Orders made under the Act have a life of 12 months and are subject to the usual annulment procedure when laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The time has not apparently yet come when export controls can be dispensed with.  There are at present a number of goods subject to export control under various Orders made from time to time.  Accordingly, it is necessary to continue these powers for a further period.  That need arises (1) from the necessity to conserve for the benefit of home industry, certain raw materials which continue to be or which may become in short supply; (2) to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from here to Iron Curtain countries, or that this country is not used as a base through which such materials might be sent to these countries from other countries, and thirdly, to have available a means for dealing with the position in the event of any international situation arising which might result in this country being drained of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted.  Accordingly, I request the Seanad's consent to the enactment of this measure.</P>

    <Title>Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to effect a number of miscellaneous amendments in the legislation relating to the E.S.B.  These amendments relate to rural electrification, fisheries, compensation for interference with a public bridge, powers to dispose of land, membership of the Oireachtas and pension matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to rural electrification, the effect of the Bill in Section 2 is to raise the authorised limit of expenditure to £30,000,000 from the existing limit of £25,000,000 which was authorised in 1955.  It was contemplated that the need for new legislation raising the limit would arise this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Section 3 is to reintroduce a capital grant which had been payable from the commencement of the rural electrification scheme until 1955.  In 1955, it was considered that the financial position of the board was such that they could provide from their own resources the finance required for future development, and the grant was withdrawn.  In the year ended 31st March, 1955, the board had a considerable revenue surplus, including a surplus of £445,130 on rural revenue account.  The financial expectations aroused by the satisfactory <Col N="63" /> results in that one year were not realised in subsequent years.  In the year ended 31st March, 1957, the board had a deficit of almost £500,000 on the rural revenue account and that was more than sufficient to absorb the surplus on the general account and to put the whole of the board's operations into deficit.  In the year ended 31st March last, the board had a still larger deficit on the rural revenue account which produced an overall deficit of £180,000 on the general account.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear, in view of certain misinterpretations of my remarks in the Dáil on this Bill, that the board do not need a subsidy in any sense of the term.  The provision of this capital grant is to enable rural dwellers to obtain a supply of electricity upon terms which would be reasonable from their point of view.  Without some provision of this kind, either the charges for rural suppy would have to be very substantially increased or, alternatively, the board would have to continue incurring these heavy deficits on its rural revenue account, involving an overall deficit on its general account. It is clear that the requirements of rural electrification have meant in recent years the difference between a modest surplus on the board's general account and a loss.  That is a situation which is likely to persist in default of something being done about it in succeeding years.  The areas left to be connected under the rural electrification scheme are the least economic&mdash; the areas from which the average return on capital, represented by fixed charges, will fall heavily&mdash;and the annual deficit on the rural account in the absence of any provision for a capital grant would, on completing the scheme, be well over £1,000,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Of course, it was part and parcel of the original electrification scheme that a 50 per cent. capital grant would be given to the board.  The relief which such a grant will afford to the board is not sufficient to eliminate losses on rural electrification so that to some extent it may be said that the general electricity consumer is supporting, in <Col N="64" /> the charges he pays for electricity, the higher cost of providing a supply on reasonable terms to rural dwellers. There is no doubt that the rate and extent of rural electrification would have been very different if commercial considerations had been taken into account.  As commercial considerations were ignored on the insistence of the Government, who desired to see the supply of electricity extended to all rural areas, it is reasonable that the Government should assume as far as possible some responsibility for the financial consequences.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5 and 6 deal with certain changes considered desirable in the board's accountancy procedures.  Section 4 of the Bill will relieve the Minister for Finance and the E.S.B. of the obligation to earmark particular advances to the board as being for rural electrification or for general purposes. In practice it was found difficult to determine beforehand the purpose to which a particular advance would be applied.  Actual expenditure on rural electrification will be limited to £30,000,000 and it is contemplated that expenditure for general purposes will be limited to an overall total of £100,000,000.</P>
    <P>The effect of Section 5 of the Bill is to permit the board to charge against their general revenue any expenses which they must incur on investigating the potentialities of a fishery before they can decide whether or not to preserve it.  Under existing legislation, all such expenses, including expenditure incurred in maintaining and protecting stocks of fish while the investigations are going on, are chargeable to the fisheries account, even though the fishery concerned might never be operated.  The restoration of the fisheries is difficult enough without loading these expenses on to the fisheries account.  Under Section 5, it is proposed to charge these expenses to the general revenue account.</P>
    <P>The object of Section 6 is to enable the board to transfer to the general revenue account the annual profit or loss arising out of their operation of fisheries.  It is clear that hydro-electric development involves such damage to fisheries in a river that their rehabilitation <Col N="65" /> assuming it is possible at all, is a long and costly process and deficits are likely to occur for many years before the fruits of restoration work can be expected.  As the board's involvement in fisheries is a direct result of hydro-electric development, these operations cannot be regarded as a separate undertaking.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to abolish the separate capital accounts and balance sheet and incorporate the results of the board's fishery transactions in their general account.  In that way, the board's fisheries will be treated in the same manner as their other subsidiary activities, such as installation work and merchandise trading. Separate trading and profit and loss accounts are published by the board in respect of these activities. That will be continued, but the balance on each of these accounts will be transferred annually to the general revenue account.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill authorises the board to pay compensation to persons who have suffered serious loss or inconvenience as a result of the submerging of the Fitzgibbon Bridge by the Lee hydro-electric scheme.  The board is empowered under its legislation to submerge or otherwise interfere with any public or private road or bridge for the purpose of carrying out a hydro-electric scheme.  That legislation provides that in case of private roads and bridges, compensation shall be payable by the board, but there is no provision in any earlier Act for the payment of compensation for interference with a public road or bridge.  In general, in such cases the board are required to provide suitable replacements, unless relieved of this obligation by Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Lee scheme, the approval Order provided for the submerging of the public bridge over the River Dripsey, known as Fitzgibbon Bridge, and for the erection of a replacement bridge some distance from the site of the original bridge.  On investigation, the board found that, because of the nature of the site, the <Col N="66" /> construction of a bridge would be technically difficult and that the cost would be out of all proportion to any use which might be made of it.  They sought an Order relieving them of the obligation to construct the replacement bridge.  I informed them that the obligation to provide a replacement bridge must be discharged by them, unless they could negotiate an agreement acceptable to the majority of the landholders concerned.  I told them then if they succeeded in concluding a satisfactory agreement with the landholders I would promote the necessary legislation to enable them to implement the agreement.  The majority of the landholders have now agreed to do without the bridge in return for compensation payments, the amounts of which have already been agreed with the board.</P>
    <P>The position now is, therefore, that although the board have negotiated satisfactory agreements with most of the landholders, they have not got the necessary legal powers to make the compensation payments.  The object of Section 7 of the Bill is to give the board the power to make these payments.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill is designed to remove doubts about the board's powers to dispose of property.  Some of the lands acquired for the carrying out of a particular hydro-electric scheme eventually become surplus to requirements.  These powers have never, it is true, been seriously questioned, but it is essential that the board should, if necessary, be able to satisfy a purchaser that their powers of disposal are adequate.  Otherwise, a situation might arise in which they would have to retain property they did not need, which would be undesirable. The purpose of Section 8 is to put the board's powers beyond doubt but it does not confer any new powers on them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill revokes Section 3 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, which disqualified members, officers and servants of the board from nomination for, or membership of, the Oireachtas.  In more recent legislation, the principle followed in relation to State-sponsored bodies is that where membership of the Oireachtas is incompatible <Col N="67" /> with membership of the body, the person concerned may opt for one or the other.  The practice now is to provide that a member of the Dáil or Seanad may not be a member of the body and that if any member of the body becomes a member of the Dáil or Seanad, he shall cease to be a member of that body.</P>
    <P>The present Bill provides that a member of the Dáil or Seanad would have to resign before he could be appointed a member of the board or take up employment under the board.  As regards seeking election to the Dáil or Seanad, it is proposed to make a distinction between members of the board and officers and servants of the board.  It is proposed to provide that a member of the board would have to resign before offering himself as a candidate for election or on nomination as a member of the Seanad, but that officers and servants of the board should be free to seek election and if one is elected, that he shall be regarded as absenting himself from his employment with the board and shall not be paid for the period of his absence.  He shall be regarded as seconded from the service of the board. In that regard, the aim of this legislation is to put employees of the board on much the same footing as employees of C.I.E.  Provision is included to enable an officer or a servant of the board who becomes a member of the Oireachtas to preserve his right to a pension from the board.</P>
    <P>Section 10 to 13 are designed to enable the board to pay to their former employees pension increases similar to those provided for other pensioners under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>Section 14 proposes the amendment of the superannuation terms of the present chairman of the board.  It is proposed to cancel Mr. Browne's Civil Service superannuation allowance, and instead, to grant him superannuation on the lines of those payable in the Civil Service and based on the aggregate of his service in the Civil Service and in the E.S.B.  The effect of the amendment is that Mr. Browne, on retirement, will be paid a pension of <Col N="68" /> half his retiring salary, together with a gratuity equal to one and a half times that salary.  This section implements a decision taken by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 provided that the board could add up to ten years to the period of pensionable service of employees who were 40 years of age or over on the passing of the Act in 1942. Under Section 15 of the Act, they are also empowered to pay supplementary pension allowances to certain persons transferred to the service of the board from undertakings acquired by the board.  Section 15 of the Bill is designed to permit the surrender of the whole or part of these supplementary pension awards in return for an appropriate annuity for a dependent, as may already be done in the case of ordinary pensions.</P>
    <P>Under Section 14 of the Superannuation Act of 1942, the board are empowered to add up to ten years to the period of pensionable service of employees who were 40 years of age or over on the passing of the Act. Under Section 15 of the Act they are also empowered to pay supplementary pension allowances to certain persons transferred to the service of the board from undertakings acquired by the board.  Section 15 of the Bill will permit the surrender of the whole or part of these supplementary pension awards in return of an appropriate annuity for a dependent, as may already be done in the case of ordinary pensions.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill is intended to remove any doubts which may exist regarding the dates of operation of amendments to the existing superannuation schemes of the board.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 17 is to amend certain provisions of the manual worker's superannuation scheme which have been in dispute between the board and members of that scheme for a number of years following the introduction of an amending scheme in 1952.  It is a complicated problem which would take some time to explain to the Seanad.  The position, however, is <Col N="69" /> that after various efforts to resolve the dispute were unsuccessful, some time ago a compromise solution of the difficulties was agreed between the parties and as I am satisfied that the solution is fair and reasonable, the necessary section has been introduced to implement it.</P>
    <P>The next provision of the Bill is Section 18, which refers to the rate of interest payable by the board on loans made to them by the trustees of the superannuation funds.  Section 14 of the 1949 Act provided that the rate should not exceed 4 per cent. With the increases in interest rates which have taken place in recent years this rate is no longer realistic and a position has now arisen in which the trustees can secure a better return on their funds elsewhere. Unless, therefore, provision is made for the payment of a more attractive rate of interest they may invest their funds wholly outside the board.  As these funds represent a useful source of additional finance for the board, this would be most undesirable.  It is proposed, therefore, to remove the limit of 4 per cent.  In view of the possibility of further fluctuations in interest rates generally it would be inappropriate to fix another figure in substitution for the existing limit, and it is proposed, therefore, to provide merely that the rate payable shall not exceed that charged at the time on advances from the Central Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word or two on Section 3 and I want to welcome the Government's decision to extend the facilities for the completion of rural electrification.  We have been chopping and changing with this policy over the years, but, despite that, we have managed to bring light to a great part of rural Ireland.  I suppose it is true to say that the more difficult and the more remote regions have yet to be tackled.  The Minister points to the fact that the areas left to be exploited are probably the most uneconomic and will prove a greater drain on the funds of the board than those which have already been developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge on the Minister that whatever the cost, this work must be <Col N="70" /> done.  Improvements have been brought about in rural Ireland over the years, but nothing has done more to brighten the lives of the people there than the expansion of the Shannon scheme.  The experience, however, of many enthusiastic country people in trying to bring current to their districts has been very discouraging in many cases.  The Minister is aware, as I am sure most Senators are, of cases where the enthusiastic few go out and canvass their neighbours to try to get the requisite number of signatories so that the scheme will be brought into the district.  At times, the results are very discouraging.</P>
    <P>I think there is a necessity for reconsidering the policy of the E.S.B. in regard to the returns which they must have before they start exploiting a particular district.  We are now into the more thinly populated and poorer areas and amongst a type of farming community, many of whom are not particularly concerned whether they get light into their areas and into their homes or not.  These are the people whom we must stir into a consciousness of their responsibility to their families, to their future and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Rural life, and living it to the full, is terribly important in the life of the nation and it must be the policy of the Government, and of the Oireachtas, to develop our national life to the full over the whole of the country.  Areas must not be left dark, silent and unexploited.  These are the areas into which the E.S.B. has now to go and they must go into them.  It is hard to get many of the people in these areas to move in this matter. They look at the cost and they find in many cases that the cost of installing power into their homes is prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of a case within the last month in an area which was almost completely exploited, with the exception of one or two homes. These are left out and now they can be given current only at a price which makes it prohibitive for them.  If the people are to live here, they will have to make other provision.  That situation must be conquered.  The standard of life in rural Ireland to-day is judged <Col N="71" /> by what light you have got on the scene and the day is now past when you can keep young people in the country, going around with oil lamps, candles, hurricane lamps and that sort of thing.  They will not stay in such surroundings and we can make up our minds about that.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, if we want to give serious consideration to the problem which must be conquered&mdash;keeping the people in the rural areas&mdash;the nation must do everything it can to make life attractive there, so that the people will stay there.  There is no doubt whatever that nothing is more conducive to a satisfied life in rural Ireland than having light in the home.  Light in the home not only means that men can see around them but that there will be light in their minds as well and that their minds can be opened.  They will have visions of things which were not open to them before.</P>
    <P>In my judgment, the first thing we have to do is to open the minds of the people.  We have got to open first the minds of the women and then they will open the minds of the men.  One would think that there was almost a conspiracy to keep those in rural Ireland in darkness and drive them out of rural areas altogether.  We are compelling them to live in conditions which, to them, are not acceptable.  I say that whatever the cost may be, this situation must be put behind us.</P>
    <P>I know that somebody from an urban or city area, or the financiers, will say: &ldquo;But it is costing too much.&rdquo; Any of us who have experience in local authorities know that we have all to put our hands in our pockets, living on the farms as we are, and make our contributions so that each local society will bring water and sewerage schemes in to all our towns and villages.  We are not bringing them out to the countryside, but the man on the hillside has to put his hand in his pocket and make his contribution so that the people in the towns and cities&mdash;the larger towns, anyhow&mdash; will have these amenities.  I do not quarrel with that at all, but I should like these amenities to be shared, and I hope nobody will have the hardihood <Col N="72" /> to rise in this House and suggest that this is a scheme which is very expensive, a scheme which, because of its extension to the rural districts and remote areas, which are costly to exploit, is raising the price of electricity to the consumers in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I can understand these people having a grouse, but I think that if they take the long view, they will agree that it is vital for this country to-day that we keep our people where they are on the land, even in the remote places, because if they leave that land, I do not know who is to work it.  It would not be difficult to take many more of them off it to-day and I think that by bringing light and power into the more remote rural districts at a price which they can pay, a price which will not be too high&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;too high&rdquo;, I mean that if the E.S.B. demands are of such a nature that the sum which the intending user will have to pay in his charge is too high, you will just not have light or power brought into that home&mdash;we will do much to keep them on the land.  The day is not too far distant when that home will no longer be a home.  We can have thousands of these and, goodness knows, we have more than enough of them already.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister for what is being done, but I want him to carry this work as far as he possibly can.  Let this work go on with all possible haste; let the E.S.B. not be afraid to go into the more remote and difficult regions; let them not demand such returns of people seeking light and power in their homes, with all the names in a book, as will justify them in deciding that it is an economic proposition. I do not think that, if the Minister is waiting for that from the various districts, he or anyone else in this House will see light in these homes.</P>
    <P>I hope what the Minister said will be justified by events and that by 1961 or 1962, this work will be completed and then we can say it is well done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with what Senator Baxter has said relative to rural electrification.  We should look on each farm, particularly the isolated farm, as an industry to <Col N="73" /> which we have to give light and power. Most of the produce with which the Government White Paper on farming deals can be converted for use by our live stock only by making power available for the grinding and crushing of the grain grown on the farm.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the eradication of bovine T.B. and better hygienic conditions, but without electricity in the cowshed and without washing facilities, it is impossible to have good hygienic conditions, not only in the cow parlour but in the home.  The will of the farmers to do the job and produce more&mdash;and that is the task and the challenge that is set for all of us&mdash;will be facilitated and enormously encouraged by the full development of rural electrification.</P>
      <P>Many of the people about whom Senator Baxter speaks, who live in the more isolated places, feel a certain sense of grievance that they are being overloaded in the charges, in that they have to pay double what their neighbours a mile or half a mile away have to pay.  I ask the Minister to consider these people as a producing element of our community rather than to look on rural electrification as an amenity or a luxury.  It has often been said that the luxury of to-day is the necessity of to-morrow.  For those people who are isolated, to-morrow has arrived.  They cannot carry out the tasks of their agricultural industry without rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real reason I rise to speak to-day is to touch on another facet of the board's activities which I mentioned on a previous occasion.  When electricity development took place in this country, it was necessary and obvious to everyone that it was an undertaking, responsibility for which the State would have to carry, and the powers which both Houses of Parliament gave in order to facilitate the acquisition of land and buildings, the submerging of bridges and all the enormous powers that have been given to the E.S.B.&mdash; which would naturally be given because they are acting in the common good&mdash;are all to be commended; but, to my mind, they have been allowed to engage in an activity in which we ought never to have allowed <Col N="74" /> them to engage and I hope the Minister will seriously consider withdrawing those powers from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to this one facet of the matter: the board are engaging in trading which I consider should be handed over to private individuals and I ask the Minister to consider that matter.  In all the important towns in Ireland, they have established showrooms.  That is all to the good because it advertises the uses of the appliances of modern ingenuity in the electric field, but I believe these should be sold and the work done by private individuals rather than by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that from all the surveys I have read of our economic position, we seem to be moving more towards statism than any country in Western Europe.  The Minister is a man of wide ministerial experience and he can appreciate as well as any of us, the desirability of seeing to it that this aspect of the board's activities will not be allowed to grow apace and to harm people who could do this business as well as, if not better than, the board.  I shall have an opportunity at another time to develop the point as to the advantages the board have with regard to finance, publicity and other rights which are denied to private traders, but I wish to take this opportunity, as I shall take advantage of every other opportunity afforded to me, to bring the matter to the attention of the powers that be <Col N="75" /> because I regard it as a highly undesirable development in our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct attention to a situation which is causing much concern among certain employees in the service of the E.S.B. It arises particularly in the case of persons who were excluded, by age, from certain allowances in the E.S.B. Superannuation Act of 1942.  The matter which gives rise to the dissatisfaction was caused, to a large extent, by the time-lag between the establishment of the board in 1927 and the coming into operation of the superannuation scheme in 1943 and the fact that a number of the employees had not attained the age of 40 at that time.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Act of 1942 provides for the payment to employees of 40 years and upwards at the time of the passing of the Act, of certain supplementary allowances over and above the pension in cases where the board is of opinion that owing to the age of the person on entering the scheme, such pension is unduly small but the allowances apply only to the 40 and upwards class.</P>
      <P>In the service of the board when the scheme began were a large number of employees who, while not 40 years of age, had a considerable number of years' service and although they will be credited with half of their prior service, they cannot qualify for pension at the full rate of 40 eightieths. There are some cases too where, even were the full years of service allowed, the employee would still be some years short of the maximum required to receive a full pension at age 65 but where special consideration would be justified.</P>
      <P>Much of the hardship to these employees could be removed if the Minister would agree to accept an amendment to Section 14 of the Act of 1942 which would delete the age limit, delete the fixed number of years that could be added and establish a right of appeal from the board's decision where the persons concerned were dissatisfied with the manner in which their pensions were computed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> In support of the claim being made on behalf of these employees it should be borne in mind that these early E.S.B. workers were not trained at the expense of the board.  Most of them entered the board as fully trained, experienced operatives and placed that skill and training at the service of the board when its survival and future success depended, in large measure, on such skill being available.  Many of these operatives gave up remunerative employment with promising prospects to serve the new enterprise.  They are, therefore, entitled in justice to receive a full pension having regard to their special value on entry.</P>
    <P>Any expense to the board in giving them what is only fair treatment should be set against the value they brought into the board at its formation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the board made certain regulations whereby employees could retrieve the balance of their prior service by the payment of additional superannuation contributions but as the time was 1943, in the height of the emergency difficulties, it proved impossible for most of the employees to pay the added contributions and very few in fact did so.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the claims of these early employees by accepting an amendment to the Act now before us.  The number of those concerned will diminish as time goes on and the cost will not be a recurring one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make rather emphasises what Senator Baxter and Senator Burke had to say. In a way, it is a particular case.  In a rural electrification area, which is usually an area of about five miles square, normally all the people who apply get light after their houses have been measured, and so on.  The board have a sort of plan of their own whereby, even in that area, if one or two or three houses are a little away from the rest or in a more distant corner of it&mdash;perhaps very old houses or houses some distance from the main line&mdash;the people in them must pay an extra charge.  In other words, the people who live in an <Col N="77" /> isolated or backward area are further penalised because they live there.  I should like the Minister to try to correct that position.  Surely the charge should be equal all round?</P>
      <P>I have particulars here of a case which will illustrate my point very well.  I wrote to the E.S.B. about it and I got a letter from them from Dundalk on 10th September.  I will not mention names.  They said that Messrs. D., M. and K. are three people in an uneconomic group.  That is what they call it; I prefer to call it a backward area.  They then said they quoted them the normal charge&mdash; Mr. D. 16/4, Mr. M. 13/9 and Mr. K. 15/1.  Now Mr. K. refuses to pay the special charge so back comes the E.S.B. inspector and says that Mr. D. and Mr. M. will have to pay extra charges of 8/2 and 6/2 respectively. I was informed only last week that one of these men, with the other, has either refused to take it or is moving out, with the result that another third charge will be put on the remaining man simply because he lives in a backward area, but still in an area that is part of a rural electrification scheme.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, in advising the Minister for Finance to grant these moneys, to look into cases of very particular hardship like that because these people live in a very backward area and yet they are charged more than the man who lives along a main road.</P>

      <P>We are dealing now with a most attractive and mouth-watering £100,000,000 monopoly, and this is an opportunity for us to ask some questions.  The Minister and his predecessor whenever they were asked questions by us in our efforts to seek information about some of the activities of the board, always replied that there was no function residing in the Minister.  This is now our opportunity. I shall be very brief and just ask a few questions.</P>

      <P>I shall ask just two questions.  I think it is an opportunity on which we might examine the entire picture.  I am wondering whether the work of this monopoly has been satisfactory to the consumers.  I would ask the Chair to allow me to support Senator Burke in this.  The Department and this House should examine whether or not the encouragement given to the board to engage in commercial trading in equipment has not been overdone and if it is quite fair to those who, by their taxes, support this board and have to compete and live against it. Above all, I would ask the Minister to convey to the board that we disapprove of the dragooning and brutal method of accounts collection practiced by the board to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent, the Bill removes the prohibition on the staffs of semi-State bodies from becoming members of the Oireachtas. We should all welcome the provision which establishes the principle that the staffs of semi-State bodies should be permitted to engage in politics.  We have heard so much in recent times about politicians and politics that it is a good thing the Oireachtas should decide that politics are not such a dangerous thing that the staffs of semi-State bodies should not engage in them and that they constitute no danger to the efficient operation of semi-State bodies that some members of their staffs are members of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regret I have to express on this aspect of the Bill is that the Bill provides, on the one hand, the right of members of the staff of E.S.B. to become members of the Oireachtas and in the next sub-section of the section, all but takes away that right. It takes away the right inasmuch as a member of the staff of the E.S.B. will be unable to sit in either House of the Oireachtas, although he should wish to do so and although the people may have expressed a desire that he do so, because he will be seconded from his employment and will receive no wages. I do not understand the necessity for that provision.  I think there is adequate precedent to cover the proposal I would make that a member of the <Col N="79" /> staff of the E.S.B. who becomes a member of the Oireachtas should be entitled to continue in his employment and to get such proportion of his wages as the board consider adequate in proportion to the amount of time he could spend in their service.</P>
    <P>If you look at the case of national teachers, you will find that a national teacher who becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas still receives his pay.  There was a time in the British days when it was unlawful for a member of the teaching profession to attend even a political meeting. With the advance of time and the strenuous efforts of the national teachers, they were enabled to attend political meetings and in more enlightened times, they have been able to sit in the Oireachtas and continue in their employment.  I do not see why there should be a discrimination between national teachers and the members of the staff of the E.S.B.  It is also true to say there have been members of the Oireachtas who have been employed by local authorities, people such as dispensary doctors, who were entitled to continue in their employment and receive their salaries, subject of course to their putting in a <i>locum</i> during their absence.  You also have the position of county medical officers who have been members of the Oireachtas.  As far as my information goes, I think members of the clerical staffs of local authorities have been continued in their employment while members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me that there is a great deal of use in giving members of the staff of the E.S.B. the right to sit in the Oireachtas, if it means they are solely dependent for their livelihood upon the allowance they get from the Oireachtas.  If a member of the E.S.B. staff did become a member of the Oireachtas, it would be a very dangerous thing if he had to depend on such an allowance to maintain himself and his family.  It might well be that such a person would have to seek other means of being subsidised.  Without casting any aspersions upon members of the E.S.B. staff who might become members of the Oireachtas in the <Col N="80" /> future, it is easy to see how an undesirable situation could arise where a person wanted to take his seat in the Oireachtas but at the same time had to rely upon outside sources in order to get sufficient money to support himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider leaving some discretion to the board which will enable them to pay a salary to persons becoming members of the Oireachtas in proportion to the amount of time they have could spend at their employment.  That probably would not impose any administrative difficulties or any undue expenditure on the board.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to deal with is the point made by Senator Miss Davidson in relation to superannuation. I understand that the position under Section 14 of the 1942 Act has not operated as advantageously for some members of the staff as it might. Under that section, the board have discretion to give the full ten years as additional allowance or whatever proportion they think fit.  In the case of some members of the staff, the allowance has been worked on a rule of thumb basis, by which half their service prior to 1943 has been given to them by way of years for an additional allowance.  That has not worked to the advantage of the staff.  If it were, at a minimum, compulsory on the board to give the full ten years, it would go some distance to meet the position of these people.</P>
    <P>As Senator Miss Davidson said, the time when this option to buy back their service prior to 1942 was given was a very unfavourable time financially for these people.  It was a time of a wages standstill Order.  In those circumstances, the persons who had to make that contribution found it extremely difficult.  In addition, the staff of the E.S.B.&mdash;I am quite certain it applies on the technical side and it must have applied equally on the clerical side&mdash;were recruited at a time when it was necessary that the newly-established E.S.B. would have people of experience.  That meant that these people were fairly advanced in years at that time.  Consequently, it meant <Col N="81" /> that if they had to pay for their prior service, they were at a disadvantage compared with people entering the service of the board at present.</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand the superannuation scheme of the E.S.B., which has been confirmed by Order of the Minister, the amount of the contribution payable by a person who wishes to get credit for prior service is related to the salary which the person had at the time he opted to pay for prior service.  That imposes a great hardship because a person might be on a salary of £800 at present and will have to pay a contribution in respect of £800, whereas for the years of service in respect of which he received credit he would have been on salary of £400 so that he is actually paying back more than he would have paid if the superannuation scheme had been in operation at the time.  The time lag that Senator Miss Davidson referred to was, indeed, undue.  It would be unfair that members of the E.S.B. should now be in a worse position than they would be in if, in the earlier Acts, provision had been made to enable the board to establish a superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>In contrast with the position in the E.S.B. you have the position under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, that the board is enabled, immediately on establishment, to set up a superannuation scheme so that its employees will not be faced with the type of situation with which employees of the E.S.B. were faced in 1943.</P>
    <P>I do not quite follow what the position is in regard to the increase in pensions. As far as I can see from the Bill, there are different categories of people who will get increases in pensions from apparently different dates.  Perhaps the Minister might expand on that in his reply.  I certainly welcome the provision enabling the board to increase pensions, even by the limited sum set out in Section 1.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, that is, the position in regard to the inhabitants of the area where the Fitzgibbon Bridge is or was&mdash;I do not know whether it has been submerged or not.  The case was made in the Dáil by the Minister that a majority of the local inhabitants <Col N="82" /> were agreeable to accept compensation and that the compensation offered by the E.S.B. was in some cases on quite a generous scale.  It appears that there is a minority who do not accept what it is proposed to offer them.  I think the Minister took the view that that was a case where the majority view should prevail.  It would be a very sorry day for this country, if we were not to have regard to the interest of minorities and even of individuals.</P>
    <P>If the E.S.B., in the interest of the common good, must submerge Fitzgibbon Bridge and if, in its own financial interests, it does not want to erect a bridge in its place, that is no reason why any individual citizen should be placed at a disadvantage.  I do not think the principle that the E.S.B. should be the sole arbiters of the amount of compensation payable even to one individual is a principle that would be acceptable to this House.  It is well established that no man should be a judge in his own cause and neither should any semi-State body be a judge in its own cause.  The Minister stated that there was no means by which compensation for disturbances in a case of this kind could be assessed.  It is certainly not beyond the wit of man &mdash;it is certainly not beyond the wit of the Minister&mdash;to devise ways and means by which compensation for disturbance can be assessed.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should reconsider Section 7 in the light of an Act of 1919 under which there is certain machinery for the appointment of arbitrators to give compensation to people, where land has been taken over.  I think there is also some provision in respect of disturbance in the Town Planning Acts.  We have a town plan for the City of Dublin and many people will be disturbed.  I do not know whether there is machinery in the present Town Planning Acts for assessing compensation in the case of people who are disturbed, but certainly some machinery should be devised.  If it is provided in Section 7 of the Bill, there will be some kind of precedent for the town planning situation, when it arises.  I would not at all agree that the E.S.B. should be the sole arbiters in regard to the compensation to which these people are entitled. <Col N="83" /> These people are entitled to have that determined by somebody who is independent.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks these people are being unreasonable&mdash;perhaps they are; I do not know&mdash;he can make provision whereby they will have to pay the cost of arbitration proceedings, in the event of their being awarded a lesser sum than they were offered. Then at least if people are being unreasonable and foolish, they will pay for their folly in that way.  At all events, we ought to see to it that these people are given the right to have this matter determined by some independent authority.</P>
    <P>The Long Title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to amend and extend the E.S.B. Acts of 1927 to 1955&rdquo;.  I should have thought that at this stage the time was opportune to amend Section 99 of the 1927 Act.  That section is the section under which the E.S.B. wields the arbitrary powers about which there have been so many complaints and to which Senator Barry has just referred.  I addressed a communication to the E.S.B. asking them upon what grounds of morality, of responsibility as a public utility and of fair play between a great corporation, such as the board, and a humble citizen they could justify the activity which they have been engaging in by disconnecting the supply of electricity. I received a reply from the board and they made no attempt to answer that question.</P>
    <P>The section in the 1927 Act confers upon the board the right to disconnect the supply from people who neglect to pay their accounts.  The trouble with semi-State bodies, with all statutory bodies, is that they have no right to do anything which they are not authorised to do under a statute. Consequently, since the duty is imposed on the board of connecting electricity for people and giving them current, there must also be a specific power included in the statute to enable them to disconnect current where people neglect to pay their bills.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely wide power but it is one which, in my opinion, was <Col N="84" /> intended by the Oireachtas to be used sparingly.  There are very few circumstances in which an individual citizen who has been deprived of his rights can forcibly enforce them against the person who deprives him of them.  If a landlord has a tenant who will not pay his rates, or his rent, the landlord, under the rule of law which prevails, cannot go in and throw him out with a crowbar.  That time has gone.  If a hire-purchase firm hires furniture to an individual and the individual falls down on his payments, the hire-purchase firm cannot go into that man's dwelling and take away the furniture without an order of the court.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that when the E.S.B., established for the benefit of the people, are given this extremely wide power, it should be used most sparingly and only under great provocation. The kind of provocation I would have in mind is where a person consistently refuses to pay his bill.  But the power has not been used in that way.  The power has been used in cases where people have paid their bill; it has been used in cases where people have not received bills, and it has been used in circumstances which ordinary people would condemn.  It would seem to me that the board is adopting the attitude of a bully.  It is using its powers tyrannically and there will always be a reaction.  In fact, I think there has been a reaction.  The board may justify its activities on the ground that it is necessary to do this to keep down costs, but in the long run, the board may very well find that it will not have kept down costs and will not have increased efficiency in administration.  Some people have already adopted the device of not submitting their accounts to the board when they submit their cheques. Then reference numbers have to be looked up and separate receipts made out, instead of endorsing the accounts furnished to the consumer.</P>
    <P>That is not going to contribute to efficiency and keeping down costs.  I wonder if the Minister would not consider amending the relevant section of the 1949 Act in order to make it obligatory on the board in certain <Col N="85" /> circumstances to apply to court for an order in the same way as other individuals must go to court to recover debts.  I do not think any difficulty should arise from the collection of accounts.  People know that they have to pay the electricity bill and the bills will be paid in the same way as people have to pay rates and rents.  It seems to me that the present activity of the board may well become a boomerang in that people may consider what devices they can adopt to bring the board to its senses.</P>
    <P>As I said, the matter upon which I should like to get some further information is the question of increases in pensions and perhaps the Minister might indicate the categories and classes to which they will apply in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to three sections in this Bill, two of which have been referred to just now by Senator O'Quigley.  The first is the section dealing with the rates of increase in pensions.  I notice seven different categories are mentioned. Starting with category (a), where the amount of pension does not exceed £100, some people are to get an increase under this Bill of 15 per cent.  I should like to ask a question along similar lines to that asked by Senator O'Quigley as to what kind of people are these retired employees of the E.S.B. who are struggling, at the moment, to live on a pension of £100? Are they people of very short-term service, or people whose original salary was so small as to warrant a pension of only £100?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that to expect such people, if they are in any numbers, to be satisfied with an increase of 15 per cent. is to ask something that we should not ask.  The last Act mentioned here in this section is the 1955 Act.  In 1955, the cost of living index stood at 131.  It now stands at 146 or perhaps a little more.  The figure of 146 was for May in 1958, and consequently even if we take the most recent year mentioned, 1955, for these Acts and compare it with May this year, we find that there has been an increase in the cost of living of something like 11½ per cent.  It is only <Col N="86" /> the first three of the categories mentioned here (a), (b) and (c), which are to be compensated at that rate or a little over.  Categories (d), (e), (f) and (g) are given less compensation by way of increases in pension than is a reasonable counterpart of the 11½ per cent. rise in the cost of living since 1955.  In other words, I think we should not be satisfied with the rate of increase in pensions here mentioned. I realise that these rates are common form, and this is not the first time I have risen to my feet in this House and protested against the niggardly rate of increase to pensioners.  I always have the feeling that if only pensioners had the capacity to organise a strike, their pleas might be more readily listened to and accepted. They cannot go on strike and consequently they frequently tend to be forgotten. This Bill does not forget them, but I suggest it deals with them with a niggardly hand.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister, if he has the figures available, how many people are in each of these categories (a) to (g) under this section, and what kind of people are these who are apparently now expected to live on pensions of £100 per year or less.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Section 15. We have had similar legislation before. This is the section which permits a man on retiring to surrender some of his pension which will be paid as an annuity to his widow when he dies. The point I should like to make is one I have made before in relation to a similar provision in another Bill.  It seems to me that the very pensioners who would be most concerned to surrender some proportion of their pension for the benefit of their widows, are those who might not be in 100 per cent. good health.  I am querying the justice or equity of putting a provision in sub-section (1) that it is only in the case of retired employees &ldquo;whom the board consider to be of good health&rdquo; that this concession will be given, allowing them to surrender some of their own pension, not somebody else's money, for the benefit of their widows.  That certainly would be a harsh provision because it seems to take away from those who might most <Col N="87" /> desire to make such a sacrifice the possibility of so doing.</P>
    <P>The other point relates to Section 7. I am sorry for referring to it in reverse order, as it were.  The point has been made, and well made, by Senator O'Quigley in relation to Section 7 that we ought not to accept, even in relation to a few people, the principle that the board itself shall decide whether it will pay any compensation and, if so, what amount, to people who are put to inconvenience by action of the board.  I simply want to support what Senator O'Quigley said there, and to appeal to the Minister as to whether he cannot find a formula whereby there might at least be an appeal to himself arising out of such compensation, or at any rate some mechanism of appeal, because as it is at present phrased, this Section 7 says in line 25 onwards:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the board may, if they so think fit, pay to that person compensation in respect of the loss or inconvenience aforesaid of such amount as the board consider reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to support what Senator O'Quigley said, that it does not seem just that the decision to pay compensation should be left entirely to the board without any appeal and that the decision as to what amount of compensation is equitably due should be left entirely to the board without appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of saying something about the E.S.B. and I should like to say that, in my opinion, the E.S.B. has been a very efficient organisation.  I think it was the first semi-State organisation set up in this country and it has done an amount of good work since its early days.  It is a fact that, of late, it has been getting into some difficult weather, both as regards cost of rural electrification and its efforts to improve its efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator Baxter said about the importance of rural electrification, but in urging rural electrification, we must appreciate that we are piling a burden on the E.S.B.  Up to <Col N="88" /> now, the E.S.B. has been dealing with an expanding and worthwhile economic market, but now we are asking them and encouraging them to expand in a part of the market which will be largely uneconomic.  I think they should expand in that direction, and should be encouraged to provide light and power in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is because of these difficulties that the E.S.B. has perhaps been trying to reduce its costs by collecting its bills more quickly than was previously the case.  All of us appreciate, I think, that money outstanding is not very much good, and that if accounts are paid up to date, costs will be affected appreciably; but unfortunately the E.S.B. have been lacking in tact, lacking in their public relations and have neglected to educate their consumers and the public generally as to the need for this improvement before using the heavy fist.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the E.S.B. must collect their bills and must collect them as quickly as possible, to keep their costs as low as possible, but I often wonder whether or not the approach to this might not be some method of fining the people who neglect to pay their bills currently.  It is true, of course, that these people who neglect to pay are a charge on the other consumers.  These people should be asked to bear that charge themselves, when they do not pay their bills and they have to be carried forward to another period and the E.S.B. should be permitted to put an extra charge on their bills, and of course eventually, if they do not pay, to disconnect the supply altogether and take court proceedings for the amount outstanding.  The E.S.B. in my opinion have been a little too hasty and lacking in tact in their approach to their consumers and they will not get the co-operation they would like to get because of that lack of tact.</P>
    <P>I direct the Minister's attention to Section 9 and ask for his sympathetic consideration and, I hope, the sympathetic consideration of Senators in relation to it.  The Minister said in the Dáil that his approach was to provide that the practice at present existing in <Col N="89" /> relation to C.I.E. employees elected to the Oireachtas should be extended to E.S.B. employees.  I do not think that is happening because so far as I know, the practice in C.I.E. is that where a person is elected to the Dáil, he can maintain his position in the superannuation fund, even, if he is in the fund, by paying both contributions, the board's contribution and his own contribution.  He is not limited and not pegged to the salary of which he was in receipt at the time of his election.</P>
    <P>The Minister can appreciate that rates in a particular job may vary over the years and so far as I know it is the practice in C.I.E. to allow a person contributing, maintaining his position in the superannuation fund, to have regard to the change in the rate payable for his job.  In other words, if he was employed as a clerical officer&mdash; some have been elected&mdash;at the time of his election and if the rate for that clerical officer grade changes, then the person concerned pays 10 per cent. or whatever it is of the new rate and not 10 per cent. of the rate of which he is in receipt at the time of being elected.</P>
    <P>That is good both for the individual concerned and for the superannuation fund and I feel that the board should be allowed discretion in this matter. They should not be tied as they are in paragraph 5 at the end of page 5.  That paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reference in this or the next following sub-section to the receipt by any person of remuneration from the board shall be taken as a reference to the receipt by that person of remuneration from the board at the rate at which he was being remunerated by the board on the last day of his whole-time employment....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The board and the individual should not be pegged down quite so tightly. It would be good for the superannuation fund and the individual, if account could be taken of the change in the rate of remuneration.</P>
    <P>I remember an instance in C.I.E. where a person had been in public life for quite a long time.  He was maintaining his position in the superannuation <Col N="90" /> fund, but he represented that if he had stayed in the service, quite obviously he would not be in the particular post he left ten or 15 years ago.  In other words, he would have had the opportunity of promotion and the probability was that he would have been promoted out of that post. I think the approach of the board, in agreement probably with the superannuation fund, was to recognise that there was justice in that claim and to permit the person to pay at an increased rate of contribution into the superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at that aspect to see if it would be right that a certain discretion should be allowed to the board, probably in consultation with the management committee of the superannuation fund affected, to take account of changes both in the rate for the job and the possibility that the person concerned could, if he had stayed on in the service, have got promotion from the post which he left.</P>

      <P>We all want to see rural Ireland brightened up.  What is the real position?  If any Senator who is a member of a local authority gets a request from businessmen, professional men and others to have a couple of lights in their village, we are told by the officials that it is not a scheduled village.  There are certain villages in my constituency where the people are paying for other villages while they themselves remain in the dark.  That is wrong.  That is happening all over the Twenty-Six Counties. The people in one village are paying for light in another.  Unless a businessman puts a light outside his door, that village is in darkness and there is no hope of getting light.</P>
      <P>In spite of all the lights to-day in certain parts of rural Ireland, I am conscious of the fact that you would not find a young man or woman there, no matter what light you put in the country.  They are gone because there is nothing to keep them in it.  Electricity will not keep them in the country and there is no use in talking about brightening it up.  We must provide other means.</P>

      <P>We often hear it said that rural Ireland should be brightened up.  Why is it not brightened up?  When you canvass a village and go into houses asking people if they will take electricity, what is the one snag they are afraid of?  It is that they would not be able to pay at the end of two months because their husbands might be unemployed or it might be a case of a widow or an old age pensioner in a cottage.  You will be told: &ldquo;I would like electric light all right but two months is too long to keep me without paying.  I would not have the money to pay the bill after two months.&rdquo;  Could there be any other way of collecting the money as it is a hardship on people who have no means?  Why not collect it weekly or monthly?  Why fix the period at two months?</P>
      <P>If you have not the money in two months' time your supply is cut off and that is happening in certain parts of the country.  When a man becomes unemployed, he has not the money to meet it from what he gets from the employment exchange.  He cannot afford it.  Let us be candid and honest with one another.  Then, again, the valuation goes up.  I hear farmers complaining that when they get electric light, their valuation goes up.  That is not encouragement to a man to brighten up his home.  Something must be done with regard to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have three semi-State bodies&mdash; E.S.B., C.I.E. and I.T.A.  Some of us have been members of local authorities for a number of years.  Whenever a question is asked in the Dáil or if you write to the Department in connection with any of these bodies, you will be told that the Minister has no function in the matter and that you should write to the board, company or association concerned.  Although the Government are voting money every year to these bodies, the Minister has no function; that is wrong.  If the Minister has no function, then the ratepayers who are voting the money ought to have a say.  But nobody has a say&mdash;only the board.  The board is <Col N="92" /> the boss, no matter what we say or do. Even the Minister is powerless.  That is the position in the country at the moment; no one in charge to answer for these bodies and Ministers have no functions.</P>
    <P>There should be some way whereby, when the Minister receives representations from a local authority, he can say to the officials: &ldquo;You must do something for these people.  The people are paying.  You must give them light.&rdquo;  Surely that would be better than putting it off from one day to the other?  That is why some people will not sign.</P>
    <P>I had to canvass in my constituency on a few occasions.  The parish priest called a meeting.  He brought the county councillors and all the people to the hall and tried to get them to sign in order to get the light in the country.  We were met with that opposition from poor people who were afraid they would not be able to meet the demand after two months.  The same thing happened in the town, where there are many houses.  There is a demand every two months.  You have the rent of the house, which is very dear, and the electricity bill.  You have to pay either one or the other. It goes over a couple of months.  After four months you will get a final notice and the supply will be cut off if you do not pay the bill.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for a long time.  In our town, the water is pumped by electricity. Some years back, when the officials came to the urban council, they told the members of the council that the more was pumped, the lower the cost. But that is not the case to-day.  Pumping water by electricity is a very heavy burden.  I suppose the same will apply as time goes on.  When you get it in, you are yoked to it.  Then they scourge you and charge you what they like and you have no redress.  If the Minister could do something with regard to the payment every two months in certain areas, it would help the people there and encourage them to have electricity installed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Just looking over this Bill and its sections, I think we are all more or less in general agreement with <Col N="93" /> its provisions and the objects it sets out to attain.  But I find, listening to the Minister and looking over the several sections of the Bill, that I am provoked to some general ideas and thoughts to which I should like to give expression in a very few words.</P>
      <P>We all agree that the E.S.B. have done a magnificent job of work and are an admirable organisation in every way.  I think they are a model organisation in this country.  We can be proud of the way in which they carry out their duties, on the whole, and of the appearance of their machinery and stock everywhere.  On that point, I wish I could say the same about some of our other State organisations.  I wish I could say that the outward appearance of their goods, their staff, and so on, is as good as that of the E.S.B.  If such were the case, we could be very proud of our State and semi-State bodies generally.</P>
      <P>I agree with the provision by the Minister for the expansion of rural electrification which is proposed in this Bill.  I think Senator Baxter's remarks on this point were very apt. We are all in agreement with the idea of making our rural areas bright and attractive for people to live in because of the effect their way of living has on their minds and eventually on their actual way of working.  I think, in a way, it can be said&mdash;without any degree of insult or anything like that&mdash;that our people who come from the country are rather heavy looking.  I said this once before when talking about the Army.  You would not take long to recognise an Irishman from the country at Euston Station, London. That may be all right on the Abbey Stage, and so on.  I think we would like to see our people mentally smartened up, dressed smartly, and so on.  All these things arise originally from the home.  If people live in bright, clean homes where they have light, electricity, water, and all the other amenities, they will not only look different in the future but act differently.  In that way the provision of electricity in the rural areas will have a very great ultimate effect on the lives of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Burke and <Col N="94" /> other speakers who have spoken about the question of the activities we are asked here to support with money&mdash;the activities of the board in giving supplies and services to the people.  It is only right that they should be asked to confine their activities to providing supplies and services that cannot reasonably be provided by private enterprise. Undoubtedly, the E.S.B. have been trading in electrical supplies and equipment in competition with private enterprise and traders who contribute to the very existence of the E.S.B. It is rather hard luck on people who can only provide moneys for the E.S.B. through their way of business, if the E.S.B. compete more or less unfairly with them because of the immense facilities the E.S.B. have from other sources.  Very often, these people have only their own trade from which to make a living.  This is a matter of general principle which applies to other State bodies.  Other State bodies definitely intrude on the realm of private enterprise.  They were never intended to do so, and I believe they are doing positive harm to our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from Section 108 at page 40 of the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government favour the system of private ownership of industry and will not be disposed to enter any manufacturing field&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I presume this applies to commercial fields as well&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in which private enterprise is already operating successfully.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very praiseworthy principle and one that ought to be more meticulously carried out.  We have here the example of the E.S.B. where it is not carried out, and this is a cause of much annoyance and difficulty for traders.</P>
    <P>Again, on page 34, Section 90, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Special reference should, of course, be made to particular industrial schemes which, for reasons of public policy or because it is <Col N="95" /> considered unlikely that they will be initiated by private interests, it is proposed to sponsor as Government projects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the things I refer to are not things that have not been initiated or sponsored by private interests?  They definitely are being so sponsored and were initiated and in existence before the E.S.B. came into being.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to that aspect and ask him if something could be done, not only in the case of the E.S.B. but in the case of other State bodies as well.</P>
    <P>As I have said before, I believe the whole future of our economy lies in the happy co-ordination of State enterprise and private enterprise.  At the moment, we have gone as far as we can with State enterprise.  I believe that is recognised by the Government in their statement in this booklet. I feel that, now and in the future, our great and only chance of development is on the private enterprise side of our economy, in co-ordination with our State organisations.  The E.S.B. provides power and light, the lifeblood of our industrial economy.  If that body can be properly geared in a sensible manner with our private enterprise economy, both can move in harness together towards a brighter future and much greater expansion in our industrial and commercial economy.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that up to now we have been putting far too much emphasis on State enterprise.  In fact, I believe it is the cause of our lagging behind.  We have the slowest rate of development of any European country, outside the Iron Curtain.  I should like to qualify that by saying it is not a note either of despair or too much criticism.  It is saying that we have now prepared the ground and, through State enterprise, we have got the foundation upon which we can build; but we have built sufficient foundation and we should now build the structure on top of it.</P>
    <P>These are general remarks, and this is not the first time I have said them. I will continue to say them so long as <Col N="96" /> I am here, because I believe in them so deeply.  I believe we have never really got down to things in the way I have been expressing day in and day out.  I think I can say that that seems to be the philosophy expressed in the recent booklet produced by the Secretary of the Department of Finance.  I was happy to see that and I hope the Government in future will take their lead from some of the headings in that statement.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to commend the E.S.B. for what it is and what it has done.  I trust that this Bill will enable it to become even bigger and better than it is at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small point in Section 7 I should like to raise.  It is a point of general interest, which seems to me to be bad from the point of view of legislation. If the House looks at Section 7, they will find that the E.S.B. can, in the matter of the Fitzgibbon Bridge, act as an interested party and as judge in its own case.  The Minister has explained that.  He has told us that the amount of compensation is already agreed on.  That goes far enough to meet the present case, but it does seem to me a matter of some seriousness that we should be passing this section which may act as a precedent for future pleas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we read this Bill as it stands, it looks as if we are sanctioning the principle that in certain cases of inconvenience, the board may award compensation and award such compensation as they think reasonable; but against that the people who are being inconvenienced according to this measure have no right of appeal, no right of saying: &ldquo;We do not think this reasonable compensation.&rdquo; If I am wrong in that, I hope the Minister will correct me and I will not continue; but as I read this section, it is not made clear that the amount of compensation is already determined.  I think there is some danger here that later on in this House we will be told: &ldquo;Well, the E.S.B., according to Section 7 of this Act, have the right to award compensation, if it thinks fit and such compensation it thinks fit, without any further appeal. <Col N="97" /> If my fears in this respect are unwarranted, I should be grateful if the Minister would put that right, but I should like to put it on the record here that I personally and many members of the House are very hesitant to pass a section which makes the board both an interested party and judge in its own case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the debate, many Senators referred to the rural electrification scheme.  It seemed to me that their remarks indicated a certain lapse of memory as to what this scheme contemplated.  I would strongly agree with those Senators who said that the rural electrification scheme was the most important social development, so far as the rural areas are concerned, in our time. Indeed, I so described it when putting the scheme and the legislation to put it into effect through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>That scheme required a great deal of very careful preparation and estimation before it was committed to writing. Finally, after a great deal of examination of the possibilities of bringing a supply to the rural areas, what seemed to be a practical scheme emerged.  The problem was this and Senators, I think, have not completely grasped it: whether you could supply electricity to a rural area at a rate of charge which would induce rural dwellers to take supplies in sufficient number as to make it technically possible.  It was considered in the end practicable to go ahead with that scheme on two understandings. One was that half the capital cost would be provided free of charge and the other that the E.S.B. would not be obliged to bring the supply to any house where the cost of bringing it to that house was more than 16 times the fixed revenue charge to be derived from the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole scheme was based on the assumption that the rural dwellers would get a supply of electricity upon the basis of what was then the rural tariff of the E.S.B.  That 16 to one calculation was vital to the whole scheme because its practicability depended on it.  On the basis of that calculation, it was assumed that 70 per <Col N="98" /> cent. of our rural dwellers could get the supply at that rate or charge.  In respect of the other 30 per cent., it was accepted that they just could not be supplied under that scheme or at that rate of charge.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the coming into operation of the scheme, that ratio was altered from 16 to one to 24 to one and the E.S.B. undertook to supply current at the standard charge to any dwelling where the cost of bringing the network to the door was not more than 24 times the fixed charge revenue.  In cases where that ratio could not be realised and where the cost of bringing the wire to the dwelling was more than 24 times the fixed charge, an additional charge had to be paid by the person receiving the supply, or by someone else.</P>
    <P>When I was in opposition some years ago, I raised in the Dáil the question of abolishing this additional amount which some of our rural dwellers have to pay because they cannot be brought within the scheme.  I thought that the amount of revenue which the board was getting from these additional special charges was so small in relation to the board's total revenue that the board could easily carry it, but I found out that was not so and that the abolition of the special charge would mean that other rural dwellers would have to pay at least an increase of 10 per cent. in the cost of the current, if the charge were abolished.</P>
    <P>It is true that these houses, which cannot be supplied without some additional contribution from the occupiers because they cannot be brought within the scheme, are generally isolated, but that does not mean that they are occupied by people who are poorer than the rest of the community.  The most uneconomic area would be a place in County Meath with three or four residences.  The most economic area was found to be near Spiddal in County Galway which was largely populated and where the average standard of living would be much lower than in the area I mentioned in County Meath.  Consequently, we must not always think in this matter in terms of helping out a section of the people who are entitled to some help from the community <Col N="99" /> resources which the rest of the community cannot get.</P>
    <P>The rural electrification scheme is now almost complete.  Naturally, the E.S.B., having regard to their financial difficulties and to the problem of raising capital for various purposes in recent years, were inclined to drag their feet on the rural electrification scheme.  They proposed to me that they should stop at this stage and only take it up again at a later date.  I did not agree to that.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas decided during the course of the war that the rural electrification scheme should start, because of the benefits it would confer on rural dwellers, when the war was over and supplies of materials were available in sufficient quantities to enable a beginning to be made.  I stated then that the intention was to complete the scheme in ten years. There was quite a large number of people who said it could not be done. It was not done in ten years, but it will be done in 12 years.</P>
    <P>I dislike interfering with the administration of bodies like the E.S.B., but I told them in regard to this matter of policy, namely, the completion of the rural electrification scheme, that they had no choice; that the rate of development was a matter for themselves but that the intention of the Government to get it completed within a certain time must be met.  They have undertaken to complete the scheme by 31st March, 1962.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that the scheme will involve a substantial deficit upon the board's rural revenue account&mdash;a deficit that will have to be offset by a surplus secured from other activities which they undertake, particularly the activity of selling electricity in urban areas.  One of the calculations upon which the finances of the scheme were based in 1942 was that in the post-war period the cost of materials would be 33? per cent. higher than before the war.  That was the optimistic mood we were in in 1942.  That assumption was proved to be completely incorrect, with the result that even if we had <Col N="100" /> been able to stick rigidly to the line laid down in the scheme published to the Oireachtas, the financial results of the whole operation would be different. The board must now carry the rural deficit for as long as is necessary. Eventually, the deficit will be wiped out.  But not for about 20 years.</P>
    <P>Senators Burke and McGuire referred to the merchandising activities of the board.  I have an open mind as to whether the ordinary merchant selling electrical equipment or providing electrical service has suffered or gained from the competing activities of the board.  If I were asked to make a decision, I would say he gained and gained considerably.  The merchandising activities of the E.S.B., the operation of their showrooms, their advertising campaigns and the general sales promotion activities upon which they engage redound to the benefit of private traders.  I find that individual traders have no hesitation in admitting that.  I believe that the general level of the sales of electrical appliances would be a great deal lower, if the board had not entered into that field. It is in the interests of the board that individual private merchants should be as active as they are in promoting the sales of electrical appliances and bringing to the notice of the public the advantages that will accrue from a greater use of electricity in the home.</P>

      <P>The board went to every individual merchant and said that if he sold electrical appliances on the hire purchase scheme, the board would finance his operations.  Surely that was not a sign of hostility to the private merchant?  Indeed, the whole aim of the board is to try to encourage merchants to be more active in seeking sale for their appliances, and thereby increase the sale of electricity.  I think it would mean a very considerable falling off in activity in that field, if the board were to step out of it.</P>

      <P>I will deal with the <Col N="101" /> matters raised here in the order in which they were raised.  Senator Miss Davidson and others referred to the pension scheme of the E.S.B. I want to be quite specific about this.  I brought in that pension scheme in 1942.  There is always a problem, it is true, when a pension scheme based upon the creation of a pension fund, with equal contributions from the employer and employee, is created in an organisation which has already been some time in existence.  The problem of service prior to the date of introduction of the scheme has to be dealt with.  The E.S.B. pension scheme is a contributory scheme based on a fund which is managed by a committee and which has to be kept solvent by them on the basis of the contributions it receives.</P>
      <P>In respect of those who were 40 years of age and over on the date on which the scheme was brought into operation, the board was empowered to provide for the payment of supplementary pensions out of their own resources, without contribution.  That was to meet the problem of those who, because of age on that date, could not benefit by the other provisions of the scheme, or were unlikely to be willing to do so because of the cost to them.  Another provision was that the board were required in respect of that prior service to pay their contributions so that the employee got pension rights in respect of half his prior service free of cost to him.  An employee could get rights in respect of the other half of his prior service by increasing his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, 18 years later, a number of E.S.B. employees who did not elect to buy their prior service want to get the benefit of it free of charge.  I think that is impossible.  It would disrupt the whole scheme and it would be completely unfair to all those who, over the past 18 years, have been paying higher contributions in order to earn that right.  I do not think they have any grievance.  I think the statement made by Senator Miss Davidson that some people surrendered better prospects in other employment in order to serve the E.S.B. is very strictly for the birds.  Both then and now, persons who are in permanent, pensionable employment with the E.S.B. are regarded <Col N="102" /> as the favoured members of the community.  So far as the additional supplementary pension to persons over 40 years of age when the scheme was introduced is concerned, my information is that the board has been extremely liberal under that section.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by a number of Senators&mdash;Senators Barry, O'Quigley and others&mdash;to the board's collection methods.  Whatever may be said about their collection methods&mdash; I am not going into a discussion on them&mdash;I think it is deplorable to hear Senators suggest that when the board goes to some person who has taken a supply of electricity, has not paid for it and is cut off, they are depriving that person of his rights.  It is deplorable that members of the Oireachtas should try to encourage people into thinking that they have a grievance when they suffer penalities for not paying their debts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may be that the board's method of collection, the periods over which they charge their accounts and other arrangements of that kind, could be modified and improved.  I do not know about that; it is a matter for the board to consider.  Nobody is entitled to a supply without paying for it and it is necessary to keep in mind that the great majority of the people who are customers of the E.S.B., and who are paying regularly for their supply are paying a bit more than they need pay in order to make up for the people who are defaulting on their obligation to pay promptly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the rights of employees of the board to seek election to both Houses of the Oireachtas, what we are doing in this regard is something that might have been done long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1927 Act set up the E.S.B. as the first of these State bodies and there was this strong feeling that persons who are members, or employees, of <Col N="103" /> that board should not be in the Oireachtas.  That problem was met by providing that if they were employees of that board, they could not go up for election.  Since then, the constitutionality and desirability of that method had been questioned and now the matter is put the other way around. Members of the Oireachtas may not be members or employees of the board without resigning membership, but everybody is free to seek election and if he secures election, he is free to make his choice.  What we are doing is just putting the E.S.B. in the same position as other State organisations.</P>
    <P>I think it would be highly undesirable to contemplate the position where a person could be a member of the Oireachtas and at the same time, a member of the E.S.B. and perhaps be able to speak on its affairs with greater authority than the Minister.  Whatever we may feel about politics, it is to be recognised that there will be difficulties created if people who are active in politics and members of the Oireachtas are also employees of a State body dealing with members of the public, or working with other employees or with subordinate staff under their supervision. Therefore, we have established in regard to all these State bodies that a member of the Dáil or Seanad may not be on the board or in the service of these bodies.  However, we provide that they may seek election and, if elected, can be seconded from the service of these organisations and have the right to re-employment when they lose their membership of the Oireachtas or retire and their pension continuity is also provided for.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the intention to put the E.S.B. Staff member in the same position as the C.I.E. staff member in this respect and by and large that has been done, but certain different considerations, due to circumstances, arise.  In the case of a member of the staff of the E.S.B. who gets elected to the Dáil and wants to maintain service pension rights in the E.S.B. fund he can continue to pay on the basis of the salary which he was receiving at the time he became elected.  This is the only practical arrangement and, in <Col N="104" /> certain circumstances, it is protection for the individual because in the last resort, the pension he will get at the age of 65 will be based not on the size of his contribution but on the salary he is actually earning on that date.</P>
    <P>I propose to say a word about Fitzgibbon Bridge, because there has been some misunderstanding with regard to the obligations of the E.S.B. in that regard.  The board had the duty of providing a bridge, but they asked me to release them from that duty because of the technical difficulties and very high cost involved.  I said that I would not release them, unless they could get agreement with the people directly concerned to accept compensation in lieu of building the bridge.  They said: &ldquo;Must we get the agreement of them all?&rdquo; and I said that it should be the agreement of a substantial majority.  I understand that they have the agreement of ten out of 14, that they are expecting to complete agreements in other cases, and that there are only a couple of cases where people have not agreed to accept compensation.  In one case, indeed, there may even be some question of the validity of a claim.</P>
    <P>The position is that unless we pass this section, the people concerned will get neither a bridge nor compensation, because the board, in consideration of the fact that they have already concluded agreements with the individuals concerned, have already been released from the obligation to build a bridge, and the final step in the whole process is the passing of this section, which will empower the board to pay the compensation.  They have not got that power now, because it was never contemplated that they would compensate for the closing of a public road or bridge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is a misunderstanding of the position in this regard.  The board want to pay compensation.  They say: &ldquo;We are <Col N="105" /> going to spend a lot of money building a bridge that very few people will use, and it will not even be built in the most convenient place.  Would it not be far better to give that money to the people concerned and let them use it for their own benefit rather than waste it in a rather futile type of construction, because it would be a costly bridge and one which only very few would use?&rdquo;  The board have been negotiating the amounts of compensation and their intentions are quite generous.  The suggestion that we should bring in an arbritrator to deal with the question of values is impracticable, and it also implies that we should go on some legalistic basis of calculating the actual amount of loss.  Approached in that way, the people concerned would get a great deal less, because the financial loss they could prove to have suffered would be considerably less.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most concerned not to establish such a precedent, and I wish to say here and now that the fact that we have agreed to pay these sums in compensation to certain people in the area of the Lee hydro-electric scheme is not to be taken as a precedent involving the board in paying compensation for alleged loss on the closing of a public road in any future case.</P>
      <P>I do not know what terms of reference you could give an arbitrator, and I should hate having to draft them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was given to understand that because certain legal proceedings had been started by a few people in the area against the board, these people may fear that the board will retaliate now by prescribing lower compensation in their cases than in the cases of people who are not associated with those proceedings.  In the Dáil, I have given a very specific assurance that no such prejudice shall operate and that the rates of compensation fixed in the remaining cases will be in line with the general level of those fixed in <Col N="106" /> cases in which it was done by agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill I am now submitting to the Seanad has as its main purpose an increase in the remuneration limit for insurability under the Social Welfare Acts of persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour.  As Senators are aware, this remuneration limit, which has always been a feature of our social insurance schemes, has been increased from time to time.  The present limit of £600 was fixed by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Because of increases in wages and salaries over the past few years many persons have ceased to be insurable due to their remuneration having exceeded the £600 limit, and thus are no longer eligible for the benefits to which they were formerly entitled and for which they may have paid contributions over a long period. It is considered that the raising of the remuneration limit to £800 would restore insurance cover to such persons, and thus bring back within the scope of the scheme the classes to which the scheme was originally intended to apply.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps explain that the Bill makes no change in the position of manual workers.  Such workers are insurable irrespective of their rate of remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons whose employment ceased to be insurable by reason of their remuneration having exceeded the £600 limit, and who again become insurable on the coming into operation of this Act, would not, because of the gap in their contribution records, be able to satisfy the contribution conditions for benefit for a substantial period.  It is considered that some concession should be made in these cases, as the <Col N="107" /> deficiency in contributions could not be remedied by any action the insured persons could themselves take.  Subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Bill provides for the crediting of contributions in respect of a period sufficiently long to enable such persons, if they already have 26 contributions paid, to satisfy the contributions conditions for benefit on again becoming insurable.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 3 provides for the crediting of contributions to persons becoming eligible for a new benefit.  This is a general provision not specifically related to the main purpose of the Bill.  As Senators will have seen, from the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, the need for this provision arises from the fact that persons who are insurable for limited benefits only could, by regulations, be made eligible for a new benefit.  Their previous contributions would not count for purposes of the new benefit, and it is proposed to credit contributions to them on the same lines as contributions are credited to new entrants to insurance generally.</P>

      <P>This is another Bill made necessary by the fall in the value of money.  It has some very interesting points about it.  A person with £800 a year is now eligible for health benefits and for certain social welfare benefits.  It would appear to me that under the Health and Mental Treatment Bill, a person may now have £1,100 a year and be eligible for benefits.  I am not objecting to that, but it would appear that we will very soon be in the position when a person may be liable for payment of surtax on £1,500 a year and at the same time, eligible for social welfare benefits, which to me would seem to be the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of our whole treatment of the position arising from the fall in the value of money.  Some people are getting benefit out of it; others are getting none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the position with regard to Dublin City, about which I happen to know something.  It appears to me that if money is to be spent, it might be spent perhaps in at least as desirable a way as this Bill contemplates.  In Dublin, for example, <Col N="108" /> there are more than 250 out-patient clinics.  In these clinics, before the Health Act came into operation at all, a great number of patients came in, usually at the recommendation of a general practitioner.  They were treated very often by specialists and asked no questions about their means, but treated well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a long overdue amendment of the income limit for insurance.  I know that the limit of £600, which was fixed, I think, in 1952, is long out of date and I know the trade unions interested in the problem have been pressing for a considerable time for an amendment.  I am sorry that action was not taken to amend that income limit long ago and sorry also that when the Minister has come to amend it, he stops at £800.</P>
      <P>I should prefer not to see any limit at all, but if there has to be a limit, certainly it should not be £800, because with the ever-increasing cost of living, especially in the past 12 months or so, the £800 limit will be very quickly out of date and the trade unions will have to press again for a further amendment.</P>
      <P>I have read the Bill and I have read the explanatory memorandum.  I know I am rather stupid but I still find it very hard to understand exactly what is happening.  I am particularly concerned about bringing back into benefit those who since 1952 have gone out of benefit, because of exceeding the £600 per annum income limit. As I understand it, the Bill will give these people who are now being brought back into benefit 104 credits. These are not sufficient to bring them into immediate benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That satisfactorily disposes of that question.  Another aspect of it is that this amending Bill could very well bring people into benefit on a salary scale of £775.  They are brought back into benefit and they could get a normal increment this year or the year after which would bring them over £800.  They would then go outside the limit again.  I am wondering if these people have the right to maintain their position for widows' and orphans' benefits by paying voluntary contributions.</P>

      <P>Three years?  My information is not right then.  Supposing they are now brought back, supposing they were insured previously and are now brought in under £800 for the next two years.  They then go over £800 and they have not the right to continue on as voluntary contributors. I think in large measure we may be taking contributions from them under false pretences.  We are not giving them the same rights as other contributors have of maintaining their position with voluntary contributions for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look at this aspect.  I should not imagine there would be many involved, but it does seem that provision might be made for such people to opt to maintain benefits for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like <Col N="110" /> to support what the last speaker has been saying.  I approve of this Bill and I am glad to see it coming in. I do not think, however, that it goes far enough, and, in fact, I do not think I am misinterpreting Senator Murphy when I say I agree with him in feeling that it should go all the way.  So far as the scheme in practice is concerned it would be better if the scheme were to cover the whole community and not apply a means test.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has told us, this is a Bill mainly to increase the remuneration limit.  I notice it jumps from £600 to £800&mdash;a jump of 33? per cent.&mdash;since 1952, since it was first established.  I wonder is there an implied suggestion there that in 1952 a remuneration of £600 a year is equivalent in 1958 to £800 a year. If that is the case, may we hope to see some kind of echo, as it were, in Government policy in relation to increased pensions and so on?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, if he has figures to show us, or a reasonable estimate, as to how many people are affected by this change, how many people, including dependents, is it calculated would be brought in under the scheme by this change in the remuneration limit?  I should also like to ask him if he has figures&mdash;I think the last Minister for Health had them at his disposal because he mentioned them in the form of a proportion when he was introducing the voluntary health insurance scheme legislation&mdash;what proportion of our community will this new arrangement bring in under the scheme, what proportion of our community will it cover, will it be four-fifths, five-sixths, seven-eighths or just what percentage or proportion, what fraction of the community will now be covered by our social welfare legislation?  I have a feeling that the figure may not be very far from seven-eights.  If so we may soon reach the position, I hope, where practically the whole community will be under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for figures on that, if he has them readily available.  Arising out of that, and arising out of my <Col N="111" /> suggestion that the proportion of the community which will now be covered by this will be a pretty big fraction, why do the Government still feel that they cannot go all the way?  I want to advert to the fact that in establishing whether or not a particular patient qualifies for the scheme, whether he has £800 or £815 and whether, in fact, he qualifies, he is to be asked a lot of questions when he fills in his form applying for the benefit.  I suggest that out of every 20 questions, about 12 relate to his means in one way or another, and consequently half the amount of form filling required under the social welfare scheme could be cut down if the means test, of which this Bill still remains a symbol, were to be abolished. In other words, it would be an enormous administrative simplification if we were to go all the way, and to bring in everybody into the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another question I would ask is how will this affect landowners and farmers?  As I understand it, it was not merely people with an income not exceeding £600 a year who were in under the scheme but also farmers whose valuation was not more than £50.  It seems to me that the two categories came in under the scheme.  I am prompted to wonder whether, by some dispensation, the cost of living has not gone up since 1952 for farmers, or why is it that no change in the valuation under which their land must fall in order to qualify under this scheme is contemplated? Why is there no change?</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask whether an examination has been made of the manner in which the voluntary health insurance scheme will be affected by this increase.  As I understand it, a pretty large section of people between the £600 and £800 a year level who might be regarded as the big market, as it were, for voluntary health insurance will now come in under the free or semi-free scheme.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether any representations have been made on behalf of those concerned that admission to the voluntary health insurance scheme, as a <Col N="112" /> non-profit venture by the Government, or whether any expression of concern on their behalf has been put forward&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would put that question to the Parliamentary Secretary, if I may, as to how many potential subscribers to that scheme he thinks are lost by this Bill.  A great number of potential subscribers cease to be potential subscribers if they are to be given it free and do not have to insure.  I think that is germane to our discussion to-day.  In other words, is the voluntary health insurance scheme jeopardised?</P>
      <P>This is my last question.  I am sorry to appear to inundate the Parliamentary Secretary with the questions, but this is the last one.  Have the doctors been consulted?  As I understand it, I may again be misinterpreting it, but, at the stroke of a pen, by this Bill, in fact, there will be a transfer of a large section of paying patients to free treatment or partially free treatment.  I take it that, under the terms of previous legislation, the doctors have to comply. Therefore, I would like to ask if they have been asked their opinion.  I do not think it unreasonable to ask that question.  I think courtesy would demand that they be at least consulted. I would ask also whether any related suggestions have been made for increased rates of medical fee or remuneration in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which can best be discussed in Committee. There are a number of points which I want to make.  First of all, a scheme of legislation which applies to so many people ought to be drafted in a way that is intelligible to people who want to know their position at any time in relation to benefits, contributions and the like.  It is not at all clear from this Bill what is in fact being done.  We <Col N="113" /> know in a broad way that the income limit has been raised from £600 to £800 per annum; but, after that, when it comes to the question of how people will fit into the new situation, it is very difficult to find out what precisely their position is.  For that reason, I think it might be better to deal on the Committee Stage with a number of the points I want to make.</P>
      <P>Here is a particular point which I wish to draw to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary.  There are quite a number of people who were compulsorily insurable under the 1952 Act and who, with the increases in salaries arising either out of increases in the cost of living&mdash;getting increases in their salaries through increases in the cost of living&mdash;or because they are on a scale, exceeded the £600 per annum limit and therefore ceased to be compulsorily insurable.  Under the Act, they were entitled to become voluntary contributors.  They had one year within which to exercise the option to become voluntary contributors and I think in some kinds of cases that year may be extended to 18 months.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate position of those people who did not exercise their option is that, had they known about the option which they might have exercised and had they known of the value of membership of the scheme as voluntary contributors, they would have exercised their option and become voluntary contributors.  Unfortunately &mdash;and I do not blame the Department of Social Welfare for this&mdash;many of these people did not know of their right to exercise the option and consequently, if they were to die, their widows and orphans would not be entitled to contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider what I am about to suggest to him in the context that social welfare insurance, on the scale that we now have it, was not appreciated as widely as it might have been; that people did not know the benefits they were entitled to, particularly in the matter of becoming voluntary contributors, as well as they might <Col N="114" /> between 1952 and the present day.  I am wondering whether the Parliamentary Secretary would consider allowing all those people who had the option to become voluntary contributors under the 1952 Act and who did not exercise their option to make that option now by way of some amendment to this Bill.  In making that provision, it could be provided that these persons now opting to become voluntary contributors would have to pay back the contributions for which they would have been liable, if they had made the option at the time they should have made it.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, there are only about 1,500 voluntary contributors. I think I came across that figure somewhere in connection with the Report of the Advisory Committee on Voluntary Health Insurance.  It struck me as an amazingly low figure &mdash;1,500 persons.  I think it exemplifies the point I make that people were not aware of the right they had to become voluntary contributors and, certainly, if they were so aware, did not appreciate the benefits that would accrue to them through becoming voluntary contributors.</P>
    <P>I would go this distance in order to make these people's widows and orphans entitled to a contributory pension.  If the Minister thought that, by making these people voluntary contributors, he was also bringing them in under the Health Act, I would be prepared to agree that these people should not be entitled, because they are voluntary contributors, to the benefits under the Health Act, but that they should be entitled to become voluntary contributors under the Act for the purpose of contributory widows' and orphans' pensions.  I do not see that there could be any difficulty administratively in making an amendment to this Bill to meet the position of these people.</P>
    <P>Under the First Schedule to the Act, Part I, paragraph 3 (a), that is, the schedule which determines the employments that are compulsorily insurable, one of the employments is employment in the Civil Service of the Government. I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the situation <Col N="115" /> there, but the Civil Service of the Government does not cover all the persons that are regarded as civil servants.  For instance, the employees of the Houses of the Oireachtas are not civil servants of the Government. Neither would the employees of the court who would be under £600, or £800 as it will be under this Bill. Neither are civil servants of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that these people are being insured at present.  I wonder what is the legality of the Minister for Social Welfare in requiring these people to be insured, when they are not liable to be insured under legislation as it stands?  I am sure the Minister's Department is well aware of the situation which enables me to state that the people employed in the Civil Service of the Government do not embrace people of the kind I have mentioned. In view of that situation, would it not be proper, particularly if these categories are at present being insured under the heading of employment in the Civil Service of the Government, that the position ought to be rectified? It seems to me to be a case where there ought to be an amendment in order to bring the position into line with the decision of the Supreme Court, which decided the matter, and the more recent legislation, the Civil Service (Regulation) Act and the Civil Service (Commissioners) Act, which sets out and recognises the difference between employment in the Civil Service of the Government and the Civil Service of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one point to make and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give me an answer on it.  Some years ago I came across the case of a man who had been 35 years in insurance and who then, because of an increase in salary, went over the limit.  Shortly afterwards, the limit was extended and he was brought back again.  During his whole 35 years, he never had a claim, but some short time after going back on insurance, he fell ill and died shortly afterwards, leaving a widow and two children.</P>

    <P>When it came to claiming the widow's pension, I well remember the answer I got: that she was not eligible <Col N="116" /> because he had not 156 stamps since his last entry into insurance.  When it came to claiming the non-contributory pension for his widow, on account of her age and the ages of the children, she was ruled out.  Can this sort of thing happen a man now?  Having been in for 35 years, having been forced out by the law and having been brought back again by the law, just because he dies within a short time after being brought back into insurance, are his widow and children unable to get benefit?  When I tried to alter the position before, I was unable to do anything about it.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might tell us the position in regard to persons who have taken out voluntary health insurance policies, people who are in the £600 to £800 bracket, who have paid their premiums and committed themselves?  Is there any provision that they do not lose?</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Colley, the case he instanced cannot happen now.  Such a man is always in insurance.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked how many people would come under this Bill.  Approximately 18,000.  It might be information for him to know the number of insured people we had on 31st March, 1957.  It was 719,063.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley dealt with the point about the lack of knowledge on the part of voluntary contributors.  We have given every possible publicity to that.  The only consolation I can give him is that his figure has gone up from 1,500 to over 2,000.  I admit it is very small.  The Bill was designed to induce the voluntary contributors to come along.  They have not come along, but I certainly promise to give the matter all the publicity I can.  I am afraid we could not go into this retrospectively. I am referring to voluntary contributors who neglected to benefit and did not avail of the period of a year or 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked about the position of a man or woman with between £600 and £800 under the Bill. They can become voluntary contributors when they go above £800 and they will qualify for the benefits, if <Col N="117" /> they have the insurance he queried me about.  The Senator will understand that, under the Bill, they get two years' credit.  If they have 26 contributions in their insurance history, they get three years' credit.  When they get an increment, they qualify for these benefits as voluntary contributors.  Of course, if they have not a past insurance history, it is a horse of a different colour.  It is hard to meet every difficulty on the road.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington talked about farmers and the cost of living. I am very much afraid he anticipated the Bill coming in.  I am sure the Minister will deal with the points he raised.</P>
    <P>I think the Seanad will agree that the Bill is not contentious.  There may be criticism that we have not brought the salary scale up high enough.  We have done what we consider is best.  For that reason, we want the House to give all stages to-day as we want the Bill to become law on 1st January.  If it does not become law then, there will be a six months' lapse period under the 1952 Act.  We want to have certain publicity and have certain cards and credits marked up.  A lot of things have to be done in the short period between this and the end of the calendar year.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill involves no departure in principle from legislation which has already had the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Its main object is to amend the definition of some of the classes eligible under the Health Act, 1953, for general institutional and specialist services, maternity and infant care services and mental hospital services.  The passage of time has made it desirable to introduce the amendments now proposed in the categories of eligible persons if real effect is to continue to be given to the intentions of the Legislature in passing the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953 specified the classes who with their dependents are eligible for the services. These classes are, broadly speaking, persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952; other adult persons whose yearly means are less than £600; <Col N="119" /> farmers the rateable valuation of whose holdings is £50 or less; and persons outside these three categories who cannot without undue hardship, provide the services for themselves.  Dependents of persons in each of these categories are also included.</P>
    <P>The first amendment we are making in this Bill provides that the reference in Section 15 to the Social Welfare Act, 1952, will be read as a reference to that Act as amended.  At present, when it is desired to confirm the eligibility for health services of an insured person, it is necessary only to establish that the person has paid an insurance contribution within the specified period.  As the insured were accepted <i>en bloc</i> in 1953 as a class which should be given the benefit of the new and extended services then introduced, it is equitable that insurability, as newly-defined now, should continue to be one of the criteria for entitlement to these health services.</P>
    <P>The second category of persons eligible for institutional and specialist services is adult persons whose yearly means (including the means of certain relatives) are less than £600.  The Bill proposes that this limit should be increased from £600 to £800.  It would obviously be inequitable that, while insured persons earning up to £800 a year would be eligible for the services, the income limit should be £600 for others.</P>
    <P>The Bill relates only to two of the classes entitled to the services and does not affect the present basis for determining the eligibility of farmers.  The reason is, of course, that land valuations are, to all practical intents, immutable and that the proportion of the farming community entitled to the services has not altered since they were introduced.  A farmer who would have been entitled to the services in 1953 is still entitled to them, unless he has been fortunate enough to acquire extra acres since, bringing the total valuation of his holdings over £50.</P>
    <P>Apart from the matters to which I have referred, it is proposed in the Bill to make one small but important change in the determination of eligibility. <Col N="120" /> I have had representations to the effect that it is onerous to include, in the yearly means of an applicant, the full yearly means of any unmarried son, daughter, step-son or step-daughter living with the applicant. I think it is generally agreed that in most cases the full income of an unmarried son or daughter is not available to supplement the parents' income nor is it realistic to expect that it should be.  It is accordingly provided that, in calculating yearly means, the first £100 of the income of any son or daughter resident with an applicant shall be disregarded, subject to an overriding limit of £300 on the amount to be so disregarded.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to arrive accurately at the number of persons who will be affected by the provisions of this Bill and of the extra cost which will be incurred.  It is, however, estimated that very roughly 80,000 additional persons will be brought within the scope of the institutional and specialist services and the maternity and child health services.  The annual cost, half of which will be met by the rates and the other half out of the Exchequer, is of the order of £120,000.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a fair case for the Bill and there are only two points I should like to make on it.  It is, of course, desirable in the light of the falling value of money to raise the point at which a person becomes eligible for health benefits from £600 to £800.  I understand that under sub-section (4) of Section 1 that £800 may, in certain cases, be increased by £300.  So that we are in the position now that a person may be eligible for health benefits when he has £1,100 a year, whereas he is also subject to surtax at £1,500 a year.  Therefore, we have this rather curious position that here the falling value of the £ is taken into account, whereas the State and various Ministers for Finance stubbornly regard the £ for the purpose of income-tax and surtax, not only as falling in its value in 1958 but as having the <Col N="121" /> value it had in 1914, which surely portrays a rather curious example of double thinking.  If some Minister does not take it up soon, we will reach the point where people who are eligible for surtax will also be eligible for health benefits, which, in the words of Euclid, would be absurd.</P>
      <P>A great many more people are eligible for benefits under this Bill and as far as Dublin City is concerned, it will certainly mean greater crowding in the Dublin hospital clinics.  There are in Dublin a great many clinics.  I think there are over 200.  It is complained that in the case of a considerable number of people who go to them, and particularly the poorer people, their position now is worse than when the Health Act came into operation.  Before the Health Act came into operation, they went to a clinic, sent very often by a general practitioner without filling up a form, or sent by a specialist and they got in the clinic itself the medicines prescribed by the specialist.</P>
      <P>The position now is quite different. They cannot be treated unless they have a ticket and as well as that, they must fill in forms.  I have been given, by various people, rather harrowing descriptions of women with a baby in one arm and parcels in the other, not well educated, endeavouring to fill up forms which asked a variety of questions such as what is their husband's income, which sometimes they do not know.  The whole work of the hospital is slowed up by all this form filling and it is adding to the expenses.  They have found it necessary to give assistance to people filling in these forms. It sometimes happens that one woman will fill in a form rather summarily for another which one doctor said was the best thing that could happen because all that he wanted was to see the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charges now are 2/6 for attendance and 7/6 for an X-ray.  There are no provisions at all for the use of certain machinery for the examination of heart or brain trouble and no provision at all for physiotherapy.  I am not sure what the extra cost of that would be, but the extra cost of this Bill, according to the Minister, will be £120,000. <Col N="122" /> It will benefit certain people but it will also aggravate the position in the dispensaries in Dublin City.  One of the curious things about the present position is that whereas a patient before the Health Act, could get medicine in the actual hospital or clinic which he was attending, the same patient has now to get the prescription, and take it to his dispensary area where the doctor may, I think, refuse to make it up or have it made up for him.</P>
    <P>I think that is all done under regulations and I suggest that these regulations could be simplified and that we could reduce the amount of form filling.  If one abandoned the form filling and left it to the discretion of the hospitals or medical practitioners and made a bulk payment, I am not sure that it would cost a great deal more.  I know of one case where the bill of 10/- a day at a hospital was the cause of considerable anxiety and considerably retarded the patient's progress.  I know you cannot give these things out quite freely, but it is a curious commentary on the State's welfare operations that a great many people should find themselves worse off now in the City of Dublin, from the point of view of attendance at clinics, than before these Acts came into operation.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could make an inquiry, with a view to seeing if all this form filling, which is very difficult for certain people, could be lessened.  I am fairly expert myself in filling up forms, but I find them very repulsive and difficult and people not accustomed to using a pen find them still more difficult.  I wonder if some improvement could not be made in Dublin, particularly so that a patient who went to a clinic could be attended there and get at the clinic whatever medicines were prescribed for him rather than that he should have to go to a clinic in one place, then go to another place, wait in a queue and perhaps fill in another form to get medicine.  Granted the principal Acts are there and that the processes being followed in this Act would seem to be inevitable, but as I said in the beginning, while the Minister for Health is pursuing the £ upwards, the Minister for Finance is <Col N="123" /> holding the £ for tax purposes on the basis it had in 1914.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make first a few points, some of which I thought relevant to an earlier Bill.  The two Bills are linked together, and one may be forgiven perhaps for making similar points about both.  The Minister, in justifying the introduction of this Bill, said that the rise in the remuneration limit from £600 to £800 is justified on the grounds of the changed value of the £.  I notice, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, in certain cases the limit can be raised from £600 to £1,100, that is to say, nearly doubled.</P>
      <P>I would like to make to the Minister for Health the point I made to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I should like to see some evidence of a similar Government realisation of the rise in the cost of living when we come to give increases to pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall return immediately inside the scope by saying I was glad to note the figure, that an extra 80,000 persons are being brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to a related question to which the Minister might give a reply.  I think I am right in saying that his predecessor told us that some 5/6ths of the community are covered under the health scheme as it was before this present amendment.  I should like to know what is the new proportion?  Is it some 7/8ths of the community which will now be covered by the scheme?  If this is so would it not be better, as Senator Professor Hayes has suggested, or half suggested, to abolish all the form-filling in the simplest possible way, by going all the way, and making it 8/8ths of the community, by getting rid of the means test?  Most of the complications in the administration are related to finding out whether you had £600 now, or will <Col N="124" /> have £800 a year, or £1,100 a year or more, with dependents.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask whether the Minister has had any representations from the voluntary health insurance scheme, arising out of the fact that their potential market will be reduced by the provisions of this Bill.  It seems obvious that a pretty large section of people&mdash;some 80,000 persons in fact&mdash; who were potential subscribers to the voluntary health insurance scheme will now almost automatically cease to constitute a part of that potential market.  I should like to know if the Minister has had any representations, and if so whether this is a matter of concern to him, and whether he has any opinion as to whether the loss of this potential market may not jeopardise the scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to ask a question about the doctors&mdash;whether the doctors were consulted on this.  I take it that the Bill means in fact that a number of paying patients will now be treated either free or partly free&mdash; patients who previously would have to pay either directly or through a voluntary health insurance scheme.  I take it that the doctors under this scheme are being asked to take free or semi-free an extra 80,000 people.  I do not know whether it is considered that the doctors' fees should therefore be increased, or the number of doctors be increased, but I would like to know whether consultation with the doctors has been entered into by the Minister. It would seem that courtesy would demand that.  The doctors pretty well must comply with the terms of this Bill when it becomes an Act, and my feeling is that they deserve at least to be consulted in the matter.  I should like to know if they were consulted, and if so, what is their general attitude towards this change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill extending the limit from £600 to £800 is, as Senator Hayes has said, a very logical extension of the Health Act of 1953, in view of the fall in the value of money in the past five years.  It is also, of course, a corollary to the Bill the Second Stage of which we have just <Col N="125" /> passed, the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill.  It should therefore commend itself to the Seanad.  I have only one point to make in regard to the matter, and it is a legal point, arising out of the interpretation by the courts of certain sections of the Health Act, 1953, which should be brought to the notice of the Minister and his Department. It concerns a defence which is of late being entered in the courts by insurance companies where they operate for defendants in road accident and other negligence cases.</P>
      <P>It has now become a practice for insurance companies to plead as a defence against the plaintiff's claim that the plaintiff, in regard to his medical and hospital expenses, is not a liability of the defendant, as being a holder of a medical card, or, in the middle income group, and a liability of the defendant or defendants in the case of contributions which have to be paid by him to the local authority.  That view has been pushed by insurance companies in their pleadings, and their defence in these cases has been upheld in some courts.  It has not yet been decided finally by the Supreme Court. This I think is a matter which should be brought to the notice of the Minister for Health, because the effect of insurance companies setting up the Health Act and saying that they are not liable to pay the plaintiff's hospital and medical expenses because of the Act, and that the plaintiff in the particular case must look to his local authority to pay for his medical and hospital expenses of course, would, if universally held, shift a certain burden on to the local authorities and to the Exchequer which heretofore has been borne by insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this before the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a matter which has not been finally decided by the Supreme Court, but it has been held in various High Court and numerous Circuit Court decisions in cases where the insurance companies have used in their defence Sections 14 and 15 of the Health Act, 1953, as an escape clause.  I think it is a most <Col N="126" /> undesirable practice, shifting a burden to the local authorities and the State which has not heretofore existed. Where this plea has been entered, the insurance companies are claiming to be free from the burden of paying the plaintiff's medical and hospital expenses. It is a very undesirable development, and should be settled one way or another by the Supreme Court, or the Minister could very easily consider an amendment of this Bill for the Committee Stage.  If that is not possible, certainly in the next six or nine months if the position has not been clarified, a Bill should be introduced covering this point.</P>
      <P>It would be a simple matter to exclude all liabilities arising out of negligence actions by the provisions of Section 14 and 15.  A simple sub-section could quite easily be brought in excluding local authorities from any liability arising out of hospital and medical expenses incurred in any civil action.  The shifting of a burden arising out of a legal technicality being utilised by insurance companies to the detriment of the finances of our local authorities would appear to be a very undesirable development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the raising of the means ceiling from £600 to £800 and also the modification which leaves out of the reckoning the first £100 of the yearly earnings of an unmarried son or daughter residing with the family.  The charges for institutional treatment, however, still give rise to much hardship because of the general tendency to treat the 10/- per day as the minimum and not the maximum charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to direct the Minister's attention to the case of victims of occupational accidents where the persons may be hospitalised for long periods during which the only payment they receive is workmen's compensation of 90/- per week.  The number of non-fatal occupational accidents in the course of a year is very considerable and many such cases require hospital treatment for some time at least.  I am informed that the majority of these institutional cases are charged at the full 70/- per <Col N="127" /> week, although the workmen's compensation payment of 90/- would be insufficient for the maintenance of the family during the breadwinner's stay in hospital.  The procedure adopted is that the hospital bill is not served by the local authority until the man is back at work again, when, though he may be in a difficult position trying to clear off debts which inevitably accumulated when he was in hospital, he is pressed to clear off the hospital debt at the full rate of 10/- per day.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, the Minister informed me that if a person's income ceased when he entered hospital, he would, in the absence of other means, be treated as in the lower income group and so receive free institutional treatment. In the case of injured workmen in receipt of workmen's compensation, the same treatment should apply and it is reasonable to ask that the means be assessed as they are when a man is in hospital and not when he is back at work earning full wages.  I would ask the Minister to consider this point in view of his previous statement and that he would advise county managers to follow the procedure mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to raise, one of which deals with those who contribute towards maintenance.  In the explanatory memorandum which the Minister sent us with the Bill we have the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945 (as amended by the Health Act, 1953), the classes eligible for the mental health service are the same as those eligible for the general institutional and specialist services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is one exception to that and I should like the Minister to look into it.  There are people who are liable to contribute towards a patient in a mental hospital who are apparently not liable to contribute under the general health services.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to Section 230 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this Act and without prejudice to any obligation <Col N="128" /> for the time being imposed by law otherwise than by or for the purposes of this Act, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  every legitimate person shall be liable to maintain his or her father and mother;</P>
    <P>(b)  every illegitimate person shall be liable to maintain his or her mother;</P>
    <P>(c)  every man shall be liable to maintain such of his legitimate children as are for the time being under the age of 16 years;</P>
    <P>(d)  every woman shall be liable to maintain such of her children, whether legitimate or illegitimate as are for the time being under the age of 16 years;</P>
    <P>(e)  every married man shall be liable to maintain his wife and shall also be liable to maintain every child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, of his wife who was born before her marriage to him and is for the time being under the age of 16 years.</P>
    <P>Under that section apparently, a married illegitimate child would be liable to maintain his or her mother, even though I presume the clause about hardship would come into it. There are instances which I should like the Minister to look into.  I know it is a difficulty with which mental hospital authorities are confronted. They are bound by that to claim against people who perhaps would prefer to forget all about it.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to raise is the question of the £50 valuation as opposed to the £600 or £800 limit. Circumstances have arisen apparently since 1953 that entail the giving by the State or employers of anything up to £800 salary where previously £600 had been sufficient.  In other words, either because of the cost of living or some other consideration, it was necessary for a person who previously earned £600 to get a great increase in his salary.</P>
    <P>Surely the cost of living has been equally hard on the farmer, who has to meet his own cost of living.  He has had to meet an increase in the <Col N="129" /> price of fertilisers and seeds and so on.  The agricultural price index figure is perhaps the only indication I can give the Minister.  It has not risen very much since 1953 until 1956, the last year I have figures for, 1956 was the last year in which it was above the 1953 figure, which would indicate that the farmer's income has not increased, whereas his cost of living and the prices he must pay for seeds and fertilisers have increased.  To my mind, there is no comparison between the man with £600 salary and the farmer with the £50 valuation and I suggest to the Minister that he should raise that figure to £60 under this Bill.  To my mind, £600 was always far in excess of what the £50 valuation farmer could earn from his farm in 5½ days in the week.  In the first instance, £600 far exceeded the average income of the farmer with a valuation of £50 and I think any figures the Minister can procure will bear out that point.  I hope the Minister will look into that point and then decide to change that £50 to £60.</P>

      <P>Senator Cole has just mentioned the point I was about to raise.  My problem is why the farming community are to get no benefit under this Bill.  I do not see any reason why farmers whose valuation was £50 or under when the Bill was introduced in 1953 should not benefit under this Bill.  They are no better off to-day than they were in 1953, and, as a matter of fact, in my opinion, after the disastrous year we have just had, they are much worse off than the salaried people whose incomes are not less than £600 or £800.  I should like to join with Senator Cole in asking the Minister to consider the farming community in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect which was mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, that is, the detrimental effect this Bill will have on the voluntary health scheme.  In my opinion, it will make impossible the working of that scheme.  I understand that when the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill was introduced, the then Minister for Health, Deputy <Col N="130" /> O'Higgins, gave an undertaking that there would be no change in the social welfare legislation without consultation with the voluntary health scheme authorities.  That obviously is not the case.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the population of this country will be covered by this Bill, which leaves only 20 per cent. who ordinarily would not be interested in either voluntary health or national health insurance, so it seems to me that this voluntary health scheme will fall through.  I understand that none of the staffs in our voluntary hospitals even as present constituted have been consulted about this Bill.  In my opinion, the present extension of the Act will have a detrimental effect on Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this Bill and to put it in a more workable form than it is in at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, partly from a professional standpoint, respectfully raise four points for the Minister's consideration?  We contemplate the extension of a very important Act to provide for certain people.  There has been a great deal of talk about incomes under £600 and under £800 per annum.  May I stress another side of the matter?</P>
      <P>We are extending a service.  What does that extension exactly mean? The extension of the service will involve, I think, the consideration of four points.  Firstly, for want of a better term, we must consider what I can only call &ldquo;leakage&rdquo;.  It is current gossip that a certain number of persons are benefiting themselves though they are not financially entitled to do so. Those of us in medicine say that they are benefiting themselves anyhow, even if we are paying for it.  Even if there is some leakage going on, which I think will increase by raising the ceiling from £600 to £800 per annum, I should be interested to hear the Minister on the subject of the number of persons availing themselves of a service to which they are not financially entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> Secondly, we must consider the question of the local authority.  The extension of the Act will increase the responsibilities of the local authorities. As far as we can judge, the local authorities have in many ways shown themselves to be in a bit of a difficulty. For example, speaking from the point of view of the medical profession, we get the impression that they are trying to clamp it down on outpatient departments. If this Bill is passed and if the Act is extended to certain people, I think outpatient departments will suffer a bit more.</P>
    <P>If we extend the application of the Act, we must realise that in the past three or four years not only has the outpatient department been extending itself enormously but it has developed in the past two or three years in ways which were not heard of when the Act started.  I have in mind psychiatric treatment in the outpatient department. It is now possible for a person in a neurotic condition to go to an outpatient department and have things talked over by a sympathetic expert. His troubles can be solved.  He may be given a sedative.  Everything may be set right.  Most valuable work has been done in that respect.  Sometimes these troubles are not permanent but are just like the oscillations of a barometer, really.  In extending the services of this valuable Act, it is very important to make the local authorities recognise the importance of the outpatient psychiatric department and psychiatric treatment.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this will be an additional strain on hospital resources, hospital staff and hospital facilities.  A figure of 80,000 patients has been mentioned. Is that not a minimum figure?  Would that not include the families?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a comprehensive figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of 80,000 will increase the strain on hospitals.  Every year, they are getting more strain because of better diagnosis and increased laboratory work.  What can be done now is almost unbelievable to those of us who were medical students 40 years ago.  We realise the <Col N="132" /> importance of modern biochemical tests, and so on.  If we extend the Health Act, we shall have to extend the treatment we are giving.</P>
      <P>Point number four has already been raised efficiently by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and others, that is, the relationship of the general practitioner and how far the medical profession has been consulted in this regard.  If I were embroiled in medical practice, I would say: &ldquo;The cost of living has been rising for these people and for me, too.  I will get only 2/8 for each patient treated.  My share for my services, such as they may be, is certainly nearer to 3/6 than to 2/8.&rdquo; What is sauce for the goose should also be sauce for the goslings.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill because I do not think it a measure that lends itself to too much discussion.  A few red herrings have, I think, been brought into the debate.  The approach by certain Senators has been rather unrealistic.  For instance, certain Senators tried to convince us that the reason for the introduction of this measure is the alleged increase in the cost of living and also the alleged diminution in the value of the £.  I think the leader of the opposite side of the House started on that note.  I want to point out that these considerations have no bearing whatever on the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been brought in because it has been discovered that certain deserving sections of the people have been put outside the scope of the 1952 Act by reason of certain increases in remuneration, salaries and wages that have been given to those sections of the community.  The real purpose of this Bill is to bring those people back again within the scope of the 1952 Act.  I think nobody here can deny that that is the fundamental purpose of the Bill and its introduction has no bearing on the cost of living or on the value of the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the Act which was passed by the Oireachtas <Col N="133" /> last year.  Under that Act, the contributions which might be demanded by a local authority from a person in the middle income group who was entitled, under Section 15, to hospital treatment were increased from 6/- to 10/- per day.  The case then made by the Minister was that persons under £600 per annum were well able to pay up to a maximum of 10/- per day and that they should be compelled to pay that, if the local authority decided they were able to pay that sum.</P>
      <P>I find it hard to reconcile that point of view expressed by the Minister when he was increasing those charges with the extension of the limit from £600 to £800 per annum.  I should have thought that people under £800 would be in as good a position, at any rate, to pay for their hospital expenses as the people under £600, perhaps&mdash; say, somebody on £400&mdash;would be able to pay the increased charges which the Minister enabled the local authorities to charge under the Act which was passed last year.</P>
      <P>It seems a logical conclusion of the introduction of the Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill to adjust the charges as set out in Section 1 of this Bill.  It is a fair indication of the value of money at the present time that a family with an income of £1,100 is now entitled to the benefits of Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What disturbs me about this Bill is what has disturbed a number of other Senators.  Many thinking people have come to regard the establishment and functioning of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board as a hopeful sign of the direction in which we might travel in regard to social legislation. That board is the nucleus of a sound social policy which might be enlarged and expanded.  Instead of drawing people upwards into the health services, it might have been a far better thing if people were given the opportunity, through some slight degree of subsidisation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, of being brought downwards into the voluntary health insurance scheme.  Under the Voluntary Health Act, no subsidy is payable to the board.  If some small subsidy were payable, perhaps the <Col N="134" /> necessity for extending the income limit from £600 to £800 might not arise at all.  We would have more and more people availing themselves of the benefits of the voluntary health insurance scheme instead of casting a further burden upon the local authorities and the Exchequer by the extension of the income limit.</P>
    <P>As Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said, the potential market for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is being contracted.  It is very regrettable at this stage of the development of the board that it should be faced with the serious competition presented by this Bill.  As far as my knowledge goes, the board has functioned in a way that has won the admiration of anybody who has taken out insurance with it. It is a great pity that anything should be done under this Bill to endanger the successful functioning of that very desirable body or which would prevent the development of that aspect of social policy I have referred to.</P>
    <P>As regards the functioning of the health services, I am sure the Minister is well aware of the many complaints being made about the method of operation.  In his statement, the Minister said that the insurability of people under the Social Welfare Act was intended to be and would continue to be the criterion of eligibility for benefits under the Health Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not quite that. Only in relation to Section 15 (2b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I mean; that insurability would continue to be the criterion of eligibility for these people.  I understand that a voluntary contributor under the Health Act is a person who is insured or is regarded as being an insured person to the same extent as a compulsorily insured person under the Social Welfare Act.  I should have thought that immediately a person established he was a voluntary contributor, the local authority was not obliged to look into his means or the means of his dependents&mdash;that the voluntary contributor was entitled immediately to the benefits of the Health Act.  That does not seem to be so.  Perhaps the <Col N="135" /> Minister might indicate whether local authorities are being unduly meticulous in the discharge of their functions in making these inquiries from voluntary contributors?</P>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Lenihan deserves the attention of the Minister.  I do not know whether the necessary amendment to oblige an unsuccessful defendant to pay hospital costs should be brought under the Health Acts or the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  Section 174 of the Road Traffic Act did oblige persons liable to pay damages to an injured person to pay the hospital costs incurred by that person as a result of injuries sustained in a road accident.  Whatever sum was recovered under a judgement against a defaulting person provided for the payment direct to the hospital authority of expenses as laid down in the Road Traffic Act.</P>
      <P>I would disagree with Senator Lenihan that we should await some final decision in this matter by the Supreme Court.  Take the case of a negligent motorist injuring a person. It is quite clear it was never intended that that person's insurance company should benefit by the health legislation that has to be financed out of public funds.  I would prefer that before there is any decision in the matter by the Supreme Court, rather than have the Oireachtas as it were override a decision of the Supreme Court, the Oireachtas should decide the matter now while it is in doubt.  The Oireachtas can meet the case by an amendment.  If an amendment is not possible under this legislation, I suggest that the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, consider an amendment under the Road Traffic Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to answer a question asked by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  No doubt the Minister will answer the question but I am in a position to answer it also.  He asked the Minister how far the medical profession was consulted in the drafting of this Bill.  The answer is that the medical profession was not consulted at all in regard to the drafting of this Bill.  So I am informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> The 1953 Health Bill was pushed through in the teeth of the strong opposition of the profession.  The profession was opposed to State medicine, to the absence of proper planning in regard to the facilities offered in the Bill and to the absence of reasonable compensation, particularly in the case of the medical staffs of the voluntary hospitals.  In spite of that, the medical profession co-operated in the implementation of the 1953 Act, and made a success of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been drafted without any consultation with the medical profession, the voluntary hospitals or the local health services.  The result of this Bill, when it is enacted, will be to place a great additional pressure on the already inadequate facilities of the hospitals of this country.  The staffs are inadequate; finance is inadequate; the hospitals are all running on deficits. This Bill will add a very large number of additional patients who will press on these already overloaded facilities.  As Senator Hayes has already said, the people who will probably suffer most in this will be the very poor&mdash;the people who are not able in any circumstances to pay for their medical attention. These people rely entirely upon the services of the voluntary hospitals, and if those hospitals are overtaxed, as this Bill tends to overtax them, then the people who will suffer most are the very poor sections of the community.</P>
    <P>As already stated in this debate, many of the facilities for treatment at clinics by the local authorities are inadequate.  I am informed that in the cities of Dublin and Cork, owing to either real or alleged financial stringency on the part of the public authorities, there has been considerable ill-advised retrenchment with regard to outpatient clinics particularly, as has been pointed out by Senator Fearon, in relation to psychiatric treatment.  I am informed that the local authorities are unwilling to institute new types of clinic which are called for by the new developments in medical science.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there has been great development in other countries <Col N="137" /> in the out-patient treatment of psychiatric diseases.  As Senator Fearon said, many of these diseases yield to intelligent treatment.  I am informed that in Dublin and Cork, owing to an alleged financial stringency, the necessary facilities are not available in this country.</P>
    <P>One point which has been raised in this debate several times and one which I make no apology for repeating, is the effect of this Bill on the incomes of the medical profession.  I would have thought that 80,000 families and, therefore, over 300,000 persons would be added to the people entitled to get specialist treatment in hospitals without extra payment.  The Minister interrupted a previous speaker to dispel that illusion.  Apparently the total number of people affected by the Bill is 80,000.</P>
    <P>The addition of so many to those entitled to get specialist treatment in hospital without extra payment will undoubtedly have an extremely depressing effect on the incomes of the medical profession.  Doctors at present get 2/8 per patient per day in hospital for specialist treatment.  This Bill will add very greatly to the number of people who are getting treatment at that very moderate rate of pay, many of whom could very well afford to have a certain amount of treatment at the hands of their own doctors.</P>
    <P>I am merely repeating earlier points in the debate but sometimes it is no harm to say a thing twice.  Doctors have to live as well as everybody else. It has been said that the justification for raising the limit from £600 to £800 is the rise in the cost of living.  There is a quite unanswerable case for an equivalent rise in doctor's fees.  The professional classes in this country are penalised at every turn.  They are the last people to get rises in money incomes.  They are taxed to their absolute capacity.</P>
    <P>The £600-£800 group who have been brought within the scope of this Bill for hospital treatment are amongst the people who provide incomes for doctors.  Now they are being included in a category which will get specialist <Col N="138" /> treatment from doctors who are paid quite inadequate fees.  It is an unfortunate fact but we know it is true from income-tax statistics, that the number of people with over £800 per annum is rather small and that the number of people with over £1,100 per annum is even smaller.  If this Bill comes into operation the doctors will be confined for their professional incomes to the demand of this very small section of the population.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a university representative and as a person who has the interests of the medical profession at heart, I cannot help feeling that the Bill is a very serious threat to the prosperity of the medical profession in this country.  Already we export from our universities a very large percentage of our medical graduates and, if the earning capacity of the medical profession in Ireland is still further reduced by measures of this kind, we will export more doctors.  The attraction abroad is very great where incomes are higher.  We are exporting a very large number of our medical graduates in University College and other colleges throughout the country.  If the result of this legislation is gradually to whittle away the incomes of the Irish medical profession, then I am afraid that more and more of our best graduates will emigrate.  The effect of that will be serious from the public health point of view.  I think it is an extremely serious step for the Government to enact any measure, however desirable it may be for other reasons, which may have the effect of impoverishing the medical profession and driving more of our graduates away and depriving us of the best medical practitioners.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that, in legislation of this kind where the medical profession are asked to make all the sacrifices and to do all the work, they are at least entitled to some consideration at the hands of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct a misapprehension under which, I think, Senator Hayes and, perhaps, other Senators may have been when the Senator asked me if it were <Col N="139" /> possible that an income of £1,100 a year would still not debar a person from benefiting under paragraph (b) of sub-section 2 of Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953.  I said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I want to qualify that and point out that that is a family income.  It is not the personal income of any one person.  It is the amount which the family as a whole may enjoy as an income.  As you know, in computing the family income under this Act, the local health authority is bound to take into consideration not only the earnings of the head of the family and his wife, but also the earnings of the children of the family and the stepchildren of the family.  All this section does is to exclude the first £100 of each child's earning up to a total of £300 in all. It is not, as the Senator tried to equate it, the same as personal income.</P>
      <P>The Senator also complained that the people were very much worse off nowadays in regard to clinics than they were before the Health Act of 1953 was introduced.  That is a strange thing because I think that, before the Health Act of 1953, the specialists holding these clinics recieved no remuneration. Nowadays the position is different.  They are paid on a sessional basis.  It is rather strange to find that, according to Senator Hayes, experience is now supporting an argument which I have often heard advanced by a medical practitioner who happens to be a member of the Dáil that if you want to get good service then it must be a free service and that a person who does not pay does not get the same sort of service as he would if he were paying.  We are paying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator also complained that previously the patients could get medicines at the clinics.  That is true, but what sort of medicines?  They could not get the very expensive drugs they are now entitled to get and which are provided for under the Act.  The cost of drugs has gone up so much and the cost of the health services has gone up so much that by regulation we have to try and keep control over the manner in which these very expensive medicines are dispensed.  That is why we have a certain amount of form filling and why certain medicines are no longer free on demand at these clinics.  Those who see the cost of health services rise year after year and who complain very bitterly about the burden imposed on the taxpayers should support us in endeavouring to control expenditure under the Act rather than seek to loosen the control and thereby result in an increase in the cost of the services, perhaps without any real benefits to the people.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked me how many people were going to benefit.  He asked me what percentage of the population would now come within the scope of the Health Act. I should say exactly the same proportion of the people would be entitled to the benefits of this amending Act as when the Act of 1953 was first introduced.  All we are doing in this Bill is to give renewed entitlement to benefit to persons who were excluded from the scope of the Act by reason of the increases which have taken place from time to time in their money incomes.  We are merely restoring the <i>status quo</i> as it existed in 1953.</P>

      <P>Oh, no.  They are not all going to be provided with treatment altogether gratuitously and free of charge.  A very large number of people, of course, will have to contribute but the assumption is that they are in a position to contribute. The free services are provided only for those who cannot provide them for themselves.  The Senator also raised the question of how the voluntary health insurance scheme would be affected by this Bill.  I have received no representations from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board that the board's schemes will be adversely affected by the Bill.  I am advised that they will not be affected at all and therefore the long and sometimes protracted speeches which we heard about the baneful effects of this amendment upon the future of the Voluntary Health Board are without foundation.</P>
      <P>The question was put to me by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, and repeated by a number of other: &ldquo;Have the doctors been consulted?&rdquo;  The doctors have not been consulted because we are merely restoring the position as it was understood to be at the time when the introduction of the services concerned was being considered. We are merely bringing back into eligibility the persons who it was anticipated would be eligible in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Davidson mentioned the position of patients who have been the victims of occupational accidents and in that connection cited what I understood she believed to be the practice of Dublin Corporation.  Her reference was in relation to such persons who have to undergo hospitalisation because of the fact they have met with an industrial accident and who, during the time they are in hospital, are in receipt only of the statutory amount <Col N="142" /> payable under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  It has been the practice, with certain health authorities at any rate, in cases where they have reason to believe a person has an income, and is not entered on the General Medical Service Register, to bill him in the first instance for the hospital services at the rate of 10/- a day.  Within the last five or six weeks I have taken steps to indicate to the local authorities concerned that I do not think that this is a proper practice and that unless an applicant appears, <i>prima facie,</i> to be in a position to pay the maximum charge, then a reduced charge related to his readily ascertainable income should be charged.  That perhaps would cover the main grievance to which Senator Davidson referred. I shall, however, look into the matter further to see if there is anything else we could reasonably do to meet a case of that sort.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole said there were some inconsistencies between charges made under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945&mdash;under Section 230&mdash;and under the Health Act of 1953.  In fact, there is no inconsistency.  In the case of both Acts persons are required to pay charges made on their immediate dependents where such charges are leviable and the person on whom the charge is made is not in a position to pay it.  That is the fundamental principle of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  The Senator also mentioned the position under the Mental Treatment Act of 1945.  There is no discrimination as between persons who have dependents and who have immediate relatives whom they are in a position to maintain.  There is no difference in their treatment under the two Acts.  Perhaps I did not get the Senator's point quite clearly.  If I did not, I will have a chance of looking at the official report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will verify that, but it is my recollection that it does not appear in those terms in the Health Act of 1953 but it is by reference ascribed to the Public Assistance Act of 1939.</P>
      <P>The Senator argued that because we were increasing the income limit for entitlement under the Health Act from £600 to £800 we should do something more for the farmers.  First of all I have made the case that the real purpose of this Bill is to bring back within the scope of the Health Act those extruded from it by reason of the increases which have taken place from time to time in their money incomes. There has been no change in the valuation of farms.  The same number of people on the farms are entitled to the benefits of the Acts as were entitled when the Act was first passed, and in fact I may say that it is very difficult to see what more one could do in the remaining cases.  I have mentioned that the general average for the country of the number of people who will be within the scope of the Act as amended will be about 85 per cent.  At the present moment the number of farmers under £50 valuation in Connacht is 97.4 per cent. of the farming population of Connacht.  In the three counties of Ulster the percentage is 94.9.  In Munster it is 82.7 and in Leinster 74.3.  It seems to me that there cannot be any great hardship among those who do not come within those very comprehensive fractions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who owns a farm of £50 valuation has a very valuable property, whereas another person has perhaps a more or less precarious existence; in so far as he depends on the general state of the economy and on another individual or corporation for the day-to-day employment which gives him his livelihood.  In those circumstances we are not doing any injustice to the farmers when we are merely trying to redress in relation to wage earners and persons in similar circumstances the position in which they now find themselves, and restore them to the position <Col N="144" /> in which they were in 1953 in relation to the Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon seemed to think that we were breaking entirely new ground. That has been the basis of the objections raised on behalf of the medical profession; but we are merely endeavouring to recover lost ground or to bring back and reinstate on the original ground the people who were driven off it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the services have been readily and easily available, and therefore some people are perhaps getting benefits under the Acts to which they are not entitled; but I do not think there is a very significant number of such people.  It is no greater now than it ever was, and in fact if anything I should be surprised if it is not significantly less, because I have taken the line that these services are costing so much and are now so highly developed and highly specialised that no person should get them free if he can make a reasonable contribution to the cost of them. The complaint I generally receive is not that somebody is getting the services who is not entitled to them, but that persons entitled are not getting them.  It would seem, taking these latter representations, that it is unlikely that there is any very substantial number of persons getting the services who are not entitled to them.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made&mdash; Senator Fearon mentioned it too &mdash;that one of the consequences of raising the income limit under the Act will be that local authorities will tend to clamp down on outpatient departments. That is not my experience of local authorities.  They behave responsibly and try to give the benefit of the Health Acts as widely as possible.  Their tendency is rather to look for greater expenditure than to try to cut it down.  I do not think there is any very great danger that they will reduce the scope of the services now available.</P>
    <P>We should of course like to see these services extended to the maximum extent that would be useful, but again we have to consider in this connection the overall cost.  The cost of the services now runs in the order of <Col N="145" /> £16,000,000 a year.  I have tried to keep it to that figure.  Whether I can succeed in doing it this year I do not know, but if I do not do that and if the Minister for Finance has to increase the standard rate of tax I shall hear a great deal of moaning and gnashing of teeth in this House when I come along, if I should happen to come along, with another Bill to increase the medical benefits which might be provided.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the Bill is going to impose any very great strain upon the existing hospital facilities.  I gather that when the Act of 1953 was going through the House it was represented that its provisions would strain the resources of all the hospitals&mdash;public authority and voluntary hospitals&mdash;to breaking point.  I do not think it can be contended that this is being done. Indeed, so far from there being any undue pressure upon certain classes of hospitals, we have reached a stage at which we have some hospital institutions vacant for want of patients, and our difficulty has been to find some use for them.  That of course does not apply to general hospitals in Dublin, but I do not think it can be contended by any person going through the hospitals and looking at the conditions and the manner in which patients are treated now that the Health Act of 1953 imposed any undue strain upon their resources or their staff.</P>
    <P>In any event, the raising of the income limit from £600 to £800 surely is not going to increase the incidence of sickness and illness among us.  We will still have the same number of persons falling ill, I suppose, year after year, or approximately the same number. The only difference will be that if they do fall ill they will receive a certain amount of help to make themselves well.  The voluntary hospitals will, to that extent, perhaps, benefit by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley was one of the Senators who raised a number of questions and were disturbed about the effect this Bill might have on the voluntary health insurance scheme.  I have dealt with that and I do not think I need repeat what I said.  Another <Col N="146" /> question which he asked was whether the officers of local authorities are unduly meticulous in inquiring into the means of voluntary contributors under the social insurance scheme.  I do not know.  I do not think they are. Naturally they must satisfy themselves &mdash;they must do their duty to the ratepayers&mdash;that these voluntary contributors are entitled to secure services which are provided for them, either free of charge, or for the rather nominal charge which is provided for in the amending Act of last year.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien said that the Act of 1953 was put through in the teeth of opposition from the medical profession. I do not know whether or not that is an exaggeration, but I do know that despite that opposition, the Government which in 1954 succeeded the Government which put the Act through in 1953&mdash;our immediate predecessors in office&mdash;put the whole Act into operation.  They must have done that presumably by some sort of agreement or arrangement with the medical profession.  In any event, since then, we have had another general election.  The Health Act of 1953 happened to be one of the issues in that election, particularly in my own constituency, and the people have endorsed the provisions or the principles of the Health Act of 1953.  It is too late to argue whether we are for or against the Act.  The people have spoken in regard to it and we have just got to make the best of it and the medical profession must make the best of it.</P>
    <P>The Senator also adopted an unaccustomed role.  As a rule, he is one of those who plead for greater and greater retrenchment in relation to Government services and expenditure. To-night, he told us the health facilities are inadequate at the moment and he spoke of the real or alleged need for retrenchment.  I think our general financial position may be somewhat better now than it was last year.  The need for retrenchment, however, where it can be secured without affecting the efficiency of the services has not passed and, needless to say, it is still very real.  To the extent that we can make these services more economical without <Col N="147" /> impairing their efficacy, I shall try to do so; but I must say I cannot see that we will be in a better position greatly to increase the amount of money which can be provided for the health services, while still trying to meet the long term commitments of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  The community as a whole is still bearing a very substantial burden in taxation. There are other sources of revenue which appear at the moment to be tending to dry up.  In these circumstances we shall have to face the position realistically and see what can be done.  We have done a great deal within the past five or six years and until the situation has considerably improved we cannot do very much more.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to extend the Rent Restrictions Acts for a further period of one year after the 31st December, when they would otherwise expire.  In present circumstances the Acts could not be allowed to lapse without causing hardship to many tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Government took office they initiated a fresh departmental examination of the rent control problem having regard to the recommendations in the Conroy Report on Rent Control, presented in 1952, and to the economic changes which have taken place since then.  The examination was completed during the year and the major recommendations in the report submitted to the Government. I am glad to be able to say that instructions have now been given to the Parliamentary Draftsman for the preparation of a comprehensive measure which will repeal and reenact the present Acts with modifications. <Col N="148" /> The drafting of such a measure is bound to take some time but I hope to be in a position to introduce it sometime in the New Year.  In the meantime, it is necessary to keep the present Acts in force, as proposed in this Bill, and I ask the House, therefore, to give it a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that we accept this Bill for what it is, namely, a Bill to continue the present situation until such time as a comprehensive Bill can be produced.  We would just like to say that everybody will be looking for a lot from the new Bill when it does come in.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, there are very grave hardships under the existing situation, as regards landlords, particularly, and as regards tenants.  For my part, I hope something enlightened will come from this new Bill which will make it profitable for landlords to own property and which also will make it good for tenants to be able to rent holdings under the new Act.</P>
      <P>I feel that, unless landlords get proper rewards for the letting of their property, we will not have proper lettings for the tenants.  In other words, if a Bill is produced which gives a proper and a just consideration to both sides, it will be in the interests of everybody.</P>

      <P>The Bill proposes to extend the Rent Restrictions Acts only for one year and therefore I shall not enter into the general subject.  I just want to refer to the report on Housing by the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  I would remind the House that a repeal of the Rent Restrictions Acts is a very important recommendation of that Committee's Report and that, by the recommendation, they hope to save a great deal of money on new housing by conserving the stock of existing houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The repeal of the Rent Restrictions Acts is a very important part of the policy outlined in that report.  I hope that policy will not be put aside or shelved.  I take it, from what the Minister says, that that is not the case and therefore I shall not pursue the <Col N="149" /> matter further now.  If this were a permanent extension of the Rent Restrictions Acts, I would have a great deal to say in relation to the report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.</P>

All the Strasbourg plea seeks to do as I understand it, is to try to prove that the Government acted <i>ultra vires</i> in interning these people.  My motion makes no such suggestion.  It asks that they should now be charged and tried by the ordinary courts.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, my motion deals explicitly with the internees, whereas the case before the Court of Human Rights deals solely with a man who is not in fact an internee at all, a man who has been released, and to whom my motion could not apply.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann requests the Minister for Justice to institute a judicial inquiry into the reported conduct by District Justice Gordon Hurley of the case heard before him on September 15th, 1958, arising out of the assault, on June 26th, 1958, upon three street preachers in Killaloe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with attention to the ruling of the Chair in this matter.  The House will remember that I tried first to raise this question as a matter on the Adjournment some weeks ago, and it was indicated to me, in your own words, Sir, that &ldquo;the better way would be to put down a motion&rdquo;.  I felt at the time, and I said so, that a motion would be more satisfactory, and would give more people a chance to put their point of view, and, generally, would allow for a wider debate.  My only fear had been on the question of delay. I should like to say now that I am grateful to the Chair and to the House <Col N="151" /> for there having been no delay whatsoever between the time I put down the motion and the time when it is being debated here.</P>
    <P>My contention, and the contention I shall try to support by evidence, is that <i>prima facie</i> there is cause for grave ministerial concern arising out of the conduct of this case, as reported.  It has been so profoundly disturbing that it has stirred the public conscience to an extent fully sufficient to demand that the Minister shall have the facts judicially examined and established, and decide then, but not until then, whether or not action is required.</P>
    <P>In saying that the public mind has been profoundly disturbed by this matter, I should like to state at the outset that my own conviction is that this is true of a very big section of the public.  Decent people of all religious beliefs have been shocked by what appeared from the press reports, to have taken place, and by the manner in which it was reported to have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I should like to read two of the press reports of the matter at issue. My motion refers to the case as reported. The first of these reports is from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 16th September, this year, under a heading &ldquo;Religion is above the Courts&rdquo;.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;District Justice Gordon Hurley said in Killaloe yesterday: &lsquo;Religion is above the courts, the main business of which is to preserve peace. When men come into an Irish village and provoke the people by foisting their views on them, they are abusing whatever rights they have under the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of religious worship.  Such action is bound to draw down the rod of the people whose hospitality they have received.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>He applied the Probation Act in a case in which Michael Boland and John (Christy) McKenna, of Ballyloughnane, Killaloe, and Patrick Daly, Killestry, Killaloe, were charged with unlawfully assaulting Robert Glen Lindsay, Samuel Glen <Col N="152" /> Lindsay and Christopher Rowe on June 26th at Killaloe, thereby causing them actual bodily harm.</P>
    <P>The defendants, who pleaded guilty, were represented by Mr. I. M. Houlihan, solicitor, and Inspector E. McDonnell prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Mr. Houlihan said his clients were under great provocation.  They were respectable farmers and had been attending a fair in Killaloe when they were confronted by three young men &lsquo;vending Christianity&rsquo;.  His clients took offence, as it was the wrong time and place for these men &mdash;two of whom, he understood, came from Limerick, and a friend of theirs from England&mdash;to go foisting their special brand of Christianity on a people steeped in Christainity.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the position was aggravated by the fact that some time before, leaflets had been left in the confessional of the Catholic church in the parish from which his clients came, and the parish priest had protested from the altar, and asked for more vigilance from his parishioners.</P>
    <P>Mr. Houlihan said that he did not want to associate the complainants with circulating these leaflets for the simple reason that it had not been proved, but it was not the first time that &lsquo;pseudo-evangelists&rsquo; had visited this area.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The judiciary in England have described those people as a sect of canting humbugs&rsquo; went on Mr. Houlihan, who added that it was fantastic for these young men from Limerick to come into Clare vending Bible and Christianity on a people who were steeped in it.  To say they were preaching Christianity to a people ignorant of it was only adding to the blaze.  The Irish had Christianity since the time of Saint Patrick, and had spread all over the world.</P>
    <P>Another of his clients, Mr. Boland, he said, was highly commended for coming to the rescue of a member of the Civic Guard when there was trouble before between <Col N="153" /> members of some sect or other and the people.</P>
    <P>Inspector E. McDonnell said the men came to Killaloe to hold a religious meeting on the steps of the church.  Mr. Rowe held the Bible in his hand and this was taken from him by Mr. Boland, who gave it a couple of kicks down the street.  The guards then had a conversation with the men and they went to their car, but the defendant got around by another street, intercepted him and hit them with their fists and sticks.</P>
    <P>One of the Lindsays fell from a blow on the forehead and lost two teeth.  He was unconscious for about 20 minutes.  He was treated by his family doctor and taken to hospital next day.  There were no serious injuries, but Lindsay had concussion for some time.</P>
    <P>District Justice Hurley said the recalled a similar case in Limerick some time ago.  He had gone into the matter very deeply then, and he still held the same views.  As he saw it, that case was a precedent for future findings of the court.  No costs were allowed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A fortnight later in the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> on October 1st, 1958, the following report appeared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A fortnight ago at Killaloe, near Limerick, three men described as &lsquo;respectable farmers&rsquo; appeared in the district court charged with unlawful assault on three evangelists who had come to hold a religious meeting on the steps of the church.  They were approached by the three defendants, one of whom seized the Bible from one of the evangelists and kicked it down the street.  The evangelists drove off, but in another street were intercepted and attacked by the defendants.  One of the preachers was knocked out and lost two teeth.</P>
    <P>The defendants pleaded guilty, but their solicitor said they had acted under great provocation. They were attending the fair at Killaloe when they came upon the three young men &lsquo;vending Christianity; they took offence because it was the wrong time and place <Col N="154" /> for these men... to go foisting their special brand of Christianity on a people steeped in Christianity.</P>
    <P>District Justice Gordon Hurley applied the Probation Act&mdash;a conviction was recorded, but there was no penalty.  He justified his action by reference to a previous case and delivered this dictum:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Religion is above courts the main business of which is to preserve peace.  When men come into an Irish village and provoke the people by foisting their views on them they are abusing whatever rights they have under the Constitution which guarantees freedom of religious worship.  Such action is bound to draw down the rod of the people whose hospitality they have received.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>The precedent to which the District Justice referred was a judgment of his own, delivered four years ago, when a party of men in a village near Limerick set upon two Jehovah's Witnesses.  District Justice Hurley bound over the victims of the assault to keep the peace.  The case aroused some comment at the time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that in the light of that kind of report, the Minister ought to be gravely concerned.  There is no doubt there has been grave public concern in the matter.</P>
    <P>In the same article, the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> quotes, and several other papers similarly quoted, the Most Reverend Dr. E. Hodges, Bishop of Limerick, as writing in the following terms about his own community:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many members of the community will agree that that street preaching is undesirable.  Many will question the adequacy and accuracy of the preaching proposed.  These are side issues.  The main question is: can the citizen of Ireland depend upon the protection of the law to preserve him from bodily harm if he expresses what are thought to be views unacceptable to the religious loyalties of persons who happen to be present in the public street when <Col N="155" /> the words are used?  Apparently not.  He can be mobbed and battered with impunity by anyone who is &lsquo;provoked&rsquo; by the words used. Such at least is the ruling of the district justice involved.</P>
    <P>The Bishop criticises in detail the terms of the judgment, in particular the justice's statement that the Constitution &lsquo;guarantees freedom of religious worship&rsquo;, and claims that the Constitution guarantees something much more&mdash;&lsquo;recognition of the various branches of the Christian Faith.&rsquo;  Dr. Hodges speaks of the incident as an important one with serious and sinister implications.</P>
    <P>Small wonder that this incident in a remote village will in many larger and more influential circles suggest the creaking of the ecclesiastical Iron Curtain closing down on thought and speech and action...</P>
    <P>Dr. Hodges says the reaction of the Church of Ireland Clergy &lsquo;and of those we represent&rsquo; must be threefold:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A sense of thankfulness and pride in the freedom to think and speak and act, at least within our communion;</P>
    <P>A realisation that in matters even remotely connected with difference in religious belief a member of the non-Roman Church cannot be certain of justice;</P>
    <P>A determination that the goodwill and friendliness which exist between us and out neighbours not of our form of Faith shall be maintained by our Church to the uttermost; and that no miscarriage of justice, no outbreak of religious zeal will break out faith in the innate kindness of the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote that as a statement of a responsible citizen, with a long record in this country, indeed in this city, before he went to Limerick, as indicating grave public concern on the part of himself and of the many for whom he spoke.</P>
    <P>I want to quote the words of a former judge of the Supreme Court, <Col N="156" /> Mr. Justice Black, expressing concern in similar terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The legal way to deal with street preachers&mdash;the civilised way&mdash;was to tell them to move away.  This was what the Guards did.  After they had walked away, they were attacked.</P>
    <P>The district justice, said Mr. Black, applied the Probation of Offenders Act.  He let the offenders off without a word of reprimand or without binding them over to the peace, and, for good measure, proceeded to pour the vials of his wrath not upon the miscreants, but upon their battered victims.  The critics&mdash; and they were many, consisting of both religions&mdash;had condemned this, carried away he thought, by their indignation with the conduct of the district justice.  They had been so carried away that they had overlooked, he thought, the most damning feature of the whole scandalous transaction.  That was not what the district justice did, but the last eleven words of his allocution in which he said that this case was to be a precedent for future findings&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir.  I feel I have now sufficiently established that there has been grave concern among responsible people in this country.</P>
      <P>It was widely suggested and feared that the effect of the type of court report which I have read might be to encourage a repetition of the same kind of thing. That is suggested by both the people I have just quoted.  That the fear is justified is demonstrated by a letter which appeared from one of the people who pleaded guilty to the assault in this case, in the Limerick <i>Weekly Echo</i> of 25th October, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The justice has been very bitterly criticised for applying the Probation Act in our case.  It really makes no <Col N="157" /> difference to us what the judge's decision was.  We know our duty and will gladly do it again to-morrow if the necessity arises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel that the widespread public concern I have indicated was shown again in the Dáil when on 29th October, Deputy Booth, in Volume 171, column 37, of the Official Report, asked the Minister the following question :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Booth asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware of the disquiet that has been occasioned amongst various religious denominations by the recent case of an admitted assault on street preachers in Killaloe; and whether, having regard to the fact that the Constitution guarantees the free profession and practice of religion, he will make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To this the Minister, Mr. Traynor, replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am aware that various religious denominations have expressed concern lest their rights should be infringed, and I, therefore, wish to say that the freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion which are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen by the Constitution will be safeguarded by every means in the power of the law officers of the State and the Garda Síochána. On the occasion in question, the Garda acted promptly&mdash;though they were unable to prevent a surprise attack on the persons who were assaulted and, when the papers were referred to the Attorney General, he at once directed that those concerned should be prosecuted on a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm.</P>
    <P>The accused pleaded guilty and expressed through their solicitor, their regret for what had happened. The district justice applied the Probation of Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the handling of the case by the district justice and the remarks which he is reported to have made, this is a matter on <Col N="158" /> which, I think, it would not be proper for me to comment: to do so would inevitably tend to shake the confidence of the public in the independence of the judiciary.  There is a way provided for under the Constitution and the law by which, in certain circumstances, a judge or district justice may, following a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be removed from office; but, otherwise than as a part of that procedure, it would not be proper for me to do or to say anything that would appear to be an interference with the independence of the judiciary, the maintenance of which we regard as vital in the general public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Just two points on that : it is obvious in the first place that the Minister was &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of widespread expressed concern and secondly, that he referred to the remarks which the district justice &ldquo;is reported to have made&rdquo;. I submit that it is his duty to find out whether the district justice in question was correctly reported.  I feel that to go beyond that to-day and to presume further is something that we cannot now do, until the facts are judicially established.  It would not be fair.</P>
    <P>On the question of &ldquo;the independence of the judiciary&rdquo;, I certainly agree that the independence of the judiciary is of supreme importance in any democratic State, and I certainly would not suggest that the Minister should like to quote what Mr. Black has said on that principle of law, as quoted in the passage I mentioned before.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Justice has said that he could not comment because of the independence of the judiciary.  The independence of the judiciary had nothing to do with what the Minister was asked to do. The independence of the judiciary meant that judges could not be removed from office by Parliament, unless for misbehaviour and they could not be spoken to or influenced while a case was <i>sub judice.</i>  But when the case was finished and over everyone was free to criticise it, and <Col N="159" /> he thought if the Minister had chosen to dissociate himself from this conduct of the district justice he would have acted wisely and well.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On one final point I should like the attention of the judicial inquiry to be directed by the Minister, if and when he sets it up, and that is to the specific question as to what particular grounds were set out in the district justice's order of dismissal under the Probation of Offenders Act, whether it was on grounds of character, antecedents, age, health, or mental condition of the person charged, or the trivial nature of the offence, or the extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed.  I believe that that is a matter also which must be gone into and judicially inquired into.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons&mdash;on account of the reported unusual conduct of the case, on account of the widespread informed public comment and publicly expressed concern that the constitutional rights of citizens shall be effectively protected, and because the assaulters apparently interpreted the words of the district justice to mean that they now have full licence to &ldquo;do it again to-morrow&rdquo;&mdash;it seems to me imperative that the Minister should be deeply concerned to ascertain just precisely in what measure the whole conduct of the case by the district justice in question was accurately reported, and what are in fact the full, precise and legitimate implications of the district justice's words from the bench as actually spoken.  The only way to ascertain this equitably is by the setting up of a judicial inquiry. This the Minister has full power to do. It is only in the light of the findings and report of such an inquiry that he or anyone else can equitably decide whether or not further action is required. I therefore respectfully urge upon him the necessity of setting up such a judicial inquiry forthwith.</P>

      <P>I second this motion.  I also endorse all of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said and if I may be permitted to do so.  I should like to commend his moderation.  I do <Col N="160" /> not propose to speak at any length.  I shall say three things only.  I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that there is widespread public disquiet at the newspaper reports of the proceedings. Secondly, I believe&mdash;I know many citizens share this view&mdash;that there are full grounds for instituting a judicial inquiry.  Lastly, I would urge the Minister to assert his powers in regard to what some of our citizens at least consider to be a grave infringement of constitutional rights and a grave breach of fundamental civil liberties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>This motion is in order because of the provisions of the Act of 1946 which gives power to the Minister for Justice to take steps which will eventuate in a judicial inquiry into the conduct of a district justice.  The power the Minister has seems to me to be a power which he must decide to exercise or refuse to exercise.  I am afraid he must do so without comment. Senator Sheehy Skeffington made an admirable speech in the circumstances in which, like the rest of us, he was precluded from criticising a district justice.</P>
      <P>I think we should take a general view of this matter.  The Constitution of the State and the practice since the State was founded guarantee the absolute independence of the judiciary in the exercise of their judicial functions.  If my memory serves me right, the Act of 1946 which makes provision for this particular type of inquiry, in certain respects puts the district justice on the same plane as a High Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The independence of the judges is an excellent principle.  It has been accepted by all our citizens and in practice, it is something which has worked extremely well.  In particular, the system inaugurated shortly after the State was founded, of district justices, has given great satisfaction throughout the country.  The system works well and that does not mean that every one of us at all times must be satisfied with every decision given or every observation made from the bench, but the system does work well and the disquiet in a certain circle about this particular matter indicates <Col N="161" /> in its own way how well the system works generally.  It works particularly well for ordinary people who have no influence and no power.  It works well, as everybody knows, for minorities, no matter how one defines these minorities.  Nothing should be done or said, or implied, which would take in any way from the independence of the judges, no matter what their rank.</P>
    <P>If I may allude to one thing which Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, it seems to me to be nothing short of a mental aberration for a former Supreme Court judge to say that when a case has been decided in court, everybody is free to criticise it and the Minister in particular is free to criticise it.  It would be an extraordinary state of affairs if the Minister for Justice, or any other Minister, considered himself free to criticise a decision given in court by a district justice or any other person holding judicial office.  I am sure this Minister or any other Minister would not contemplate doing anything of that sort.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that this inquiry should not take place.  The Minister has already answered a question in the Dáil on the matter and he has given certain guarantees which I am sure will be carried out, and which have always been carried out.  I do not want to express any view, and nobody on this side of the House wants to express any view, for or against anything that has been said or done by a particular district justice in a particular case.  That would be improper here and highly undesirable. I should like to say that we do not agree that this is a case where a judicial inquiry should be set up.  I think it is only right I should say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said and to look at the matter from the point of view of the regard we have for the judiciary.  I think it would be in order to say that we have inherited, or perhaps really helped, to build a judiciary of which we are very proud and in which we have the greatest faith.  I do not think there is anybody in this House who, if he <Col N="162" /> were unjustly accused of a crime, would like to be tried under any other system of justice in the world than the one which we have here and in these islands.  We all have the greatest respect for that system and for that judiciary, perhaps with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil, but that is beside the point now.</P>
      <P>If we do not uphold that tradition and give it the support in this House that we feel it should get, according to the traditions of this House and of the country, then, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, we will lose one of the great bulwarks of democracy and of civilisation itself.  It is with that viewpoint that I would suggest to the Minister that if there is a case of overstepping the line by a member of that judiciary that causes the public to be concerned and in fact in this case I think it has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My point was that if there is public concern over a decision, then it is the Government's duty, through the Minister, to consider it and, if necessary, hold an inquiry into that decision.  That is what this case boils down to.  If the Minister considers there is enough public concern over any decision of the judiciary, then it is his duty to allay that concern in the interests of the judiciary and the country at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes to some extent has given the guidance to the House that I was anxious to give immediately after the seconding of the motion.  Therefore I should like to begin by repeating what I said in reply to a question that was addressed to me in the other House that it would not be proper for me to comment on the handling of this <Col N="163" /> case by the district justice and the remarks which he is reported to have made.  To do so would inevitably tend to shake the confidence of the public in the independence of the judiciary and for a very obvious reason.</P>
      <P>How could the judges or justices retain any semblance of independence if a member of the Executive were to act on the principle that he was free to express disapproval or, for the matter of that, approval of the way a judge or justice had acted in a particular case, seeing that it is within the power of the Executive to sponsor or support a resolution for a judge's removal from office, to increase judicial salaries and to promote a judge or justice from one judicial office to another on the occurrence of a vacancy which permits of this being done.  Were such a principle to be acted on how could the public be sure that some judicial person had not been influenced in a subsequent case by such an expression of approval or disapproval?</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that once a case has ceased to be <i>sub judice</i> comment is free and that it would not be an interference with the independence of the judiciary for the Minister for Justice to say what he thought of the way such a case had been handled.  It does not need a lot of imagination to see where this doctrine would lead us or much reflection to detect the fallacy. Our civil liberties are inseparably associated with the independence of the judiciary but how could either endure if when a judge or justice had acquitted someone that the State had prosecuted he were to be told by the Executive that he ought to have convicted him or that having imposed one sentence he were to be told that he ought to have imposed another and does anyone suppose that a hint by the Executive as to how a judge or justice should act in the exercise of his functions is any less objectionable if it has been occasioned by the decision in a particular case the hearing of which has concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made the foregoing remarks for the purpose of clarifying my position with respect to the precise question that has been raised.  Is not this <Col N="164" /> a case, the motion suggests, in which the Chief Justice should be requested by me to arrange for a judicial inquiry under the provisions of Section 21 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946?  Let me remark in passing that if it were such a case, which, in my opinion, it is not, I could not prejudge the issue by lending myself to a discussion of the substance of the matter which was going to form the subject of such an inquiry.  But having decided that this is not a case for a judicial inquiry, am I then free to go into the reasons for that decision? By no means, for this could not be done without saying something which might be taken to imply approval or disapproval of the way a justice had acted in court which, for the reasons I have already explained, is precisely what I am not prepared to do.</P>
    <P>As the Senator knows, there is a way provided for in the Constitution by which a judge or justice may be removed from office by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas but, otherwise than as a part of that procedure, I am not prepared to do or say anything that would appear to be an interference with the independence of the judiciary, the maintenance of which I regard as vital in the general public interest.  However, I would be less than candid if I did not add that nothing could be graver than a resolution of the kind and that I would regard it as wholly unwarranted in the present case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House long.  I am grateful for the manner in which I have been allowed to raise this matter, in which I have been allowed to put my case, and the way in which it has been received by the Seanad.  I feel very strongly that Senator Cole has said the fundamental thing when he says that it is because we have the greatest respect for the judiciary that the present circumstances would demand a judicial inquiry, not a prejudging of the issue but an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leads me to the Minister's reply.  The Minister insists that it would be most improper for him to comment, but I would remind him that the motion does not ask him to <Col N="165" /> comment.  It asks for a judicial inquiry.  It is obvious that such an inquiry would send a report to him. It would investigate the facts&mdash;what did take place, what was in fact said, how the case was conducted&mdash;and make a report.  It might easily report that the Press accounts were gross distortions, or that the Press reports were substantially correct, but that the conduct of the case was entirely unreprehensible, and that there was no cause for public concern; or, thirdly, that the conduct of the case was improper.  Even were the last of these to be the conclusion of such a report, the Minister would not then be bound to act upon it, but he would be bound to consider such a report.</P>
    <P>My motion asks not for a ministerial comment but for a judicial inquiry into the facts.  The Minister reminds us that it would be possible for any of us to move a resolution demanding the removal of the district justice.  In my opinion, that would be grossly unfair to the district justice in question, because sufficient facts are not before us.  I would much prefer to have a judicial establishing of the facts, before suggesting any action or deciding to take any action.  It is for that reason that I would press this motion and urge the Seanad to pass it, asking the Minister to set up a judicial inquiry to investigate the facts, and report back to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter the Chair has kindly allowed me to raise is this&mdash;the urgent need for improvement in the scientific sections of the National Museum.  First, I should like <Col N="166" /> to thank the Minister for coming here to give us his views and listening to mine.  We have been looking to him with confidence as a young and energetic man, to face some of the urgent needs for reform in this country.  What I am offering him this evening is a limited objective in education which I suggest he, by his efforts and the support of his Department, could put through in a few years.  It has the advantage of no political strings tied to it, and I hope that when he speaks to us this evening, he will justify our confidence in him.</P>
      <P>I referred to this urgent matter previously on the Appropriation Bill, 1957, and on the Central Fund Bill, 1958.  Owing to pressure on his time, the Minister for Finance was unable to give any definite reply, so I very much welcome this opportunity of hearing the Minister's views directly.</P>
      <P>Before I say anything about the regrettably insufficient state of the science museum, I should like to make it very clear that I am not offering any criticism of the present staff.  They are doing a good job in very many ways; but I am going to say that in the present conditions of space and of personnel they cannot do what they ought to be able to do.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say in detail what I said before, to give the history of the museum or details of what is wrong with it.  I am quite sure that the Minister is already very well informed on this matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, by way of proof, three things.  First, there is the significant fact that the visitors of the scientific department of the museum ceased to function some years ago in sheer despair and for no other reason, because year after year they suggested necessary improvements and were simply ignored.  The names of those visitors are to be found in <i>Thom's Directory.</i>  They are eminent scientists representing universities and other scientific institutions in our country, and it is a very grievous fact that they felt bound to retire through sheer despondency at the state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I can quote the opinions of many eminent scientists, to the effect that at the moment, the scientific section <Col N="167" /> of our museum is entirely inadequate. Thirdly, I have gone to see for myself, and possibly some other Senators have done so, and it is quite clear, even to a layman in science like myself, that it is quite inadequate.  Valuable specimens, extremely valuable specimens, simply cannot be displayed. They are stacked higgledy-piggledy in a room which is not open to the public. Some of the specimens are deteriorating from lack of staff to look after them.</P>
    <P>Again, there has been a very serious decline in the teaching and research work which our scientific museum should do.  That is mainly due to lack of staff.  I will quote one highly significant and most deplorable numerical fact.  The number of visitors visiting the scientific section of our National Museum a year ago was 145,000 less than it was 30 years ago.  The number of visitors has fallen off in 30 years by 145,000&mdash;almost half the number who attended about 1928 are not attending now, and that despite the fact that the population of Dublin has almost doubled in that time.  That is a most serious fact that speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that at the moment the museum is not merely unsatisfactory by present standards of scientific education but is unsatisfactory by the standards of 50 years ago. That is a very shocking thing and I believe I could produce ten eminent scientists in this Chamber who, if allowed to speak, would support what I have said.  We have gone back rather than forward in our scientific museum in the past 30 years.  That is a most regrettable situation.</P>
    <P>It is bad for three reasons.  It is bad because scientific education in any developed country needs a good scientific museum to supply it with specimens, to help it with exhibits and with lectures.  There are thousands of things that an energetic museum could do, even a museum like that in Glasgow which is not a metropolitan museum, but is doing ten times as much as our museum is doing at present in the way of scientific education.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is bad for the scientific <Col N="168" /> development of the country.  &ldquo;Economic expansion&rdquo; is the phrase we are using now which means development of our natural resources, and if we want expert knowledge of the minerals, the plants, the animals of the country, the best way to provide that knowledge is to have a good scientific museum.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is bad for our prestige among visitors to this country.  It was very regrettable that last year, when a very large scientific association, the British Association, was visiting Dublin, and went to our science museum, they were most dismayed.  There is a contrast there with the archaeological section. When visitors come to our archaeological section, they are impressed and delighted.  They then go to the other side and find quite the contrary.  That is most regrettable from the tourist point of view and the point of view of the good name of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The third aspect on which I want to concentrate, since the Minister is here, is the educational aspect.  I would urge on him very seriously, that a well-equipped scientific museum is essential for good scientific education in the schools and the universities. It is not enough for a museum to be a mere repository of specimens.  We know the old-fashioned kind of museum, rather dusty and rather dark, where the things are kept safely and if anyone is prepared to do a certain amount of burrowing, he can get them out.  That idea of a museum has gone completely.  The modern idea is that it should be a dynamo for scientific studies and knowledge throughout the country, and it could be that.  I am sure the Minister recognises these considerations and I am pretty sure that he is concerned about the present situation.</P>
    <P>I can envisage some possible objections he will put up to making a change and I will try to meet them. The first is, obviously, finance.  This will cost a good deal of money&mdash;it will be a matter of, I should think, some tens of thousands of pounds. Well, we have had a programme put before us within the past few weeks of £220,000,000 to be spent on economic <Col N="169" /> expansion.  Excellent&mdash;but I do want to say this: it is not enough to provide materials and machines for the future prosperity of Ireland.  We do need, and will need urgently, well-qualified men and women to manage and direct our materials and machines. We will need people who understand the fundamental principles of science and who can apply them.</P>
    <P>There is a quotation which I think we older members of the House once learned for the intermediate examination, and I hope the Minister insists that citizens of this country learn it for the intermediate examination still. It is from a poem written 200 years ago, the <i>Deserted Village</i> by Oliver Goldsmith, but it still applies to what I am saying now:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Goldsmith goes on to say that princes and lords may flourish but if a bold peasantry go, the country is doomed. I suggest, if industrialists and manufacturers flourish and we have not an educated citizenry, it will be just as bad for the country.  The modern equivalent of the princes and lords are the manufacturers and industrialists; the modern equivalent of the bold peasantry is the well-educated citizen of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger in this £220,000,000 economic expansion programme that unless the Minister fights his corner&mdash;and I am speaking on the wider issue now&mdash;for education, he will be failing us, I think, as a nation. Material expansion without education will do us no good.  I simply say that to meet the possible financial objection. If we can find £220,000,000 for material things, can we not find one-half or possibly one-tenth of a million pounds for our scientific museum?</P>
    <P>There is another objection the Minister may have in mind.  I listened with great interest to his speech in Trinity College some weeks ago on the risk&mdash; I would even say the undesirability&mdash; of training scientists for export.  I agree with him to a large extent.  That is what our natural history museum&mdash;<Col N="170" /> that is its technical, old fashioned name &mdash;will not be doing because it displays and promotes understanding of the natural wealth of our own country primarily.  It fosters a deeper knowledge of Ireland, and I would say a deeper love of Ireland.  Many a schoolboy has got to know the country better, its birds and its plants, from what he has seen in the natural history museum.</P>
    <P>It is quite different from the nuclear physics kind of science.  On the whole, we cannot afford that in this country and if we educate for it, there is a risk that they will go abroad.  I suggest that by fostering the kind of science our scientific museum should foster, we will not be encouraging export or emigration.  We will encourage the people to stay at home and understand their own country better.</P>
    <P>There is one other risk that the Minister may say: &ldquo;Well, that is all right, but there are a great many other things to be done in the Department of Education and this must wait its turn.&rdquo;  It is for him to decide ultimately, of course, but I do suggest that here is a limited objective with no political complications, as some of the other possible projects would have, which would be achieved in the lifetime of one Minister.  If he would put this high in priority, at the top priority, of his Department, he could do a very fine job for the country. There is this urgent need in our scientific education.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I would, as a practical step, urge the Minister to do this.  I urge him either to recall the Board of Visitors with an assurance that something special will be done or else to set up a larger committee, perhaps incorporating the visitors, to examine the whole position. However, it is no use doing that unless he gives them some kind of an assurance that drastic improvements will be made.  As a long-term policy, perhaps the Minister or the Department might consider moving the whole museum right away from here out to Glasnevin beside the Botanic Gardens&mdash;building, with part of the £220,000,000, a fine big scientific museum in Glasnevin.  In Stockholm, I understand that the scientific museum is near the Botanic <Col N="171" /> Gardens.  It works in very well.  There is plenty of room there.  If he would do that, the Minister would solve the whole problem because our archaeological museum would then have sufficient space and the Botanic Gardens would have a helpful neighbour.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to appoint a committee with a definite assurance that something will be done.  I hope he will undertake this task.  I hope he will show that he is determined to make the scientific museum worthy of Dublin and a fit adjunct to Irish scientific education.  In any efforts he is prepared to make, I assure him he will have the eager and active support of scientists and educationists throughout the whole country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have very little time in which to debate this subject, I shall be very brief.  I agree fully with every word Senator Stanford uttered and I would add my voice to his.</P>
      <P>I happen to have been, or perhaps I still am, if it is not altogether disbanded for good, a member of the Board of Visitors.  It was composed of members of the Royal Dublin Society, the Royal Irish Academy, the National University, Dublin University and the Minister's own representatives.  Just as Senator Stanford said, the committee was a very conscientious one and was composed of the very best people in the country who could be found for that particular object.  If the names are examined, I think it will be seen that they are highly representative of all the scientific and cultural bodies which they represented.  That body tried very hard to get something done, but, in complete despair&mdash;it is the only word to describe it&mdash;eventually gave up their activites.  However, they always made it clear that if they were required to do any useful job in the matter, they would be willing to come together again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can say, without revealing any inside private information, that the Board of Visitors looked with great hope to the establishment of the Arts Council.  I happened to be a member <Col N="172" /> of the original Arts Council.  I asked the Board of Visitors not to disband until the Arts Council got going, so to speak.  It was brought up as one of the very first inquiries of the Arts Council when it was established in, I think, 1952.  A recommendation was made to the Department of the Taoiseach but nothing was ever heard since about it&mdash;and there the matter stands at present.</P>
    <P>I have visited the museum regularly since I was in the National University in 1919.  It was a place I went to form the very beginning, when I came to Dublin first.  In those days, we were under the British Government.  The museum, as I think Senator Stanford will agree with me if he remembers that far back, was really quite a presentable museum at that time.  It was very well staffed.  It was comparatively up to date by world standards at that time in its presentation of exhibits and even in its purchases.  It was able to compete at auctions with dealers and with private collectors both here and in England.  Altogether, for our position in the world, it was really quite an adequate museum.</P>
    <P>As Senator Stanford has said, steadily since we got self-government, the museum has deteriorated more and more in every way.  We have had most distinguished members of the staff there who had to give up because they were not being properly remunerated but I think that was a very secondary consideration with them.  It was mainly because they felt they were in a decaying organisation, that, in a scientific world in which everything was going ahead, they found themselves stagnating.  In the end, having stuck it out for a long time, many of these distinguished men were forced by circumstances not only to leave the museum but to leave the country and to go to other places where their services were fully availed of.  Scientifically, their services were availed of and they were financially rewarded.</P>
    <P>Even here to-night, Senators may have noticed that when Senator Stanford got up to speak, the gallery was full.  When he sat down, the gallery was practically empty.  The obvious <Col N="173" /> lesson is that it is rather a boring subject. I found that out myself in my own life as I have been interested in these things.  I found it was always a boring subject.  Whenever I brought it up before several Governments, I was told, in effect: &ldquo;We cannot do it today: maybe to-morrow.&rdquo;  The whole sum that is spent, perhaps, on An Bord Fáilte might be better spent if it were all put into the museum rather than into An Bord Fáilte, if it is as good as it is.  Even financially, as a tourist winner, apart altogether from its scientific implications, it would probably be good value for the money spent.</P>
    <P>I should like to see something being done at last, even if it is only in this limited sphere of the scientific museum. My only objection to Senator Stanford's proposal is that he has not included the Art Museum because everything he said applies also to the other museum.  It is really all one, although it should not be.  However, that is another day's work.  If we could only get down on the lowest level, preserve and build up what we have on the present site, it would be something, but not enough.  What should be done is that there should be a division.  All these parts of the museum should be subdivided.  There is even room for a folklore museum which should be in a park as is the case in the Scandinavian countries.  There is a big and important job to be done there.  I heartily support Senator Stanford's motion in its restricted sphere.  I should like to see that sphere widened.</P>

      <P>In the rather limited time at my disposal to reply to the arguments made by Senators Stanford and McGuire, I think it would be better if I confined myself as much as possible to the factual position as it is and as we hope to see it.  The financial provision for the Science Museum which, as Senator Stanford says, is more correctly known as the National History Division of the National Museum, comes under the Science and Art Vote in the Department of Education group of Votes.  There is also in the same Vote provision for the National Library, the National College of Art and the Irish Manuscripts Commission&mdash;the <Col N="174" /> National Gallery happens to be in a separate Vote.</P>
      <P>There is one thing which I will readily agree is common to all these institutions.  They are severely restricted in their work and in the efficacy of their work by considerations of space.  Sooner or later&mdash;and the sooner the better&mdash;the country will have to face up to reasonably adequate expenditure to make these institutions worthy of their name and of the country.  As Senator McGuire pointed out, they may be matters which do not demand great public outcry on their behalf in respect of financial provision, but there is no doubt that the country will have to face up to greater expenditure on these institutions, if it desires to have and to keep them.</P>
      <P>If I might confine myself to the Natural History, Division of the Museum, Senator Stanford has referred to the fact that it does play an important part in scientific education. I cannot deny that.  I would not attempt to belittle in any way the part it could and should play. But it must be agreed that the research function of the professional staff of the National Museum is rather a limited one.  In the broader sense of the word &ldquo;research&rdquo;, it is more a university rather than a museum function.  Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the existing professional staff there have not been and are not engaged in research.  There is evidence in the recent publications by some of the members of the staff and publications by other persons with the assistance of the staff and the facilities provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may mention <i>Irish Fishes</i> by Doctor Went, published in 1957; and <i>Penal Crucifixes</i> by Mr. A.T. Lucas, the present director, published in 1958. I am told that there are in the course of preparation <i>Guide to Irish Antiquities</i>, in galley proofs, and <i>Irish Swords</i>, in page proofs.  There are two other works: a supplement to Father Colgan's <i>Flora of County Dublin</i> and <i>Irish Birds,</i> which are in varying degrees of readiness for the printers. In addition, the existing staff have publications to their credit in many <Col N="175" /> archæological publications, not only in this country but in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>I should like to say <i>en passant</i> that, as far as I am aware, there have not been any retirements of outstanding men in the museum, in recent years at any rate.  There is no record of such a man having retired from the museum, either because he was dissatisfied with the work or by reason of the level of the remuneration.  Of course, we did have the retirement of one of the assistant keepers, who was appointed to a Chair in University College, Galway.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of staffing and rates of remuneration, it might be recalled that in recent years there have been considerable improvements in that respect.  In 1954, the present post of director was created.  Up to then, the senior post there was an administrative one, but now the director is a well-known scholar and for that reason the work of the entire museum is kept in greater conformity with required standards.  Three assistant keeper posts were sanctioned in October of last year.  A little before that, five technical assistant posts were created instead of the three that had existed.  There were improved salary scales for all the staff and, even as late as January of this year, there was a revised scale for keepers.  A smaller point, indicating perhaps the degree of attention being given to the staffing position generally, is that half of the attendant posts have been made established posts.  It is true that at the moment two vacancies for professional assistants exist in the Natural History Division, but the posts have been advertised on a number of occasions and some difficulty has been experienced in finding suitable persons to fill them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the non-functioning of the Board of Visitors, I might mention that the present period of non-functioning is not the only one in the history of the museum.  I believe it has happened two or three times in the past 50 years, so that any frustration the board might feel as to their recommendations not being implemented is not peculiar to the present <Col N="176" /> time.  Nevertheless, many of the improvements that have taken place in the recent past were suggested by the board themselves.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reconstitution of the board, I would not be at all unsympathetic to their coming together again, but as Senator McGuire probably knows better than I, some of the present members have retired from the various posts by which they were particularly qualified and some have died in the meantime.  It must be remembered, too, that under the statute, the Dublin Scientific and Art Museum Act, 1877, two other bodies have the right to nominate visitors: the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society.</P>
    <P>I might mention that there has been some difficulty within the committee itself in regard to the interpretation of the board's duties and functions.  These had not been resolved at the time they disbanded and I am given to understand that some members of the board came to my predecessor and informed him they were taking certain steps as a result of which they felt the board could function again, but my predecessor never heard anything more about it.  He went out of office a year and a half afterwards and I have not been approached directly on behalf of the board ever since.  Nevertheless, as I said, I am not unsympathetic to the reconstitution of the board on its present lines or on expanded lines, as suggested by Senator Stanford.</P>
    <P>I might add, as an example of recent activities which are indicative of greater interest in the museum generally, that an Irish glass collection was purchased for £9,500 and an Irish silver collection for £1,400 approximately. These were two valuable additions and, without the necessary financial provision, could not have been purchased for the museum.  In the coming financial year, I hope to be successful in persuading the Dáil to raise the Grants-in-Aid for the purchase of specimens, fittings and materials.  The present grants are comparatively small, but I hope to make a reasonably substantial addition to them in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might conclude with the <Col N="177" /> thought which I expressed at the outset, that we are entirely below par with regard to accommodation in the three main institutions to which I have referred?  I want to say to the Senators who spoke and the Seanad in general that the question of accommodation for the museum, and particularly for the Natural History Division, is under active consideration. That is no mere platitude.  I can <Col N="178" /> assure Senators that, in so far as it lies within my power to do so, the question of the provision of adequate accommodation will be pursued actively until such time as we can overcome the present unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th December, 1958.</P>
