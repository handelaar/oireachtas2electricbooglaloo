      <P>It is my sad privilege to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, as a tribute of respect to the memory of His Holiness Pope Pius XII, Seanad Éireann do now adjourn, and that an expression of its profound sorrow on the death of the Holy Father be sent to His Eminence the Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals.</P>
      <P>The universal sorrow occasioned by the death of His Holiness Pope Pius XII is evidence of the love and respect he inspired, not only in 450,000,000 Catholics whose spiritual leader he was, but in millions of people of every faith and race who saw in him a fearless champion of social justice and human freedom, and the foremost advocate of peace and goodwill among men.</P>
      <P>Pius XII came to the throne of St. Peter only a few months before the Great Darkness fell over Europe in 1939.  As Secretary of State to his illustrious predecessor he had worked unceasingly to avert the disaster which threatened mankind for the second time in a generation.  As Pope, he intensified his efforts&mdash;alas, without avail.  &ldquo;Nothing is lost by peace&mdash;all can be lost by war,&rdquo; he said, in a memorable appeal before the guns spoke in Poland, and this wise counsel motivated his unremitting labours during every one of the 19 arduous years of his great Pontificate.</P>
      <P>The world remembers with gratitude his paternal concern for the military and civilian victims of the holocaust; for the prisoners, for the orphans, for the sick, for the refugees. His charity knew no frontiers of creed or ideology.  He directed and financed a worldwide organisation whose phenomenal achievements in the alleviation of hunger, suffering, and distress make a splendid chapter in the history of our times.</P>
      <P>The voice of Pius XII was always raised against tyranny and injustice, and on behalf of the workers, the poor, and the downtrodden.  He was the Supreme Crusader against race hatred and the colour bar.  His succour of the persecuted Jews in the hour of their direst need will stand for all time as a shining example of brotherly love and as a powerful rebuke to the enemies of religious liberty in every land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His sympathetic understanding of the awakening national consciousness of the peoples in Asia and Africa was <Col N="3" /> reflected in his creation of a Chinese and an Indian Cardinal, and in his anxiety to speed the day when a native clergy would be available to meet all the needs of the mission fields.</P>
    <P>Better than any of the long line before him, this widely travelled multilingual Pontiff knew the world in which he lived and was keenly aware of its complex problems.  He was an earnest and consistent advocate of international co-operation in every field.  He welcomed the advent of the United Nations Organisation but deplored its lack of effective means to enforce the rule of law.  He pleaded the cause of the undeveloped lands and the rights of colonial peoples. Appreciating the deadly menace to civilisation of the hydrogen bomb and the expanding stockpile of nuclear weapons, he repeatedly stressed the urgent need for an international agreement to control them.</P>
    <P>Pope Pius XII had a deep affection for Ireland.  He received and honoured the leaders of our country and, on one occasion, expressed his admiration for the Constitution and system of government under which we live.  He paid a unique tribute to our national language by addressing a group of Irish pilgrims in the native tongue.</P>
    <P>That gentle voice which radio made familiar to us all is stilled forever.  The Catholic Church has lost a wise and saintly Father, the world a great statesman and an outstanding exponent of the Christian way of life.</P>
    <P>Anois, nuair atá an Pápa Pius a Dó Dhéag imithe ar shlí na fírinne uainn, níl le déanamh againn-ne ach guieachaint ar a shon.  Go raibh solus na síoraíochta ag a anam uasal, agus go raibh an dea-shaol a chaith se anseo os chionn na hEaglaise in a lóchrann soillseach dúinn fad a mhairfimíd.</P>

      <P>Is ceart agus is cuí do Sheanad Éireann brón agus cumha a chur in iúl ar bhás an Phápa. Tá ambasadóir againn ag a chúirt sa Róimh, ach taobh amuigh de sin tá dlúth-cheangal is fíor-charadas idir pobal Éireann agus an Athair ró-Naomhtha. Tá an ceangal san chomh láidir inniu agus a bhí riamh, nó níos láidre, mar is mó agus is minicí is <Col N="4" /> féidir le h-oilithrigh an Pápa d'feiscint agus a ghuth a chloisint inniu ná aon am ó thosaigh Éireannaigh ag triall ar an Róimh.</P>
      <P>In expressing our sympathy on the death of Pope Pius XII, we are at one not only with the whole free world but with millions of others who are unable to make their voices heard. There has never been more widespread, more spontaneous or more sincere grief on the passing of a great international figure.</P>
      <P>When the late Pope ascended the throne in the Spring of 1939, war was already in the air.  He was to live through that war and never for the remainder of his life was the world really at peace.  He had not only to face the dangers of the complicated problems which arose from the conflict itself, but also the emergence of new national and social forces and of new and awesome scientific discoveries. These discoveries dealt not only with man's physical make-up but also with his brain, his mind and his personality. The late Pope left none of these problems untouched.  He was well equipped for his task by his experience, his unique intellectual gifts, his deep spiritual fervour and his universal sympathies.  Pius XII was able to meet the great figures of this age, men distinguished, each in his own sphere, and to impress each and every one of them.  But, as well as that, he was tireless in giving audience to the plain people of every race and creed, and class and colour.  Surely, he will be known as the most accessible Pope in history to the ordinary layman.  He spent himself in the service of God and we pray that God may rest his soul.</P>
      <P>I have the honour, a Cathaoirligh, to second the motion.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group in the Seanad and on my own behalf, I wish to be associated with this expression of condolence on the death of our Holy Father, Pope Pius XII.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past century, the Church has been ruled by a succession of great Popes&mdash;Pius IX, Leo XIII, St. Pius X, Benedict XV, Pius XI and Pius XII. All of them were outstanding for the <Col N="5" /> sanctity of their lives, for their wise and courageous leadership and for the depth and extent of their learning.</P>
    <P>More, perhaps, than any other Pope, Pius XII came into contact with the people of every nation and of every condition.  For each he had a special message; his words brought light and hope and peace to millions of humanity.</P>
    <P>Pius XII had a very deep devotion to the Mother of God and, perhaps because of this, the Catholics of Ireland, with their centuries-old devotion to Mary, had a very special love for the late Pontiff.  We mourn his death.</P>
    <P>As a worker and a representative of workers, it is right that I should recall that in order to show his anxiety that all should recognise the true nature of work, Pope Pius XII, on 1st May, 1955, instituted the Feast of St. Joseph the Worker.  He said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is Our intention in so doing to bring all men to recognise the dignity of labour.  It is Our hope that this dignity may supply the motive for the formation of a social order and a body of law founded on the equitable distribution of rights and duties.  This day, therefore, May 1st, which is here acclaimed by Christian workers, and has received, so to speak, its Christian baptism, will no longer be a stimulus of hatred, discord and violence.  Instead, it is now and will continue to be a recurring invitation to modern society to fill up the things that are still wanting to social peace.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On his election as Supreme Pontiff in the fateful year of 1939, Pius XII took as his motto&mdash;&ldquo;Peace is the work of justice&rdquo;.  It was truly a motto which fitted him, not alone because of his family name Pacelli&mdash;&ldquo;Son of Peace&rdquo;&mdash;but also because of his work before and after his elevation to the Throne <Col N="6" /> of St. Peter. Because of his untiring and unceasing work for peace, Pius XII has become known as the &ldquo;Pope of Peace&rdquo; and now he has gone to his eternal reward.  Whilst mourning his passing, we are comforted by the fact that his teachings and writings will live on.  May his teachings and continued intercession on our behalf bring peace to the world, to our country and to our hearts.</P>

      <P>As a representative of Dublin University and as a member of the religious minority in the Republic, I should like to share in this tribute of respect to the memory of His Holiness, Pius XII.</P>
      <P>By his wisdom and by his courage, by his warmhearted understanding of the problems that most deeply concern us all in this anxious epoch, and especially as a champion of peace, the late Pope won the respect of many outside his own fold.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to add further to the tributes that have been paid to his memory.  My predecessor, Dr. Alton, late Provost of Trinity College, was able to speak on a similar sad occasion in the past from personal acquaintance with the Pope of that time; I have not had that privilege. But I have a profound conviction of a deeply felt sense of loss throughout the whole of this country on this occasion.  I should like, therefore, on behalf of the university that I have the honour to represent, on behalf of my colleagues in the Seanad, and on behalf of the religious minority, to take this opportunity of offering our respectful tribute to the memory of Pius XII, and our deepest sympathy to our fellow countrymen in their sorrowful bereavement.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to, unanimously.</P>
