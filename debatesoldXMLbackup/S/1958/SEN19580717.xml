      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is introduced with the object of amending the law relating to savings banks.</P>
      <P>The five trustee savings banks in the State&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Monaghan&mdash;are very old institutions, all having been founded between 1816 and 1820, long before the Post Office Savings Bank was established. They have furnished and continue to furnish an excellent service for the small saver.  While the trustee banks are private bodies and do not form part of the machinery of the State, nonetheless they have always been subject to State supervision, with legislative provision to determine the manner in which they should conduct their business.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the Acts which govern them were passed in the early nineteenth century and the consolidating Act of 1863, with certain amending Acts, is still the governing statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only change in the governing legislation made since the setting up <Col N="1004" /> of the State took place in the early 1940's.  The Finance Acts of 1940 and 1942 provided that the Irish Trustee Savings Banks instead of, as formerly, investing their deposits with the British National Debate Commissioners should invest them in the same manner as deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be appreciated that the code of legislation under which the banks operate is now somewhat out of date in certain respects. Steps have already been taken in Britain to bring savings bank legislation into line with the needs of to-day and between 1920 and 1949 four amending Acts were passed, followed in 1954, by a consolidating measure.</P>
    <P>We are, of course, aware of the desirability of consolidating in one Act the legislation dealing with savings banks and a comprehensive review of the position is, in fact, in hands; but, since the matter is very technical and complicated, examination will take some time.</P>
    <P>The trustee savings banks have, however, drawn special attention to certain statutory restrictions which are unnecessary in present-day conditions and which hamper them in co-operating fully in the savings drive. The present short preliminary Bill has for its objective the removal of these out of date restrictions as soon as possible.  As well, the Bill makes certain provisions in relation to the superannuation of the banks' staffs, designed to bring the pension terms to be given to these staffs as nearly as possible into line with those available to civil servants under the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>We intend to press ahead, in consultation with the banks, with the major job of revision and consolidation. If, however, it transpires that the number of amendments necessary in the law is considerable, as they well may be, the Oireachtas may find it more convenient to have the amendments in the form of a second preliminary Bill, so as to simplify their study of the final measure, which would then be a purely consolidating one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> Section 1 of the Bill is the interpretation clause.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that deposits may be received and repaid by cheque or other negotiable instrument; that transactions of deposit and withdrawal may be carried out either during or outside normal banking hours and by post; and that where a group savings scheme is in operation, deposits may be collected by the bank at the place where the scheme is in operation, either during or outside normal banking hours and by one officer only, whether honorary or paid, of the bank.  It is not envisaged that the banks will issue cheque books to their customers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 enables the trustees of trustee savings banks to make and carry out pension schemes for their permanent whole-time staffs with terms which are, as far as possible, equivalent to those applicable to civil servants under the Superannuation Acts.  At present, superannuation benefits are limited to those provided for civil servants under the Superannuation Act of 1859.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relieves a bank from the obligation of printing its rules in every deposit book issued by it.  Instead, a copy of the rules must be made available free of charge to any depositor who asks for them.</P>
    <P>Section 5 removes the restrictions which now prevent a depositor from having more than one account in a trustee savings bank or in the Post Office Savings Bank, and from holding accounts in both a trustee savings bank and the Post Office Savings Bank. Power is also taken to amend the declarations required from intending depositors in both types of bank as these declarations at present contain a statement that the depositor has not an account in any other savings bank.  It has been found that the prohibition on double accounts hampers group savings schemes since only persons who have no account already in another savings bank can participate in such schemes</P>
    <P>Section 6 is the customary section dealing with the short title and citation of the Act.</P>

      <P>What is the reason for the withdrawal outside the usual office hours?  It sounds an extraordinary thing.  I take it that an official of the Trustee Savings Bank could hand over money outside the usual office hours. Is there any particular reason for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for that, principally, is that, at present, money being deposited must be deposited in cash during office hours and in the presence of two officials.  That means that money could not be sent in by post or sent out by post and also, as I explained already, it makes it almost impossible to deal with a group scheme because, to keep within the law, if there were a group scheme in any factory, they would all have to come to the bank inside office hours to make the deposit. It is to enable the bank to take deposits by post and to collect in the case of a group scheme outside the office that these restrictions are being removed.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - International Finance Corporation Bill, 1958&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable Ireland to join the International Finance Corporation which is an affiliate of the World Bank.  The corporation's functions supplement those of the World Bank and membership of the corporation is open only to members of the <Col N="1007" /> bank.  Fifty-five of the 66 countries, apart from Ireland, which were members of the bank in May, 1953, have also joined the corporation.</P>
      <P>The objects of the corporation are indicated in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill.  The memorandum also gives examples of projects which have been financed by the corporation.  The articles of agreement of the corporation comprise the Schedule to the Bill. These form the corporation's charter and they contain its regulations relating to its membership and capital, its operations and its organisation and management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the information contained in the explanatory memorandum and in the corporation's articles of agreement, I think that I may confine my remarks to the benefits to this country which are likely to follow from our becoming members of the corporation.  The corporation's primary object is not simply to help along certain selected private projects by making loans available to them. Its purpose is wider.  It is to demonstrate that private investment in the less developed areas when prudently made and properly managed can be both profitable and useful and by that demonstration to encourage investment in these countries by private investors. As I mentioned in the Dáil last week, our need is not for foreign capital as such but for the technical knowledge and managerial skill that may be expected to come with foreign capital.  The possibility of obtaining assistance from an international financial organisation such as the corporation may be expected to overcome in many cases the initial reluctance of firms in the United States and elsewhere to invest in a country like Ireland of which they may have had no previous first-hand experience.  We may also expect to benefit from the corporation's functions as an international clearing house for investment projects.  In this way opportunities in Ireland which might otherwise escape their attention can be brought to the notice of foreign firms seeking investment opportunities.  The possibility of obtaining financial assistance from this <Col N="1008" /> source should encourage the initiation of productive projects by Irish interests. I am, therefore, confident that by becoming members of the corporation we will be placing ourselves in a position to secure valuable assistance in the task of encouraging productive investment in this country.</P>
    <P>The financial commitments involved in membership are indicated in the explanatory memorandum.  It is understood that on becoming a member Ireland will be obliged to subscribe for approximately 350 shares of the corporation stock at a cost of 350,000 dolelars. The amount of each country's subscription to the corporation is related to its subscription to the World Bank.</P>
    <P>In addition to subscribing to the capital stock of the corporation membership involves the according of certain privileges and immunities to the corporation.  These are similar to those granted to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank by the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the articles of agreement of the corporation it will be necessary for the Government to sign the articles and to deposit with the World Bank an instrument setting forth that it has accepted the agreement in accordance with its law and has taken all steps necessary to enable it to carry out its obligations.  The present Bill, which follows generally the lines of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1957, in so far as that Act relates to the World Bank, is designed to give approval for the acceptance of the agreement by the Government and to provide the powers necessary to enable it to implement the agreement. The explanatory memorandum indicates the purpose of the various sections of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the three or four Bills that we have had of this sort.  I hope it is like one of those medieval military operations whereby all the little citadels outside were taken before attacking the main fort.  I have not any great faith, however, that that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say, <Col N="1009" /> as he said in the Dáil last week, that it was not a question of getting foreign capital in here.  I have heard quite a lot about the scarcity of capital in this country from politicians over the past four or five years.  My recollection is that the first person I heard publicly making comment on that of an appropriate kind was my colleague, Deputy Crotty, who said in Kilkenny a couple of years ago that we had too much capital in this country.  I thought, in regard to the kind of campaign that was being waged at that time, that it was a very appropriate comment.</P>
    <P>Last year, when the Minister brought in the World Bank Bill and the Bretton Woods Agreements Bill to this House, Senator O'Brien and I were in agreement that there was no great necessity for capital of this sort in this country and that we were unlikely to need the help of these international institutions on the capital front.  It is something to think that he has been converted. Whether he thought about the matter before at all or not&mdash;it might not have been in his territory&mdash;the Minister certainly is now on our side.</P>
    <P>As I say, I hope that when the Minister has completed this operation of attending to little outside citadels in relation to our whole financial set-up, he will then see about attacking the main fort and putting it in the same kind of order.  If it is necessary to have legislation, I hope that he will bring in that legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be welcomed, in the same way as the other Bills last year were to be welcomed.  I do not think, as I said about the Finance Bill yesterday&mdash;I think I called it the &ldquo;fat&rdquo; Finance Bill&mdash;it will help the country greatly, but I see no objection to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say, except that my recollection is that, when speaking here last year on the World Bank, I did stress the importance of the advisory services that might come from that bank.  I did say that it might be very useful to get finance for a big project, if there was a big project for which capital was needed.  I still think we may need capital for a big thing of that kind, but principally I should say that <Col N="1010" /> if we did not think we knew enough about the project, the best way to get technical assistance is to get the capital and the technical assistance at the same time.  The same applies here.  This corporation, of course, deals with private enterprise.  In fact, it does not ask the Government to recommend or guarantee a project.  It acts directly with private enterprise itself.  When this Bill goes through, it will be a matter for any private individual to get in touch with the corporation if he needs finance and make the necessary arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to bear out what I said earlier, the purpose of the corporation, under Article 1, is &ldquo;to further economic development by encouraging the growth of productive private enterprise in member countries, particularly in the less developed areas.&rdquo;  I doubt if any Government in this country would plead that this country is a less developed area.  I hope it would not.  I do not think it would be true to plead that it is a less developed country in this sense, I am glad to say.  Secondly, I doubt if we did plead it, that the corporation would be prepared to accept that plea. As I say, I have no objection to our carrying out this operation, and I think it is part of a scheme of approach, but I do not think there is really any question of this country being a less developed area.  We have become a member of these institutions and they all link up together.  I do not think the Minister would like to give that impression, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to what he said in reply to my earlier observations, I think that impression might be got from what he did say.  He said there was some likelihood that we might need capital under certain circumstances and so on.  I <Col N="1011" /> firmly believe there is no shortage of capital in this country.  I believe that there is a good deal of capital inadequately used, both monetary capital and real capital.  Accordingly, I should not like anybody to get the impression from the Minister's reply to me that there was something of that sort in the Bill.  We have all had the experience over the years of operations of this sort where expectations were aroused and grievous disappointment when those expectations were not realised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to implement the arrangements in relation to surplus wheat which were announced in January last and subsequently discussed in this House.  The proposal is to spread fairly over all wheat growers the cost of disposing of such quantity of millable wheat as may be produced in excess of requirements. For this purpose a levy will be deducted by the purchasers from the price of all millable wheat marketed; this levy will be paid into a fund to be managed by a board to be set up under this Bill and will be used to meet the cost of the disposal of the surplus wheat.  In respect of the 1958 crop the surplus will be that quantity of wheat marketed for milling in excess of 300,000 tons dried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important sections of the Bill are Sections 2, 3 and 4.  Section 2 provides for the deduction of the wheat levy from the standard price by the purchasers and for the transmission of the sums involved to the board which is to be set up under the Act.  This section also provides for a payment of the levy to the Minister in the event <Col N="1012" /> of the board not being in operation before the commencement of the 1958 harvest.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the fixing of the rate of wheat levy by the Minister. It is intended that before fixing the levy the Minister should consult with the board to be set up but provision is also made for consultation with representatives of the growers in the event of the board not being in operation before the levy appropriate to the 1958 crop is determined.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the establishment of a board to be known as An Bord Gráin.  The primary function of this board will be to collect the wheat levies and to arrange for the disposal of surplus wheat to the best advantage. It is intended that the board shall consist of a chairman and not less than four or more than eight other members to be appointed by the Minister for Agriculture.  I may say here that before making appointments to the board, I propose to have consultations with the interests concerned.  These interests include not only the growers of the wheat but the pig feeders and the manufacturers of animal feeding stuffs who will be concerned in the disposal of the surplus wheat for feed.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that in addition to the general powers being given to the board to purchase and sell surplus home-grown millable wheat and to collect the wheat levy it will also be empowered&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to invest moneys under its control;</P>
    <P>(b)  to arrange for the carriage, drying, handling and storage of wheat either by providing itself with the necessary facilities or by arranging with the owners of such facilities to use them on behalf of the board;</P>
    <P>(c)  to provide itself with such offices and premises as it considers necessary and to equip and maintain such offices and premises;</P>
    <P>(d) to borrow, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time such moneys as it considers necessary; provision is also made for the <Col N="1013" /> guaranteeing of a loan to the board by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance up to a maximum of £3,500,000;</P>
    <P>(e)  to appoint such and so many persons to be its officers and servants as it thinks fit; (an officer of the board will be authorised to inspect and to make copies of records of all purchases of wheat. This power is necessary in order that the board may ensure that levy is paid on all purchases).</P>
    <P>(f)  to require wheat purchasers by notice in writing to furnish to the board in such form and at such time or times as it may specify returns disclosing the date of purchase of any wheat and the quantity, quality and condition of wheat purchased.</P>
    <P>It is provided in Sections 20 and 21 that the board shall submit to the Minister each year a copy of its accounts (including the balance sheet) certified by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, together with an annual report, and that such accounts and report shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the primary function of the board is to collect the levy and arrange for the disposal to the best advantage of the surplus wheat which may arise.  I would like, however, to direct the attention of the House to Section 7 of the Bill, which provides that the Minister for Agriculture may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time by Order (a) assign to the board such additional functions as he thinks fit in relation to cereals (excluding wheat imported for milling), cereal products and animal feeding stuffs; (b) make such provision as he considers desirable or necessary in relation to matters ancillary to, or arising out of, the assignment to or fulfilment by the board of functions assigned to it under this section.</P>
    <P>This provision is being included in the Bill in view of the fact that Grain Importers (Eire) Limited will probably be wound up in the near future.  As the House is aware, that company has fulfilled a very useful function since <Col N="1014" /> 1939 in arranging for imports of wheat and coarse grains and also in operating various schemes introduced for the purchase and disposal of home-grown cereals.  When this company was set up in 1939, it was intended that it should operate only for the emergency period.  Due to various circumstances, however, it has been continued in operation and its directors, who have given their services without fee, are anxious to be relieved of their responsibilities in this regard.  It is now proposed that the business of importing wheat for milling will revert to the usual trade channels and while it may be possible, in consultation with the interests concerned, to arrange for the import through the usual trade channels, of such limited quantities of coarse grain as may be required, it is most desirable that some central organisation should be available to implement such schemes as may be devised for the marketing of home-grown cereals.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that the arrangements now proposed for the marketing of surplus millable wheat are experimental; they have been accepted by the Government following consideration of the various proposals put forward by interested parties and if they do not operate satisfactorily some other arrangement will have to be devised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in my view, crystallises an action by a Party now in Government who refused to accept the difficulties that existed with regard to the marketing of what and are now asking the wheat growers to accept those difficulties themselves. Everything is now being cast back into the hands of the wheat growers to look after them.  This Government went into office after constantly and repetitively refusing to accept the difficulties that existed and refusing to consult with the then Government in their efforts to do their best for the wheat growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest anybody should think that this was the first time there was a surplus of wheat and the first time there was a major difficulty, one has only to address oneself to the figures of mill <Col N="1015" /> intake.  In 1953, there was an intake of 2,600,000 brls; in 1954, 3,286,000 brls.; and in 1957, last year, we had a mill intake of 2,781,000 brls., approximately the same as 1953.  This year we have approximately the same intake as we had in 1954.  The difficulties in 1954 were largely magnified by the fact that because of the very wet year, our wheat was such that less could be used in the grist.  Much less of that wheat could be used in the the grist then.</P>
    <P>The principle of the married price which was regarded as a satisfactory principle by such organisations as N.F.A. and which is adopted in this Bill is merely a principle.  It has absolutely no relation to the mathematical calculations and the decisions that are arrived at after study and which are to be carried out under this Bill.  The principle of the married price is merely a principle.</P>
    <P>It is well that we should now look on wheat growing from the point of view of the policy in regard to wheat growing of the various Parties in the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, before the last election, said that the best he could do was that for five years he would guarantee that he would name a price before the wheat was sown.  His words were received with derision.  He was regarded as somebody who was merely saying he would reduce the price.  Everybody saw a difficulty arising at that time.  It was perfectly easy to say to Deputy Costello that he was being cagey, but if the arrangement had stood, the farmers would have known the price before they sowed the crop.  This year, they did not know and next year if this Bill is bulldozed through Parliament, they will not know.  &ldquo;Bulldozed&rdquo; is the operative word.  This Bill is being bulldozed through Parliament, with no regard for the interests concerned and for the opinions of people, such as Deputy Russell in the Dáil, who raised their voices on the matter.  There was no spirit of co-operation.  This Bill is being bulldozed through Parliament. It is a case of like it or lump it.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of the principle of the married price, a figure of <Col N="1016" /> 300,000 tons was taken.  It is well we should consider this figure and where it came from.  In December, 1953, before the last election, when it was a fact that there was going to be a difficulty with regard to the marketing of wheat, the Fianna Fáil Cabinet took a decision.  That decision, if one has regard to the Dáil Debates, was mentioned not once but four and five times by them since.  That decision was that the aim was a production of 300,000 tons of wheat.  That aim is still there enshrined in the married price, but the only difference now is that it represents a forced reduction of 100,000 tons in the production of wheat.  This is the Government which, when out of office, talked in a headline in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of October 23, 1955, like this: &ldquo;Farmers count their losses in millions; wheat, beet, potatoes incentive is gone&rdquo;, in an article by the late Deputy Walsh, Minister for Agriculture, God rest his soul.  Even the drop of 100,000 tons was still some tens of thousands above the Fianna Fáil aim at that time.  &ldquo;The drop represents some £800,000 loss to the wheat growers.&rdquo;  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!  The pot is surely calling the kettle black to-day!</P>
    <P>The Bill is a clumsy Bill.  I do not know how it got through the Department of Agriculture because I think there are men there who know the trade, men who know wheat growing and who should have made some better contribution than this clumsy effort before us.</P>
    <P>Quality and standards of wheat are completely ignored.  Be it known that the flour millers of this country to-day employ a milling consultant who has a laboratory with 50 laboratory assistants testing every possible thing about wheat, flour and bread.  What has the Department of Agriculture to compare with this?  Have they tried? Is there anything in the Bill to let us know that they will try?  This is a most important thing because it must be remembered that for the first time we will have this year at least 400,000 tons of wheat on the market and there will be a market at full price for 300,000 tons of it.  The millers know that and they know that quite a lot of it will be set aside for animal feeding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> I do not know if any provision is to be made for segregation or anything else, but I know that a flour miller will not buy wheat for the colour of anybody's bright blue eyes.  Milling is not a nationalised industry and the miller will behave exactly the way that best suits himself.  Some years ago, this was not so because there was a subsidy. If millers then behaved in a similar manner, there was a similar subsidy and the whole thing worked out normally, but now it is different.  If a miller on the north side of Dublin can take in excellent wheat for milling which will give better and more flour per barrel of wheat, he will do better than his neighbour on the south side who takes wheat which is millable, but of which a certain proportion is mediocre.</P>
    <P>If you go to the fair to buy ten cattle and 15 are on offer, if prices in relation to quality, bulk and all the rest can be roughly standardised, what do you do?  You pick out the ten best cattle and leave the five worst behind. That happened in regard to wheat last year in Dublin City, where you had seven or eight or nine intake points and each intake point was trying as hard as it could to get the best wheat. They wanted the others to get the mediocre wheat, while they got excellent millable wheat.  This was because for the first time the price of the loaf and the price of the bag of flour was going to fix their profits.  They wanted to see to it that they got the better wheat so as to make the better profits. There is no safeguard to see that the farmer will not have more of his wheat rejected than is necessary.  &ldquo;Rejection&rdquo; can be &ldquo;selection&rdquo; and &ldquo;rejection&rdquo; can well become &ldquo;selection&rdquo; next harvest, if the Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>Talking about the reduction in price, the people who get the price will be lucky because they must have top quality wheat.  Everybody cannot have the best quality of the wheat tendered at intake points.  Everybody cannot have the best best at the fair and everybody every year cannot have the best wheat.  Everybody, if he is a good farmer, can produce good millable wheat.  Maybe one year it will be a week later than the year before, but <Col N="1018" /> perhaps that suits that year.  You will have the situation whereby those decent men producing wheat over ten years may next year or the year following find that they are selling, not on the basis of rejection, if the wheat is not millable, but on a basis of selection even though it is millable.  If it is possible for the intake point to select enough wheat of better quality than a farmer's wheat and put it aside for milling then that farmer will have his wheat rejected, even though it is millable.</P>
    <P>I had rather thought when there was to be a new approach to wheat intake, a new approach to wheat drying, a new approach to wheat milling and a new approach to wheat growing, that at least some little promise would be given to farmers that the practice of other countries would be followed and that some effort would be made to blend Irish wheat.  Up to the moment it was a fact that no such effort was made because Irish millers', the port millers', viewpoint was that if they had the &ldquo;cure-all&rdquo; of foreign wheat to mix with Irish wheat in sufficient quantity, they did not need to blend their Irish wheats.  Irish wheat could be of any sort and quality so long as it was barely millable because the millers could use the &ldquo;cure-all&rdquo; of foreign wheat and forget the blending of Irish wheat.</P>
    <P>In England, where as little as 15 per cent. of English wheat is used in the grist&mdash;though it is as high as 35 on certain occasions&mdash;ships carry wheat from East Anglia to the Port of Liverpool for use in the mills and wheat from the Manchester area makes its way to mills along the Welsh border which is quite a considerable distance from where it is grown.  Here where the price of wheat is fixed there is a problem to be faced.  With a proper blending of Irish wheat, it is possible to use a greater amount in the grist.  Fianna Fáil have decided that 300,000 tons are the amount they can use.  They are happy if they can use that amount, but I am not happy.  I want to see more of it used.  I am not naïve enough to say that with a wave of a wand, you can use 100 per cent.  Irish wheat, but I am brave enough to say that I hope efforts will be made.  This is one effort which can be made.  To give an example of <Col N="1019" /> blending and how it works, we had this year at various intake points in Louth wheat which is more acceptable to millers for inclusion in their grist at the moment than other wheat which the millers had.</P>
    <P>I have heard the miller in a very large mill in Waterford say that he was very sorry that he could not get down to Waterford some of the wheat of his own firm from Ardee in County Louth for the admixture, and in my own business, a miller for whom I buy wheat has refused to allow me to take even a very small quantity for animal foodstuffs because he wants to admix it with wheat from another area which has certain characteristics.  These are things which should be investigated but are not to be investigated and are not envisaged in this Bill.  If the Department of Agriculture has not at present the facilities to enable it to know what is wanted, there are a couple of milling consultants, very large firms, in England which will gladly give them all the reports and information about Irish wheat they want.  If we are only groping before we walk, if the Industrial Research Institute is not supplying as complex and complete figures as we would like or doing all the tests, let us see to it that we get the information by going further.</P>
    <P>Section 7 was referred to in the Dáil the day before yesterday by Deputy Russell.  I do not like it.  I realise that during and after the war there was the necessity for the purchase of coarse grains by Grain Importers, Ltd., yet any of those large State-sponsored organisations are liable to be expensive and I would prefer if the disposal of millable and unmillable coarse grain and other feeding stuffs was left to the ordinary trade channels. To give an example of what can happen, I have seen wheat being consigned from Louth for animal feeding stuffs to points very far away, at the same time as compound millers in Louth were having it sent to them from as far away as Wexford.  Imagine the loss there in freight alone.</P>
    <P>The flour miller could not care less, nor could Grain Importers, but the unfortunate <Col N="1020" /> man buying a bag of meal in Monaghan, Louth or Meath was paying possibly 6d., 9d., or 1/- more for his bag.  That is what we do not want. We want to get away from organised purchasing.  We have one of the finest grain markets in the world not very far away from us, in Liverpool, and most of our grain comes from there, anyway.  While it is necessary in the case of large shipments to see that large combines within this country which are controlled from outside do not fix prices and create a ring and, while at the same time not wishing to exclude Section 7, I would hope that month by month and year by year there would be a reversion to the ordinary trade channels in purchasing coarse grains from outside this country.</P>

      <P>Finally, I would say that I still have hope that the Minister will see a little bit of light, that he will not bulldoze the Bill through but will listen to the various opinions expressed in this House and by farming organisations outside.  I would prefer that he would have such matters discussed here to-day because, as the Bill is, it is clumsy and various things that have been mentioned by me, for instance, should be considered at least a little.</P>
      <P>There is a point about Irish flour milling which is obvious but never discussed or mentioned.  It seems to be unmentionable.  That is the fact that the two large milling combines which own the port mills derive fantastic, colossal benefit from the fact that they can suck foreign wheat into their mills and their own store and mill it there without further movement.  Imagine the difference between sucking wheat at the North Wall in Dublin or at Limerick or Waterford direct from the boat and milling it, with no extra charges except the port dues, and a miller in Carlow, Sligo or various other places who has to have the wheat taken in at Dublin port, Limerick, Waterford or elsewhere, stored for him by firms like the Merchants' Warehousing Company, bagged off or put into bulk lorries and driven to his mill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The relation is that this is a Bill designed to dispose of surplus wheat and also to look after the purchase of the wheat crop in the future, and here is a considerable extra profit that could be looked to in the Bill and should in fact be considered when the framework of financial legislation under Sections 2 and 3 is being considered.  The Minister should consult with the millers on this point and, if possible, see to it that there is more equity in the milling trade.  If the intake of foreign wheat was even punitively treated, it would be far better. Imagine a situation where a flour miller knows in his approach to the purchase of Irish wheat that if he can import 10 per cent. more foreign wheat, he will gain a fabulous sum of money!  This should not be allowed to continue.  Those millers with these facilities should be encouraged, even by punitive measures, to see to it that more Irish wheat is used, because the more Irish wheat used, the higher the price will be to the farmers.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister if he can to give us the price of Irish wheat for the coming year before the Dáil and Seanad rise.  After all, the elected representatives, no matter what political side they come from, are entitled to know.  Even though the Minister has arrangements made that he will not make the announcement until the end of the month, it is a cheap thing not to have an opportunity of discussing the price of wheat here.  I at least have not approached this in a very political way, and the Minister would find that the matter would be discussed amicably and fairly, if he would make the announcement now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, to my mind, is legally to rob the farmers of this country and to enable the Government to evade the responsibility which rests on nobody but themselves.  When they were not in power, by speeches from back-benchers and innuendoes from Front Bench Fianna Fáil Deputies in the <Col N="1022" /> Dáil, they tried to put over to the people that if they were re-elected, they would increase the price of wheat. This Bill is nothing more than complete and absolute deceit.</P>
      <P>I have seldom got up in this House feeling so badly about any Bill in my four years as a member of the Seanad, and I think that the Minister by this Bill has done irreparable harm to his own Party.  He has taken what I would consider the cowardly way out, not facing up to the responsibilities and promises made by both Fianna Fáil front-benchers and back-benchers in election speeches and speeches made during their term in Opposition.  This is a very undemocratic way of taking advantage of the farmers of this country. They have been robbed by the millers for the past 20 years and now a Bill is being introduced to rob them still further.  I protest against this Bill and feel very strongly about it.</P>

      <P>So much has been said on this question of wheat, here and elsewhere, that it is time we became sensible and objective in our treatment of it. Therefore, it is a pity that Senator Prendergast, without apparently having anything to contribute, should rise and make what were&mdash;may I say, without offence to the Chair?&mdash;rather unparliamentary statements.</P>
      <P>I agree substantially with the speech made by Senator Donegan on the scheme&mdash;since he, apparently, is agreeing substantially with the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have misinterpreted the Senator.  I take it he agrees that some scheme must be found for dealing with surplus wheat.  We are agreed that we have arrived at the stage where more than the 300,000 tons will be available to us each year, as an excess over and above the amount decided by the Government to be necessary for milling to make bread <Col N="1023" /> and flour for our people.  Since we are to have that surplus, it is obvious that some organised scheme must be found.</P>
      <P>Apparently the Minister is not very tied to the present scheme, as he indicated that it is of an experimental nature and that, as a result of experience, amendments of the scheme or some other scheme may be found necessary to deal with this matter.  We are all agreed that we will continue to have that surplus of home-grown wheat and that some organised scheme, reasonably fair and equitable to all parties, must be found.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a reasonable, a fair and an honest effort on the part of the Minister to devise a scheme which will be reasonably fair to everybody.  No one of us, and certainly no one representing the farming interests, would like to see a position whereby a certain number of wheat-growing farmers could get 75/- or 80/- a barrel for selected millable wheat and that the remainder, the not so lucky ones, should be forced to sell the amount not required for milling purposes, but still millable wheat, at a much lower price as animal feed.  It is quite obvious that it would be very unfair to those people who were unlucky or who could not manage to be first in, in supplying wheat to the millers, that they should be forced to accept a relatively low price.  It is to avoid that situation that the Minister has brought in this Bill. Senator Donegan knows that that is so and I suggest that it is because he knows and realises it that he made the rather objective speech he made on this measure.</P>
      <P>I think the scheme is worth a trial. It will prevent some of our farmers getting a good price while others are forced to accept the price of animal feeding.  In view of all that, it is very hard indeed to understand why Senator Prendergast should see fit to get up, without making any reference to the Bill, except to say he regarded it as legalised robbery of the farmers, saying that under the Bill the Government were going to legalise robbery.</P>

He should have listened more carefully to Senator Donegan, so as to get a better idea of what the Bill is about, since Senator Donegan obviously knew what he was talking about.  I hope that, in future, on any measure of this sort, the Senator will not see fit to indulge in these rather extravagant statements, which really mean nothing in the long run.</P>

      <P>I hope the measure will be a success.  I know it will be hard to work it in practice and that many snags will arise.  I know it will be hard to ensure the collection of the levy and, human nature being what it is, there will always be the desire of some to be first, whereupon others will have to be last.  I wish the measure every success.  I hope it will succeed in being fair to all parties, that it will ensure that some farmers will not be forced to sell millable wheat at the price of animal feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>The Minister was asked to indicate the price of wheat.  I should not like to be in the Minister's position in answering that question.  I know Senator Donegan realises how hard it is to make forecasts on that point and that is why he is asking the Minister, rather innocently, to forecast it.  I do not suggest that Senator Donegan is a very innocent man; he is an able man and he realises that&mdash;at this stage, or indeed at any time&mdash;there is some element of guesswork, as one is dealing with an unharvested crop and one has not a very accurate record of the acreage involved.  It is at best an approximation.  It is on the amount of wheat harvested that the Minister must gauge his price.  Therefore, it is rather soon to ask the Minister to commit himself on this matter of price, if he sees fit to hazard an opinion&mdash;perhaps he will; I do not know&mdash;but I think it is rather soon to ask him to forecast the price, since he is not faced with that responsibility at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I hope the board will succeed in ensuring the smooth running of its scheme to deal with surplus wheat and that it will ensure that we will not always be faced with this problem of having debates here about the disposal of wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the Bill is experimental.  I find it very hard to reconcile that with the elaborate machinery set up in the Bill.  This is the first year that we have had the problem of the sale of surplus wheat, but it seems that that matter is to be committed to permanent officers and the board being set up may be a bit premature.  The question at issue seems to be what is to be our wheat policy for the future.  I, like many others, have been hoping for an announcement of some date for the realisation of our goal of a 100 per cent. Irish loaf.  I know the Minister desires that as much as each and every one of us.  It would give great hope and confidence to the country if a date could be set for that.</P>
      <P>I have been reading about what took place in 1928-29 when there was a campaign being waged for the use of 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. of Irish wheat in bread and the millers asserted at that time that it would absolutely ruin the flour.  The same excuse has been used against increasing the percentage. Many people are disturbed by the increasing tendency to monopoly in flour-milling and in the South, especially, there has been a very undesirable development of amalgamation of flour-mills and bakeries with detrimental effects on many small bakeries in local towns.  I doubt if such practices would be tolerated even in America where anti-trust laws are in operation to curb such growth in monopolies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, except in so far as the growing of wheat is creating a function for the board.  The board is to be appointed by the Minister.  I had hoped that the time was coming when our organisations would carry <Col N="1026" /> their share of responsibility for development. I should like to have seen in the section a recognition of our organisations and a provision that a certain number of the members of the board should be nominated by the organisations concerned.  It is quite easy to define what organisations are. Not every body that put up a placard and say that they represent the farmers are entitled to be called an organisation.  They must have the outward marks of an organisation.  They must have offices and premises and adequate staff.  If that criterion is applied, there are only a few organisations worthy to be so called.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister may see fit to amend certain sections to give more direct responsibility to the organisations, especially to the National Farmers' Association, which has been doing a great deal of very valuable uphill work.</P>
      <P>I should like a statement from the Minister as to whether we want surplus wheat in future.  Wheat growing is not a very profitable business, from an export point of view.  It is profitable only in so far as we can use a certain amount at home.  I venture to suggest that the economics of the situation would indicate coarse grains rather than the production of an unnecessary surplus of wheat.</P>
      <P>The question of surplus can be controlled by some system of contracts.  I do not think the board has power to do any such contracting.  There are brilliant examples of beet growers handling their problem on a contract basis. Any wheat policy should give proper help to the smaller grower, the man who uses wheat as a valuable part of his rotation, and any surplus should come through the larger grower or should be avoided as far as possible by a workable system of contract wheat growing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a retrograde step and may have far-reaching effects.  The Bill ends the Government's guaranteed price for wheat and may be only the thin edge of the wedge to end the guaranteed price for beet, barley and other commodities produced by farmers.  All Parties and all <Col N="1027" /> Governments have indicated the importance of fair prices, stability and guaranteed prices for farm produce. This Bill wipes away any guaranteed price for wheat.  At the present time, when wheat has been in the ground for over four months and within a short time of being harvested, no farmer knows what he will get per barrel.</P>
      <P>Various Governments have called for increased production and have got increased production.  The farmers answered the call, not because the fields were filled with inspectors, but because there were inducements given and because they had faith in the past Government.  No matter what may be said or was said here on the last occasion by Senator Lenihan about the anti-wheat policy of Fine Gael, it was during the Fine Gael Party's term of office, when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, that we got a surplus of wheat.  The farmers deserve better from the present Government and from the present Minister than the setting up of a board to do the dirty work which the Minister is not man enough to do.</P>
      <P>The position that exists to-day is of the present Government's own making.  That cannot be denied.  The members of the Government when they were in Opposition went around the country and fooled the farmers by promising them that, if they were returned to office, they would give 82/6 per barrel for wheat.  Even after the election, even last year, they were content to mislead and fool the farmers.</P>
      <P>At column 43, Volume 161, of the Dáil Debates of April, 1957, Deputy Corry put down a question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the absolute necessity for increasing the wheat acreage this year, and in view of the endorsement of the wheat policy by the people...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;That, of course, was because of the inducement that they would get 82/6 per barrel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;he will state what steps he intends to take to secure by financial inducement an increased wheat acreage this season; and if, in view <Col N="1028" /> of the lateness of the season, he will make an immediate statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Acting Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Aiken, in reply, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No alteration in the price of wheat in these last days of March could appreciably affect the acreage of wheat this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister wanted to tell the truth, he could have told it at that time.  Instead of trying to fool the farmers, he could have told them that he believed there was enough wheat sown and that there was no reason to give any further financial inducement to get wheat grown.  He was not prepared to do that, but he was prepared to give the answer which he gave and to continue still to fool the farmers.  If he had told the truth even at that time, the farmers would have been prepared. If he had said, as in all probability the farmers knew, that we would have a surplus of wheat and that it might be necessary to reduce the price of wheat last year, then the farmers would not have ploughed up all the land which they ploughed up last October, November and December and we would not have the position that exists to-day.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, when Deputy Dillon was mentioning the promises made about wheat, the present Minister asked him to produce evidence.  I happened to be in Leighlinbridge on a very cold morning during the by-election for Carlow-Kilkenny and the present Minister strutted up and down outside the chapel gate and one thing is certain, he warmed the cockles of the farmers' hearts there that day.  I remember, and I wrote it down at the time, that he promised he would give them a price of 82/6 for wheat.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that this situation should arise to-day when we are debating this very important question.  It is a very important question for the farmers throughout the country and I am very surprised that any member of the Fianna Fáil Party should say that they made no promises regarding the price of wheat.  Any honest member of the Party will recall that they spoke about wheat, about the price of wheat and about the growing of it, from every platform during the by-elections.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Fianna Fáil Party on this question.  I have a good deal of sympathy with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should keep calm.  The wheat is sown and I hope we will have a bumper crop, even though we will not get the price for it.  Not even the Minister can tell the farmers what price they will get for it.  However, in the past we took harder knocks than that and the farmers will survive it, with God's help.  I should like to support what Senator Quinlan said with regard to a contract price for wheat.  It has worked very satisfactorily as far as the growing of beet is concerned and there have been no complaints up and down the country.  I do not believe anybody should get a monopoly of the good land of this country and growing a cash crop of wheat on it at the expense of the ordinary farmer who sows his quota of wheat each year on the land he has prepared for it; on the tillage land after sowing his potato and beet crop.  If he is breaking up <Col N="1031" /> land for beet and potatoes next year, he can grow a nice crop from it, too.</P>
      <P>Anybody travelling through the country can see whole farms broken up by conacre men.  I believe it is time for the Department to step in, especially since this critical situation has developed with regard to the growing of wheat.  I hope next year the Minister and the Department will make an effort to channel the growing of wheat on the same lines as beet is contracted for to-day.  I hope the board when it is selling the wheat will make a better effort next year in the selling of it than this year.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil recently, we were informed that so many hundred tons of wheat had been sold to British and Six-County farmers and millers at a price of £18 per ton, while the Irish farmer was being charged £26 per ton for it.  After that question, the price of wheat was reduced to the Irish farmer from £26 per ton to £23.  There is no food more suitable for poultry than wheat.  If we have a surplus of wheat, why not give the farmer's wife the benefit of the price we are giving to our competitors in the persons of the British and North of Ireland housewives?  I think it is a very unfair thing.</P>
      <P>Another unfair thing is that nobody can buy wheat except in six-ton lots. The Minister is well aware that the farmer in County Cavan which is his own area and the farmer in West Cork from which I come cannot always afford to buy in such big lots.  He is paying the very extreme price that is being asked for it now by the Department or by whoever is responsible for the sale of it.  They should at least be given the wheat in small parcels at the same price as that at which it is exported to the British and Six-County farmers.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill has been discussed up and down the country.  There is no member on the Opposition Benches who has not been asked in his own area why the board is being formed.  The Department has handled the situation to the best of its ability in the years past.  I am sure that the cost of running this board will also fall on the shoulders of the wheat growers.</P>

In conclusion, I would appeal to the Minister to consider the contract system next year and try to bring some order into the chaos created by the policy of wheat growing pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party and give some sense of security to the farmers who invest in seed in order to grow their field of wheat, plough their ground and pay the rent and rates and all the overheads so that they can at least, before their crop is harvested, know the price they will get for it.</P>

      <P>If this Bill is being brought in by way of an experiment, I consider the machinery too elaborate. As a matter of fact, I do not like too many boards at all.  I imagine there are too many in the country.  They are costly.  Some time ago I met the Minister in Clonmel at a meeting of the agricultural committee.  I told him that I did not consider it was good policy at the time to export the surplus wheat at £19 a ton and import foreign offals.  I explained my view as well as I could.  I was very glad to see some few days later that he had decided to sell the surplus wheat at home at £23 or £24 a ton.  It works out at 28/- a cwt. ground at the present time.  He changed his mind that time.  I appeal to him again to change his mind this time.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be a pessimist at all.  I have a kind of an idea that after a bad season, we may not have the great surplus of wheat at all that people think or about which they talk.</P>

He also stated, if my memory serves me aright, that there was little evidence of co-operation by us as a Party in providing some means of disposing of <Col N="1033" /> it.  I want to tell the House that, when I became Minister, nobody appeared to have done anything about the surplus wheat.</P>
      <P>The amount of surplus wheat which then existed grew up and was a carryover from 1955 into 1956 and from 1956 into 1957.  It was exactly 145,000 tons of dried wheat on the 1st January last. The only amount of that surplus wheat disposed of was a small quantity following our return to office.  I want to tell the House and the world at large that I would not remain in office in any Government looking on at 120,000 tons of dried wheat bulging in the lofts and the granaries of the country, paid for by the millers using their overdraft arrangements to do so.</P>

The wheat was there.  It cost a very substantial sum of money.  If it were to be sold at animal feed prices, it would have to be sold at a loss of £20 per ton.  Of course, the caretakers who were in Government at the time would not face up to that responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The plea was made to me here by Senator Donegan that I was not to bulldoze this measure through the House.  Apparently his understanding of bulldozing is that all the freedom will be given to him, to his colleagues and to all the critics to talk &mdash;as they are entitled to talk so long as they remain within the rules of order&mdash;on the subject, but that when the Minister stands up to reply and hits out hard, they are free to smother him if they can.  But with the assistance of the Chair, I have a suspicion that that is not going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I have been accused of annoying the Minister while he was speaking.  I did ask the Minister, through you, Sir, a simple question.  If I have transgressed, you can rule that I have transgressed.  The simple question I asked was when he came into office. That was all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember dates.  You can find it out easily from the records of the House.  I do not mind being asked a question, but when a Minister or indeed a Senator is making a speech, while a question might be all right at a certain time, it does have a disturbing effect, even if he has the answer on his lips.  It is not right; it is not fair.  It should not be addressed to him in that way.</P>
      <P>I am dealing with a remark made here by the Senator on what he called lack of co-operation in disposing of a problem that was there, he said, as far back as 1954.  I am saying&mdash;what I am saying is true and the records will establish the truth of it&mdash;that nobody really attempted to face that problem but me.  In the course of a few months, one way or another, I have been able to get from the Government the means and the money to dispose of that surplus wheat, to refund to those who paid for it the moneys they were out of pocket and sell that surplus wheat so that the lofts and granaries of the country will be available for the harvest to which we are looking forward now.  I think that was the first and essential step in order to clear up this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me tell the House, too, that as <Col N="1035" /> far as the price at which this has been disposed of is concerned, I actually called the compound millers together for the purpose of discussing conditions under which they might agree to take over all this wheat.  If the compound millers had said to me in the course of those discussions that they were prepared to take over all this surplus wheat at a stated price, I can assure you that they would have got it.  But the compound millers, as I explained to Senator Crowe at that meeting in Tipperary, want to make a compound and in order to make a compound, they must have the ingredients to make it. This was their problem.  This was their business.  They knew more about it than I did.  They knew more about it than most of us here.  They knew what was value and what was not value.  They knew what was a good investment and they knew what was not a good investment.  Anyway, I assume they did, being businessmen as keen as mustard.</P>
    <P>If I then interested myself in wheat or became in any way vocal about wheat, it certainly was since I came back into office as Minister in the month of November, 1957.  This is the task I set myself and this was the concern which I felt: In view of what we suspected would be a large harvest this year, to get the situation clear and to have the machinery ready to move off so that those who had grown this crop would find a customer and so that we would have the means of buying and paying for it, storing and drying it.  Whatever other arrangements were agreed upon between the growers and myself could work out afterwards.</P>
    <P>There have been references here to the production of an all-Irish loaf and the difference that it would make if we were able to provide an all-Irish loaf.  It is not very far back to 1956 and in 1956 the Almighty decided on giving us a certain type of harvest and during portion of that year the percentage of Irish wheat being used was reduced to 50.  Indeed, when the millers at that time were being pressed to buy the wheat, to dry it, store it and pay for it, they insisted on freedom to reduce for a time the percentage <Col N="1036" /> of Irish wheat used for conversion into flour.  It was as a result of that policy in 1956 that I had in 1957-58 the surplus of wheat to dispose of about which I am talking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I say again to those who have been talking in terms of an all-Irish loaf that I am inviting them to take their minds back about a year and a half.  A year and a half ago, the millers were permitted by the Minister at the time and the Government of the day to reduce the use of Irish wheat to 50 per cent., and that assurance was given to them on the understanding that they would purchase the wheat coming on the market, and if they did not get that freedom, they were not prepared to purchase that wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody knows that it surely is not the fault of any Government or Minister that a harvest should be unfavourable.  We have, unfortunately, from time to time, had those fairly bad harvests.  In fact, as Senator Quinlan has rightly pointed out, we had to drag ourselves along and drag the public minds along from the point where we were not using any Irish wheat to a point where we were coaxing them to take 10 per cent.; and we have gone from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent., to 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and to 80 per cent.  That does not appear to be a bad result at all.</P>
      <P>I have been accused here, too, of producing a figure of 300,000 tons of dried millable wheat as the quantity required for our own purposes.  It has been said here and in other places that this figure was never agreed upon, was never understood to be the figure by those who discussed this whole scheme provided for in this Bill with the Minister. As far back as 1947, when I was in the Department of Agriculture, we were required as a Government then to make application to the Grain Committee of F.A.O. setting out our requirements in years ahead of imported wheat, and in that application the amount of dried millable wheat at which we aimed here at home was in the neighbourhood of 300,000 tons.</P>
      <P>In fact, we were castigated in the Dáil on several occasions by our opponents and critics in the years that followed because we had committed ourselves to that figure and because, as it was said, we were not really aiming at what Fianna Fáil had been claiming it was aiming at.  Now, of course, for the convenience of political argument, it comes as a shock and surprise to people to find that even with the fall in the consumption of flour which we are told has taken place here and in other countries, the 300,000 tons figure mentioned is something that is just suddenly and swiftly pulled out of a hat by the Minister for Agriculture or some person who has some design of hurting the interests of the growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before, and I will say it again and again because it is true, that the scheme provided for in this Bill for the disposal of any surplus <Col N="1038" /> wheat that should arise out of this year's crop is not and was not the sort of scheme that would appeal to me personally.  As I said yesterday evening in the Dáil, in a matter of this nature, no one, no matter how well informed or how intelligently advised, can be sure that a particular approach to a problem that has existed for the first time is the right approach.  There is always that element of doubt as to whether the approach you have in mind is the right one as against the approach suggested by some others.</P>
    <P>I am quite truthfully saying this, because those with whom I discussed this, thanks be to God, are all alive and well and can always meet me face to face, and if I tell an untruth in this matter, then they should be able to establish that; but in the course of my discussions with them, as I said yesterday evening, I devoted quite a considerable time to a very severe criticism of that scheme, because I wanted to give to those who designed it, or in whose mind it was formed, a chance of convincing me that they had been thoughtful about it, that they had applied their minds to it and analysed it carefully.  I said to them, too: &ldquo;Once you hand this to me and once I undertake as Minister to implement this, it is not your scheme any longer. It is mine.  I make myself responsible for it, for bringing in proposals to set up this machinery and for endeavouring to make it work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who is it who would not when meeting a number of farmers who were so keenly affected as they were, naturally, and meeting the Minister whose duty it was to be concerned, who would not say: &ldquo;Well, I do not feel any enthusiasm about what you are urging on me and the course you are asking me to take, but you are the people, after all, who will feel this most one way or another, and why should I not try to meet you?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan has been inviting me to do all sorts of things in this Bill, to give the right to organisations to build up the board themselves and supply the personnel and all the rest of it; but here I was taking the first step along the road that he has been urging me to continue, without giving me any <Col N="1039" /> recognition for the fact that I have taken the first one.  I have, then&mdash;and no emphasis of mine will be sufficient to make it as clear as I would want to have it&mdash;that I am not trying in any way to shirk because in fact the means by which I would have done this myself were entirely different.  In the political world, you have to be prepared to take everything.  Although I met them quite recently on these matters, I am afraid that the poor farmers&mdash;I mean the representatives of the National Farmers' Association&mdash;are not as tough as the politicians and indeed it is a good job they are not.</P>

I am anxious, all the same, to put on record this statement, that I have proof that, from the first day I met the representatives of the growers, I used one figure and that was 300,000 tons of dried millable wheat.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to plead for protection or mercy of any kind, as I have a sort of confidence in myself that tells me I will steer fairly safely over all the difficulties.  It is only right that I should make my position clear, whether others accept it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan asked me to give whatever information I could, if I had any, as to what the price would be. He wants it before the Dáil and Seanad rise.  I am very sorry I cannot oblige him.  First of all&mdash;and this is a very excellent reason&mdash;I do not know what acreage of wheat is in the country at all at present.  I have got only the sort of rough estimate that we ourselves are able to refer to, certain calculations we are able to make on the basis of certain figures.  Whether it be the middle of July or the third or fourth week of July, the determination which is provided for in this Bill should be made in consultation with the board to be set up&mdash;or failing its being in existence, should take place with the representatives of the growers.  That consultation need not take place and could not serve any <Col N="1041" /> useful purpose, until such time as we have the returns from the people whose duty it is to make these returns.  Therefore, I cannot make any guess, nor would it be advisable to start guessing at this stage.</P>
    <P>At the time of the announcement of the scheme, the officials in my Department at my request, placed in black and white before the public, and especially before those interested in wheat growing, a clear idea of how that scheme would work and what effect it would have in certain eventualities.  I said that if the wheat acreage were as it was this year, if the yield from the wheat acreage were the same as this year, on the basis of a 300,000 tons usage of dried wheat, that would result, according to our calculations, in a reduction of 6/- per barrel.</P>
    <P>I said further that if the acreage and the yield should increase or decrease, the reduction figure of 6/- would go up or go down.  Now, I could not go any further than that.  I was anxious to do that in order that people would at least have that as a sort of guide.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I told this in this House, in the course of the discussion which we had here.  I met a County Louth man on my way home from this city one night, before the announcement was made at all.  I was sitting in the car and I saw this young man standing, as I detected, on his way towards Navan.  I pulled up the car and said: &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; and he said he was going to Navan and could I give him a lift.  I did so and immediately he opened his mouth, I knew he was a County Louth man.  I knew by his accent and I said: &ldquo;You do not belong to here?&rdquo;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I am a Louthman.&rdquo;&ldquo;What are you doing over here, so far away from home,&rdquo; I asked; and he said: &ldquo;Well, we have taken land over here for wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So the conversation developed and I was quizzing him about his activities and his employer's activities and the acreage grown and general business and I said: &ldquo;That is a lot of land to take so far away from home for wheat.&rdquo;&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it is going to be down 10/- a barrel.&rdquo;&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;it is a thing about which I do <Col N="1042" /> not know very much.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am not a farmer myself; I read the papers fairly closely and I did not see any announcement on that particular subject. I suppose this is the time of the year that it would be made?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we are waiting for it, but they all say it is going to be down 10/- a barrel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The forecast made on the basis that the acreage remained as it was and the yield was the same was of little value, apparently, to my County Louth friend because he was prepared to take greater risks than that.  Indeed, there must have been very many County Louth men of the same mind, because in spite of the devastation that has been done to the whole wheat policy by the announcement of this scheme, while I cannot speak authoritatively as to the acreage that has been grown this year, according to calculations based on the limited information we have, the acreage will be substantially higher than it was last year.  Therefore, my County Louth friend was prepared to take a chance and so were thousands of others.  They have their own reasons for taking these chances.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan has shown a great deal of concern about wheat growers. He is like myself in that.  I thought I would have a friend in him, in the sense that I thought he would be thinking of the West Cork pig feeders and cheap grains and the sort of free import of coarse grains that Senator Donegan seems to have a notion of also, but it would not suit the book if he came out too clearly or too strongly on that subject.</P>

      <P>Senator Donegan referred to Section 7 of this Bill and another section.  Provision is made for giving to this board certain powers in relation to the importation of coarse grain and feeding stuff of all kinds.  I am making the point that the Senator, having commented, as he did, and expressed, as he did, the wish that these controls be relaxed and removed was really expressing my point of view.  In fact, at the time he expressed those sentiments I said, for the first and only time that I had reason to say so since I came to know the Senator as a Deputy and as a Senator, that I felt like saying &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;.  I said it on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

I have Fine Gael and Cumann na nGaedheal Senators&mdash; of course, there are no Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal Senators in this House&mdash;running ahead of me as far as these very worthy national pursuits are concerned.  When I look at Senator L'Estrange, I think of his contributions during the war years and how critical he was of anybody being asked to grow wheat and the unkindly reception he used to give Ministers when they found it necessary to go before the body of which he was a member, the County Committee of Agriculture of Westmeath.</P>

      <P>They want to be braver than the National Farmers.  The National Farmers knew very well that the taxpayer was not going to continue to give a price for wheat that would result in the sale of, say, 75,000 tons or 100,000 tons of surplus wheat at a price around £20, £21, £22 or £18, while at the same time paying for that wheat £38 of the taxpayers' money. The National Farmers knew that.  They were very wise to arrive at that conclusion, as they did.  Do you think that would be good enough for the new-found converts to this national policy?  Not at all.  They would pave the roads and surface the boreens of Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal with surplus wheat at £40 a ton at the expense of the taxpayer about whom they make so many wails from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am terribly concerned about that, for my own sake.  I do think that a wee bit of diversion is no harm.  As I stated yesterday, whatever may be the conclusion of people who have not had the opportunity of knowing, there is no person who would be as anxious as I or more anxious than I when discussing a measure of this nature to give any information that I could, to meet any reasoned argument that is advanced, provided, in my judgment, as a result of my experience of dealing with public men, they were genuinely trying to be helpful and constructive and to improve the machinery provided in the Bill or to make suggestions, the adoption of which might effect an amendment of it.  That not only applies in this case but it applies in all other matters and that is as it should be, <Col N="1046" /> more especially I would say where a Minister for Agriculture is concerned, rather than any other Minister.</P>
      <P>As far as the request made by Senator Quinlan is concerned, I appoint the board.  Somebody must have the responsibility of making the appointment.  The representatives of the organisation that speaks for grain growers know that I will consult them. I have told them that I will consult them.  No Minister, if he is a responsible person, wants to be tied down, so long as the responsibility is his, by a provision that he will do something on the recommendation of So-and-So.  A board dealing with a matter of this sort should be substantially representative of growers, but as I say there are also the compounders, the cooperatives, the pig-feeders and other such interests, as well as those who produce the grain.</P>
      <P>When I approved the inclusion of a section like Section 7, I was thinking in terms of this board, if it appeared to work, as a replacement for Grain Importers entirely, and a board to which I could refer questions such as the ones I have had to decide since I became Minister.  I must say I was reluctant to decide such questions because I did feel, even with the advice of my best officials in the Department, that I was not the person who should make these decisions. Questions which I have to decide are those such as whether in view of the fact that we are trying to dispose of 120,000 tons of wheat, I should give a licence for the import of pollard; whether we should import any additional barley, or any or all of these things, at a time when there was a surplus of wheat.</P>
      <P>I would prefer questions of that nature to come before a board composed of all these interested parties, so that the different points of view would be expressed at board meetings, that the representatives of each interest would see the others' difficulties, and that the decision arrived at would be more likely to receive wider approval than if the matter were decided in the political sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I met the farmers this morning, the representatives of the <Col N="1047" /> grain growers, and I am very pleased to announce that they are prepared to co-operate fully in the implementation of the machinery provided for here, when this Bill becomes an Act.  The Bill has to pass here; it has to be signed; I have to appoint the board; the returns have to be got and the amount of the deduction will have to be determined&mdash;and this is what I do not like&mdash;when I say I do not like it it is because I made a statement that in the month of July, I would announce what this deduction was to be.  I made that statement in good faith and it still could be possible that I would not be able to make the announcement in July.  I would make it in an hour if I was in a position to make it.  To those who want to accuse a Minister, or any person, of deceit on that basis, well, I make them a present of it.</P>
    <P>I was being pressed in the Dáil to give this information.  I was reminded that the month was slipping by.  I know that myself and I can see the steps which lie ahead and which have to be taken and that in all probability I will not be able to make this announcement for some time.  Anyhow, the wheat is growing and no announcement I can make now will affect in the slightest degree what the grower will receive. The calculation will have to be based on certain factors, and if I were to know the acreage now, and to make a calculation as to what the possible yield would be, and to announce that to-night, what would be the difference to the grower, whether he is in County Louth or any other place?  What would be the difference to him whether he hears the announcement now or in the first or second week of August?  It would not make one bit of difference to him.</P>
    <P>However, some people think they can embarrass you if you commit yourself, genuinely, to a date and claim that you are not keeping your word.  I do not think&mdash;and I am a fairly good politician in these matters&mdash;that that works at all.  I do not think there is any kudos due to any individual who approaches his responsibilities in that way.  I think his judgment is entirely at fault.</P>
    <P>Senators who talked about the way <Col N="1048" /> I have &ldquo;codded&rdquo; the farmers offered the greatest insult they could level against the people who own the land in this country.  Anybody who is familiar with the farmers, and with rural Ireland, knows that you cannot fool those people, if ever you are stupid enough to attempt it.  They are far too intelligent and their judgement is far too dependable and in many cases they will keep that judgment to themselves. I only say this by way of advice, that when we use the expression &ldquo;codding the farmers&rdquo; we are really offering an insult, and a very great insult, to the most intelligent section of the community and one of the main reasons I say that is that they have supported this Party and this Government in regard to its wheat policy, and every other policy, for many years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> With regard to new private housing, it is proposed that the State grant for a new house in an area where a public piped water-supply and sewerage scheme are not available be increased by £25.  This increase will be reckonable for supplementary grant purposes, so that the additional grant assistance from the State and the housing authorities would amount to £50 at the maximum.</P>
    <P>In association with this proposal, the Bill provides that the existing grant for the installation of private water-supply and sewerage system be increased from £60 to £75, or to £50 for water-supply and £25 for sewerage system where these are separately provided and that the rate of reconstruction grants available to farmers and agricultural labourers be increased by £20 at each point of the scale.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the scaled scheme of supplementary grants at present payable by housing authorities for reconstruction work undertaken by farmers and agricultural labourers, for the provision of water and sewerage facilities and for works which qualify for improving grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, be replaced by a provision enabling housing authorities to pay supplementary grants of equal amount with the State grants for these works, in relation to the cost of the works carried out.  This proposal will have the effect of raising the valuation limit for farmers qualifying for supplementary reconstruction grants from £35 to £50, the qualifying limit for the State grant.  I would regard participation by housing authorities in assisting persons who carry out any of the works in question as being of importance at least as great as the direct housing operations of the housing authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>Grants for repair and improvement works are mainly availed of in urban areas.  The amendments I propose are, firstly, to increase the rate of these grants by £20, as is provided for in respect of reconstruction grants and, secondly, to simplify the administration of the grants and to extend their scope.  Eligibility for these grants would be tested, not by the suitability of the house for occupation by persons <Col N="1051" /> of the working classes or by agricultural labourers, but by the essential nature of the works proposed for the purpose of providing suitable housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the financial part of the Bill enabling housing authorities to make loans for reconstruction works and for repair or improvement works, capital for which will be available from the Local Loans Fund.  The loans would, in particular, facilitate owners or prospective owners to carry out major conversion works on larger houses so as to provide additional rented accommodation of good modern standards.  Owners of groups of terraced houses would also be encouraged to put them in repair and improve them where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government has agreed to make capital available to housing authorities to enable them to make advances under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to persons in the lower income groups purchasing previously occupied houses.  Housing authorities will be notified of the scope of this offer in due course.  The existing definition of market value does not enable stamp duty, legal fees and other costs incidental to the purchase of houses to be included in the loan. It is proposed to enable housing authorities to include all such costs in future for the purpose of calculating the amount of advance to be made, in the same manner as they may be included in the advance for a new house. A person may thus obtain a Small Dwellings loan for the purchase of a previously occupied house and may also obtain a loan for the repair of that house if necessary.</P>
    <P>A final provision on the private housing side is the replacement of the present system of rates remission by a graduated scale of payments over ten years, beginning with the payment of one-tenth of the rates in the first year and increasing by one-tenth each year.  In this way, there will be no sudden increase in annual outgoings facing those in the lower income groups, to whom the impact of full rates after seven years remission of two-thirds of rates might constitute hardship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> The Bill contains an important provision relating to the financing of rural housing provided by county councils. It is proposed that the urban system of differential subsidy will in future apply to rural housing.  Where, for instance, a statutory operation such as the relief of over-crowding or the demolition of an unfit house is involved in rehousing an agricultural labourer or a person of the working classes outside an urban area, the higher subsidy rate would be payable under this Bill. The lower rate of subsidy would apply where no positive action is taken towards eliminating bad housing conditions or the relief of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>In order that county councils will have all the powers of urban housing authorities to deal with slum clearance it is proposed that they should be required to make bye-laws relating to overcrowding in respect of houses intended or used for occupation by the working classes.</P>
    <P>There are two other provisions in the Bill relating to subsidy, neither of which makes any change as far as the financial position of housing authorities is concerned.</P>
    <P>One of these proposes to compound the value of certain subsidies payable under enactments of half a century ago.  The intention is to simplify the method of extinguishing these old loans and to obviate the necessity for numerous annual calculations and numerous minor payments.  In effect, the outstanding balances of certain loans will be reduced by the compounded value of the subsidies and certain investment funds from which annual dividends contributed to the subsidies will be surrendered to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the other provision is to give statutory authority for certain interest subsidy payments being made in respect of borrowings in the period 1948 to 1953.  This authority is sought at the instance of the Public Accounts Committee and does not affect the payments made to housing authorities or town commissioners.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice to renew the currency of the Labourers Acts from time to time for specific periods. The ultimate intention is to merge the <Col N="1053" /> Labourers Acts in the Housing of the Working Classes Acts so as to form a single code.  The present Bill, like various previous Bills, makes its own contribution to this ultimate merger. It also provides for continuance of the Labourers Acts until they are replaced or repealed.  When the consolidation of these codes is completed, the new code will replace the complex collection of Housing Acts which we now have to deal with.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed in the Bill relating to slum clearance operations are put forward in the light of the experience gained by housing authorities, who have found the existing provisions insufficient in some respects.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that owners of premises which are the subject of demolition orders should be required as soon as the order becomes operative, to secure it against further occupation. It is proposed also that a person who occupies or permits another person to occupy an unfit house which is the subject of a statutory notice requiring repairs to be carried out and has become vacant should be liable to prosecution and prescribed penalties.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that where land to be acquired by a housing authority by means of a compulsory purchase order includes dwellinghouses which are unfit for human habitation and are incapable at a reasonable cost of being made fit, the compensation payable in respect of the unfit dwellinghouses, if the Minister confirms the order, shall be site value less the cost of clearance.  This provision contains no new principle.  It will have the effect of preserving the well-established principle that buildings which are unfit for human habitation should qualify for compensation at cleared site value.</P>
    <P>Provision is made widening the power which a housing authority has to close any part of a house let for human habitation so as to bring within this power any part of a house used for human habitation, whether or not the occupation is a letting.  It is necessary also to remove any doubt that service of a copy of a demolition order (not the original order) will be valid compliance with the existing statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> Housing authorities have power to extinguish public rights-of-way and easements in certain circumstances. The power does not extend to the acquisition of lands which, for technical reasons, do not come within the definition of clearance areas or improvement areas.  It is essential that the extended power be available to housing authorities and provision is made for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in this Bill an evolution of the various Housing Acts that have been passed by the Oireachtas from time to time.  In so far as this Bill proposes to safeguard the very large capital assets that have been invested in our housing over the past 100 years, I think it is desirable. It should have the advantage that if houses are properly and adequately repaired, the working and middle classes will have good houses at reasonable rents.</P>
      <P>I now wish to ask the Minister if the provisions of the Bill will help to give effect to these objectives in a practical manner.  Much of this house property for which he proposes to increase grants&mdash;for this is an extension of present legislation&mdash;belongs to landlords, many of whom, owing to the Rent Restrictions Acts, find themselves unable to raise the necessary money for repairs.  There is no use in the Minister saying that he will give very large grants to these people because first they must go to the banks for the money to pay the contractors.  That is the position under present legislation and I do not see any provision in this Bill to simplify the procedure.  It may be 12 or 18 months or two years after the house is repaired that the owner will get the money.  That is the impossible difficulty regarding money facing owners of property in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last housing committee recommended the complete decontrol of houses over, I think, a ten-year period. The reason they recommended that was that it was of no value to anyone to invest money in houses.  If the Minister wants to make the Bill in a success, he will have to bring in a provision, or the officers of the Department <Col N="1055" /> of Local Government must be allowed to frame legislation, so that portion of the money required to repair houses can be paid to the contractor as the work goes on.  In the past, that was not possible.  It was 12 or 18 months or two years, before the money was made available to these people.  In fact, I have been given to understand that repairs which were started had to be stopped because the people who owned the houses had not the wherewithal.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has happened is that the landlord often refused to start off on repairs of houses because he could not get the money from the bank and the local authority had to do the repairs.  The same grants were not available to the local authority as were available to the landlord and the effect was that the tenant had to pay a far greater amount than if the work had been done by the landlord.  The poor landlord found himself in the position that he had not the money to do it, but the procedure would have been effective, if facilities had been given to the landlord.  It may be necessary in certain cases to give the landlord a loan as well as a grant.  A landlord who has a considerable amount of property which has got into disrepair&mdash; he has not been able to maintain it because of the Rent Restrictions Acts&mdash; gets an order from the local authority to repair 50 houses.  The Minister is giving very good grants, but the landlord may not be able to put up the amount he must put up.  It may be necessary in order to preserve these assets to make a loan available for the repair of houses as well as the grants under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I think that successive Governments in this country deserve great credit for the housing policy they have pursued.  I can certainly speak from memory.  In my own lifetime, there has been a great improvement in housing, and visitors to Ireland are greatly impressed by our housing.  In a lecture which he gave in University College, the Deputy <Col N="1056" /> Secretary General O.E.E.C. said that Ireland is one country where there is no housing problem.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into any detail on the Bill.  I simply feel that this is an occasion to draw attention to the Capital Investment Advisory Committee's Report on Housing which should be studied by every member of the House.  It is a very important report and I am glad to say that I can see the influence of the report on this Bill.</P>
      <P>These are the main points in this report of which I see traces in the Bill and which I think are of great importance to the general finances of the country.  The committee believes that houses should be as far as possible provided by private enterprise; that, except in the case of the very poor, houses should be able to be sold on the market without any public assistance; that State expenditure on housing should be reduced to meet the absolute economic and social requirements; that State investment in housing should take as little as possible of the scarce capital of the country which is needed for more productive investment in agriculture, industry and transport.  The committee recommended that houses should as far as possible, even if erected with State capital, pay economic rents.  At present houses are unduly subsidised.  Differential rents should be gradually introduced, with allowances for cases of hardship.  This would tend to reduce the debt charges on housing which were referred to yesterday in the Finance Bill.  They are the principal reason for the mounting charge of the public debt.</P>
      <P>The need for new houses would be considerably reduced if the present stock of houses were more intelligently used.  The object of legislation in regard to private houses should be that all accommodation should be utilised and that waste and deterioration should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One measure to which the Capital Investment Advisory Committee attaches great importance is the repeal of the Rent Restriction Acts, which were war measures and have now outlived their usefulness.  The result of these Acts is that landlords have <Col N="1057" /> neither the power nor the will to maintain their houses, a great deal of accommodation is wasted, some families are overhoused, and landlords are afraid to admit tenants.  The result is that the demand for new houses is inflated beyond a legitimate level.</P>
    <P>The committee recommends very strongly the gradual repeal in stages of the Rent Restriction Acts, with hard cases being specially treated.  Meanwhile, pending the repeal of these Acts and after they have been repealed, owners of houses should be encouraged to repair and improve houses.  Loans under the Small Dwellings Acts should apply to old as well as to new houses, and persons excluded from the Small Dwellings Acts should get guaranted loans from building societies and insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Slum clearance should be expedited by additional powers and the distinction between rural and urban over-crowding in slum clearance should be abolished.  Bad rural housing is a cause of emigration and its improvement is a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>Finally, the committee recommends that whatever capital is saved from the housing programme should be diverted into productive investment.  This would among other things provide additional employment in the building industry, which would also find employment in the repair and maintenance of existing houses and in slum clearance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the main points of this report have been accepted by the Minister.  In his speech in the Dáil introducing the Estimate for his Department, reported in columns 27 and 28 of the Dáil Debates, Volume 170, for 8th July, he lays down the main lines of his housing programmes. I shall not quote his speech, but will simply refer to it.  He seemed to follow very closely, except in one or two respects to which I shall refer shortly, the recommendations of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  Furthermore, the main proposals of the committee are embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill in the Dáil and in this House has laid down the main heads of what he hopes <Col N="1058" /> to achieve by the Bill.  It is clear that the Bill is based to a great extent on the Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in the Dáil :&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In association with financial and administrative policy, these objectives are, first, the eradication of the remaining blocks of unfit housing, in particular in the larger urban areas; second, the rehousing of persons displaced through clearance operations by redevelopment, as far as is practicable, of the cleared areas; third, the encouragement of persons whose accommodation is unsuited for their needs and who are not served by the local authority programme, to provide houses for themselves, either by purchase of previously occupied houses or by having new houses erected for themselves; and fourth, to activate expansion in the very essential work of maintaining and improving the existing stock of houses by reconstruction, repair and improvement, the provision of water and sewerage services and by conversion of houses which are too large by modern conventions for single families, into separate dwellings of adequate standards either for renting or for sale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that this quotation shows that the Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee has been largely followed.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of this Bill I particularly commend.  One is the emphasis on rural rehousing.  Bad rural housing is a potent cause of emigration. The second aspect is, as I understand it from what the Minister stated, that he proposes in the rehousing of people cleared from the slums to resort more to centrally situated flats than to houses on the outskirts of the cities.</P>
    <P>There are two main recommendations in the Capital Investment Advisory Committee's Report which are not adopted by the Minister in the present Bill, and it is to call attention to these that I have risen in this debate.  The two recommendations to which I refer are the repeal of the Rent Restriction Acts and the insistence on differential <Col N="1059" /> rents at a level that will reduce the housing subsidy and debt charges to an absolute minimum.  Until these recommendations are adopted, certain evils will remain in the housing programme. The existing houses will not be properly maintained and there will be a good deal of waste.  Some of the matters to which I referred will continue. The demand for new houses will be unreasonably inflated to a level which would not exist if the Rent Restriction Acts were not in existence. Finally, debt charges in relation to housing will grow and therefore the taxation necessary to meet them will also grow.</P>
    <P>These are matters which were referred to in the debate last night.  I hope the Minister will not hesitate to adopt the remaining recommendations of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  I hope that he will not be prevented from doing so by an unreasonable conservatism.  A dynamic attitude towards the housing problem is now required.  I hope the Minister will not be deterred through the fear of causing unemployment in the building industry.  In the first place, it must be understood that employment is a means to an end and not an end in itself.  The building industry exists for the provision of houses, and not in order to give employment to those engaged in it.  Moreover as I have already suggested, employment will be provided by the maintenance and repair of existing houses, by slum clearance, and by the new productive investment to which it is hoped the capital released from the housing programme will be turned over.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the Bill, in my opinion, is a step in the right direction. We should welcome it in the Seanad, but at the same time, something still remains to be done.  If this Bill were followed by the gradual repeal in stages of the Rent Restriction Acts, with special provision for hard cases, and by the insistence on graduated differential rents to reduce housing charges on the taxpayer to a minimum, the Minister would deserve very well of the Oireachtas and of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  One can do nothing other than congratulate him. In doing so, I sincerely hope that it will give the fillip to the building industry that he hopes for.  There is a depth of sincerity in the Bill, but I could examine it only cursorily when I got it yesterday and I am perfectly satisfied that if it is implemented in the succeeding months, it will be of great advantage to the building industry and to the people who are still looking for houses.</P>
      <P>I would not rise to criticise something that I appreciate.  For many years, I considered that many aspects of this Bill ought to have been made the law of the land; so it would be entirely wrong and unfair to the Minister to criticise him because he is doing something I believe to be the correct thing to do.  We in local authorities can advise the Minister, and I hope in the next few moments to give him the value of my advice and my experience in a local authority and to show how, perhaps, the sincerity that he envisages in this Bill and has incorporated in it may not be implemented as the months and years go on.</P>
      <P>It is our experience on the various county councils that no matter who is Minister and in no matter what fashion a Bill may be framed, there is still the question of appreciation by the local authority officials.  Their method is the important method and their appreciation and interpretation is, in the last analysis, the one that the ordinary public will work on.  If the Minister and his senior officials are conscious of that at this stage, I believe this Bill will give a great fillip to the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said before that the building industry is not an employment factor&mdash;it is a means to an end, not an end in itself.  That may be very well the high level financial aspect, and it is well that those at high level look on it in that way.  We in the local authority must look at it <Col N="1061" /> both ways, to see what is coming to the general public in the way of housing, and also to see it from the point of view of the employment it creates.  That has always been a factor. One may pretend not to see it, but it is there.  It is wrong, of course, that the Minister should introduce a Housing Bill primarily to cure unemployment&mdash;we know that&mdash;but it serves that purpose and we appreciate anything like that, in a country where emigration is so heavy.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay on this measure now, as we will have more opportunity when the Bill comes before us in Committee; and by then we will have a better appreciation of it.  However, there is one point in relation to Part VII, the section headed &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo;. What are the benefits accruing to the ordinary S.D.A. house purchaser from the table?  It is implied that it saves him the impact of having to pay two-thirds rates in the first one or two years of the purchasing period of his house.  In my experience&mdash;and I am sure in the experience of many Senators who are members of councils&mdash;the period of the first year or two does not matter a lot. Most young men who are purchasing houses are reasonably safe in the first couple of years.  The time when it becomes difficult for them to meet their obligations to the local authority is when the children start coming along, in the second, third, fourth and fifth years and that is the time when there should be some alleviation.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree with me because anyone who has taken the slightest interest in this business over the years, and particularly those who serve on local authorities, know that a young man who is purchasing a house under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts does not feel the impact so much in the first year but that the impact is more severe in the second, third, fourth and fifth years, when the children are coming along.</P>
    <P>The table here, while it is in the right direction, is only half a step in the right direction.  Under the old system, in the first seven years, the purchaser received two-thirds reduction in his rateable valuation.  Suppose <Col N="1062" /> the outgoings were £30 on a £15 valuation house, under the old system, in the first year, he would pay £10, in the second year £10, in the third year £10 and so on to the seventh year.  In the eighth year, he would pay £30.  The impact would come upon him then.</P>
    <P>I am quite conscious of the fact that it was with a view to alleviating that situation that this table was introduced. There is a lightening of the impact in the first two years, when it really does not matter.  He pays £3 on a £15 valuation in the first year, £6 in the second year and in the third year £1 short of what he would normally pay under the other arrangement, but, in the fourth year, he is paying £2 more than he would have paid under the old system and in the fifth year, £5 more.  We find that in the seventh year, he would have paid £70 under the old system and will now be paying £84.  In other words, he will have paid £14 more over the years than he would have paid in the ordinary way.  It is a good argument that he is still saved the impact in the earlier days.  Then we go on from that and he is saved a little impact here.  He pays £6 in the eighth year and £3 in the ninth year. We come to the final year, the tenth year, and we find that he has paid £5 more to the local authority than he would have paid.  He is being charged £105 for what he would have been charged under the old system only £100.</P>
    <P>I know that £5 is a small thing in a period of ten or nine years, but it is our job to point that out to the Minister. I believe it was emphasised in the other House, although I have nothing in writing about it.  I feel it my duty to point out to the Minister that this £5 in each case is a consideration and it is felt that a man who purchases a house under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts is entitled to a reduction rather than an increase in financial obligations.  The State is purloining or stealing £5 from each man in these cases.  I do not emphasise that word, but I have no other word for it.  If there were any reason for that, if the purchaser were being cushioned against an impact, I would say that the £5 would be worth it, but he is not being saved from the impact.</P>
    <P>I have experience in Dublin County <Col N="1063" /> Council.  It is recognised on the council that I have good experience of people who purchase houses through the Small Dwellings Acts, which is a wonderful Act.  I cannot over-emphasise that, in my experience, the first and second years do not matter because most young men have money at that period, despite what they say about being &ldquo;broke&rdquo; after paying the deposit and paying for the honeymoon, and all that.  Despite all that, most young men meet their obligations in the first and second years.  It is when the children come along that the difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>In the seventh year, under the old system, he paid £70; under the new system, he will have paid £84&mdash;an increase of £14.  It is unfair.  The sliding scale is not of sufficient value to warrant the loss of £5 in the final year and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider extending the table by a further five or ten years, five at least.  If that is done, the impact will be less severe in the fourth and fifth years. Mathematicians in the Department may find that they might make another £2 out of that, but it would be worth it if the period were extended to 15 years. I make that point and I will come back to it on the Committee Stage, and possibly I may submit an amendment for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like now to go back to the question of the implementation of these Acts.  A colleague of mine here will, I believe, refer to the difficulty of getting the Department officials to implement the ideas set out in legislation. Between the officials of the local authorities and the officials of the Department of Local Government, there grows up a conspiracy to defeat what is in the Minister's mind, and more important, to defeat what local councillors would like to do for the betterment of the people in their areas. I might say that it is a great pity that documents of this nature are not submitted to capable councillors for their views before coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe, implicitly, that the Minister is serious and his senior officials are serious, about getting something done now, but <Col N="1064" /> I think the councillors should be acquainted with such proposed legislation and have the opportunity of giving their views on it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say what I am about to say in any sense of impertinence, but my council has looked for an interview with the Minister, and with his predecessor, on matters which were relevant to this Bill, and we did not get the courtesy of a reply from his Department.  However, the Minister may feel, or it may be the advice of his officers, that he will get on better without us, but I say that he cannot get on without the assistance of councillors. I know that Ministers are in touch with councillors in their own sphere, but I think they have to keep in touch with other people's views as well.</P>
    <P>I should like now to look at that section in the Bill which permits the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts moneys to be applied for the purchase of houses which were previously occupied. This is a move in the right direction also, but immediately I see difficulty in the purchase of those houses and these difficulties arise from the method of valuing.  The Minister's predecessor introduced a Bill which gave this country a yardstick for valuing.  I heard it said at the time that we were the only country in the &mdash;with apologies, although it may be appropriate&mdash;English-speaking world that had a yardstick for valuing and that other countries were still muddling along in the matter.  The system is that when a house is completed, the valuer assesses the reasonable cost of building, the reasonable cost of acquiring the site, the reasonable cost of profit to the builder and then he assesses, in his opinion, the value of the house.  That was the rule which was made generally by the Department, but every one of us who is a member of a local authority knows that there is no valuer in this country, outside the realm of quantity surveyors, who could do that.  It would have to be either a quantity surveyor or a man who is capable of going into the whole costings of the article to be valued.  Yet with a wave of the pen, this Bill says that a previously occupied house is to be valued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> With respect, I say that the valuer who will try to carry out that part of the Bill will apply the age-worn system of valuing.  He will recommend to the local authorities that they advance X pounds for that house and in his mind he must take into consideration how much the house will secure on the open market, should the person who is getting the loan default in the future. All local authority valuers are doing that, despite the fact that the Minister and his Department say: &ldquo;You shall value by another system.&rdquo;  They disregard that completely.</P>
    <P>To give effect to that recently in my council, we had to use a section of the Managerial Act and force the manager to carry out the wishes of the council. No council likes to do that.  Where humanly possible, one likes to cooperate with the manager, and generally speaking, there is that co-operation all over the country.  If a valuer assesses the worth of a house at X pounds and the council disagrees and says that that is unfair, then the manager is risking his position if he does not take the advice of the valuer, because it is a financial matter and he cannot take risks in that connection. I, therefore, ask the Minister seriously to consider that aspect, the method of valuing an old house.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to mention is the method of rendering to the Minister's Department the specification for repairs to a house.  In this connection, I mean specifications from somebody who is going to carry out a certain job to an old house.  All of us here have experience of houses and most of us live in old houses.  If you want to repair a joist in the floor of your kitchen, you begin to think in terms of taking out that joist and putting in another.  When you think a little deeper, you realise that you have to take up the whole floor, because the joist runs one way and the flooring another.  If there is a defect in a ceiling rafter, the complete ceiling must come down.  Of course, if the ceiling is made from the new panelling, it does not have to come down, but in the old-fashioned houses, the whole ceiling must come down.  It is, therefore, more than difficult to give an estimate to the <Col N="1066" /> Minister, or to his Department, for repairs to an old house before you put the pick-axe into the wall.</P>
    <P>All of us have experienced that.  Yet the Minister and his advisers say, in one fell swoop, you will get X pounds for doing a certain job.  That may not be crystal clear to everybody but the fact is that once you interfere with an old house, you do not know what you are getting into.  This matter may cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, but of course the Minister is in the happy position of being able to stop it when he likes, and that is a saving grace.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility of purchasing a Small Dwellings Act house and then getting a grant on the same house later.  According to the Minister, that can be done by people in the lower income groups.  I do not think it can be done in the Dublin County Council.  We may be different from other councils, but I do not think it can be done.  We do not give a loan to any applicant under the Small Dwellings Act unless he has a maximum amount of money after his outgoings of repayments to the Small Dwellings Act people.  I believe that maximum is £7 10s. or £8.  I am not quite certain at the moment.  That maximum carries on for the remainder of the 35 years. If that man has six or seven in family and would like to build an additional room, he cannot get a further loan from our council because he must have a certain amount of money after the outgoings are paid.  For instances, the poorer class of man in Dublin county must have not more than £10 5s. per week to get a Small Dwellings Act loan.  There are many of us in this House who would hardly regard the fellow with a regular £10 5s. per week as a poor man.  That is the type of man who can get a Small Dwellings Acts loan in Dublin.  I presume that it works the same in other councils.</P>
    <P>The man who gets £9 5s. per week steadily&mdash;it is a fairly good wage&mdash;will not get a Small Dwellings Act loan from Dublin County Council or other councils presumably throughout the country.  It is worked this way.  It is not so much what he has coming in, but what he will have after he has paid out.  If he earns £10 per week and his <Col N="1067" /> outgoings under the Small Dwellings Act loan are £2 15s., his outgoings from the Small Dwellings Act loan are not considered with a two-third remission on the valuation or in the Table now submitted.  It is with everything full on that he is supposed to have £7 10s. &ldquo;take home&rdquo; money as we often describe it in the building industry after everything is gone.  A man who has £7 5s.&mdash;this is true in regard to Dublin County Council&mdash;will not get a Small Dwellings Act loan. Therefore, he goes into the queue for a local authority house.  He then goes on the rates, so to speak.  All that is thrown out because of the fear of the man defaulting in his repayments in the future and that the house might be given back to the local authority and they would not get their pound of flesh on the open market for the house.</P>
    <P>I raise these points in the hope that they make some impact on the Minister in his endeavour to serve the people who are purchasing these houses.  It has been said that a 20 years' remission of rates under the present system did not apply elsewhere. I should like to inform the Minister that he was ill-advised.  It did apply, I think, on the Malahide Road.  I do not know the system of remission.  I think it was on the present system.  It is a fact, however, that a 20 years' remission of rates was given on the Malahide Road.</P>
    <P>This is a step in the right direction, and, if implemented, will be of great benefit.  I have grave doubts about its implementation because any man who is acting as he ought to act on a local authority knows quite well that in regard to these little nominee sites, little groups of houses in the country, nothing less than carrying arms to the Department of Local Government will get them out of it.  You have got to dot your i's and cross your t's and do this, that and the other, until it is obvious that every single person in the council knows there is somebody at the top of affairs codding somebody else, but they never cod the county council.</P>
    <P>We could scream at the Minister, as has been done to his predecessor, that he has not got the money, but none of <Col N="1068" /> us want to do that.  We have all had that sad experience.  We all want to be helpful; I want to be helpful.  It would appear from the continual returning of plans for alteration that the Minister has not got the money. It would appear from the Bill that he has the money.  As I said earlier, there is a depth of sincerity in this Bill, but it might be advisable if the Minister would advise those beneath him in the Department that that is what the councillors are thinking&mdash;that the Minister has not got the money.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might correct my impression by dishing out the money as speedily as he can to the Dublin County Council.  That will satisfy us.  The Housing Act (No. 12) of 1925, Part 2, sets out the proportion of rates which may be remitted.  It tells us that you can remit for 20 years. I understand the Minister was informed that it was not a fact that the system of 20 years had been applied. It was applied on the Malahide Road and in the Act of 1925, provision is made for its application.  I should like, when we get round to the Committee Stage, to submit an amendment on that point.  If that is done, I cannot see how it will interfere in any way with the income of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin County Council, we like progress and I am sure every other county council likes the same.  As far as 20 or ten years are concerned, it does not matter a whole lot.  In the tenth year, he will be paying half the amount and gradually he will be moving towards the final day when he pays the lot.  I would ask the Minister to consider a period of 20 years.  On that note, I will sit down, thanking the Minister for listening.  I really congratulate the Minister with deep sincerity for introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  If it should turn out as I think it should, it will be a tremendous improvement on our housing legislation up to the moment.  There are provisions in the Bill which will help a number of people who were actually ruled out of any benefit and who were prevented from getting the housing they required.  I <Col N="1069" /> am sure that if it can be implemented in full, it will be regarded as a boon by such people.</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make on it is in connection with the rates remission referred to by Senator Carton.  I am not going to go into the detail he has gone into about the various years, but I do think that the graduated scale is going to be of immense advantage to a number of people.  I have personal experience of it over a number of years and I know that when under the old system people paid a third of their rates during the first seven years, they found it very inconvenient to find the whole amount in the eight year.</P>
      <P>I do not agree altogether with Senator Carton that in the first two years, they had plenty of money; in my experience, they were generally tied up with paying for other things, but by the seventh year, there were three or four children to be provided for in the average house.  There were school fees to be paid and other things. Some people had come to regard their rates as in or about what they were paying and they got a tremendous surprise when they got a bill for three times what they were used to paying in the eighth year.</P>
      <P>From my experience, I certainly agree that by a graduated scale, by paying a little more each year, they will get used to it.  They will know that they must pay full rates.  It will not come as such a surprise as I have found it with some people and they will be better able to cope with it.  The scheme as it is at the moment will involve much the same cost for local authorities.  They may be out five pounds, but it will not cost the ratepayers at any rate any more so far as I can see.  I certainly think this proposal a great improvement on the old system of a third for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I want to refer to is the extension of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts to the older houses.  I think that is a good step. In pre-first war days, the Act was very popular in Dublin for the purchase of houses.  There did not seem to be much trouble in those days about valuing houses.  Whether, with all the regulations we have been making, it <Col N="1070" /> has become harder or not, I do not know, but in those days there was a certain market value that anybody who was connected with the market at that time could agree on to within a ten pound note.  With all the regulations we have been making about taking this, that or the other into account, there seems to be a great difference of opinion on the value of houses in recent years.</P>
    <P>I hope, as Senator Carton pointed out, that the Minister will try to do something about that, with regard to old houses at any rate, and get some sort of standard value.  The value it would fetch in the open market should be the standard leaving out all the fringes.  I think it will be of tremendous advantage to a number of people, if this can be operated.  It will enable them to take even a house in bad repair and by the repairs grant, put it into proper order for themselves. There are a large number of people, in the City of Dublin at any rate, who, even if they could get a new house at the moment with the grants and the Small Dwellings Act loan&mdash; some of them do not get that on other conditions&mdash;would not be prepared to go out the distance they must go for a new house. They want to be nearer their work, owing to their hours.  They have also found the buses too costly and inconvenient with too long a pause in between at these new places.  They want to be in the old city.  They cannot get a loan for that.</P>
    <P>For years&mdash;I do not know what the position may actually be now&mdash;they could not even get a loan through a building society and this clause in the Bill should go a long way to meet their wants.  It may have the incidental effect that a number of people will be prepared because of changed circumstances regarding older houses, to go out and get new houses and help building in that way.  I can see that happening in a number of cases in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>For my part I have always been a believer in the owner-occupier system for a man and his house.  I believe that it promotes the best of citizenship. I have always been in favour of the tenant purchase schemes under the <Col N="1071" /> local authorities and I think that we did not do nearly enough of them.  If one just looks at some of the original tenant purchase schemes in Dublin, around Marino, Donnelly's Orchard and parts of Drumcondra which I know personally, nobody could say that they were not a huge success.  They have provided suburbs one can be proud of and the people are in every way the best of citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Carton will agree with every word I say.  Some of those people came from very bad surroundings, but because they have an interest in their own homes the children were not allowed to destroy the property as they were on other schemes.  Their fathers took care of that because they would have to pay for the destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been in favour of those schemes even theoretically and from what I see I am more in favour than ever.  This clause in the Bill will help to provide more owner-occupiers and I think that is good for us in the country and good for our citizenship.  I am speaking mainly of Dublin, because I know it, and I can say that it would be an asset in every way to us in the city.</P>
      <P>The next point is the increase in the repair grant and the removal of the clauses.  Their removal is going to be a tremendous advantage.  I have met several cases already of people who wanted to repair their houses if they could get the grant, but who were ruled out by those clauses.  I can see some of them now when this Bill goes through getting busy and helping to give work.  The Bill will also, as the Minister pointed out, help landlords, who due to the rents they were bound down to legally, were not able to keep their premises in order.  It will help them to save their property and give their tenants a fairer deal than they have been able to do up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell me if I am right in saying that they will <Col N="1072" /> be entitled to the two-thirds remission on the increase for seven years under other legislation, as regards the rate increase that will follow these repairs. I think that is so.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the interest rates.  One of the big questions slowing up building in Dublin is the amount that people have to pay in interest.  The rates are so high that the payment works out at such a figure that there are a number who some years ago, if they were at the same stage, would have gone in for a house, but will not to-day because they cannot see themselves taking on the payments which they will be making for the rest of their lives, since they are over a 35-year period.  I was wondering whether the Minister would not give serious consideration to trying to find some fair flat rate of interest that could be charged on those houses, irrespective of the bank rate going up or down, that would enable people to know what they would have to pay for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by congratulating the Minister again.  I hope that when it is put into operation, the Bill will achieve all the objects and ideas he has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>In that the Bill aims at the final clearance of slum dwellings and the earlier re-housing of the slum dwellers themselves in blocks of modern flats, and encourages others, not covered by local authority programmes, to provide for their own housing accommodation, this Bill is a very valuable extension of the existing housing legislation.  The extension of grants to previously occupied houses for conversion as single private dwellings or for letting as two or more flat dwellings, particularly in city areas, will make a good contribution to solving the difficulties of other classes of city dwellers.  It is hoped, however, that those applying for such grants would be issued in advance with minimum constructional arrangements or whatever you call them, plans for construction, so as to ensure that the reconstructed dwellings, whether for private usage or for letting as single units or groups of flats, will conform to certain agreed standards.  What I <Col N="1073" /> have in mind is the fact that it would be so easy to rebuild the old houses into overcrowded, unhealthy tenements and find ourselves starting off afresh on a slum problem.</P>
      <P>Apart from the contribution to housing the city people, the reconstruction of these large old houses will brighten up our cities and towns, making them look prosperous and progressive.  I cannot think of anything so depressing to visitors as the sight of good old houses, either unoccupied or falling into decay.</P>
      <P>The grants for the installation of sewerage and water to dwellings is of very great value indeed from a health point of view and in lessening the drudgery which has been the lot of rural housewives in far too large an area for far too long a time.  It is quite impossible, as we all know, to maintain a healthy community and raise a healthy family where there is no sewerage and no piped water for human consumption.</P>
      <P>In regard to the remission of rates, while the proposals in the Bill go a good way to lessen the anxiety of those who will avail of the new opportunities in the Bill in the matter of reconstructing their property, I think the Minister could afford to be somewhat more generous, because as I understand it, the remissions will apply only to the increased valuation, and the taxpayer will continue to pay his ordinary rates on the original valuation, so that the cost involved would not be so very great.</P>
      <P>I should like to follow up what one of the Deputies said in the Dáil when he pressed for the regulation and reduction of legal charges in respect of small dwellings.  Legal fees of £50 to £80 are a hardship on ordinary working people, and they do not appear to bear any relationship to the amount of work involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to grants in general for house building, I would like to ask the Minister a question.  I do not know whether this really applies here or not. The question is: just what a Local Government housing inspector certifies when he passes a house as fit to receive a council or corporation grant.  We all saw in the Press recently where in <Col N="1074" /> County Dublin a housing scheme in a very lovely area had houses that were most attractive, but after they had been occupied for a very short time, serious defects manifested themselves. This resulted in a law suit in which judgment was given in favour of the tenants, who eventually received from the builder sums of money which were in no way related to the cost which would be involved in putting those houses into condition.  I think that most people when they are buying houses feel that the Local Government inspector is their watchdog, but apparently that is not so.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the value of this inspection by the Local Government inspector.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by expressing the hope that much good will come from this new measure and thanking the Minister for introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this Housing Bill and wish to say that, in my opinion, it is a very progressive step in the right direction and will, I hope, go a long way towards solving the housing needs of the people of both rural and urban Ireland during the next five or ten years.  I have listened to the various speakers mainly talking about conditions in the City of Dublin. I should like, coming from a rural constituency, to say that under the provisions of this Bill there are many advantages for people living in the rural areas, and that the amount of grant available for the average sized five-roomed house is very considerably improved.  In some cases, it will be nearly £150 more than under the old system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of public bodies for a number of years, I made a study of the conditions of people living in rural areas and urban areas and will briefly tell what I have seen.  In rural Ireland, excellent work was done by public bodies in providing houses for the working classes.  The provision of houses for people up to £5 valuation in my county is nearly finished.  There is an important change in this Bill, in that the sliding scale for supplementary grants has been removed.  In future, <Col N="1075" /> the person building a house up to £50 valuation can get 100 per cent. of the supplementary grant.  Is that not correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of person I always have in mind as being most in need, and whom I have mentioned on many occasions, is the man on a small valuation, up to £20, in rural Ireland, the man with the thatched house, which is sadly disappearing from our countryside.  We know there are generous grants proposed in this Bill. That man, in my opinion, is the only person not catered for.  The man up to £5 is provided for out of the rates by public bodies, and the man on the higher valuation is able to borrow and provide the house for himself and his family from his own resources; but these other people on small valuations are not able to borrow the amount of money required.  That may not be the position in every county, but there are many cases where those with the valuations I speak of cannot provide houses for themselves.  The Minister should reconsider the position of those people.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill for urban dwellers.  In every town, there are many houses which were built a couple of hundred years ago.  They have an elaborate front, whether it is a shop or otherwise, in good repair; but the back is tumbling down.  I hope these people will be able to take advantage of the reconstruction grants to repair those houses.  Those people cannot provide reconstruction costs out of their own resources, and the urban councils cannot help them, as very often 1d. in the £ on the rates would produce only £40 or £50.  With their many commitments they cannot provide supplementary housing grants.  I have a letter here from a man living in a small town, who says they do not think they can provide this money. The Minister should consider that position.  The urban dwellers will benefit considerably under the Bill, but it would spoil it all if the urban councils are not able to lend the money to the individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his splendid attempt to finish up the housing <Col N="1076" /> problem of our people.  Deputy Blaney is a young man and I am sure he will leave nothing undone to complete the work started 30 years ago and which we all hope will be finished in our own time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome the Minister on his appearance in this House.  I also welcome the Bill and I appreciate the Minister's honesty in bringing it in. However, I warn him that there is no use in having this legislation passed and having Ministers saying all over the country that there is plenty of money available, when we have a different experience in County Dublin. In saying this, I do not refer to the present Minister; it applies to previous Ministers also.  If they would say decently they have not the money, we would know we could not go ahead with our plans.</P>
      <P>I will give an illustration of the position in County Dublin.  First of all, there is no other county which has faced up to the housing problem as well as we have in County Dublin.  Both the councillors and the management in County Dublin have been determined, once and for all, to end our housing problem.  We had the applications; we had the tenants prepared to pay rent. A couple of years ago we had 200 houses in course of construction.  At the last meeting of the Housing Committee, although we had the same number of engineers and officials going out on inspection, there were four solitary houses under construction.  I am sure I am correct in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>During the time when the late Deputy Davin, God rest him, was Parliamentary Secretary, he wrote a letter, which I have in my possession, saying the Department had approved of 84 houses for erection in Lucan. That would be between three and four years ago.  The Department has held us up since then.  They want the plans done this way and that way.  Finally, they agreed to 42 houses&mdash;just half the number we required in Lucan.  Even then, there has been wrangling on that for the past two years and they will not allow the 42 to be built.  I would <Col N="1077" /> ask the Minister to take up this matter and see why the county council is not allowed to proceed with the erection of even 42 houses.</P>
      <P>We are talking about bringing tourists to the country.  As a representative of No. 2 area of County Dublin, I should be awfully disappointed if tourists visiting the lovely place that Lucan is should see the hovels, the pigsties. There are places in the West of Ireland where pigs are housed under better conditions.  I would be glad if Senator Lenihan, who goes home that way, would turn to the right at the court house and see the conditions.</P>
      <P>We have heard the Minister saying that money is not the obstacle.  The previous Minister said the same. Nevertheless, county council housing schemes are held up.  The Department have finally agreed to the contract for development.  It has been held up for the past three or four months because a small part of a boundary wall would have to be altered.  If these were the last words that I should utter, I say that the Department has deliberately held up the housing scheme in Lucan and other schemes in County Dublin for want of money.  At the last meeting of the Housing Committee of Dublin County Council, a remark was passed which I consider very apt. Members of the council were very sore about the position.  We asked the Minister to receive a deputation and were refused.  A member suggested that if they had sanctioned all the schemes and the housing question was finished, the officials would have nothing to do.  I hope the Minister will go into that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with Small Dwellings Act loans for private houses, I would very specially appeal to the Minister that in such cases there should be no stamp duty.  At present, a person who buys a private house has to pay stamp duty and the loan charges are exorbitant. There are certain people who like to live in the city.  When they purchase a house, they are involved in costs of every kind.  There should be no stamp duty on these houses, particularly where they are under a certain valuation.  The legal expenses are far too high.  I am not prejudiced <Col N="1078" /> against the legal profession, but I do say that they have no conscience when it comes to the question of charges.  I am speaking from sad experience and from the experience of friends of mine who bought houses and who paid £65 for the transfer of a lease.  The vendor had the lease; the purchaser had the money and it was only a matter of going to the Castle and getting the stamp, which would take only half an hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>They knew how to stamp it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.  I congratulate the Minister on applying the Small Dwellings Acquistion Acts to these people, but I would appeal to him to provide that there shall be no stamp duty on houses up to a certain valuation and that there be some control over the legal costs.</P>
      <P>In regard to poliomyelitis, I congratulate the Minister for Health on introducing a scale of charges for vaccination.  The Minister for Local Government should lay down a scale of legal charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not advocate building thousands of houses in the City of Dublin where there is not a purchase scheme attached to them.  I do advocate such schemes in County Dublin or other counties because the gentleman who is now President of this country introduced a purchase scheme for cottage tenants in rural Ireland.  There was never a purchase scheme in respect of such houses in the City of Dublin.  The whole system is wrong.  A nation cannot be built around thousands of local authority houses in Dublin.  If the tenants were given some interest in the homes, they would look after them and it would not be necessary to expend thousands of pounds in repairing them or we would not have to send a painter to paint a painter's house, the same painter being an employee of Dublin Corporation.  The ordinary ratepayers have to pay for that and they have to be considered.  The people should be given some title to their homes.  In Marino, Drumcondra and the first part of Cabra, the houses are a credit to the people in them and the type of citizens coming out of those houses are <Col N="1079" /> a credit to the nation.  While the provision in the Bill is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough.  There should be a purchase scheme for corporation houses, particularly where the tenants are in a position to purchase.</P>
    <P>With regard to grants or Small Dwellings Act loans for the purchase of private houses or houses that have been occupied, would the Minister explain if there is any limit to price or to valuation?  For instance, will a house the valuation of which is £26 in the City of Dublin be eligible for a loan under the Act?  I should be grateful if the Minister would give some indication on that point.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of loans under the Small Dwellings Act&mdash;now I clash with Senator Carton&mdash;while the county council have restricted loans to persons of a certain income, they are really doing them a good turn.  Take the case of a person with £9 or £9 10s a week. If he is given a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, he finds the repayments on the loan, at the cruel rate of interest charged, and rates amount to £3 a week.  It is doing such people a good turn at the start to refuse them.</P>
    <P>On the question of ground rents, no greater crime was ever committed in the eyes of those of us who fought against British landlords than the new form of more cruel and more tyrannical landlords that has been set up.  In the case of land around the City of Dublin, development of which did not cost the owners 1/-, where water and sewerage were brought there, where the ordinary grazing value of an acre before the water and sewerage were brought there was about £15 per annum, we find eight to ten houses built on the acre, the occupiers of which are being charged £16 10s. ground rent.  That is a shame.  It is the worst form of tyranny and landlordism.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council have decided that they will not give a loan in respect of any house where the ground rent is more than £10, and even £10 is exorbitant.  That £10 applies where the developer had to develop the <Col N="1080" /> ground and bring in water and sewerage. Some scoundrels took advantage of development in their areas to charge extraordinary ground rents and they should not get away with it.  If a person can be legally charged for doing an injustice in one direction, I do not see why that should not be the case in another direction.</P>
    <P>Then again there is the case of a private builder.  He builds his own house and goes to live in it, and if he defaults in the ground rent, the ground landlord can step in because the man who has built the house never owns the land.  Successive Governments in this country have hopelessly failed, and I say that without reserve, to attack the question of ground rents.  As Senator Crowley stated, the question of private ownership is a very important one and it is one which is encouraged by the Pope who, in his Christmas Message, stated that the heads of families should have a stake in the country.  In view of the ground landlords we have in this country, none of the middle-class people, and none of the working-class people can ever have a real stake in the country because they do not own the land on which their houses are built. They have not got an opportunity of buying it, even at so many years purchase. It is a shame that such a system should be allowed.</P>
    <P>On the question of remission of rates, I agree with Senator Carton and my idea is that it is being done in the wrong way.  It is being done in a way which is the reverse of the way I think it should be done.  I may be wrong, but I would have the full rates paid at the start and I would give the remission the other way around, for the first 15 or 16 years of occupation.  I think that should be done because when a couple get married, they are reasonably well off and after seven years, if they are blessed with a family, the first child is then ready to make his First Holy Communion. It is then that the full rate is clapped on them.  If God blesses them with a reasonable family, and our middle-class people are blessed in that way, by the time 15 years have passed, they are not able to meet their liabilities. By the time the house has <Col N="1081" /> been occupied for 15 years, there would be a chance that some of the family would be in a position to help the parents.  It is in those desperate years, between seven years and 15 years occupation, that persons with families are hardest hit and it is during those years that we should do all in our power to assist them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred, in a paper which he read, to building societies. With all respect, the small dwellings loans are bad enough, but God protect the people from building societies because they have no scruples at all about the interest they charge.  I see some Senators laughing but any statements which I make I can prove to the hilt.  I would be disappointed if any Senator recommended any person to go to a society or individual charging 7 or 8 per cent. on the money they lend.  I think that is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving a grant to people who will reconstruct large houses into separate dwellings.  That is a very good thing, but I think that in that direction, if the Minister is giving that grant, he should do something about stopping the rotten system which prevails in Dublin where if you have even one child, you are not allowed into a house.  The Minister should bear in mind that if he gives grants towards the remodelling of houses that rotten system of preventing people from getting accommodation, because they have children, exists.  I know of a case where a couple were taken into a house and about 16 months later, when it was found that a baby was about to be born, they were put out.  They could not be put out legally, but they were persecuted in such a manner that they had to leave.  I feel that people who do that sort of thing should not get away with it.  After all, if the State and the taxpayer are giving grants towards reconstruction to make a house fit for a family, there should be some clause to prevent that system operating.</P>
    <P>In connection with loans and grants, I say again, with all due respect, that the Department are a washout, so far as these are concerned.  I know of a case in County Dublin where a man bought a house and spent a lot of his <Col N="1082" /> own money reconstructing it.  He went to the Department last February or March and he received permission to go ahead only last week.  There should not be delays of that sort.  People who show such industry are worthy of consideration and should get some help and co-operation.  They do not understand the law so well and they should get reasonable help and co-operation from the officials of the Department. After all, that is what they are paid for.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the question of building flats in Dublin City.  By all means, we should go ahead with that and not take people from the heart of the city and put them out in the country where their bus fares alone constitute a rent in themselves.  It would be far better and those people would be far happier, if they got a chance to live in reasonable conditions in the city.  That is what they are used to and I would say that they were completely out of their depth outside the city area.  I am sorry to say that many of them are in dire poverty.  It is not about unemployed people that I am talking but the man who is earning but who has to pay bus fares and if the children are working has to pay the differential rent.</P>
    <P>As far as Dublin Corporation are concerned, with their town planning, I think they have gone completely mad. You have only to go to Ballyfermot or Finglas to see the acres of the most fertile land being wasted.  There are open spaces here and open spaces there.  I believe in playgrounds, but it would be interesting if the Minister found out from the corporation the cost of the playground at Nephin Road.  It is not finished yet and it is just a great mass of weeds, but I would like to know what it cost the ratepayers.  It seems foolish to erect such a park beside the Phoenix Park.  The same thing applies in Blanchardstown where the town planners would not allow us to build on a site.  They want open spaces in the open country, which is stupid and should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>In regard to grants for repairs in County Dublin, we have spent an exorbitant sum of money for repairs to cottages because during the war years, they got into a state of disrepair. I should like to know if those <Col N="1083" /> grants for repairs will apply to houses owned by the county council.  We have had cases where we had to spend four times what it cost to put up the house originally, to put the house into repair. I wonder will the Minister make any allowance where a local authority spends £70,000 or £80,000 for repairs on cottages to put them into repair. As soon as they are put into order, the people take them over and the county council is finished with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should commend itself to the Seanad.  It is an extension of the very admirable principle enshrined in previous housing legislation and in the Small Dwellings Act&mdash;the principle of helping those people who want to help themselves.  I think it is an admirable principle and this Bill extends the provisions whereby the State and the local authorities are enabled to help people to build and reconstruct their own houses.  There is no need to go into the details.  Briefly, increased grants are made available towards building, reconstructing and improving houses and increased grants towards the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  These grants are admirably set out in the memorandum attached to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Hogan's point is an interesting one&mdash;the difficulty of catering for farmers in the low valuation category.  That is partially met. It is the intention of the Bill to meet that by Sections 8 and 13.  I think these two sections are admirable ones.  Section 8 is an enabling section which permits the local authority to provide grants for reconstruction on the same basis as grants given by the Department.  That is a very welcome extension of the reconstruction grant provisions under the old Acts.  Under the old Acts, most local authorities had a rather complicated grading system whereby they supplemented the grants made by the Department towards the local authority.  That, taken in conjunction with Section 13, which provides for the extension of the Small Dwellings Acts loans for reconstruction, should meet the point made by Senator Hogan&mdash;the difficulty of making provision for farmers in the low valuation category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> There are increased grants for reconstruction and the loan reconstruction scheme should enable these people to improve their holdings and add whatever room or make whatever improvements are necessary to put their houses in a proper habitable condition. In that connection, there is one suggestion I should like to make to the Minister.  It is in connection with the section under which he makes provision for equivalent grants to be made by the local authority where grants are made by the State under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 1929, Section 7.  There are many cases where the Land Commission, under the Land Acts, make provision for a grant by way of reconstruction.  I think that a similar provision as that provided in Section 7 should be introduced, whereby the local authority would be enabled to make a grant equivalent to that given by the Land Commission to a person for the reconstruction of a house.  At the moment, the Land Commission can make a grant to the local authority, but there is no provision whereby the State or the local authority can make any additional or supplementary grant.  If the local authority could have similar provisions whereby they could make a supplementary grant, it would further help people and enable them, by way of grant or loan, to reconstruct their houses.</P>
    <P>I think most people from rural Ireland will welcome the provision that the grants be made available by local authorities by way of subsidy from the Central Fund.  That is an admirable provision.  Although not in the Bill&mdash; it merely empowers local authorities to do what they are entitled to do by law &mdash;it is set out in the explanatory memorandum that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Statutory authority exists under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts but is not operated at present, empowering housing authorities to make loans for the purchase of previously occupied houses.  It is proposed to enable housing authorities to exercise these powers in relation to the lower-income groups...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us a definition of &ldquo;lower-income group&rdquo; in that case.  I assume it applies to <Col N="1085" /> people who can already get a Small Dwellings Act loan for the building of a new house, people in receipt of under £830.  That is also another very valuable extension of the small dwellings code.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that this Bill is a progressive one and the Government are to be commended for bringing it in.  There was a suggestion in the recent Capital Investment Advisory Committee's report, the latest, that the Small Dwellings Act should be curtailed or restricted in some measure.  That would be a very undesirable procedure.  The Small Dwellings Act is an admirable Act and it would be a mistake to curtail or restrict any advances made under that legislation.  There is a suggestion in their second report that that should be done.  I am glad to see from this housing legislation that the Government do not propose to follow the Investment Committee in that recommendation. The Seanad should have no difficulty in passing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this Bill is a natural development, taking into consideration <Col N="1086" /> the progress of housing in this country over the past 15 years. We had a situation during the war years when the Government of the day could not build any houses.  After the war, a great need had to be filled.  It does not matter which Government filled it because either Government would probably have filled it in rather the same sort of way.  The speeding up in housing since the end of the war until last year was a natural thing.  The need was there.  People were in a very bad way and needed new houses.  They needed reconstructed houses.  The great and constant acceleration that went on was a natural development.</P>
      <P>We have been criticised by the O.E.E.C. Report and by many economic advisers overseas who told us that we were spending too much of our available capital on the construction of houses.  I would disagree with them as I think would most members of the House.  While we can be advised by these people, they sometimes take too material a view.  It is true to say that it is a terrible thing to see a man with a good house not able to pay for it because he has not a job.  Perhaps we should have concentrated more on the provision of work and jobs, but I differ from the experts in saying that each Government did their best and no well-thought out scheme for industrial advancement was delayed for want of money.  However, it was inevitable that the stage would be reached when this unnaturally high volume of private and public building could not be sustained and early last year that stage was reached.</P>
      <P>I am not going to play politics on this, but we had members of the other House saying, as members of this House said, that the money was not there, that the money was in the Local Loans Fund, that the Government had no money to build more houses.  Of course, that is quite true because as quickly as you gentlemen get it, you dole it out.  As soon as the Department of Local Government gets their money, as soon as the ordinary revenue comes to the Minister for Finance and he passes it to the Minister for Local Government, the Department of Local Government doles it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> When I was a foolish young Deputy &mdash;you might say that I am still a foolish young Senator&mdash;I addressed myself to the question of the delay between the submission of plans for houses to the Department and the sanctioning of those plans.  The delay was three days over a period of 20 years.  That would amaze Senator Tunney.  That was, of course, not the case when the plans were found wanting, when a wall was wanting, as Senator Tunney mentioned.  In that case, back they go.  At this time, however, there is a change in the general flavour.  The way of looking at this is such that epithets and allegations will not be hurled at the Minister.  Allegations will not be made that he has not the money.  No one will tell him now as someone did before that he has not 64,000,000 brass farthings when the sum of £64,000,000 was referred to regarding housing needs.  The money is coming to him as it always did, as it came last year when the scare was on to his predecessor to enable him to issue it to build houses, purchase lands or build roads.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this Bill, there is a colossal reduction in the Estimate for housing.  One must remember that in the Book of Estimates this year, there is a reduction compared with last year of £700,000.  I do not know what effect that will have on the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one point I want to discuss&mdash;other speakers discussed everything else I was going to raise.  The point is what is referred to in our local authority as tenant purchase schemes.  The position in our local authority&mdash;and probably in every other local authority&mdash;is that while ordinary corporation or council housing needs are not satisfied, a tenant purchase scheme will not be sanctioned. A Small Dwellings Acquisition Act scheme will be sanctioned but here at least a few hundred pounds have to be put up by the purchaser.  A tenant purchaser scheme, however, by a county council or a corporation, where the purchaser need not put up the money and for which the council or corporation must assume responsibility, will not be provided for the white-collar workers or for any person who needs his own house.  The money will not be put up until the ordinary needs have been satisfied.  As was mentioned by Senator Carton and other Senators, the man to-day with £10 a week, a clerk, a man in business or in any other job defined as a white-collar worker is not a very well-off man.  He wants to own his own house.  He probably is not eligible&mdash;or his housing circumstances are such that he would not get one anyway&mdash;to be re-housed by the local authority, but because he cannot say he has the £100 which he needs under the Small Dwellings Act, he cannot get his own home by tenant purchase until all the needs of the working classes have been satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That rigid rule should be dispensed with.  The Minister having dispensed <Col N="1089" /> with it, should judge every local authority as he finds them.  For instance, if he sees that in Drogheda 300 or 400 people still need to be re-housed and sees that it is impossible for the local authority to satisfy their needs with that proviso, then they should be allowed to build under the tenant purchase scheme.  Senator Laurence Walsh, a fellow member of the corporation, will agree on that point and will also ask the Minister to consider dispensing with that rigid rule which binds him at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which Senator Tunney mentioned regarding the number of officers.  I know that there is redundancy perhaps in certain departments of local authorities because of the wildly accelerated building rate&mdash;more than one in five families over ten years got new or reconstructed houses.  That is a problem we must face and there are difficulties.  A man who came in and became permanent, a man who did his best and worked hard to build these houses is entitled to his permanency.  The Minister and the local authorities have difficulties there.  The only way to meet them is in the ordinary business way of meeting every situation as it arises by trying to find these men jobs in other places where their permanency will not be affected.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Leader of the House, Senator Ó Maoláin, felt I was being political about money.</P>

      <P>I was not.  I was being clear about the fact that, as moneys become available, they are dished out. As moneys become available to the Minister, he doles them out to local authorities.  It would be his wish to hand out three times as much if he could.  That would be the wish of every Minister.  I do not want to see anybody in this House or in the other House with local authority connections saying that he has no money, because even if the Minister has no money to-day, the next day he may walk in with a fine allocation from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I should like to mention to the Minister, though possibly they are more appropriate to the Committee Stage.  I should like to hear the Minister speak on them, if possible.  First, I should like to say that the emphasis to-night has been in favour of the Bill and most of the Seanad are very much in favour of it and have approved of the Government decision that it is necessary; but there has been very little spoken on the opposite side.  That is the position which Senator Donegan mentioned at one point, but did not dwell on very much&mdash;that the international financial experts and our own have been advocating over a number of years past that we have spent too much money on housing compared with what we are producing.  That has been the opinion of our own Central Bank in their review over a number of years. It has also been the opinion of a great many local authorities or members of local authorities&mdash;that they have been seeing themselves face loans mounting year after year.  I know that it may be very welcome in some cases to have this Bill and see, as some Senator has said, that under Sections 8 and 13, local authorities may have permission to give advances and grants; but I know of local authorities who were doing that and had to stop it because they found the amount coming on the rates to pay the interest on those loans was getting beyond their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are to a certain extent warnings which the Minister may not feel it wise to accept as yet in the history of housing, but housing has been since <Col N="1092" /> the war the greatest expense that local authorities have.  I wonder what the indebtedness of the whole Twenty Six Counties would be at present on housing alone.  It must be an enormous debt, and it will be a long time before it is repaid, or, in other words, before there is any relief to the rates.</P>
    <P>The other matter I wanted to mention was in connection with Section 12 dealing with grants for the installation of private water supply and sewerage. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to examine the other Acts, but what is the position with regard to a similar grant by the Department of Agriculture?  If a farmer applies for a grant to sink a well, I believe he applies to the Department of Agriculture. I was interested in the position in my own county and indeed in any other.  Possibly in the future when the tuberculosis eradication scheme becomes more advanced, it will be necessary to have a bored well for all water supplies for dairies and so on. The Department of Agriculture will give a grant towards that.  Can the farmer obtain a grant also under this Bill?  Can he obtain a grant under Section 12 here and another from the Department of Agriculture for two supplies, one being for the yard and the other for the house?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of this Bill refers to water schemes &ldquo;being provided&rdquo;.  Will the Minister decide by regulation the meaning of &ldquo;being provided&rdquo;?  In my county, there are schemes listed by the medical officer which will not mature for a number of years.  Because these schemes have been planned but cannot be done for some considerable time, would the applicants in those areas be debarred for that reason from availing themselves of this grant?  If those people availed themselves of the grant, it might obviate the necessity for the local authority of extending the supply to those persons.</P>

    <P>Senator Tunney suggests that considerable improvement could be effected in legal costs.  I suggest that Senator Tunney's own knowledge could be improved in this matter. Legal costs are fixed and approved by <Col N="1093" /> the Oireachtas.  They are statutory charges, and this House and the other House are responsible for the costs which the legal fraternity are entitled to charge.  Unlike the fees of auctioneers, medical practitioners, architects, and so on, the legal fees are controlled by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As a member of the legal profession, I would refer the Minister to the fact that loans under the Small Dwellings Acts necessitate considerable costs in the way of charges or mortgages on the property.  I should like him to consider this matter and see if there is any way in which these charges could be reduced, for this reason.  On numerous occasions, people have come to me and asked me to apply for a mortgage under the Small Dwellings Acts; and I have told them not to be so foolish, but to go to a bank where, though the interest may be ½ per cent. higher, most of these charges could be obviated.  The bank will accept the land certificate or the original deeds as an equitable mortgage and obviate the necessity for having the loan registered against the holding or registered as a mortgage. Those costs are considerable.</P>
    <P>I presume it is the function of the county manager to decide this question. Possibly different local authorities have different procedures.  When there are two solvent securities, with the land certificate or the original deeds, I think that is sufficient for any local authority; and I have known none where there has been a default.  I understand most local authorities actually make a small profit on the loans which they advance under the Local Loans Fund.  Therefore, I sympathise with Senator Davidson when she talks about the high charges.  I suggest the Minister should consider circularising county managers and asking them to try to obviate the necessity for these charges on registration and on release, by the more simple procedure of equitable mortgage.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a commendable one and its provisions are a considerable improvement on previous legislation.  Its primary objects are to enable people to purchase previously occupied premises, to improve and maintain <Col N="1094" /> dwellings, provide private water and sewerage, and the conversion of large premises into separate dwellings.</P>
    <P>In the case of the small farmers who are such an important factor in our whole economy and who pay a considerable amount in the way of rates, this Bill is important.  Because of their low standard of living and their isolation from markets and so on, and the fact that they have to rely to a considerable extent on the weather to save their crops and because they lack many of the amenities enjoyed by the town dweller, it is our duty to see that they enjoy every possible benefit the Government can provide.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Cole, I am a little worried about the power now being conferred on local authorities enabling and encouraging them to provide more and bigger grants for reconstruction purposes.  In my county, the capital indebtedness is approximately £4,000,000 and indebtedness for housing alone is approximately £2,250,000.  From the time that the Acts first enabled local authorities to provide supplementary grants, my council has availed of that provision.  Owing to the poor dwellings in many part of the country, many people were able to avail themselves of these grants.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the capital indebtedness for supplementary grants alone amounts to a very considerable sum. This year, no provision was made for those grants because the Act was terminated on 31st March last.  Now the grants which they can make will be bigger and because Donegal and Kerry are the two highest-rated counties, if they are to continue those grants as in the past, it will mean that the rates in those counties will be particularly high.</P>
    <P>I realise, of course, that is a matter entirely for the local authority.  They have absolute discretion in this matter. The Minister will appreciate that, unlike a Government Department, a county council is not subject to a Minister for Finance, a Department of Finance and a Public Accounts Committee and, with the difficulty of raising money, the temptation may be there and the indebtedness of some local authorities may grow too high.  Therefore, I suggest that the Department should from time to time consider <Col N="1095" /> going into the capital indebtedness of the various counties.</P>
    <P>If, as the Bill appears to suggest, money will be freely available to provide these supplementary grants, there may be a time when it would be inadvisable to encourage a local authority to continue making grants as they have been doing up to now.  For that reason, would the Minister consider making special provision for counties with a low valuation, where rates are particularly high and where a considerable amount of improvement must be effected in building?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Laurence Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I remember having a good deal to do with its forerunner.  There is a vast improvement effected by this Bill. It assists the less well-off citizens.  I have had occasion to give deep consideration to the question of supplementary grants.  That may be all very well in the City of Dublin with its millions of pounds valuation, but when we come to deal with a small town, such as ours is, although a very important one in many respects, with a £40,000 valuation, it will be difficult to provide supplementary grants for some 400 or 500 houses which it would be necessary to provide to supply the present-day demands.  These figures will increase as time goes on.  For that reason, it should be optional as to whether local authorities will make supplementary grants or not.</P>
      <P>In the past, we had many applications for such grants.  We had deputations visiting the council.  On each occasion, they had to be turned down for the reason I have referred to.  When you think of a valuation of £40,000 or £45,000 as against millions, there is no comparison whatever.  The ratepayers must be considered, because they are the people who will have to provide the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised to hear such dissent as we heard from Senator Tunney to-night on the question of cost and the methods of financing housing in the City and County of Dublin.  Recently, two Senators visited our town to put before the citizens there a comprehensive scheme of houses which would be provided at particular figures.  I noticed, when I came to deal with it, <Col N="1096" /> that no reference was made during that conference to what I consider the most unjust feature of the whole scheme, namely, a weekly charge of 6/1 ground rent.  That has no relation or reference whatever to the general cost of the recommended scheme.  It amounts to a ground rent of £15 12s. per year.  In our town, that would be the rent of a house for a year.  That ground rent should be compared with the position in our town where we make one-eighth of an acre available at £2 a year, which means 9d. and a fraction of a penny per week.  I would suggest to those people who are interested that they should put all the facts before the people when they come to advise them and to recommend schemes to them.</P>
    <P>I must reply to Senator Donegan's reference to tenant purchase schemes. On one occasion, we invited all our tenants to apply for a tenant purchase scheme.  We had no response.  Our present manager, on another occasion, prepared details of a tenant purchase scheme for 45 houses.  Out of those 45 houses, he got two applications.  I do not think I am irrelevant in dealing with these matters on this Bill.  They are very important.  The Minister should tread warily in applying the supplementary grants provisions.  They will not be payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>I would remind Senator Donegan, who complains so much about one thing and another, that the creditworthy will always get money, and that applies to Governments and to individuals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the long delay that may occur between the application for a loan for the reconstruction or repair of a house and the actual making of a payment in respect of that application.  The only thing I can say in that regard is that I think prudence must guide the owner in seeking this money, that he will not have himself committed irrevocably before he knows he will get it and, having got the allocation of a particular <Col N="1097" /> amount of the loan for the carrying out of a specific job of repair, I believe it is possible for him to get his builders suppliers or, possibly, his local bank manager to accept a power of attorney in so far as that promise is concerned and, possibly, as the work goes on, if his contractor requires instalments of money, to draw that money from his bank, pending receipt of the loan by the bank manager. That, as I say, is a matter of prudent planning by these people who may avail of these loans under the Small Dwellings Acts, for the purpose of making repairs or improving houses which in the past they were not able to afford, or could not get the money to carry out.</P>
    <P>A suggestion made by Senator Burke, which was quite true in the past, was that local authorities were not going to do repairs where the owner had failed to do them, having received notice to do the repairs from the local authority.  It is true that the local authority did not enjoy the same privileges so far as the Local Government grant was concerned.  It is now proposed that they will.  Under this Bill the local authorities in future will be entitled, when they enter a property to repair it, where the owner has received notice to do so and has not and they will be recouped by the same amount as would have accrued to the owner or occupier, as the case might be.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned two points in addition to giving us a fair résumé of the Report of the Capital Investment Committee, which I do not intend to go into in detail.  One of the points he raised was the question of the Rent Restriction Act.  The only thing I can say there is that the repeal, amending or abolition of the Rent Restriction Act is not appropriate to my Department and the Department of Justice are in fact the people who would, or should, consider that matter. In regard to extending the differential rents system, no legislation is necessary and local authorities may make their proposals, and I think they do, and are obliged to send them to the Department of Local Government which sees that there is nothing in them which should not be there.  By <Col N="1098" /> and large, it is a matter for the local authorities and no new legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Carton said a number of things which I had intended to emphasise very much myself and have emphasised in the Dáil.  The context of part of his remarks was the absolute necessity for co-operation from the local authorities and getting the best out of this Bill, or indeed out of any of the other Housing Acts.  I will add my voice to that of Senator Carton and make a very strong plea to the local authorities to co-operate with the Department in this matter.  I would say to them that we will not hold them up, as indeed we have not held them up, in any way as suggested by some Deputies and some Senators, with whom I will deal later.</P>
    <P>I will also make a plea to the local authorities, when considering their ability or inability to face up to the costs of providing supplementary grants, to bear in mind&mdash;particularly in counties on the western seaboard&mdash; that if they give these supplementary grants, in practically all instances where applicants avail of such grants and are encouraged to build their own houses, that in the long run will mean one house less, in each case, which the local authority will have to provide wholly or partially, from either rates or Central Fund Money.  That is the main argument, and it was the argument in my own mind when I was a member of a local authority, when these supplementary schemes were first introduced.</P>
    <P>I can see the objections just as Senators, or Deputies, or councillors will now see them and I did indeed look at the burdens the ratepayers and county finances had to carry, but the final argument in my mind, and the one that carried the day, was just what I have said, that where you encourage the building of further houses by giving supplementary grants, that it means that one house less will fall to be provided by the particular local authority in the future and that it is good value by paying supplementary grants to get the house built and better value to find that the builder is the occupant rather than that the council at a later stage, should build a <Col N="1099" /> house and put that person in as a tenant.</P>
    <P>These are the considerations which I will offer to local authorities for making up their minds in this matter and I appeal to them to give us their fullest co-operation, not only in regard to new houses but in regard to the conservation of our old houses.  Senator Carton is possibly very much wiser in many ways than I am.  He and another Senator talked about the easy year there is for a builder of a new house, immediately after he has got married, gone on his honeymoon and returned to the house.  He held that it was all plain sailing for the first couple of years.  I cannot say from experience whether that is so or not but I do feel that I would reverse the argument.  One would feel that having built a house, having found a woman who is silly enough to marry one, having gone on a honeymoon and having returned, the bottom of the purse is likely to have been raked.  You may say that furniture could be purchased on the h.p. system, or on the &ldquo;never never&rdquo;, or whatever you care to call it, but when all these things have been thought about and when the couple come back, how many things will they find, and particularly the new wife, that are not there?  How many things will she find absent which she feels should be there and which her spouse, before the marriage, felt, were all catered for?</P>
    <P>While we can agree to differ in this matter, there are very strong arguments why the earlier years of marriage may be the stiffest years, when you consider the expenditure that has to be met, the costs of the wedding, of the deposit for the house, for the furniture and equipment, over and above that which may have been got on the h.p. system.  Taking all these into consideration, I think the first three or four years are likely to be very difficult years.  They are the first years where a married couple are assuming all the responsibilities of marriage, which, I am told, are very much heavier to bear than one is led to believe before getting married.  That being the case, I feel, despite the arguments which Senator Carton produced, <Col N="1100" /> that the big relief in the earlier years, in regard to the remission of rates, is a very necessary way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>There are those who said we should revert to the 20 years remission scale which was produced in 1925 and that the ratepayer would lose nothing by it. I feel that while that is true, what they did not have they cannot miss, but if the local authority, from the ratepayers' pocket, provides supplementary grants, then I feel that they are losing. I feel that if we remit the rates and remit them substantially, we have got to look at it from the ratepayers' point of view.  If they are asked, as they are being asked, to provide supplementary grants to do that job and incur that extra heavy burden on the rates, some promise must be held out of some return.  I feel that if you go beyond the ten years, you are going beyond the normal life span of a county council.  Generally, I do not think councillors will sit down and say to themselves: &ldquo;If we do this to-day and give these supplementary grants, we will get a lot of money back in 20 years.&rdquo;  They would like to look at it a little bit more reasonably.</P>
    <P>I think the suggestion also came from Senator Carton that councillors in general should be acquainted of proposals and new proposals before, in fact, we discuss them here.  I sympathise with the Senator's views, but, again, we must remember that the making of these proposals, the investigating of them, the agreeing to them and all that has got to be gone through at departmental level, in the first place, at Government level, in the second place, and that it is the right of Deputies and members of this House to discuss these proposals.</P>
    <P>I can see the Senator's point in trying to get the views of councillors of very long experience, but I can assure the House that these new proposals are based on the experience of many of our councillors through the various cases found during the years when various housing schemes were operated.  We are, in fact, finding the various weak spots by experience and, by and large we are pretty well aware of the views of our councillors throughout the country.  We get the suggestions from <Col N="1101" /> the minutes of the various meetings which we receive in all cases.  We give fair weight to the views of these people.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must not forget that quite a large number of the members of both the Dáil and the Seanad are also members of many years' standing of local authorities.  Members of the various Cabinets have also had experience in the past so that the position is not quite what might be imagined from the views expressed by Senator Carton, that we go on regardless more or less of the views, experience and advice we could get.  We have quite a bit of it from among our own members and quite a lot of it from the statements and views expressed over the years by the various county councils.</P>
    <P>There is one matter upon which I join issue with Senator Carton, that is, when he says that repeated requests were made to me to receive a deputation from the Dublin County Council on this Bill and other matters.</P>

      <P>It was mentioned here. Due to the prominence that this matter may get, I should like, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, to refer to it.  The question of receiving a deputation on degrouping is one which was made, I think, in the first instance, about 12 months ago, by the Dublin Corporation at one stage and possibly by the county council at another.  It was conditional on two Ministers being present.  It was certainly conditional on the Minister for Health as well as on the Minister for Local Government agreeing on certain stated things.  It was also made known, I think, at the time by the Minister for Health to two interested councils, both on his own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for Local Government, that the question of degrouping was one the discussion of which between the two Ministers and two councils would depend on their accepting the unified health authority. I do not want to get too involved in this; it is rather confusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the whole matter would not call for any intervention or receiving of a deputation. As far as I can gather, it did not call upon me to receive a deputation. I do not find that I, at the moment, have received or am refusing to receive a deputation on this matter. However, let me get back into order again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of valuing old houses was <Col N="1103" /> condemned by Senator Carton.  The method of estimating the cost of old house repairs was also condemned.  I know Senator Carton's capacity in this matter and I feel rather chary in contradicting him.  At the same time, while appreciating there are difficulties and that there will possibly be difficulties in the administration of these two things, I feel that, with the co-operation which he himself has expressed as being essential, we can get over both the difficulties he mentioned, and which undoubtedly we will encounter.  It will require a certain amount of co-operation. Again, I am sure that co-operation will be forthcoming.  It is co-operation which I am asking for particularly.</P>
    <P>Senator Carton also referred to the procedure under the Small Dwellings Act being unrealistic.  He talked of the many limits imposed by the various councils.  What I want to say applies to some of the suggestions made by Senator Tunney or some other Senator. The Small Dwellings Act limits we impose are: provided the income earner has an income under £832 per year, that person is in the group that may apply for a small dwellings acquisition loan, both for the purposes of the old Acts that enabled a loan in respect of a new house only and I think also in the case of the new provisions we are now making.  I think the likelihood is that they will apply.  In the case of farmers the only condition is that there is a maximum limit of £50 valuation.  All those under a £50 valuation may have recourse to Small Dwellings Act money under the local authority.</P>
    <P>Those are the only limits that will apply, and if there are procedures that must be followed, apart from that, then these are the making of the local authorities in their own wisdom.  If that wisdom is questioned by a county councillor&mdash;he is a member of a local authority and he is probably very right in making a point of it here, but if he went back to his council&mdash;I am not saying that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of conditions for making Small Dwellings Act <Col N="1104" /> moneys available by local authorities is one traditionally that has been left to local authorities, because it is their responsibility.  As such, being the lenders, they are entitled to make certain of their own conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where you may find the lack of co-operation I referred to, in the application of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible, but with many members in both Houses who feel the lack of co-operation in this matter, they may make every effort in their respective councils to see that they are not too strict in the application of the conditions.</P>
      <P>The matter that has been raised about the delaying tactics of the Department is suggestive again of our not having the money available.  Those who draw attention to these delaying tactics, as Senator Carton did&mdash;and there was a lot on the same lines which I have listened to for some days past&mdash;must remember that if we are delaying things, we are doing so, possibly although there is plenty of money which they are saying we have not got.  I want emphatically to refute the suggestion that we are using delaying tactics.  I want to make it adequately clear that where delays occur, they are often very necessary delays and, in the last analysis, are not only in order to benefit the country as a whole and the general Exchequer, but to benefit the finances of the local authorities too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer particularly to getting tenders for building schemes.  Sometimes figures are received in which the people in the Department of Local Government are well aware the costs are too high and inflated by comparison with similar schemes in adjoining areas or adjoining counties.  We know that the job can be done for less.  We know that it has been done for less and we want to make it clear that we are not going to sanction inflated prices for any jobs.  We are doing that in the interest of the taxpayer, of the local authority and of the ratepayer in turn. If delays occur, they are legitimate delays.  They are not done purposely in the way of holding up work.  I want to assure Senator Carton and other <Col N="1105" /> members of the Seanad that that is not the intention, that that is not the position and that I hope it never will be, while I am in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Colley raised the question of help to landlords or owners of a number of houses.  He also wished to know, I think, whether local authorities could go in in default of a landlord doing repairs which had been duly noticed to him in the proper manner and whether they would get the benefits of the new increased grants.  The answer to both his queries is that landlords and owners of groups of properties or houses may get these grants and the benefit of loans for repairs and improvements.  Therefore, in the case of local authorities, if they must go in and do a job, the benefit of the grants will be available to them to the same amount as would be available to the owner of a private house carrying out similar repairs.</P>
    <P>He questioned the amount of rates remission available in all cases of repairs.  In order that I do not get confused regarding the different types and stages of remission, I will refer to a note I made on this matter while the Senator was speaking.  I can say, by and large and straight off, that all repair jobs will get a remission of rates. The housing jobs under various housing schemes getting grants will get the remission in the following manner: the remission under the Housing Acts is that valuation is not increased for seven years on account of the work. That was the position and no change is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding new houses, the present remission is two-thirds of the rates for seven years, whether or not State grants are paid.  The proposed remission is nine-tenths remission in the first year, eight-tenths in the second year and so on up to the tenth year when the full rate is paid.</P>
    <P>The third category is remission for buildings other than houses which get grants.  The total increase in valuation which arises solely or partly from the extension is reduced by two-thirds for seven years.  That is according to the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1953. <Col N="1106" /> Under the Gaeltacht Housing Act, full remission is given for 20 years for jobs. I trust that that will clarify the position because there is confusion about methods of computing the remission under the different heads.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson raised the question of the possibility of recreating what we might term tenements.  This matter was raised in the Dáil in a much more vocal manner by Deputy Dillon, but I certainly take very much more notice of it now when Miss Davidson has raised it and that is casting no aspersion on Deputy Dillon. There is no question whatever that the thought furthest from the minds of myself and my advisers and the members of the Government who agreed to this measure was that there should be any recreation of tenement conditions. Inspectors from my Department will be available to advise and ensure that proper standards are maintained, and if they are not, no assistance or aid by way of grant or loans will be allowed to be paid.</P>
    <P>The question was also raised by Senator Miss Davidson in regard to the Local Government inspector being regarded as something of a watchdog for house purchasers.  I am not quite clear about the conditions about which she is making that statement, and what conditions might exist which would give rise to it.</P>

      <P>Please do, and I will try to deal with it.  Senator Hogan raised a point in which I have taken quite an interest over the years, that is, the question of rural housing.  As he has very truthfully said, in some counties, including his and my own, there is a gap to be filled by catering through the local authorities for the provision of houses for the £25 valuation small farmer class.  It is true again that where a farmer is in the £20 to £50 or possibly, in my own county, £15 to £20 class, he is in a position to avail of the Small Dwellings Act or other loan facilities, but Senator Hogan does rightfully suggest that there is an in-between who cannot be catered for under the Small Dwellings Act housing scheme and who is not sufficiently <Col N="1107" /> creditworthy to obtain a loan under the Small Dwellings Act or for title reasons to his property, may not even wish to apply for one.</P>
      <P>That group has been a problem and is still a problem to a degree, but if we look at it, we might find the amount of benefit that does accrue to those people from this Bill by way of the extra £25 in the case of the building of a new house.  In a three, four or five-roomed house, there is the Government grant and the local authority is being enabled to pay a grant of a like sum increased by the £25, so that in fact a five-roomed house or upwards may get by way of grant up to £600 of free money from the local authority and the Department of Local Government. In addition, there is the provision that up to £100 may be obtained by those smallholders by way of loan from the Land Commission.  The administrative limit is there of £100.  It is only administrative, and I have for some considerable time past been in touch with the Minister for Lands on this matter.</P>
      <P>All I can say is that if something further can be done by way of making further and better provision for this group of the small non-creditworthy farmers in the country, undoubtedly one of the worst housed categories still remaining in the nation, then the Minister for Lands and I will do everything possible, but I can say no more than that, except that it has been a very live issue in so far as the Minister for Lands and I are concerned.  If we can get any good news for them in that matter, we will be very quick to make Senators aware of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot, except to say it is compounded with the revised annuity and paid back over quite a number of years.  I am sure that the Land Commission do not like anybody talking for them, but I know that Senator O'Reilly is aware that there is not the same administrative difficulty in the case of their loans as there is with some other loans, because the <Col N="1108" /> Land Commission can add the repayment to the annuity, and they have the holding as an entire holding within their grasp and can have that charge against it, which nobody else has. Therefore, there does not arise the question of the same proof of title as they would have to produce, if they applied for Small Dwelings Act Loans.</P>
      <P>Senator Tunney referred to one matter in rather particular detail.  Undoubtedly, if the position was as he alleged, I would have great sympathy with him and would not be surprised at the justifiable anger that might have been engendered by the position he outlined in regard to the proposed Lucan housing scheme.  As far as I can understand it, the history of the Lucan scheme is as follows: during the latter year or so of the previous Government, a proposal to build approximately 80 houses in Lucan was forthcoming from the local authority.  As a result of that proposal, an officer of the Department consulted with the local housing officer, and as a result of this consultation, it was agreed by those two people that somewhere around half of that number were then justified.  In the meantime, before further action had been taken, the Government changed and so also had the departmental officer, who had gone out, in the first instance.  He had moved to another position, with the result that a further and new officer from my Department then consulted with the local housing officer for the county council.  The conclusion again was the same in regard to needs&mdash;somewhere around half of the 80 proposed.  That was approximately a year ago.  All I can say at the moment is that development work on the site is now in progress.  Work of construction has not yet started.</P>

      <P>The comparison with pigsties has been made by the Senator in regard to some of the housing in that locality.  I would make an appeal to him, a very influential member of the county council, that surely if those conditions are still existing within shouting distance of our principal city and in a most progressive county like County Dublin, would there not indeed be an effort made to introduce supplementary housing grants, even in part, in order to help out?  There should be repairing and maintenance of the houses, lest others might become as some of those in Lucan have become in the recent past.  I would appeal to him on that basis.  If we can do anything to prevent further deterioration of other houses into conditions like those he described, a very big step forward would be that Dublin County Council might try now to give more benefits and encouragement by way of supplementary grants which at the moment they are not paying.</P>
      <P>The suggestion about legal costs being exorbitant has been made on quite a few occasions.  This is rather an involved matter, when dealing with these legal people, whether you are talking for them or against them, and I was glad to hear one of their fraternity go to some lengths to set out the position as it is.  Further than that I do not feel very safe in going.</P>
      <P>There has been a suggestion that there should be no stamp duty up to a certain valuation.  Without going into details about that, there are some very strenuous objections to that course, and whether I see them in that light or not is immaterial.  I am inclined to bow to the advice tendered by those who are pretty well versed in matters of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a purchase scheme for urban houses is one which has been approached in a different light in the Dáil.  That was the disparity between the manner in which houses may be purchased in urban areas and the privileged way in which they may be purchased in the rural community.  I should possibly be slightly unfair if I were to turn it around as I got it in the Dáil and make practically the same <Col N="1110" /> answer.  The agricultural community or the working classes, whatever we may describe them as, being in a very privileged position have a well supported and subsidised method of purchasing their houses.  I think there can be no doubt that that can be justified fully, but to extend it to all types of housing, no matter where they might be or by whom they might be occupied, is a matter about which I would not be too sure.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we come back to the question whether or not there should be a levelling up or a levelling down. The answer, so far as bringing rural people into line with urban people is concerned, is that no one would consider it.  It is a very privileged position which they held for many years, in regard to the purchase of their houses, and it is one which, with the flight taking place from rural Ireland, we would be very loath to consider revising in any way, in order that we might be able to finance something similar in urban areas.</P>
    <P>For the moment, we have to leave that matter and leave the law as it is, which is that an urban house owned by an urban authority must be sold at the lowest possible price it will fetch; and the law says that as soon as that house has been sold, all subsidies from central funds must stop.  That is the law at the moment and I do not see that we can hope, in the immediate future&mdash;possibly, at any time&mdash;to change it.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney mentioned that there is a rather despicable, rotten practice of turning away prospective tenants from doors of flats, if they have children, and if the people get into the flat and have children, every effort is made to get them out.  He said we should try to introduce certain conditions, that if we assist the making available of flats in the city by way of grant or loan, we should take powers to ensure that this type of thing will not happen.  I am in full sympathy with the Senator, but right off I cannot see clearly how that can be managed.  However, when further flats become available and as they become available, the supply will catch <Col N="1111" /> up with the demand; and prospective owners, or the people about to let flats in future, will not have the same privileged position as they now hold.  Possibly, they will be glad to get a man and his wife and a couple of children, rather than turn them away, if there are children to be dealt with at all. Possibly that will right itself and I sincerely hope it does.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that I am not a Dublin man, I have always felt strongly about what he described so aptly when he talked of squandering all the good land in County Dublin.  I agree wholeheartedly that the sprawling out of our city over the best soil and land around Dublin City is something that should not continue.  It is not likely to continue, or indeed likely to be justified in the future.  Undoubtedly, we must house our people. Perimeter building has gone on in the past.  That perimeter building is regarded now as having run almost to its conclusion.  The energies of all concerned in the Dublin Corporation and in the Department of Local Government must in future be turned inwards to the centre of this city to try to rebuild the broken-down, rotten core that is there as a result of the clearance of the people from the slum conditions during the great rebuilding that went on in past years.</P>
    <P>I shall in every way endeavour to help that central city building.  Every help we can give from the Department of Local Government will be only too readily forthcoming, because not only would I like to see the centre of Dublin rebuilt, but I would also like to see some of the green fields of County Dublin left untouched.  In recent years, it almost looked as if we were going to meet the houses in County Meath, when driving up; and I would not like to see that happen.  I do not think it should happen.  Repair and improvements grants, together with loan facilities, will further ensure that our people will maintain the pretty good houses that are becoming somewhat neglected in various parts of our middle city area, if you like to call it that.  By the repair and improvement <Col N="1112" /> of these houses, we will curb that tendency, evident in the past, to go out to virgin soil to build.</P>
    <P>Also, the availability of loans to our lower income groups, to purchase what I might call secondhand or already used houses, will in itself help to maintain the population more within the city centre limits than has been the position in the past.  That also will have a very great effect in reducing the traffic chaos which has been developing, where one finds that a man working in the north of the city is living five miles out on the south side, and his pal is working on the south side and lives on the north side; and not only does it cost them money to pass each other in O'Connell Street each morning, but it creates chaos for others who have to go through the same street.  It costs money, it creates traffic chaos, and in general it is not the very best way of having things.</P>
    <P>I think these features will be gradually wiped out and that we will get more of our people back into the city beside their work, so that there will be less expenditure by the individual and there will be less traffic chaos as the result.  In that way, generally speaking, it will be possible for these people to be near their jobs and they will not have to pay high bus fares.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan talked of no money being available in the Local Loans Fund, now or a couple of years ago. He went on to justify that remark by saying that there was never any money in the Local Loans Fund. Candidly, I do not know whether there is or not, nor am I going to dispute that statement.  He went on to develop that into the story that we had delaying tactics in the Department, in regard to local authority schemes, housing and so on and so forth.  I want again to say to Senator Donegan that this is far from being the truth, that it is not so, and that we hope, in the year to come, to show that it has not been so, that it is not so and will not be so.  It has been stated that money came during the scare&mdash;which I take it refers to and describes the year 1956 or early 1957, the last six or nine months of the term of the previous Government.  He states that money <Col N="1113" /> came then just in the same way as it is coming now.  He goes on to tell us of the colossal reduction there is in the provision for housing, etc., this year in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>I want to give a few figures which I think will convince even Senator Donegan that what he has said is not so and that the reverse is in fact the case.  The colossal reduction he has talked about, that provides less this year, does not amount in fact to £700,000-odd.  There is a drop from £2,000,000 downwards but in fact the net drop is very much less than £700,000.  A sum of £2,000,000, let us say, was provided in 1957-58; £473,000 of this was saved and £1,527,000 was spent.  This year, on actual estimates of the work available for us to do, by proposals received in the Department, that provision is reduced to £1,300,000 &mdash;in other words, £227,000 less is provided than was actually spent last year.  That is closely related to the demands we know, from applications on hands, will arise this year.</P>
    <P>That is not the entire story.  Under the provisions in this Bill, if it becomes law, we expect, within 12 months working, that an additional £350,000 will be required which will be additional to the £1,300,000 odd provided at the moment; and that will bring the total this year up to £1,650,000.  It will be over £120,000 greater than was, in fact, necessary last year in all respects.  In addition to that, the draw from the Central Fund, again through the Local Loans Fund if this Bill becomes law, will be an additional £500,000 for various purposes for which we now intend to provide this money.</P>
    <P>I want also to refer to the suggestion that money came during the scare period, that was, the last six or nine months of the previous Government's term of office, to which Senator Donegan referred, and that it was coming then as it is coming now.  This was the position on 31st March, 1957: the outstanding debts to housing authorities at 31st March 1957, increased over and above what they normally have been in past years by £750,000.  In other words, there were outstanding commitments over and <Col N="1114" /> above the normal commitments for that end of the financial year of £750,000, in two housing authorities. In addition, there was approximately £350,000 of inflated overdue debts in regard to sanitary and other services due to local authorities at that date in that year, 1957.  On top of that, in the Department, there was £865,000 worth of schemes from local authorities that were queued up, awaiting sanction; sitting there and no sanction forthcoming.</P>
    <P>If proof were needed that things have changed, we can look to the first six months after the new Minister took over, to find that £865,000 worth of that work was sanctioned within the first six months of his term of office, whereas, in the previous six months and the last six months of office of his predecessor, only £13,000 was sanctioned&mdash;two small little schemes of £13,000, while £865,000 worth were queued up awaiting sanction, while, at the same time, a figure of £750,000 of inflated outstanding debt due to local authorities was lying at the door, and another figure of £350,000 also due on sanitary and other services outstanding, inflated over and above the normal level at which those debts usually run.</P>
    <P>The position to-day is, as I say, that that queue was dissipated by sanction almost a year ago.  Money is available. These schemes that were then sanctioned are going on and, in all, will incur expenditure of over £1,000,000 on £865,000 worth of sanctions.  That has been the case and any other schemes that are now coming in are being dealt with in like manner.  I am and have been in the very happy position that I have not been placed in the position of my predecessor from my own county, Deputy O'Donnell, who had to stand by and see these schemes awaiting sanction accumulate, while he could do nothing for them, because of the fact that the money was not available.  The money then became available and has been made available and the schemes have been sanctioned.  That is exactly the difference between the financial year ended 31st March, 1957, and the financial year ended 31st March, 1958.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole mentioned that local <Col N="1115" /> authorities may be spending too much and that some of them in the past had to stop making advances&mdash;I take it under some of the loan schemes&mdash;I am not sure&mdash;because of repayment costs. Possibly it may have been grants as well as loans&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because, in the ordinary way, the local authority usually tries to make ¼ per cent. profit on the loans they put out and most of them succeed in doing that.  However, through the Chair, I would direct what I have said earlier in this matter to Senator Cole and hope that it will have good effect on these people who have been scared of the rising costs on the ratepayers and I again hope that they will co-operate.</P>
      <P>Senator Cole also asked a question about water and sewerage grants from my Department where a farmer had already got for himself a water grant from the Department of Agriculture. It is very hard to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that he will or that he will not get any grant from us.  It would be safer to say that, if the water has been brought into his house, his case would be very doubtful; if the water has not been brought into his house, his case would be rather bright.  On the other hand, should the water have been brought into his house and he wanted to put in a bathroom and hot and cold water and sewerage, he could likely go for a reconstruction grant for the job in hands and possibly a sewerage grant as well for the outfall.</P>
      <P>By and large, it is unlikely that people will make money by getting the grant from both of us and getting more than, in fact, it cost them.  We will try to ensure that that will not happen, that there will be no profit but, it does not follow, if they get the one grant, that it is impossible to get another. Their best plan is to try and, if it is justified, we will help them and, if it is not, we will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Laurence Walsh raised the question of the ability of councils to provide the supplementary grants, as also did Senator Louis Walsh.  I would appeal to both Senators to try to <Col N="1116" /> ensure that these moneys will be provided in order that we can replace the broken-down houses and those that are now deteriorating throughout the country, that we do not allow them in our time to get any worse than they were when we came along and that, in fact, we should be able to say that while we were there and while we had control both of councils and Departments, or whatever you will, we improved the situation generally.</P>
    <P>There is, I think, nothing further that I want to add to what I have already said.  If, for any reason. I have omitted any specific points on which any of the members of this House have requested information, if Senators remind us of them, we will try to clarify them at the earliest possible date.</P>

Is it still a small dwelling?</P>
