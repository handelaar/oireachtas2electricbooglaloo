      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose of the Greyhound Industry Bill&mdash;in the debates on which I am deputising for the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;is to provide an adequate regulatory system conducive to the better development of the greyhound industry&mdash;that is to say, in particular the breeding, coursing, racing and export of greyhounds.  The Bill primarily owes its origin to the Report of the Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry which was set up in 1951 with terms of reference as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ascertain and report on the position respecting coursing, greyhound racing, greyhound breeding <Col N="4" /> and other related activities and such measures, if any, as are considered desirable in the national interest for the better control and development thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Coursing has a long tradition in rural Ireland, but the term &ldquo;greyhound industry&rdquo; is more readily associated with the development in fairly recent times of track racing and the export trade in greyhounds for that purpose. Coursing interests in this country set up the Irish Coursing Club in 1916 to regulate greyhound breeding and coursing activities.  When greyhound racing made its appearance in 1927, the Irish Coursing Club, after some deliberation, decided to undertake regulation in that sphere also.  With the expansion of greyhound racing, a growing commercial element developed and an export trade was built up in greyhounds for racing purposes, mostly to Britain.  During and after the late war period in Britain, greyhound racing attracted increasing patronage, with resulting benefit to our export trade in greyhounds.  For example, exports rose in value from about £77,000 in 1938 to £130,000 in 1942, £733,000 in 1945 and over £1,000,000 in each of the years 1946 and 1947.  During the middle and later 1940's also, greyhound racing in this country experienced considerable prosperity.</P>
    <P>The export figure declined rapidly to about £409,256 in 1951.  Since that date, however, a slow but continuous improvement has been experienced so that last year, 1957, 5,101 dogs, valued at £543,000, were exported.</P>
    <P>It became fairly clear that, for the future progress of this promising industry, a more effective type of control would be needed.  The Advisory Committee on the Greyhound Industry stated in their report (page 56, paragraph 136):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have been impressed with the demand from practically all quarters for a control board to be established by an Act of the Oireachtas, somewhat on the lines of the Racing Board&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(that is, for horse racing under the 1945 Act).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> The Committee went on to say (in the same paragraph):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We were informed that the Irish Coursing Club is doubtful as to whether it is legally entitled to take the obvious steps to deal with certain abuses and gathered that the club, while naturally desirous of continuing more or less in its present form, would welcome the establishment of a Control Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Committee had earlier said (page 52, paragraph 127):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While we feel bound to agree that many of the criticisms directed against the Irish Coursing Club are well founded, we also feel that its faults have been largely due to the assumption of functions which were not anticipated by its founders and that the necessary reorganisation of the club did not keep pace with the newly assumed functions and increasing responsibilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee's Report summarised their main recommendations as follows (page 81, paragraph 186):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>2.  The establishment of a control board.</P>
    <P>3.  The transfer to the board from the Irish Coursing Club of control of greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>4.  The installation of totalisators on city tracks and the imposition of a levy on the betting turnover thereon.</P>
    <P>5.  The imposition of a levy on course betting on all tracks.</P>
    <P>6.  Supervision by the control board of sales and exports of greyhounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Provisions to give effect to these and other recommendations of the Advisory Committee are contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As to the Bill itself, Part I deals with some points of interpretation and procedure.  Part II provides for the establishment and functioning of the proposed control board to be called Bord na gCon.  The board will consist of a chairman and six ordinary <Col N="6" /> members, appointed by the Minister for Agriculture, and three of the ordinary members must be drawn from the standing or executive committee of the Irish Coursing Club.  Section 16 sets out the purposes conducive to the improvement of the greyhound industry towards which the board may contribute out of its funds.  A good part of these funds which, the committee hoped would amount to about £100,000 in the first year, would come from the operation of totalisators by the board, under Section 20, at the few main tracks.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the licensing of greyhound racetracks by the board.  The board will be obliged to grant applications for licences in respect of tracks affiliated to the Irish Coursing Club in 1957, but will have discretion otherwise&mdash;for example in regard to the licensing of &ldquo;schooling&rdquo; tracks.  Under Section 25 the board will have wide powers to make regulations in regard to the operation of tracks and the conduct of greyhound racing, with a view to preventing abuses.  The section also provides that the Irish Coursing Club may make racing rules and under sub-section (5) of Section 26 such rules would require the consent of the board.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the internal reorganisation of the Irish Coursing Club as set out in the proposed new constitution attached as a Schedule to the Bill, which was worked out with the Irish Coursing Club having regard to the Advisory Committee's recommendations.  Subject to the general authority of the board, the Irish Coursing Club will continue to exercise direct control of breeding and coursing matters.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill will enable a levy to be imposed on course bets as in the case of horse racing, for the purpose of helping to finance the board's activities.  Under Section 31 the levy may be replaced at any time, if considered appropriate, by the collection for payment to the board of a specific amount as part of the admission charge for a bookmaker to a greyhound racetrack or coursing meeting.  It is believed, however, that a levy on <Col N="7" /> course bets cannot be avoided in the early years if the board is to get sufficient funds to undertake its tasks satisfactorily. I should emphasise here that a levy will require the consent of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with some miscellaneous matters mainly arising out of the Advisory Committee's Report, such as the authorisation by the board of certain officials to function at coursing meetings, regulation of the training of greyhounds for reward, control of public sales of greyhounds, investigations by the board and the Irish Coursing Club of suspected abuses, the taking of disciplinary action by the board and the club where cases of wrongdoing may warrant it, control of the admission charges for bookmakers and members of the public at greyhound racetracks and coursing meetings. Sections 50 and 51 provide means of appeal to an independent committee against decisions by the board in regard to the grant or revocation of licences and permits.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the favourable consideration of the Seanad.  I think it provides a satisfactory basis for the future regulation of the greyhound industry, which is a growing and important industry.  I think it will be found that the provisions of the Bill will operate in the best interests of all who are concerned to build up the trade in greyhounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of my consolations when I lost my seat in Dáil Eireann that I felt I had lost contact with discussions about this Greyhound Bill.  I am sure the Minister will sympathise with me about that.  I have been associated with this since 1951&mdash; I nearly said 1851, for it feels like that. I was a member of the original body which made the recommendations on which the Bill is based.  Now that I have been translated to this House, I find, like Sinbad, that this business is following me like the Old Man of the Sea, and I still have to talk about it, though I am very tired of it.  I remember that in the last Parliament the Minister now sponsoring the Bill took <Col N="8" /> a very active part in opposing the propositions which the then Minister for Agriculture put before the Dáil.  His achievement was remarkable; we had nine months of the most impassioned oratory, all filibustering.  Now the wheel has turned full circle and that nine months of oratory has brought forth this mouse.</P>
      <P>There is no difference between this Bill and the Bill introduced by the previous Minister, except for the minute change that, for the transition period, three members of the Irish Coursing Club will form part of this governing body.  After that transition period, it was, of course, the intention of the previous Minister that the elections to that body would be conducted in a democratic way.  I think he felt&mdash; he said so in public and I believe him &mdash;that he made that arrangement at the time in order to provide a carrying-over machine which would translate the present system to the new system and which would also be a tribute to the men who had brought this greyhound industry, for whatever it is worth, into whatever position it is in to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results which one seeks from this kind of legislation&mdash;and they were the results I aimed at when I was a member of the investigating committee &mdash;are twofold.  The first is that the small breeder, the man who breeds greyhounds, the small farmer in the country, will get a fair price for his animals when he has reared them.  It is quite a profitable industry for the small farmer or cottier, because he can raise two or three dogs a year at a small cost, and if they are well bred and if he is an intelligent and careful man, he will get a good reward, as good as he would get from rearing cattle; and they are only a sideline and the woman of the house generally looks after them.  Secondly, on the question of the foreign buyer, it is very important that when he gets greyhounds from this country he should not be deceived when he buys an animal, that it is worth it, that it is what it purported to be and that the racing card accompanying the animal is a genuine card, with all the faults of the animal enumerated on it.  If we <Col N="9" /> keep these two objectives in mind and if the Bill works, we will achieve these results.  If the Minister can ensure that the men who are on the first board are men of integrity and quality, I think this Bill will produce good results.</P>
    <P>The Minister has my good wishes&mdash;I will be very brief about them.  He has also my thanks for doing what he tried so hard to prevent being done in the last Parliament.  I think we should let the Bill go, that the Seanad should pass it and let the greyhound men look after their own business.  I hope that never again will we hear the word &ldquo;greyhound&rdquo; inside the gates of Leinster House and never again will we see bookmakers lobbying in the House&mdash;which was a most objectionable feature of the last Parliament when the Bill was being discussed.  I think the Minister might and would say &ldquo;amen&rdquo; to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one to control and regulate, and powers are being invested in the new board to achieve the purposes of the Bill.  Certain other powers are vested in the Irish Coursing Club.  I do not know if it has occurred to the Minister to look into the matter with which I am about to deal.  Since this Bill passed through Dáil Eireann, there has been a decision of the Supreme Court which, to my mind, has a direct bearing on a great many of the provisions of this Bill.  The Constitution provides that no law shall be enacted which is repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the Solicitors Act&mdash;which was decided on last Friday&mdash;it seems to me that the House has a duty to consider whether sections of this legislation are not repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution.  The position for the future, as I read the Bill, will be that people who are free now to carry on certain matters in relation to racing and coursing of greyhounds, the sale of greyhounds, their training and breeding, will in future be permitted to do so, only under a licence to be granted either by the new Greyhound Racing Board or under some authority given <Col N="10" /> to them by the Coursing Club.  In other words, the position which may be created by the enactment of this legislation will be, for the future, that activities which at present could be carried out without any licence, permit or approval of any statutory body will become illegal, if carried out without these permits or licences.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill provides in sub-section (1) that after the appointed day, a person, other than the board, shall not operate a greyhound racetrack, except under a licence to do so. Under Section 22 (1), the board is empowered to grant or refuse such a licence, but there is the saving provision that anybody who operated a greyhound racetrack in the year 1957 will be entitled to get that licence.  However, that will not provide for the future.  If someone establishes a track and it does not comply, in the view of the board, with their requirements, that person may be denied the exercise of the right he has to establish a track at present.  That denial may occur by reason of the board's refusal of the licence.  Under Section 24, the board may withdraw a licence or suspend it, if satisfied that the track concerned is conducted in a disorderly manner, or is in a condition dangerous to persons frequenting the track or has ceased to be used for greyhound races.</P>
    <P>Section 25 contains a number of prohibitions, the effect of which is that persons will not be entitled to act as racing managers, handicappers, judges, stewards, time-keepers or hare-drivers, save under and in accordance with permits granted by the board at its discretion.  In other words, people at present carrying on these functions will not be able to carry them on in future, except under permit of the board.  If the board withdraws the licence or refuses the permit in any of these cases, the people engaged in that occupation and deriving their livelihood from it will be unable to make their living.</P>
    <P>There are other sections which contain similar requirements.  Section 29 enables the board to grant or refuse a permit to a licensed bookmaker to carry on his business of bookmaking at a racing or coursing meeting.  Section 37 provides for the granting of <Col N="11" /> licences for the training of greyhounds. Section 38 provides for the granting of licences to hold public sales and auctions of greyhounds and Section 39 provides for the granting or refusal of licences for engaging in the artificial insemination of greyhounds. All of these are impositions being introduced by this Bill and if the Minister has not already considered this matter, I would ask him to consider, before it is taken another stage, whether, in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court on the Solicitors Act, the new situation as disclosed by that decision makes this Bill unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that in a later part of the Bill provision is made for disciplinary measures against people who do not carry out the provisions of the Bill and in the constitution of the Coursing Club contained in the Schedule, there is provision that the executive committee of the club &ldquo;may take or authorise the taking of disciplinary action, including the imposition of disabilities in relation to participating in greyhound breeding, coursing and racing, against persons who appear to them to have been guilty of conduct inimical to the breeding or coursing of greyhounds or to have contravened rules made by the Club relating to greyhound racing or the training of greyhounds for reward&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, I have not got the judgment of the Supreme Court and I must only rely on my memory of what I heard when the judgment was being delivered and on an extract from it, as printed in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of March 8th.</P>
    <P>The members of the House are probably aware that the Act in question was the Solicitors Act, which provides for the control and regulation in certain respects of the solicitors' profession. The Solicitors Act, 1954, established a disciplinary committee, and that committee was invested with certain powers, amongst which were the taking of disciplinary action against a solicitor into whose conduct they had held an inquiry.  They were authorised by the Act to do one or more of the following: to dismiss the application, <Col N="12" /> to admonish the solicitor, to suspend the solicitor from practice, to remove or strike off the roll the name of the solicitor and oblige him to make a contribution towards the cost of the inquiry. They could also oblige him to make restitution or satisfaction to another party who had come to the disciplinary committee.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court adopted the attitude that where the functions of a statutorily appointed body impinged in a profound way upon the livelihood or fortunes of the citizens and that body was not a judicial body, any Act which contained these provisions was repugnant to the Constitution, as far as these provisions were concerned.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the exercise of such powers and functions was calculated ordinarily to affect in the most profound and far-reaching way the lives, liberties, fortunes or reputations of those against whom they were exercised they could not properly be described as &lsquo;limited&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>The short point involved in the appeal was, said Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore, whether the disciplinary committee set up by the Act had been given powers and functions the exercise of which involved the &lsquo;administration of justice&rsquo;, and which could not properly be regarded as falling within the saving provisions of Article 37.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Article 37 of the Constitution provides for the exercise of limited powers of a judicial character by statutory bodies. I continue the quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Here they were dealing with a tribunal which depended for its existence and its powers on a legislative act of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that in relation to this Bill the powers and functions of the board are dependent upon a legislative act of the State.  They do not find their power except under this Act.  The quotation goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the effect of such legislation was to confer the powers to administer justice on persons who were not regularly appointed judges it was by Article 34 unconstitutional unless it could be brought within some of the <Col N="13" /> saving provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore considered the constitutional powers and functions of the disciplinary committee and said that it seemed to the court that the power to strike a solicitor off the roll was, when exercised, an administration of justice, both because the infliction of such a severe penalty on a citizen was a matter which called for the exercise of the judicial power of the State, and because to entrust such a power to persons other than judges was to interfere with the necessities of the proper administration of justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if an owner of a racetrack is conducting that track in accordance with what he considers proper standards and the Greyhound Racing Board decides that it is not a properly conducted track and withdraws the track licence from the owner, they are undoubtedly interfering with the fortunes of that proprietor and that consequently to do that under a legislative Act of the Oireachtas would be quite unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I should mention that in the case of the Solicitors Act, the disciplinary committee, while entitled to exercise these powers, could be appealed from by anybody affected by their decision. No doubt under Section 50 of this Act, an appeals committee is appointed. Section 51 provides for an appeal where a greyhound racetrack licence, and these different permits to which I have already referred, are refused, and, in the case of revocation or suspension, provides for appeal to that committee; but if the situation is that the committee is the final body to determine whether a person is to have a licence or permit, then it is quite clearly, on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision, unconstitutional. Similarly, provisions in the constitution contained in the schedule of the Irish Coursing Club enable the executive committee to take disciplinary action, including action in relation to racing and coursing, and that would also be, on the basis of the decision, unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>There seems to be another matter which occurred to me when studying this Bill that was in conflict with the Constitution.  What the Minister has <Col N="14" /> said in his opening statement suggests that this matter is not quite so important. As I understood the Minister's opening statement, the Irish Coursing Club came into being in 1916.  In 1927, it assumed, apparently reluctantly, the business of greyhound racing, but, as of this moment, there is in being an association known as the Irish Coursing Club and they are entitled to give themselves what constitution they like. That is the right which is guaranteed to them under the Constitution to form free associations.  The Bill seems to me to make an end to the Irish Coursing Club and to say to them that they shall not continue in existence, unless they take the constitution which is provided for them by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That may be only a theoretical difficulty in view of what the Minister has stated&mdash;that this constitution has been worked out in conjunction with the Irish Coursing Club.  It may also be that this section which provides for this constitution may be a legitimate exercise by the Oireachtas of its powers to enact for the regulation and control of the industry, in the public interest of the rights of citizens to form associations.  It may be a borderline case, but it does seem to be one which requires some further investigation, if the Minister is to satisfy himself that the provision is quite constitutional.</P>
    <P>Beyond that, all I want to say about the Bill is that it is undoubtedly desirable that abuses and malpractices should not be permitted in relation to an industry such as the greyhound racing industry.  People who are discharging their duties and trying to keep proper standards in the breeding and coursing of greyhounds should not suffer from these malpractices of a few people.  It is desirable that a Bill such as this to encourage, and as far as possible, to control and regulate these standards should be accepted.  I think, however, in view of the doubts which I entertain as to the constitutionality of the powers, control and regulations in disciplinary matters that this is a Bill which should receive further consideration.</P>
    <P>This might well be a Bill which the <Col N="15" /> President might refer to the Supreme Court for a determination in accordance with the provisions in the Constitution as to its constitutionality, after, of course, consultation with the Council of State.  I trust that I do not seem too pedantic in raising this matter, but I feel, in view of the very forthright decision of the Supreme Court in relation to a disciplinary committee set up under Statute that it was proper to draw the attention of the House to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much that one can add to the statements made by Senator Barry and Senator O'Quigley on this Bill, and the very full statement made by the Minister in the debate in the Dáil.  He has covered the ground and has explained matters in a way which is an enlightenment to those who have not seen the Irish Coursing Club and the greyhound industry grow as I had an opportunity of seeing them grow.  As Senator O'Quigley has said, the Irish Coursing Club was founded in 1916 and that is a year memorable in our history.  The Irish Coursing Club was founded for all Ireland and it is still an all-Irish body.  To us in Clonmel it is rather unique in being one of the things that is truly national and, at the same time, has been kept in the country away from Dublin.  I think it is one of the activities of any great importance that has not its headquarters in the City of Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is said that the Irish Coursing Club functioned very satisfactorily until 1927 when new commercial interests then became interested in coursing by the introduction of mechanical racing, known as the greyhound racing track.  I believe the Irish Coursing Club were very well aware of the many difficulties that they had. The Minister stated in the Dáil that they felt they had not the powers to deal with irregularities which occurred from time to time, and which always happen in any sport of that sort, whether it be greyhound racing, horse racing, or racing of any sort for high stakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know myself that the Irish Coursing Club were very anxious, even with <Col N="16" /> the limited powers they had, to stamp out irregularities.  It is a democratically elected group and maybe it was not always possible for them to have the powers to do what they would like to do.  I do know that, on one occasion, I had an opportunity of meeting two of the most competent detectives from Scotland Yard who came over to Clonmel to look over the records of the Irish Coursing Club with regard to grave scandals that were taking place on English tracks.  The Irish Coursing Club were in no way responsible for what was taking place on English tracks, but they went out of their way to help Scotland Yard to put an end to the irregularities in England.  I mention England particularly, to show that irregularities are not confined to Ireland and the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
    <P>The figures given by the Minister in the Dáil with regard to the export of greyhounds show how large the problem became and how important the industry became in such a short time.  In 1938, £77,000 worth of greyhounds was exported, but, by 1946, the exports had reached £1,000,000. The exports had increased about 14 times.  What was done and has been done is a great credit to those who were members of the Irish Coursing Club during all that period, and few of them have personally benefited in any great measure.  Many of them were men of outstanding ability.  Maybe some of the decisions they had to take were highly controversial, but it is easy to throw mud at a big man&mdash;he is certainly a better target than a small man&mdash;and some of the people at whom mud was thrown were very big men indeed.  I had an opportunity of knowing them for many years.</P>
    <P>Many of them are now dead and gone and I think, on an occasion like this, we should pay a tribute to what they did to make this a truly Irish Coursing Club, as removed from the English Coursing Club as it was in 1916.  In view of what was done in the past, the Minister might consider that when the Greyhound Board is established, it should be established in the country.  I suggest it should be established in Clonmel which has been for so many years the headquarters of Irish <Col N="17" /> coursing and has been synonymous with the great development which has taken place since the Irish Coursing Club was first established in 1916.</P>

      <P>I propose to deal first with the suggestion which has just been made by Senator Burke, that the headquarters of the Irish Greyhound Industry Board should be located in Clonmel.  I should like to explain my position with regard to the Bill.  When the late Senator Moylan was designated as Minister for Agriculture, he was not a member of either House of the Oireachtas and I was asked to take charge of the Bill <i>pro tem.</i>  It has happened that since Senator Moylan's death the present Minister for Agriculture has been very busily engaged, as you know, with other matters, and I have continued to deal with the Bill, merely for the purpose of having it enacted by the Oireachtas.  I shall have no association with the administration of the Bill once it becomes law&mdash;that will become the function of the Minister designated in the Bill&mdash;but I shall convey to the Minister for Agriculture the suggestion which has been made by Senator Burke and which was made, I think, in the first instance, in the Dáil by Deputy Loughman.  What action the Minister may take in regard to that suggestion, I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In regard to Senator Barry, he is very modest.  He says that there is a minute change in the Bill. I suppose it depends upon the point of view one takes.  The fundamental change in the Bill is that, under Section 9, the Greyhound Industry Board will control the Irish Coursing Club, and under the Bill as introduced by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture, the position was the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism of the Bill in 1955, and the action which I took in relation to it, was based entirely on the fact that I did not think that this control would be in the interest of the Irish greyhound industry, and I and those who were associated with me did succeed in ensuring that the Bill in that form would not be passed.  The change, <Col N="18" /> therefore, which has been made is not a minute change.  If the control of an organisation or an undertaking passes from one body to another, the change is not at all minute.  In fact, the difference between the two Bills is analogous to the change which would take place if Senator Barry were to decide to change his allegiance from Fine Gael to Fianna Fáil.  I do not think he would regard that as being a minute change.</P>
    <P>There are several other changes in the Bill.  Under Section 26, for instance, it is provided that the reconstitution of the Irish Coursing Club will take place under the supervision of the Greyhound Industry Board.  That, I think, is very important, having regard to the criticisms of the Irish Coursing Club which were embodied in the report of the Advisory Committee.  I do not want to traverse that ground again.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are many other changes in the Bill which were introduced at the last moment by the Minister then in charge of the 1955 Bill, on the Report Stage, and which have been embodied in this Bill.  These amendments were all introduced to meet the criticisms of the 1955 Bill by those who were opposed to it in its then form.  The Bill, therefore, has been substantially changed, and, I think, has been changed very much for the better.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator O'Quigley, there may be a great deal in it, but the Oireachtas is not the place to determine this question. The Constitution has a means or procedure provided for settling the constitutionality of any measure which may be enacted by the Oireachtas.  All we are concerned with, at this stage of the Bill, at any rate, is to say whether we approve in principle of the dominant provisions of the Bill, that is to say, whether we approve of the establishment of the Greyhound Industry Board, whether we think the Irish Coursing Club should be reformed, and whether we think that a body should be entrusted with the control and regulation of the greyhound industry.</P>
    <P>I cannot discuss here the decision <Col N="19" /> which the Supreme Court came to the other day in relation to another enactment of the Oireachtas.  It would be improper for me to do so.  But I can say that we may find ourselves in a very difficult position, because we have proceeded on the assumption that vocational and professional bodies are the best means of controlling the vocations and professions which they represent.  In the Constitution, there is a sort of vague general acceptance of that principle.  On that basis, even before the Constitution was adopted and enacted by the people in 1937, there were established various regulatory and disciplinary bodies to control the medical profession, bodies like the Bar Council to control the barristers, and a body to control the dental profession.  It is quite clear that the effect of the Supreme Court decision will have to be considered in relation to these bodies and to many others, but I do not think it should naturally arise for consideration on this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is the duty of the Oireachtas to legislate.  It is, too, certainly, the duty of the Oireachtas to legislate with some circumspection, and not to legislate blatantly in defiance or in violation of the Constitution; but in a matter like this, we are entitled to proceed on the assumption that what was valid and legitimate for us to do in the past is valid and legitimate for us to do now.  If it is felt necessary that the issue which Senator O'Quigley has raised should be determined, there is a means provided in Article 26 of the Constitution for determining it.  Article 26 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Article applies to any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas other than a Money Bill, or a Bill expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution, or a Bill in respect of which a resolution shall have been passed by Dáil Eireann under Article 24 of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first provision of this Article reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" />&ldquo;The President may, after consultation with the Council of State, refer any Bill to which this Article applies to the Supreme Court for a decision on the question as to whether such Bill or any specified provision or provisions of such Bill is or are repugnant to this Constitution or to any provision thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite the question which has been raised here by Senator O'Quigley, I suggest that we should proceed to deal with this Bill in the ordinary normal way, to discuss its provisions on their merits, and, if they appear to us to justify our approval, to give our approval to them.</P>

      <P>The sum of money mentioned in the draft Order&mdash;£1,300,000 approximately&mdash;now before the House for approval is the amount necessary (i) to bring the copper mine at Avoca from its present stage of development to the stage where the mine will be ready to go into production, and (ii) repay £350,000 due under a trade loan guarantee.  The copper deposits at Avoca, which were investigated by Mianraí Teóranta with the aid of Government grants totalling £543,000, were leased in 1956 to Canadian intered company, known as St. Patrick's tered company known as St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, to undertake their development on a commercial scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited are a subsidiary of Irish Copper Mines Incorporated, a Canadian registered undertaking.  Irish Copper Mines Incorporated are, in turn, a subsidiary of another Canadian mining company known as the Mogul Mining Corporation.</P>
    <P>Since the lease was granted, St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited have been actively engaged in the development of the copper deposits at Avoca with the object of commencing production on a commercial scale as soon as practicable.  The company are employing on an average 350 people on development work, and expect to employ 500 when commercial production commences.  The company have spent over £2,000,000 on the project up to the present, and progress reports which have been made available to the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicate that the scheme of development is being executed efficiently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited were dependent for their finances on their parent company, Irish Copper Mines Incorporated, who in turn are dependent upon the parent company, the Mogul Mining Corporation.  Credit restrictions in Canada have seriously affected investment and development projects, and the Mogul Mining Corporation had said they have been forced to make a selection as between the projects which should be developed and those which in present circumstances, must be brought to a standstill. A further sum of approximately £1,000,000 is required to bring the Avoca deposits to the stage at which commercial operations can be undertaken, and if this sum is not forthcoming, development work will have to cease and the mine will not be brought to the production stage.  To assist St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, temporarily, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance in September, 1957, guaranteed a short-term loan of £350,000 under the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Acts.  The financial accommodation thus made available to the company prevented a cessation of operations in September, 1957.</P>
    <P>The promoters have been very active <Col N="22" /> in their efforts to secure financial accommodation from private sources, and they succeeded in procuring an offer of a loan of £1.3 million from a Canadian issuing house.  The terms and conditions of the loan would have involved a guarantee by the Irish Government of payment of interest and repayment of capital.  Generally, the terms of the loan as to interest and discount rates were so onerous as to make the transaction an inappropriate subject for a guarantee by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>When it became known recently that an Irish company would be prepared to consider granting a loan on more favourable conditions, the promoters negotiated a loan of £1,368,420 from the Irish company.  It is a condition of the loan that it should be guaranteed by the Government as to both interest and principal.  The loan would be secured by a first mortgage on the present and future assets of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, and in the event that the security should have to be enforced, St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, have agreed that the shareholders of the company shall have no interest in the assets of the company.  In effect, therefore, the guarantor, viz., the Government, would become the proprietor of all the assets of the company.</P>
    <P>The Government has given careful consideration to the question whether it would be justified in guaranteeing the loan.  In its appraisal of the situation, the Government has had regard to the fact that the copper deposits at Avoca represent a national asset of considerable value.  Substantial employment would be provided in the development of the deposits, and the value of production&mdash;and export trade in copper concentrates&mdash;would be important from the national standpoint. The proved deposits are sufficient to justify commercial development on a substantial scale for a period of at least 12 years.</P>
    <P>The Government has already expended a sum of nearly £550,000 on preliminary work at Avoca and this expenditure will have been wasted if St. Patrick's Copper Mines are unable to procure the additional funds which are <Col N="23" /> now needed to complete the development work.  While the Government is most reluctant to contemplate the possibility that it would be necessary for it, if it guaranteed the loan, to enforce its security, nevertheless the fact remains that, if the security had to be enforced as a result of default in repayment by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, the Government would acquire control of an undertaking on which more than £3,500,000 will have been expended and which will have been brought to the stage of full development.</P>
    <P>The Government appreciates that the substantial fall in the price of copper in the past year or so has created difficulties for St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited, and is a factor which must be taken into account in deciding whether or not it should guarantee the loan. From its peak of £436 a ton in March, 1956, copper has dropped to about £165 a ton.  This collapse is due in large measure to the increased production which the rising price of copper set in train.</P>
    <P>Authoritative sources state, however, that mining development has not been planned on the assumption that copper would remain at over £400 a ton for long but was based on conservative estimates of £220 to £240 a ton.  Competent authorities say that the fall in the price of copper is sharper than most observers in the industry would have cared to predict and that the present price is lower than the oversupply position justifies.</P>
    <P>The outlook for copper is regarded as hopeful because of the prospective growth of electric power and of industrial output which will involve an increase in the world demand for electrical equipment and apparatus made from copper.  The size of known copper reserves is said to be remarkably small, and the prospects for mines such as that at Avoca are reasonably good in the light of estimates that world consumption of copper will increase by 1,000,000 tons (or 33? per cent.) between 1956 and 1960.</P>
    <P>The Government has had the benefit of a report on the Avoca mine prepared <Col N="24" /> by a well known investment trust having substantial mining interests (including copper) in various parts of the world.  A study of the report shows that the trust formed a distinctly favourable impression of the Avoca deposits.  It is stated that the development and construction work at the mine is proceeding in a very workmanlike fashion and that the approach is imaginative, yet sound.</P>
    <P>The original estimates of mining and milling costs made by the Mogul Mining Corporation have been confirmed by the report and the estimates of mineral reserves made by Mogul have been shown to be conservative. The mill design is stated to be sound and anticipated recoveries and costs are reasonable and are supported by laboratory tests.  The crucial factors are the anticipated forward price of copper and the possible sale of pyrites concentrates which will be obtained as a by-product.</P>
    <P>A decision regarding the guarantee of the loan obviously depends upon many imponderables.  A risk has to be taken, but it is a calculated risk, and, unless it is taken, there can be no hope that the development of the Avoca mine will be undertaken in present circumstances.  The Government has reached the conclusion that it would be justified in guaranteeing the loan and recommends that Seanad Eireann approve the draft Order, under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, which has been laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise, I am afraid, to speak in opposition to this motion which seems to me quite extraordinary, in the general circumstances in which it arises, and those which we remember two years ago, in March, 1956, when we debated the question of tax concessions to these various companies under the Finance (Profits of Certain Mines) (Temporary Relief from Taxation) Bill, 1955.  It was pointed out then by several Deputies and Senators that Mianraí Teoranta had done an excellent piece of work in doing the prospecting upon which the State had spent something like £500,000 which would be paid back by <Col N="25" /> these new Canadian and Irish companies&mdash;that, in fact, the work of prospecting had been carried out so efficiently and well that the Canadian mining experts were convinced that the situation was such that they could come in here and make a not inconsiderable profit.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that, in such enterprises, the major risks or perhaps the most hazardous part of such work lies not infrequently in the prospecting, which may result in nothing in the end.  But, once the prospecting has successfully been carried out, once it is apparent that there is a considerable amount of metal ore in existence at a particular place, then the degree of risk is considerably diminished.</P>
      <P>That the work of Mianrí Teoranta was excellently done, that their conclusions were soundly based, is not denied by anybody, and is, in fact, made clear by the Minister, Deputy S. Lemass, in the Dáil, speaking on this State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1958, as reported in Volume 165, column 64, when he says that he had anticipated</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...that these deposits would turn out to be a considerable national asset but, in fact, the investigation of them has disclosed that they are even more important than I then assumed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt, therefore, but that the work of the original prospecting company was well done, and that their conclusions were, if anything conservative when they said that there is copper there, and that there is money to be made out of it.  In the original debate on the Finance (Profits of Certain Mines) Bill, I suggested here in the Seanad, as reported at column 1289 of Volume 45:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The position, then, as I see it, is that the taxpayers of the country have taken the major risks of prospecting, and the mining company is now going to take the minor risk of exploiting, secure in the belief, on the basis of the preliminary work carried out by the prospectors, that there is a not inconsiderable profit <Col N="26" /> to be made.  I, personally would prefer to see a State company develop the community resources for the benefit of the community, employing necessarily all the foreign technical aid required, but maintaining the ownership and the control of the profits, if any, of this mining company here in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nothing that has happened since has led me to change my mind about that.  However, one point was made by a Fianna Fáil Senator at the time&mdash; Senator Cogan&mdash;that the great thing about this agreement with the new company was that the £500,000 that the Irish taxpayer had spent upon the admittedly rather risky prospecting ventures was to be paid back to the Exchequer under agreement by the new company.  I will quote what Senator Cogan said on that occasion, as reported at column 1279 of Volume 45 of the Seanad Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wisdom, foresight and courage of Deputy Lemass in this respect have been completely vindicated, and I think it is satisfactory that we find that the entire sum of £500,000 which was spent by the State in the exploration and development of those particular mines will now be recouped in full to the State.  That is something which must cause pleasure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I recall, when I quote that to the Seanad here to-day, that we are being asked to guarantee a loan of £1,300,000 now to this company, a major argument in favour of which used to be that they were going to pay us back the original £500,000 that we had spent on prospecting.  It looks very much to me as if we are going to lend them £1,300,000 in order that they will be able to pay us back £500,000, if not at once, at any rate, some time.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan also said on that occasion, on the same point, as reported at column 1281:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As I understand it, the Canadian company proposes to hand back to the State the entire sum that has been expended on mineral development in the Avoca area.  That means that the Minister will have at his disposal a sum of £500,000 for further <Col N="27" /> mineral development and I hope that that money will be used for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The argument that was then being used in order to convince us that the kind of concessions being made to this company, in the way of allowing them complete taxfree profits for the first four years of working, and levying only half the tax rate on profits for the next four years after that, was that we should have this £500,000 back from them, which, in the contention of at least one Fianna Fáil Senator, would be at the disposal of the Minister &ldquo;for further mineral development&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggested at that time, and I think other Senators agreed&mdash;some did &mdash;that the major risk had already been taken by the company financed by the Irish taxpayers.  At column 1286 of Volume 45 of the Seanad Reports, I am recorded as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the position as I see it, is this: the preliminary work of prospecting, what I would call the dangerous, risk-bearing work, was carried out in this country at the taxpayers' expense, and now that it has been discovered, at the cost of, I think, nearly £500,000 to the taxpayer, that there is a possibility of extracting valuable ore from these mines, at that very moment, we say: &lsquo;Right: since the element of major risk has been removed, we now pass it over to private enterprise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seemed to me to be a mistaken policy at the time.  I hope that it has become apparent since that it is considerably more mistaken, or that at least it is more obvious that it is a mistaken policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes suggested at that time that the great advantage of getting the foreign company in was that we would not be risking our own money, and that if they failed it would not be our money, but theirs, that they would be losing.  Yet we are asked to-day to allow our State, our taxpayers, to guarantee to this company a loan of £1,300,000.  On what security?  On the security of the mines we leased to them.  The thing we can look forward to by way of security is that we can <Col N="28" /> get the mines back again&mdash;mines on which a not inconsiderable sum of money will have been spent, admittedly, but a not inconsiderable portion of which money will have been our taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I might quote the Minister in the Dáil Debates at column 64, Volume 165. He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In our appraisal of the situation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>meaning when they had decided that they would guarantee this loan of £1,300,000</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;we had regard to the fact that these copper deposits in Avoca represent a national asset of very considerable value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the national asset which we lease to a foreign company, to which foreign company we are now going to lend money on the security of this very considerable national asset which we leased to them.</P>
    <P>I am not a great admirer of the capitalist system, but I think this particular example of the workings of the capitalist system is not even fair to the capitalist system itself.</P>
    <P>We guarantee this money on the security of the mines we lease, and if we are not paid back this money we will get back the mines we leased.  I mentioned that one Senator, Senator Hayes, said on the last occasion that the great advantage of passing this over to a foreign company was that it was their money that would be risked and not ours.  Apparently that advantage is swiftly disappearing.  I may quote Senator Hayes, as reported at column 1295, Volume 45 of the Seanad Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They will spend their own money in developing these mines&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and, a little further on</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If they fail they will have lost their own money, not ours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, the situation now is that we are going to guarantee a loan to them, again from the strength of our own native taxpayer, to the tune not of the £500,000 we were hoping to get back but of £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>I suggested then, and I might perhaps be allowed to suggest again, that <Col N="29" /> we are over afraid of State enterprise in this country.  Indeed, in that Dáil debate on the original Bill, Deputy Lemass, as he then was, challenged by the then Minister as to whether he was in favour of State enterprise, said he was not, that he had &ldquo;no confidence in State enterprise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Consequently both the Government of the time and the Opposition of the time seemed to be against State enterprise and in favour of the rugged individualism of private enterprise and private capitalist venture.  But this private capitalist venture has now to be backed apparently by the public taxpayer, and if it loses the public taxpayer's money, it will compensate the public taxpayer for that by giving back to the taxpayer what the taxpayer originally leased to it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we had a more intelligent attitude towards foreign &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo; in the days of the Shannon scheme&mdash;which was hotly attacked at the time, but in relation to which the Government of the day decided&mdash;I think rightly&mdash;to seek and take expert advice, and then to thank the givers of that advice, pay them, send them home and run the Shannon scheme ourselves.</P>
    <P>What we do now is to ask the foreign experts not merely to give advice, but to run the whole show, to come in and be presented with tax-free concessions for four years, and half-tax rates for the next four, and if that is not enough to lend them £1,000,000 or so if they cannot pay what they originally contracted to pay us when we leased them the mines, and they promise that if they cannot pay this sum back, they will at least give back the mines.</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that we as a community had a little more self-confidence. We are told, of course, that &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; is brought in, and so on.  There is a mistaken impression in this country that &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; is purely an import.  I believe we have a considerable measure of &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; in this country, and even in relation to such things as mining.  I am not speaking in criticism of the Canadian experts, for whose competence I have the greatest admiration and respect, <Col N="30" /> but I have admiration also for the competence of our own experts, and I find quite frequently that they are not merely as able but as up-to-date, and as well abreast of developments in other countries.  I might cite an example.</P>
    <P>When preliminary inquiries were going on before the Canadian company was set up, or agreed to come in, they sent experts over here.  It so happens that one of the points they were making inquiries about was the question of whether it would be possible to set up a small smelting plant here, or whether it would be necessary to export the aggregate, and have it smelted down, either in Canada or somewhere else.  I asked a question about that the last time, and the Minister told me&mdash;mistakenly, as I learned later&mdash;that it would cost £3,000,000 or £2,500,000 to set up a smelting plant here.  I have since found out that the sum should have been £300,000 and not £3,000,000.  It was probably a slip of the tongue, but nevertheless the fact is that a smelter can apparently be set up far more easily here than was stated.</P>
    <P>When these Canadian experts came over here, they were told by experts of Mianraí Teoranta of a small-scale similar experiment which was going on in Finland, where great success was being achieved, and where the small smelting plant was enabling the Finns in the development of their metal ores to bring about a slow steady development, related to home needs, and not related simply to the export or world market.  This was bringing lasting benefit to Finland, and was not approached by them with the purpose in mind of sucking the mines dry quickly and then closing down, but of satisfying home requirements and keeping the mines going as a long-term national asset.  The Canadians were very much interested in that small smelter, and they flew two experts to Finland, upon this Irish information. These experts studied the facts there, and I suppose what they learnt comes now under the term of &ldquo;Canadian know-how&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our own people, with half the encouragement we gave to foreign <Col N="31" /> investors and foreign experts, could have done precisely the same thing, or possibly even better.  Our experts would have not merely their own &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;, but access to other experiments and to knowledge of conditions obtaining elsewhere.  I believe, therefore, that we could have developed our own resources here just as well, if not better.  But no, we decided that we need a ruggedly independent representative of private enterprise, in the form of a foreign company sponsoring an equally rugged but partly Irish company, which rugged independent company would nevertheless have to be cushioned by tax concessions, and bolstered up by State loans, and persuaded into doing what could be perfectly well done by ourselves&mdash;far better perhaps, and with less need, perhaps, for public subsidy, either short or long-term.</P>
    <P>If we compare the attitude of our State and our Exchequer to the Voluntary Health Scheme in this country, where the absolute maximum guaranteed as a loan was £50,000 for the entire scheme for the whole country&mdash; a repayable £50,000 at full current interest rates&mdash;we recognise that we seem to be more generous&mdash;a good deal more generous&mdash;to the foreign &ldquo;ruggedly independent&rdquo; representative of private enterprise, than we are to a scheme, such as the Health Insurance Scheme, which is non-profit-making and quite demonstrably calculated to result in wide public benefit.</P>
    <P>The public mining company, however, carried on for private profit, and with big tax concessions already, is to be lent this £1,000,000&mdash;or rather we are to guarantee the loan to it of £1,300,000, and guarantee it with the full strength of the taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>I believe that such a sum of money could have been far better used by a State mining company, set up and directed by those highly skilled engineers and administrators, who made such a brilliant success of the original prospecting venture under Mianraí Teoranta, to which I think not sufficient credit has been given when talking about &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and &ldquo;expert knowledge&rdquo;, and so on.  This would <Col N="32" /> have been, in my contention, of great and lasting public benefit.</P>
    <P>The major disadvantages of depending on foreign investors instead of on our own community emerged in the Dáil debate on this same motion which is now before us.  I quote the Minister again, as reported in Volume 165, columns 62 and 63, in which he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Credit restrictions in Canada, which became quite acute in the past year, have seriously affected all investment and development projects and the Mogul Mining Corporation informed me that they were encountering difficulties in financing the completion of the development work at Avoca.  They said they were being forced to make a selection between the various projects in which they were interested with a view to deciding which of them should go on and which of them in the circumstances should be brought to a standstill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, I gave a trade loan guarantee for £350,000 which was raised by the company on a short-term basis from an Irish bank.  If that financial accommodation had not been made available to the company they would have had to cease operations in September last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to mention the fact that there was a Canadian company prepared to give them this sum of £1,300,000, but only on conditions which the company were not prepared to accept, and which the Government here felt to be too stringent.  So that we, the taxpayers, are apparently prepared to lend on conditions which the Canadian capitalists do not think quite good enough in the circumstances. I do not think I need stress the fact that the major disadvantage of getting foreign investors to develop the resources which we ought to be developing ourselves, is the fact that if they encounter difficulties, if credit restrictions develop in Canada, the Irish development project would be dropped; whereas if we put the money into our own projects, we could continue them at our own rate, without, <Col N="33" /> perhaps, making the immense forward strides that would be possible if the project were solely related to the world market, but producing perhaps something of more lasting benefit to our people.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, I am opposed to the whole principle of State handouts to enable private industrialists to succeed where, apparently, under the ordinary conditions of capitalist economy, they could not raise the capital.  We are asked to praise private enterprise, to praise the profit-seeking, system and yet apparently this company cannot find the money, cannot raise the wind, within the terms of the ordinary capitalist economy, so that what we are doing is favouring and making possible investment in something, which, in terms of ordinary capitalism to-day, is uneconomic; and we are doing this without having any working control over the enterprise.  We are doing this for the sake of a private profit-making concern.  They have &ldquo;run into financial difficulties&rdquo;, the Minister says, so the State comes along and helps them out, and guarantees a fat loan.</P>
    <P>If this had been a State company, and if it had run into the same kind of difficulties, everybody in the country would have been running up and down saying: &ldquo;There you are; they do not know how to run things.  Now they are asking for £1,300,000.&rdquo;  If this was C.I.E., the E.S.B., or Bord na Móna everybody would be shouting that State enterprise was no use, was inefficient, and that what we really needed was the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; of private capitalists.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; has been mainly used for the purpose of persuading the Minister, and, through him, the Irish taxpayer, to put up £1,300,000 for the purpose of helping these people to pay back £500,000, which we spent in doing the most risky part of the work, the original prospecting. In other words, we are earnestly endeavouring to make the worst of both worlds.  We have none of the advantages of State control and direction, none of the advantages of a self-financed private enterprise; and under this motion we are asked to opt <Col N="34" /> for all the disadvantages of Statefinanced, State-guaranteed, private enterprise for private profit.  For that reason, I propose to vote against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to the House, and I do so with a great deal of pleasure, having always found him a very pleasant colleague in the Oireachtas.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was about three-quarters way through his brief, I thought: &ldquo;Oh, this is a very schoolboy kind of production.&rdquo; Then, skilfully enough, in the last quarter of the brief, the Parliamentary Secretary really produced the genuine article out of the hat.  The reason we have this motion before us to-day is primarily the fact that the price of copper dropped from £435 to £165.  I had not got those figures quite as accurately myself.  My recollection is that there are about 15,000,000 tons of ore at Avoca and those areas, of which about 1 per cent. is copper. Might I say that at a time when the price of copper was a great deal higher than it is to-day, a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, having got all the reports of the prospects, he and his Department started moving around to see if they could get anybody to take up the project.</P>
      <P>The sky became suddenly blue and, hey presto, here was a Canadian company prepared to come in and do the job.  The Government was astonished, and rightly astonished, because there is in Dublin one of the most distinguished copper-mining men in the whole world, and he had more or less told the Government that there was not a hope for this project, and he had gone to some trouble about it.  In these circumstances, I think there is no option really.  The company having put £2,000,000, according to the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, into this project, the only option open to the Government would be to buy the concession back, pay them some sum, whatever it would be, for what they had done and then proceed to run it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that neither the then Opposition in the Dáil&mdash;and I will not <Col N="35" /> go into the details of the tremendous furore made about it at the time&mdash;nor Senator Sheehy Skeffington has been vindicated.  I must say I was flabbergasted at Senator Sheehy Skeffington who, instead of coming here in sackcloth and ashes to read out what he said on this Bill, has now adopted his present attitude.  He referred to the enormous gift which we were giving away, but it does seem to be rather a Greek gift.  Owing to conditions having changed in Canada, and the price of copper being what it is, I doubt if any Canadian, or any other finance house, would provide this money for Avoca without a State guarantee.  Nobody could be enamoured of it, but I would like to say in relation to what Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said, that in the conditions that come into the financial provisions of the Central Fund Bill, what the Senator wants us to do is to make more and better provision for us to lose money.</P>

      <P>There is one other thing which the Senator said and upon which I would take issue with him.  I think he does not understand the point when he refers to a reduction plant costing £3,000,000.  There are two kinds of reducing plants, one kind costing £300,000 and then there is the type of plant which produces fine copper.  It is a different proposition. They have already put up at Avoca a plant to reduce the ore to 6 or 7 per cent. to enable it to be shipped abroad.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I was aware there were two kinds.  I was quite definitely referring not to the orereducer, but to the small smelter, which could be erected, I understand, for £300,000.</P>

      <P>An oil refinery is being erected at Cork Harbour at a cost of £12,000,000.  The equivalent of an oil refinery could be put together in a laboratory at a cost of a few shillings.  One is quite as irrelevant <Col N="36" /> to the other as is one smelting plant to the other.  This can be an economic proposition and the Canadians have approached it in this way.  Nobody, naturally, with conditions as they are, welcomes a guarantee of £1.3 million to a company for the purpose of saving some other money, but I do not see any reason at all for opposing the suggestion which the Parliamentary Secretary has put before us to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senator O'Donovan for his kind remark at the opening of his contribution.  In dealing with this question of whether the State should guarantee the loan to the company that is in negotiation with a private company, it is well for us to deal with it as the situation presents itself to-day.  The decision, of course, to give a lease to the mining company was taken some time ago by the previous Administration and was agreed to by all Parties represented in the Oireachtas.  On the basis on which that decision has been taken, the Government, in considering the present difficulties of the company in regard to the continuance of their business to bring the mine to a point where it can be developed as a producing unit of copper within the country, felt that it was absolutely essential that the company should be facilitated by this guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, that the Canadian company has invested in the mine, in development only, the sum of £2,000,000.  What we are asking for here is that the company will be afforded the opportunity to borrow the amount of money necessary to develop the mine further and to bring it to perfection.  We are not asking the State to advance the money, but we are securing, in the terms of the agreement, that, should the company fail to sell copper and fail in their obligations under the terms of the guarantee, the mine in which £3,500,000 will have been invested by them will revert to the State.  A decision can then be taken, if such an eventuality arose, as to whether or not it would be advisable to set up a State-sponsored company, as advocated by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  That would be a matter for <Col N="37" /> decision by the people who would then be charged with the responsibility of dealing with this question.</P>
    <P>This situation has been brought upon this company by the steep fall in copper prices, and by the fact that, in Canada, credit restrictions are such that they cannot borrow any further money there.  The Government, in enabling this company to proceed to go into business, to put copper on the market, are assured that the £500,000 originally invested by Mianraí Teoranta, will be made secure to the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is very much further to say on this matter.  It is a question as to whether the company is to continue at Avoca to do the work which they originally came in there to do, and I think it would be very bad policy at this stage to prevent them from continuing in this work.  We would have the mine on our hands and we would have to proceed to develop the business ourselves, or ask somebody else to come in and develop it for us.  We must also take into consideration the fact that the reserves of ore at Avoca are estimated at 20,000,000 tons and with 1 per cent. copper, which represents 200,000 tons of copper, at a price of £165 a ton would be worth about £33,000,000 to the country.  That does not take into account the value of pyrites which could be quite substantial.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of a smelter is concerned, it is well for us to know that the company have the last say in this matter.  They are the experts, and they say that it is not feasible to have such a process carried out here.  They feel that, being an independent company, with their money invested in the mine along with the money guaranteed to them now, the onus is on them to say whether it would be feasible to enter into that portion of the business or not.  The fact is that if the loan is not approved, the mine will close down, and it will be a long time before it will be opened again by the St. Patrick's Company or by anybody else. The Seanad should in its wisdom approve of this Order, and I ask it to do so.</P>

      <P>Might I ask <Col N="38" /> the Parliamentary Secretary two questions, arising from his reply?  The first arises from his suggestion that if the company were to fail, we could then make our decision as to whether we would set up a State company or not.  The question I should like to ask is: why must we always wait until an enterprise which has been developed by private enterprise goes bankrupt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall cut all references to philosophy, and simply ask the questions arising out of the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The other statement he made, as I understood it, was that the possibility of erecting a small smelter was a concern of the company and that they had decided that it was not feasible.  The question I should like to ask is: does he know whether or not that decision as to the non-feasibility of a small smelter is due to the fact that they aim at large-scale short-term exploitation, extracting all the copper they can in the first eight years or so, and whether it would become feasible if the aim was rather a slower, longer development, to meet not so much the world market as home requirements?</P>

      <P>I move that the Seanad do not insist on amendment No. 3.  Members are familiar with the developments which gave rise to the position and it is therefore unnecessary to dwell at length on them.  The Seanad, as it was perfectly entitled to do, passed three amendments to the Bill.  The Dáil has agreed to amendments Nos. 1 and 2, but has declined to agree to amendment No. 3.  The decision of the Dáil was arrived at by a very emphatic majority of 43.  In order to keep in line with what happened under similar circumstances on a previous occasion in this House, I looked through the Seanad Debates, and I found in Volume 37, column 1845, that the then Leader of the House, Senator Hayes, in moving that the Seanad do not insist on two amendments to the Transport Bill of 1949 which the Dáil had declined to accept, advised the Seanad in the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have carried out our function. It is not for us to deal with the way in which the Dáil has discussed these amendments but with the decision which the Dáil has made, and in the light of that decision I move that we do not insist on our amendments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I commend this advice to the Seanad on this occasion and I move accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I should be flattered at being quoted by Senator Ó Maoláin on this occasion and finding him so emphatically in agreement with me, or whether I should say that the Devil can quote Scripture for his purpose.  I suppose I should say both.  Strangely enough, perhaps it will surprise Senator Ó Maoláin to know that I agree that we should not insist upon this amendment. On the last occasion on which this matter arose, when I was Leader of the House, I think the Bill had still about a month to go.  In this case, the delaying period is already over, and the only effect of our not adopting this motion, and of insisting upon the amendment, if we were to insist upon it, would be to compel the Dáil to pass a resolution to put the Bill into operation.  Indeed, they could have done that already and <Col N="40" /> given us no opportunity of having this discussion.</P>
      <P>But while I agree with the motion that has been moved, that we should not insist on this amendment, I should like to say that while, as Senator O'Donovan has said, the Parliamentary Secretary is very welcome, he is the more welcome because he has had no part in these proceedings on this amendment.  We were expecting to see the Minister here this evening, because there are a few things we would like to tell him.  First and foremost, I agree entirely that the Seanad has fulfilled its function.  It has indicated a particular defect in the Prices Bill, a defect which is not only in the Bill but is common to a great many Bills and which, in the judgement of this House and, in my judgment, is an extremely bad method of drafting Bills.  We have fulfilled our function and spotlighted that particular defect, but we could carry out no good purpose by continuing. It would be no harm to say that the predecessor of the present Parliamentary Secretary behaved in a very reasonable manner, but the Minister thought fit, when he came to see us in connection with this Bill, to tell us that we were ignorant and various other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing we objected to was the provision in the Bill which gave an officer of a Minister for Industry and Commerce power to ask any kind of question he liked, and that power was added to a great many other powers already provided for.  It is interesting to remember that the Bill passed almost at the same time as the Office Premises Bill, 1957, in Section 28 of which there is a provision in subsection (2) that: &ldquo;No one shall be required by virtue of paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) to answer any question or to give any evidence tending to criminate himself.&rdquo;  That is what we wanted in the Prices Bill. That is not being inserted and it is certainly open to the courts to say: &ldquo;The Oireachtas put it into one Bill but did not put it into the other.  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that they meant the power to exist in the Prices Bill.&rdquo;  That may not be so decided, but that is certainly <Col N="41" /> a reasonable legal interpretation.  It is probable that the powers will be exercised reasonably.  That, I know, is the defence of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and of every other Minister for this kind of provision. The real danger is that in our legislation we have given explicitly enormous powers to an officer of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I still think that no matter how these powers are exercised by the present Minister or by his successors, he should certainly make provision to say that, when a citizen is subject to questioning, he should be questioned only within a reasonable area and should not be liable, through any Act passed by the Oireachtas, to be asked questions which might cause him to incriminate himself or to reveal anything between himself and, say, his legal advisers.  Having said that and having succeeded in having the Dáil discuss the matter, I agree that in the circumstances which have since arisen and in the light of our Constitutional powers, it would be no use for us to insist.  I agree with the motion made by the Leader of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of disagreeing with the Leader of the House.  I quite agree that this Bill will now have to be passed, but we are entitled, as one of the Chambers of the Legislature, to assert very strongly what we feel about this matter.  We have no power to stop the Bill coming into operation, but I feel that we are entitled to make some comments upon the way in which our amendments were discussed in the other House.  I regret that the Minister is not here, but at the same time I feel a duty to this House, and to some members in particular, to comment on the tone of the debate in the Dáil and on the way in which our perfectly reasonable amendments were handled by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I refer to column 142 of the Dáil Debates of 12th February, 1958, in which the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a particularly stupid amendment which I cannot under any circumstances accept.  Apart from <Col N="42" /> the fact that it is badly drafted, put in the wrong place, and entirely unnecessary, if it was of any effect at all, it would be completely detrimental to the enforcement of Price Orders under this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That passage struck a vague association of ideas in my head&mdash;a similar condemnation of something else.  I know now what it was.  It was the comment of Dr. Johnson on the joint of roast beef.  He said it was badly killed, badly hung, badly cooked, badly carved, and badly served.  The tone of these two condemnations seem to me to be somewhat similar.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the Minister said that it was a stupid amendment.  On the general principle that he who drives fat cattle must himself be fat, people who propose stupid amendments must themselves be stupid.  We are entitled to defend ourselves against this accusation of being stupid.  If the House looks at column 132 of the Dáil debates of the same date, it will see that this amendment which is being rejected is described by the Minister as an &ldquo;even more foolish&rdquo; amendment than the other amendment which was accepted. If this amendment is even more foolish than the one which was accepted, I should like to point out that the Minister for Industry and Commerce inserted a foolish amendment in the Bill on his own showing.  He has refused to insert this one because it is even more foolish than the one he inserted.</P>
    <P>I should also refer the House to column 142 where it is stated that the amendment is put in the wrong place. If there is a wrong place, presumably there must be a right place.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate to the House what in his opinion would be the right place in the Bill where this amendment should be inserted.</P>
    <P>The next comment of the Minister was that the amendment was badly drafted.  The fact is that this amendment was drafted by members of the legal profession.  I need not specify who they were.  They were, in fact, members of the legal profession who drafted this amendment and moved it in the House.  It was supported by a <Col N="43" /> number of members of the legal profession in this House and in the other House.  In view of that, I was greatly surprised to read in columns 131 and 144 of the Dáil Debates that the amendment was stated by the Minister to have been drafted by &ldquo;sea lawyers&rdquo;. I quote from column 131:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sure there are a number of Deputies opposite who will have learned from experience that one of the biggest nuisances a Minister can encounter when he is trying to get a Bill through the Oireachtas is the &lsquo;sea lawyer&rsquo;, who believes he can improve on the work of the parliamentary draftsman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, in column 144 he said: &ldquo;I think it was something thought up by a sea lawyer...&rdquo; I thought I had a very good command of the English language, but this, I admit, was a new term to me.  I looked it up in several dictionaries.  <i>The Century Dictionary</i> gives the following definition of a &ldquo;sea lawyer&rdquo;.  It means three things, all of which are described as &ldquo;nautical slang&rdquo;.  The first meaning is:&mdash;&ldquo;A querulous or captious sailor disposed to criticise orders rather than obey them, one who is always arguing about his work and making trouble.&rdquo;  The second definition is:&mdash;&ldquo;The gray mangrove snapper&rdquo; and the third definition is &ldquo;a shark&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate to us whether we are querulous sailors, mangrove snappers or sharks.  If we are mangrove snappers, would be indicate precisely what a mangrove snapper is?  I have great respect for the parliamentary draftsmen. Many of them are personal friends of mine.  But I think the suggestion the Minister makes that the parliamentary draftsmen are always infallible is one which they themselves would not be inclined to accept.  We have had the experience in the past couple of months of a clause in a Bill which had to be dropped when it was questioned.  We, the same &ldquo;sea lawyers&rdquo; who were let loose on the Prices Bill, were prepared to try to argue against Section 21 of the Agricultural Institute Bill, but to our relief when the time came, it was withdrawn <Col N="44" /> by the Taoiseach, on the ground that it could not be supported constitutionally and had been wrongly inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, if every time people question the parliamentary draftsman's draft, they are told they are stupid and foolish sea lawyers, querulous sailors, mangrove snappers, or sharks, there is no point in maintaining the Seanad at all, or, for that matter, the Dáil.  If everything the parliamentary draftsman says must always go through, if he can never be questioned, it seems to me that, in the economy drive about which we hear so much in relation to the Estimates, both Houses of the Oireachtas could be abolished with great advantage.  The Ministers and parliamentary draftsmen could then legislate to their hearts' content, without being opposed by these &ldquo;sea lawyers&rdquo; and other people who are out apparently to make mischief and make the governing of the country more difficult.</P>
    <P>Though the Bill is going through, I want to register my protest against the bad principle involved in the rejection of this amendment.  I think that the amendment falls into two parts&mdash;the incriminating part and the privileged part.  I would be prepared to let the privileged part go.  I think it is not the fundamental part, but that the part of the amendment which refers to people incriminating themselves embodies a very important principle, which, as Senator Hayes has said, appears in other Bills.  If it has been embodied in several other Bills, it does not seem correct for the Minister to say it is unnecessary to embody it in this Bill.  If it is necessary in other Bills, it is necessary in this; and if it is not necessary in this, why should it be embodied by the parliamentary draftsman in other Bills?</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the right of the citizen in this country not to incriminate himself under cross-examination by officials is a fundamental constitutional right.  One of the great principles of the Common Law under which we all live is that nobody is to be convicted except by a proper trial.  It is a fundamental right of the individual, which is not to be watered <Col N="45" /> down or weakened, that everybody is presumed innocent until proved guilty and that, if people are suspected by the agents of the Government of not obeying the law, they should be prosecuted, the offence brought home to them and, if convicted, should be punished. I attach great importance to this right.  It is one of the things to which this Seanad should give countenance, that in an age like this of growing power of the State in every country, with the intrusion of the Government into every section of life, the ordinary man has the same right against people in uniform as against people not in uniform.  It is a fundamental principle of the Common Law and of our Constitution that simply because a man is put into a uniform, whether he is called a soldier, a policeman or an inspector, he has no more rights against the ordinary citizen than if in plain clothes.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is the duty of the Seanad to assert that they believe in their principles, even if we are not able to hold up this Bill to-day.  If this Bill should lead to snooping by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to undesirable intrusions into traders' private affairs, to every form of badgering by agents of the Government, at least the responsibility for the attack on the liberty of the citizen will rest on the shoulders where it should lie and the Seanad will at least have struck a blow for the liberty of the individual.  In doing so, it is very unfair that it should be attacked as being stupid and composed of ignorant &ldquo;sea lawyers&rdquo;, trying to hold up desirable legislation.  Although I quite accept that the Bill must go through, we have at least attempted to assert a very important fundamental principle of our Constitution.  Having said that, I shall say no more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what was said by Senators Hayes and O'Brien.  I think our proper attitude towards the motion would be to accept it.  It would be fruitless, I think, to delay further the implementation of this Bill.  I agree with Senator O'Brien that we have made our stand and made our position clear, and that there is consequently <Col N="46" /> no point in delaying it for another two or three months.</P>
      <P>I was not myself entirely satisfied, as I said in Committee, about this particular amendment.  I felt it was not wholly good.  I felt that if the reference to the particular instance of &ldquo;incriminating evidence&rdquo; were removed, and if there were the mere statement that the ordinary protection of any witness before the High Court would be granted to these people, it would have been sufficient.  I felt, nevertheless, that the amendment as it stood merited support.</P>
      <P>I agree with both the Senators who have spoken that the Seanad, in supporting that amendment, was doing no more than its duty.  I would also support Senator O'Brien very strongly about our need to be concerned for the procedure of this House.  I share his resentment at the tone of some of the debate on these amendments when they went back to the Dáil.  The tone was set&mdash;I do not think there can be any question about it&mdash;by the Minister, who seemed to be very annoyed, because the Seanad had ventured to pass amendments against his advice. At column 132 of Volume 165 of the Official Report of the Dáil, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Here, he is referring to the amendment I proposed myself, and which he subsequently accepted, the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;was put in the Seanad I must admit I conveyed to the Opposition that I thought the amendment of so little importance that I was prepared to accept it if they completed the Bill so that I could get it back to the Dáil to be dealt with before the recess.  But when they came along with a more foolish amendment, that did not prove possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to comment on the point already made by Senator O'Brien.  I want to comment here on the inaccuracy of the reference.  The Seanad will remember that before the recess the Minister was not here at all to pilot this Bill.  His Parliamentary Secretary was here.  It was, in fact, on the <Col N="47" /> last day that the Dáil was sitting&mdash;the afternoon of the last day on which it was sitting&mdash;that the Leader of the Opposition in this House offered the Parliamentary Secretary all stages of the Bill, if he would accept my amendment and the amendment following it.</P>
    <P>There was some doubt later about the correctness of the report.  The report was absolutely correct.  I personally remember noticing, with a certain internal amusement, that Senator Hayes was asking for the acceptance of my amendment and throwing in the next amendment also to get them both accepted together, with the condition that we would then give the Parliamentary Secretary all stages that day.  The Parliamentary Secretary accepted my amendment, but did not accept the other one.  We took a vote on it, nevertheless, and it was passed.  He could still have had all stages that night.  When you, Sir, in the Chair, asked him what he wanted to do about it, as we were entirely in his hands, and it was early in the evening, and as Senator Hayes had made it quite clear that he could get back to the Dáil before the Dáil rose, the Parliamentary Secretary himself stated that he did not see the point of all the rush, and that even if there was a gap between the old and the new legislation, it did not really matter.</P>
    <P>The Report and Final Stages were not taken that evening, although they might easily have been.  It was not until quite considerably later, long after the Dáil had gone into recess, that the Minister came before us and made his plea for the reintroduction of the original text into the Bill.  Therefore, it is quite inaccurate for the Minister to say he came before us and asked us to do something before the Dáil rose which we refused to do.  He was not here at all on this Bill, in fact, before the Dáil rose, and, in saying that, he seriously misled the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I would support Senator Hayes in saying that there is no point in our holding up this matter further.  We have made our stand.  However, as Senator O'Brien said, I feel we should be prepared to see that any suspect is given the full protection of ordinary <Col N="48" /> civil liberties.  I am prepared to stand here and say that a suspected price-racketeer has the same right to protection as any other citizen.  The fact that he is suspected of something which we deplore, removes no civil liberty from him.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am the more led to agree with this motion in that I do not believe any court would uphold the powers that are, in theory, given to the Minister's agents, to interrogate witnesses and take from them even evidence which would implicate them. In other words, I believe the provisions of the Act as they now stand unamended, will not be capable of application by the Minister's agents, and, if they try, they will not be allowed to go against the ordinary Common Law.</P>
    <P>I understand, by a tone of irritation and public statements, that the Minister is extremely anxious to get this Bill.  He is being given it.  He said he urgently desires these powers, and so forth.  I hope he will use these powers which he is so anxious to get. The Prices Advisory Body has gone since the end of last year.  How soon will the Minister set up one or more of the new Prices Advisory Committees under the powers of this Bill, which he is so anxious to get, and which we are now giving him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dissent from this motion for the reason advanced by the other speakers.  There are only one or two matters to which I would refer.  As I understand the basis on which the Constitution rests, there is a certain separation of powers and the duty of this Assembly is to legislate. If we want to legislate, we are entitled to examine Bills and, when we think proper, to make amendments to them. I regret, for my own part, that the honest endeavours of legislators here in this Assembly to make better Bills, to improve the Bills that come in to us, should be the subject of the very slighting and indeed insolent remarks which were made by the Minister, both here and in the Dáil.  Not alone was the word &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; used in relation to the amendment, but there was the phrase that it was &ldquo;a particularly stupid amendment&rdquo; and &ldquo;a most stupid amendment&rdquo;.  I framed the <Col N="49" /> amendment and I do not think I am all that stupid.  That is all I have to say on that.</P>
      <P>Since the amendment was the subject of comment by the Minister in this House, I have been considering for what reason he might have considered it was stupid.  I felt that the Minister had some particular reason for thinking it was in that category.  Possibly he had the view that the whole tenor of the operation of the Act was being changed by the amendment, by reference to the privilege which a person would have in the High Court.  He refers in column 1125 of volume 48 to the High Court and he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a person interrogated by an authorised officer merely stated he was claiming privilege or refused to reply because by replying he might incriminate himself there is nothing the authorised officer could do except to bring legal proceedings in the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, that is not what is intended and that is not the way the amendment was drafted.  If the Minister had gone to the Schedule to the Bill, which deals with the Advisory Committee to be established under the Bill, he would also find there that the Advisory Committee in bringing people before it would have all the powers invested in the High Court to compel people to come there and answer questions, and so on.  The reason for that is that the High Court under the Constitution is the Court of First Instance and it decides what the law is, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when I included, as I did in this amendment, a reference to the privilege which would attach to communication, in respect of which a person would be entitled to claim privilege in the High Court, I was referring to what the law is; and the law is always what is decided by the High Court, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.  It is not the fact, as the Minister thought, that in the event of persons claiming privilege or stating that they refused to answer questions on the ground that they would incriminate themselves, the authorised officer or inspector under <Col N="50" /> the Bill would have to take proceedings in the High Court.  That, I say with great respect to the Minister, is nonsense.  The procedure will still be in the District Court, but in the District Court we would be entitled to claim the immunity we would be entitled to claim in the High Court.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  The then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Bartley, in the course of the debate in the Dáil, said that the amendment here was not put upon the same basis as that on which it was argued in the Dáil.  He said, as reported at column 158, Volume 165:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reason I mention it in relation to this amendment is that the case that is now being made that there is a very wide principle involved in this amendment was not put forward in the Seanad on behalf of Fine Gael in so far as I could find out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1039 of Volume 48, in moving the amendment I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think this amendment is one of some substance and importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, as reported at column 1136 of Volume 48, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It seems to me this amendment raises a point of the highest constitutional importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of our arguments in favour of the amendment, we were dealing with the liberties and rights of the citizens.  I would have imagined that once we mentioned the rights and liberties of citizens, we were dealing with matters involving high principle and of constitutional importance.  It would seem to me that it is not necessary to brand and tag them as being matters of constitutional importance and high principle.  Once we are dealing with the liberty of the subject and the invasion of their rights of property, we are dealing with matters of constitutional importance and matters of principle. It is not the way in which the Minister thinks the Bill will work that will matter when one comes to implement it in the course of legal proceedings; it is what the Act will then state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> As I have already stated, I believe that if a person refuses to answer questions because he feels answering the questions will incriminate him, that will leave him open to a charge under the Prices Act, as it then will be, for failing or refusing to answer a question asked by an inspector.  For that, he can be fined or sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  It is not what the Minister thinks; it is what the Act states that will determine the law in the District Court.  I have no doubt in my own mind that that will be the position.</P>
    <P>For another reason, I regret that this amendment was not accepted by the Dáil.  We have proposals in being at the moment for the repeal of certain provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act.  There has been a campaign in progress in the United States and in this country to attract foreign capital into this country, all with a view to establishing industries here and providing employment for our people.  No American industrialist&mdash;or British industrialist, for that matter&mdash; will come into this country and invest his money here until he knows the conditions upon which he will invest his money.  I have no doubt that shrewd businessmen will find out what our laws are relating to taxation.  They will probably find out that, in relation to income-tax and the like, there are certain ameliorations of the income-tax code in regard to taxation on industry engaged in producing goods for export.</P>
    <P>Then they will come on and try to find the law relating to factories, if they are establishing a factory.  There is a whole code of factory legislation there and they will probably acquaint themselves with it.  Attached to every factory and every wholesale house, and so on, there will be offices; and these business men will probably investigate the conditions there.  They will find that, in 1958, there was an Office Premises Act enacted by the Legislature.  They will find there are provisions in it for the inspection of those offices to see that they comply with a particular standard.  They will also find that, in relation to these <Col N="52" /> inspections, there are certain saving provisions which do not compel the owner or occupier of offices to answer questions which would tend to incriminate them.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers will be interested in prices, of course, and will probably have a look at the prices legislation and then they will be interested, I should imagine, to note that, on visits by inspectors of the Department of Industry and Commerce, they will be compelled to answer all classes of questions, including questions that would tend to incriminate them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be negativing the efforts being made to attract capital here to have provisions of this kind relating to prices and profits, provisions which will compel these prospective investors to give all classes of information about their private affairs, including information which would tend to incriminate themselves.  I think that the prices legislation would not have been rendered any less effective by the inclusion of this amendment. There is a juxtaposition with the Office Premises Bill, which was passed within a short period of the Prices Bill, and the possibility that it will have the effect of putting off people who might be inclined to invest in this country.</P>
    <P>For that reason, amongst others, I regret that the Minister did not see his way to recommend the acceptance of this amendment in the Dáil. Certainly, for my part, for the future nothing the Minister has said will persuade me from putting down amendments, if I think they should be put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Brien made a number of references to statements made by the Minister in the other House and it is a pity that the Senator did not refer to one statement which I will quote from Volume 165, column 143 of the Official Report.  The statement is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Bill makes it possible to introduce price control in times of scarcity, when there is a danger of profiteering and, if these provisions are to be enforced, an inspector must have the right to go in and ask a <Col N="53" /> trader what price he is charging.  The purpose of this amendment would be to deprive him of that power, at least to give the trader an opportunity of pleading a sort of fifth amendment and to say: &ldquo;I will not answer the question because it would incriminate me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes has referred to a defect in the section and in view of the fact that the other House has already passed the Bill and deleted that amendment, it can scarcely be correct for the Senator to refer now to a defect in that legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the section as a defect.  It is in the Bill and surely I am entitled to say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may say so, but the other House has agreed to that section.  Furthermore, Senator Hayes stated that the Minister's agent would be entitled to ask any question he might wish.  The section qualifies the type of question that can be asked, because it has to be a reasonable question.  If a trader refuses to answer and is prosecuted, the court will have to decide whether or not the question was reasonable.  In many Acts that have been passed, the same type of provision is included and it is rather late in the day for some Senators to be objecting.</P>
      <P>Under the Night Work (Bakeries) Act, 1936, Section 9, a member of the Garda Siochána may ask &ldquo;of any person found in such premises such questions in relation to the said premises and the work done and the business carried on therein as such member shall think proper, and may demand of any such person his name and address.&rdquo;  If the person refuses to supply the information or fails or refuses to answer the questions to the best of his ability, the penalty is £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Noxious Weeds Act, 1936, Section 2, and again under Section 177, sub-section (b) of the Road Traffic <Col N="54" /> Act, 1933, a member of the Garda Siochána may obtain similar information and also under the Turf (Use and Development) Act, 1936, a person must give the information required and the same applies under the Shop (Hours of Trading) Act, 1938, Section 9.</P>
    <P>I consider that it would be impossible to enforce the Bill and that the Bill would not be effective, unless that section was included, and in view of the fact that it has been included in so many other Acts, I fail to see why there should be any objection to including it now.  So far as the question of privilege is concerned, the fact that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is included&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say anything about the merits of the amendments because I think we amply discussed those on one occasion in this House.  I think it a pity that we had not the benefit of Senator Walsh's opinion at that stage, because as far as I remember he is the only Senator from the opposite side of the House who has contributed a viewpoint on this matter.  It would have been of value at that time.  However, we are not now engaged in a discussion of the merits or demerits of the amendment. Like other Senators who have spoken, I do not think that it would be proper for us or that it would benefit anybody to insist on the amendment standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution provides that when there is a dispute between the two Houses, the view of the Dáil shall prevail and I think that is right and proper.  I agree that they should have the last word.  They have voted by a substantial majority in favour of the deletion of this amendment.  The only purpose we could serve now would be to hold up the Bill for a certain length of time.  I do not think we should do <Col N="55" /> so and for those reasons I would not disagree with the motion that we should agree with the Dáil that this amendment should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree fundamentally with what Senator Walsh has said. The burden of his remarks, as far as I can see, is that we lost in little things some of the rights and privileges which we had.  I think it was Lord Acton who said: &ldquo;We lose our freedom by little things.&rdquo;  Senator Walsh says that because of certain actions in the past on amendments similar to this, we should agree in this case.  I think we should be most vigilant and demand our rights.  It is a sorry commentary that we must pass this because some members of the Dáil or Seanad, in the past, were not there to see that safeguards were inserted to protect the ordinary people in their everyday dealings with officials and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend for a short period the provisions of the Tea (Importation and Distribution) Act, 1956.  The Act which I have mentioned governs the present temporary arrangements for implementing the policy of importing this country's tea requirements direct from the countries in which tea is grown. This policy has been in continuous operation since April, 1947, and has been implemented through Tea Importers, Limited, a State-sponsored body, the purchases of which are financed by banking accommodation guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  This Act will expire on the 31st March, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware that a Bill providing for permanent arrangements for the importation of tea is at present before the Dáil.  As the permanent arrangements contemplated in that <Col N="56" /> Bill could not be brought into operation before the 31st March, 1958, and possibly not until the 1st July, 1958, there might be a period of up to three months during which there would be no control on the importation of tea unless the 1956 Act be continued for the limited period proposed in the Bill now before the Seanad.  The present Bill is necessary, therefore, to ensure that there will be no interruption in the importation of this country's tea requirements direct from the producing countries until the permanent arrangements, which have yet to come before the Seanad, can be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>A very important consideration in connection with this Bill is that Tea Importers, Limited hold substantial stocks of tea purchased by the company for distribution to the trade.  The absence of control on the importation of tea even for such a short period as three months would undoubtedly facilitate the dumping in this country of inferior grades of last season tea bought in London or elsewhere at reduced prices.  When placed on the Irish market such purchases could adversely affect in a serious manner sales of the stocks of Tea Importers, Limited and involve that company in substantial losses which would, of course, have to be borne by the Exchequer on foot of the guarantee by the Minister for Finance and eventually by the taxpayer.  This Bill obviates that risk.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that, in recommending this Bill to the favourable consideration of the House, I am asking no more than that the Seanad should agree to the present temporary arrangements for importing tea being continued until arrangements of a permanent nature can be brought into operation within a period of three months from 31st March, 1958.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister had a great opportunity of testing the benefits of free trade during this three months period.  He could have proved for himself in a pragmatic manner whether it was desirable to have control, in a Bill such as that with which he will be dealing later on, or whether it might be better to have free trade. <Col N="57" /> I feel that he stands indicted when he says that one of the reasons he wishes to bring in a Continuance Bill immediately is that people would drop cheap tea on the Irish market and that Tea Importers Limited would lose money. If Tea Importers Limited were able to do their business properly, they would have been able to buy tea more cheaply than the business people in London.  I think the argument is entirely fallacious and the suggestion that we should bring in this Bill in order to protect Tea Importers Limited against buying tea badly in England is an insult to our intelligence.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann deeply deplores the arrangements for the pricing of wheat of the 1958 crop as recently announced by the Government, and strongly recommends that the matter be reconsidered and that the price for the entire 1958 crop be not less than that for 1957.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to tell the House that this motion specifically directs the attention of the House to the price of wheat in 1958.  It does not lead on to any further year.  We freely admit that nobody can guarantee prices for long periods.  It is wise, however, when considering the price fixed by the Government and the arrangements made at the same time by the Government in respect of that pricing, to consider the whole lead up to the wheat situation at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to December, 1953, there was no such thing as a surplus of wheat envisaged by anybody.  The House will remember&mdash;I am not referring to the war period&mdash;the advertisements under the different Governments which appeared in various newspapers asking <Col N="58" /> us to grow more wheat.  When a Government or Government Department issues such an advertisement and takes such a step, it must of itself take responsibility for it.  Up to December, 1953, it was a fact that the opinion of the Department of Agriculture and all the political Parties was that there could not be a surplus of wheat in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In December, 1953&mdash;I state this for no political reason as it is now an accepted fact&mdash;the Government of the day asked its civil servants to produce the quantity of Irish wheat which we could consume in one year.  Taking into consideration the amount that could be included in the grist, the amount of flour consumed by the people and the percentage of flour taken from the wheat which was milled, the answer given to the Government was 300,000 tons.  The decision of the Government of that time was to aim at a harvest of 300,000 tons of wheat.</P>
    <P>Prior to December, 1953, the then Government and the Department of Agriculture must have seen a surplus of wheat looming up on the horizon when they set about the task of finding out what were the wheat requirements of the country.  It did so with the specific intention of so directing policy that the figure got would be 300,000 tons.  In the harvest that followed, there was a great surplus of wheat based on the figure of 300,000 tons.  In May of the following year, 1954, the Government changed.  The succeeding Government found themselves with a colossal surplus of wheat and, finding themselves in that situation, took a decision to lower the price.</P>
    <P>Following the succeeding harvest and notwithstanding the lowering of the price, there was sufficient wheat grown to feed the country.  It was evident that agriculture in Ireland had departed from the traditional line of processing much of our cereal products that we produced on the farms.  In other words, the walk-it-off the land policy had disappeared.  Many factors must be taken into account when we look for the reason for this.  Capital cost was one.  Nobody except the commercial bank, provided you had taken out administration in respect of your <Col N="59" /> farm, would help in the purchase of stock.  On the other hand, if you decreased the level of your stock farming and increased the level of wheat farming, then you might get on the &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; system a combine harvester at possibly one-sixth of its market value.  You could go, at spring&mdash;or winter, if you were sowing winter wheat&mdash;and avail of credit terms for fertilisers and seeds until the following harvest.  It was then seen by the Government of the day that there had been a very great change-over. There were losses in capital investment by farmers in combine harvesters and machinery for the production of grain.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat was increased and, even though it was not brought to its previous level, it went half-way. A line was taken by the then Opposition&mdash;the present Government&mdash;so that farmers were led to believe that, if they re-elected them to office, they would bring the wheat price to a figure such as 82/6.</P>
    <P>I shall not handle this motion in a political way.  I shall merely give a couple of quotations and then pass on from them.  I may give a couple of quotations later on.  I am not trying to score points but the quotations are very relevant.  They are made to prove that the then Opposition&mdash;even though there was a surplus of wheat in 1954 and that the Department of Agriculture knew it, their Government having taken a decision as late as December, 1953, that the requirements of the country amounted to 300,000 tons of dried wheat&mdash;led the farmers to believe that if they were re-elected to office, they would most certainly raise the price.</P>
    <P>My first quotation is from the <i>Sunday Press</i> of 23rd October, 1955&mdash; the harvest-time succeeding the drop in the price of wheat.  A personal interview was given by that very decent man, the late Deputy Thomas Walsh, a Minister for Agriculture.  The banner headline was: &ldquo;Farmers Count Losses in Millions...  Wheat, Beet, Potatoes.  Incentive Has Gone.&rdquo;  In the entire article given the late Mr. Walsh, who was shadow-Minister for <Col N="60" /> Agriculture of the day, there was no mention of stock farming, cattle, pigs or of anything but the production of cereal and cash crops for sale at harvest time.  Therefore, we may take it that the Opposition of the day was suggesting to the farmers that all they had to do was to put them back in office and they would increase the price.</P>
    <P>They were in office on the 4th May, 1957.  The acting-Minister for Agriculture was Deputy Aiken, now Minister for External Affairs.  I have here a quotation from the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of the 4th May, 1957, from the official page of the National Farmers' Association and from the report of the National Farmers' Association Committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister could not see his way to increasing the price of wheat.  At this stage, an increase, he stated, would not affect the amount sown.  He said, however, that he would examine how Government action in recent months had affected the prices of granulated compounds and agricultural chemicals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To wit, the acting-Minister there implied as late as the 4th May, 1957, after the last harvest's wheat had been sold and sowing was finished, that, but for the fact that an increase then would not increase the acreage, he would give that increase.  Does that, again, not show that the present Government were quite prepared to lead the farmers to believe and, in fact, did so, that all they had to do was to vote them back into office to gain a rapid increase in the price of cash corn crops?</P>
    <P>The farmers cannot and must not be expected to know the grain trade. They cannot and they must not be expected to be able to assess market trends and to know always what will happen one year, 18 months or two years later.  There is a very grave responsibility on any Minister and his Party, and there is a greater responsibility on the Minister for Agriculture and on his Department than on any other Minister, to lead the farmers towards the right road, to get them <Col N="61" /> on the right way so as to make sure that their economy and rotation is designed to bring them a greater profit irrespective of what political gain there may be for the Party which the Minister of the time represents.</P>
    <P>To give the Seanad an idea of what was happening during those years when the Party of which I am a member was telling the farmers that they must revert, in part at least, to the old policy of not selling all their grain crops for cash at harvest time, of not creating a glut and that they must increase their farm stock, the Opposition were saying: &ldquo;Put us back and we will give a greater price.&rdquo;  The tragedy is that the Opposition was believed.  As a result we had a drop of 19,300 in the number of in-calf heifers from January, 1957, to January, 1958.  During the same period we had a total drop of 34,200 in cattle.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition of the day had lived up to their responsibility of telling the farmers the truth about the grain trade, that they must now concentrate on a proper rotation, not on an over-production of grain crops for cash, but on the ordinary mixed farming which is a tradition in this country, then the farmers could now be said to be responsible for their dilemma of a decrease in the price of wheat as well as a surplus of wheat. However, the Opposition did not do so.  Therefore, it is charged with the sin of allowing the farmers to be led astray and it is also charged with the reduction in the numbers of cattle which I have already mentioned.  That reduction may seem small.  Remember, which I have already mentioned.  That reduction may seem small.  Remember, however, that with increased production from farms&mdash;improved farm techniques, better fertilisation&mdash;our cattle numbers should be moving up year by year.  The stock we can carry on the farms should be moving up. If our agriculture were suitably designed and bent toward the proper goal then our numbers of cattle would be increasing.  A decrease at this stage, where there is good farming techniques such as short-term ley, much better methods of feeding cattle in yards, and so on, is catastrophic and something we cannot accept.</P>
    <P>I will now address myself to the first <Col N="62" /> part of the motion which deals with the arrangement that was made and I should like to refer to the disposal of a surplus which, as stated by the Minister for Agriculture in the Dáil recently on the wheat motion, amounts to 95,000 tons.  In calculating the surplus, the Minister has taken into account a normal carry-over of 50,000 tons.  He has also stated on that wheat motion, and on various occasions in the past six or eight weeks, that he is accepting liability for the surplus at the moment and that the Government is putting up the money for it.  If there is a surplus, and if he is accepting liability for it, what is the point of carrying over 50,000 tons of wheat which is merely an assurance in a year when there might be a bad crop that you will not have a scarcity of wheat at harvest? At present, you are expecting at least a 10 per cent. increase in wheat.  If the Minister is prepared to dispose of the present surplus, it is unfair that this 50,000 tons next year will be placed on the backs of the farmers, if the present arrangement holds with regard to the price of wheat.  Secondly, the disposal of 400,000 tons at £26 a ton for compound milling, is, in my view, a price arrangement which does not leave the Government carrying the entire baby.</P>
    <P>I was looking for a parallel in imported feeding stuffs to this Irish wheat which will be used for animal feeding stuffs.  The best thing I could get, and in my view an exactly similar product, is what is known as German wheat middlings, for which import licences were granted over the last six months.  German wheat middlings are German black flour, flour produced from wheat at a very high extraction rate, and they are excellent feeding; they are as good as the Irish wheat which will be released and in fact they are milled, so that will obviate the necessity of milling.</P>
    <P>The Irish tradition, need I say, is that the price of feeding stuffs was always the world price.  That tradition was preserved by the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, in his two terms of office.  He always opened the ports as far as bran and pollard and feeding stuffs were concerned <Col N="63" /> and made the Irish product, even when bearing a subsidy, compare with the imported product.  I personally have bought these German middlings at as low as £22 a ton c.i.f.  Dublin in the last two months.  It is totally unfair that this figure of £26 a ton should be charged to the feeders of pigs and the feeders of other forms of live stock, when the import price of the comparable product is £22 a ton and the Minister for Agriculture has stated he is bearing the loss in respect of the surplus in this year.</P>
    <P>Lest anyone should jump to his feet to correct me, I want to say that in this £26 a ton, there is a figure of 20/- to 30/- &mdash;I quote the Minister's figure in the Dáil motion&mdash;for the haulage to the buyer's nearest railway station. Even still, the price is considerably more than the price for a good quality comparable product, ready milled, from abroad.  The Irish pig feeder is as entitled, when the Minister makes a price arrangement in regard to any product, to get his product from abroad, as his competitor is, on the overseas or British market or where-ever he has to sell the end product. Now, 15,000 to 20,000 tons of this surplus wheat is to be sold to flour millers at £26 a ton.  This arrangement was included in the statement that the extraction rate would be lowered by 8 per cent., that there would be an increase of a ½d. in the loaf, after the previous fixing of price, and that there would be an increase in the price of Irish bran and pollard of £1 a ton. Again the Minister has come out in public and has told the farmers&mdash;on whom all this eventually falls, no matter what arrangement he makes&mdash;that he will be responsible for the entire loss on the surplus wheat of this year.</P>
    <P>Again, I refer to the practice of the previous Minister, in seeing that the Irish feeder got his feeding stuffs at the same price as that at which they could be obtained on the world market and I want to say that in small lots, on licence&mdash;not yet in Dublin but arriving&mdash;there is Argentinian pollard at £19 15s. a ton and the Minister has arranged with the flour merchants to charge £23 10s. a ton for the Irish <Col N="64" /> pollard from this wheat&mdash;not, if I may correct myself, from this particular lot of wheat but from all the wheat the flour mills take.</P>
    <P>Prior to this, when the Minister made an arrangement with the flour millers, he was dealing with Exchequer moneys.  I think he was entitled at that stage not to give the exact details, but any arrangement he made with the millers would be, of course, subject to parliamentary question, if any Deputy thought fit to address one to him.  But in this case the matter is one which affects the price of wheat to the farmers and the price of pollard and the price of feeding stuffs are prices which also affect the farmers, and he is dealing exclusively, in the future, in wheat, with the farmer's money.</P>
    <P>I feel it is incumbent upon him, or whoever replies to the motion to-night, to give the exact nature of the arrangement with the flour millers whereby they get 15,000 to 20,000 tons of wheat at £26 a ton, they lower the extraction rate by 8 per cent., increase the price of flour by 4/6 a sack or a ½d. a loaf and increase the price of bran and pollard to a figure that now stands as much as £3 10s. a ton above the price of the imported product at a time when the pig feeders of this country are cutting sows' throats as quickly as they can get at them.</P>
    <P>There is also an odd discrepancy in figures to which I would like to draw attention.  It is in the Taoiseach's contribution to the wheat debate.  I quote the Dáil Debates Volume 165, No. 6, column 868:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Minister mentioned that we would lose up to £20 a ton by exporting it whereas, the other way, we would be losing something about £12 a ton.  However, we had to meet the bill and, so, this £1,250,000 will be required.  We could not continue that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet, when I scrutinise the Book of Estimates, I find that the figure included in the book is £800,000.  There is a discrepancy there of £450,000 and I would wish that whoever replies to-night to this debate should be armed with the explanation.  Is it a fact that the Taoiseach, when computing these <Col N="65" /> figures, was thinking of the 50,000 tons which, in my view, the Minister for Agriculture and his Department have placed on the farmers' backs and which will reduce the price of their wheat next year if the present arrangement stays.  If you compute the loss not on the 95,000 tons surplus wheat, but on 145,000 tons you get a figure of approximately £1,250,000.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke in Enniscorthy and he saw fit to refer to wheat.  It may seem a small thing, but I quote from the <i>Irish Press</i> of March 10th, page 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The excess in the last couple of years in the output of wheat beyond the amount required for the production of bread and domestic flour has presented us with special difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the Taoiseach is a very able politician and he is very good at choosing his words.  I want to draw attention to the fact that the surplus of wheat which existed in 1954 was in fact of greater magnitude and a more serious type of surplus, than the surplus of wheat which this Government had to meet in this year.  I give the figures for the deliveries to mill in 1953 and in 1954, in round figures.  In 1953, wheat deliveries to the mills were 2,600,000 tons; in 1954, 3,250,000 tons; in 1956, 2,781,000 tons; in 1957, 3,250,000 tons.  The only difference between the wheat in 1954 and the wheat in 1957 was that, in 1954, the quality of Irish wheat was such that it was found, with the milling techniques prevalent at that time, that you could not include as much of it as you could include at the present time.  I want to state from my experience as a person in the grain trade that the wheat produced from last year's harvest now in store is surprisingly good.  The quality of the wheat in store for milling is exceedingly high and the Government could, if it wished, raise the inclusion figure above 79 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in Enniscorthy&mdash;he was referring to the Fine Gael attitude to wheat&mdash;said: &ldquo;To the townspeople they said, it meant dearer and poorer bread, but at present, if it suited their book, they would be telling the townspeople that it meant an addition of <Col N="66" /> something like £10 a ton for wheat to the mills with consequent increases in the price of bread.&rdquo;  My approach is not too hidebound.  I feel that the Minister, faced with the problem, not of the magnitude of the problem of 1954, because the quality is so much better, did not do enough, and if he behaved in the manner I now suggest &mdash;he and the Taoiseach have consistently said that no one suggested any way out of this difficulty but I am going to suggest one now&mdash;he would find himself enabled, with practically the same money, to pay the same price for wheat as last year.  He would thus give the farmer the opportunity to reset his sails and to decide that he was told lies in 1954, 1955 and 1956 by the Opposition and told the truth by the Government, and that he must proceed to reorientate his farming and aim at having one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough so as not to produce continuous surpluses but to gain the most profit for himself.</P>
    <P>The figure for consumption of wheat is 300,000 tons.  Last year, we produced 370,000 tons and in the meantime surpluses had become evident.  Samples of wheat were handed to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for investigation and that body has produced findings that an all-Irish loaf is possible.  I am not foolish enough to think that any tests on relatively small quantities of wheat are sufficient for the Government to take a decision upon.  But the Government has taken no decision on that.  The biggest test that was taken so far was a two months test in the Curragh camp with an all-Irish loaf produced at 80 per cent. extraction of wheat.  To my knowledge, the bread was excellent.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Government that they should follow the example of a very successful firm in this country when it wants to test new barleys, namely Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, who in the last few years have themselves done brewing and malting tests on units of 5,000 barrels of barley.  I suggest that the Minister has the responsibility of setting up milling and baking tests on 20,000 barrels on a loaf of all Irish wheat or a 95 per cent. <Col N="67" /> Irish wheat.  If he does that, he will at least have the farmers on his side. They will see that he is doing something for them.  The present situation is that he has thrown the situation to them like a bone to a dog and they can chew on it if they like or they can walk away from it.  That is not of any value to a farmer who has been consistently told that the way to get increased prices for wheat and the way to allow himself to have a higher amount of corn crops for cash sale in his rotation was to vote Fianna Fáil back into office and to vote the other Government out.</P>
    <P>If the Government or the Minister are to accept their moral responsibilities, they must give some rock to the farmer to which he can cling.  I suggest that if the Minister would now set up this 20,000 barrels milling test, he would find that he could include 95 per cent.  Irish wheat from this harvest in the grist and if he did, he would be enabled to use 385,000 tons of Irish wheat.  I am in a position to say that the National Farmers' Association have also decided that the deliveries of wheat to the mills next harvest will be in the region of 400,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Let us say that if the quota was fixed at 380,000 tons, there would be two results.  There would be a drop of 3/- approximately per barrel in the price paid to the farmer for wheat.  I would suggest that the Minister could pay that from the Exchequer rather than have to pay further large subsidies on surplus wheat for feeding stuffs.  As well as that, there would be some increase in the price of the loaf, but the increase would be very small. As far as I can make out, it would be in the nature of ¾d. on a 4 lb. loaf, less than ½d. on the ordinary 2 lb. loaf.</P>
    <P>The farmers are entitled to provide as much wheat as possible for Irish consumption.  If they are in a position that they have to pay prices for protected goods produced in Irish industries, then they must be entitled to the whole of the Irish market.  I believe that the Minister would be perfectly enabled by the Government, if he put that question to them, to raise the <Col N="68" /> figure to 380,000 tons, to bear the difference of 3/- a barrel himself and the suggested increase of less than ½d. in the price of the 2 lb. loaf.</P>
    <P>All that is not sufficient.  The present Government, when in opposition, led the farmers astray.  The Acting Minister for Agriculture on May 4 this year implied that there was still a ready market for all the wheat that could be grown.  Decent hard-working farmers living down the lanes, perhaps not buying daily papers every day of the week, have been led astray.  I am not making that as a political point; I am merely making it as a statement of fact.  The Minister must now face up to his moral responsibility and say to them: &ldquo;Look, here is the situation; here is what I will do for you.&rdquo;  Following that, he must say to them:&mdash;&ldquo;Here is your agricultural policy for the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the long term, I would suggest a few things to the Minister.  One of them would be a complete reversion to the policy announced by the ex-Taoiseach in October, 1956.  I would like to remind the House that on that day a scheme was announced for giving small loans to small farmers for the purchase of stock.  That was the result of the obvious situation in which, if things proceeded as they were going, the farmers would produce too much grain and cash crops.  That would mean that more oats and barley could be produced on the farm fed to the cattle and walked off the lands.</P>
    <P>At the present moment, the farmer has bought his combine harvester and his implements.  He has gone into wheat growing in a big way and he has used the capital which he got from selling his cattle to buy this new machinery and these implements.  He cannot suddenly change now.  The only way he can change is if capital is provided and injected into the agricultural economy to provide him with enough money, not to sell the heifer, but to mate her and to sell the calf, not to reduce the number of cattle on his holding, but to increase it and to wait two and a half years to make the profit.  He will need to wait two and a half years to sell a calf, to share in the first fruits of a change in his farming policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> What has been announced for farmers in 1954 and 1955 is responsible for their dilemma in 1957 and, from 1957, there must be a new starting-off point.  The basis of that new start must be an increase in the stock on the farms of this country.  I suggest to the Minister he should advise the Government that, as well as having national loans, they should try to float a national agricultural loan and then bring the people of Ireland to believe that, if there is not investment in agriculture, then, without doubt, the whole country is doomed and its economy must stagnate.  If the Government did that, they should also make it quite clear that those loans would be given to the farmers only in fluid capital, and that in them there would be some future for the farmers and some starting-off point at which they can emerge from their present unfortunate position.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I have endeavoured not to handle this motion in a political way.  I have endeavoured to show that there are various aspects of the present price arrangement for wheat which require specific and explicit explanation.  I hope the Minister does not regard it as a political motion.  I should like him to say what he thinks of the present dilemma in which the wheat farmers find themselves.  Does he accept responsibility for the statements made by former Cabinet Ministers in 1955, 1956 and 1957?  I know he did not say much, but other members of his Party did, and I suppose every member of the Party must be responsible for the deeds of everybody else in it.  Is he now prepared to produce a proper agricultural policy for this country and even though such a policy cannot stand forth as a shining light and as something which will bring Cadillacs to farmers in 18 months, it will be a sound basis on which they can proceed, not towards surpluses, not towards goals dictated by political considerations, but towards a sound goal on which they can build their future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion up to a point, but I do not support it in full because I am not in favour of the present system in connection with the price of wheat.  I think it is all wrong as it stands to-day.  To listen to the previous Senator speaking, one would think that this was the richest country in the world.  He spoke about combine harvesters and so on.  I would like to ask the Senator where could one use a combine harvester in my county?  The present system is altogether wrong for the reason that you have a certain number of unscrupulous people, people who would not know the difference between a blade of wheat and a blade of oats, who took conacre at abnormal prices.  People who gave the conacre thought they were getting an abnormal price, but, in fact, they were not, because when these gentlemen ranchers had finished with it, the land would hardly grow grass.</P>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the Minister, so far as the growing of wheat is concerned. My idea is that we should have a system of wheat growing in this country.  My heart goes out to the genuine farmer who grows so much wheat each year, to the farmer who grew it before there was any compulsion. These men looked after their land and put fertility back into it.  We were blessed with the possession of thousands of acres of land, a bank of fertility, but now a certain clique have been utilising that land to make themselves rich.  They may make the country richer for a time, but they will eventually make it poorer, because they are leaving the land poorer after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the small farmer who has always done an honest day's work, given employment to his own family and in North County Dublin, and in some portions of Meath, has employed three or four workers constantly the whole year around.  The employment which those other people have given, with a tractor in the spring and a combine harvester in the autumn is not worth counting.  As compared with them, the practical farmer who grows so much wheat and oats, who has so many <Col N="71" /> dairy cows and who puts fertility back into the land should get special consideration.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that if there is to be a reduction in the price of wheat, it should be made on a quota system which would enable the farmers who grow ten or 12 acres of wheat to get the full price for it.  Is it not too bad that, under the Minister's present method, they get the price up to a certain point, but when that point is reached, the price is reduced?  Under that system, the farmer in Kilkenny, North County Dublin and Meath who always grows wheat is the person who suffers.  He will not be able to get his wheat in as quickly as the fellows with the combine harvesters.</P>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with the Senator in what he has said&mdash;that we should have an all-Irish loaf.  Were it impossible to get wheat from foreign countries, we would have to do with an all-Irish loaf, and I believe the people would be very glad to get that, but the position is that we can get in foreign wheat at the present time.  I am in full agreement with the idea of an all-Irish loaf, if possible.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to congratulate the Minister for stepping in to prevent this wholesale taking of conacre at prices the ordinary farmer could not afford, abnormal prices which these unscrupulous people are giving for the rich lands of this country in order to get rich quick.  It is too bad that the people amongst whom I was reared, good practical Irish people who served Ireland and were willing to do their best for it, have to subsidise those fellows for getting away with the wealth of the country.  It is not once that they are subsidised, but twice. They are subsidised by the Government and subsidised again because of the steaming of the fertility out of the soil of the country, which should be left to the ordinary practical farmers who always gave employment and were honest and had the interests of the country at heart.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I feel disappointed because, if the price of wheat is going down, the price of the <Col N="72" /> loaf is not going down correspondingly. These things should go with each other.  We are all aware that bread is now at a price which was never approached before in this country, and it is just too bad that we have to lose so much money on the growing of wheat.  Years ago, everybody was out for the growing of wheat, and is it the position now that we have not the population for it?  Surely it could not be possible that our population has gone down so much in a quarter of a century, since we were all advocating the growing of wheat.  I feel that the cause of the situation is these persons who would not know the difference be-between a blade of oats, a blade of barley and a blade of grass.  Their only interest is the amount of money they can take from the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the price of wheat should be on a quota basis, that the man who has grown it consistently for the last ten or 15 or 25 years should get the full price for his wheat.</P>
    <P>I would give one advice to the Senator who has spoken&mdash;do not take too much heed of what this Minister said at one time or another Minister said at another time.  The position now is that the country is more or less at the crossroads and we should all combine and do our best to help one another.  It does not matter what Minister or Deputy or Senator may say it, if a thing is for the good of the country, we should support it.  It is time we forgot what one side or another said in election promises. Many people have made queer promises at election time which they did not fulfil.  Some of ourselves were foolish enough to go on to platforms and make promises that if the Party we favoured got in, certain things would be done. Fortunately or unfortunately, they did not always get in, so you cannot blame us too much.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the farmers in Kilkenny, Carlow, North Dublin and all those other places who have consistently grown wheat should continue to grow it, but the gentlemen who are so anxious for conacre should go in and grow potatoes, which are retailing at 3/6 a stone here in Dublin.  I can guarantee <Col N="73" /> that if one of them were compelled to grow potatoes and to depend upon the growing of potatoes, he would die from hunger within 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. J.M. Sheridan Mr. J.M. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take part in many of the debates in this House, but I am almost provoked into taking part in this debate by the very old saying: &ldquo;Touch my pocket, touch my heart.&rdquo;  Being a farmer myself, and growing wheat rather extensively, I consider that the price of wheat laid down by the Minister this year is unjust, and I say that not in any political sense.  I think that the price is uneconomic, especially now because of the increased cost of production.  Seed wheat is costing 5/- per barrel more, machinery parts are dearer, wages have also gone up, and some types of fertiliser are slightly dearer.  Wheat is an expensive crop to grow.  I am sure everyone knows that growing wheat in Ireland is not like growing coffee in Africa where you do it once and it goes on for 15 years.  The farmer here cannot keep growing wheat year after year on the same land.  He must have an intermediary crop if he is to be fair to his land and to himself.</P>
      <P>You can grow wheat one year, but if you are growing it extensively, you are forced to grow some catch crop such as rape or kale, or some other green crop. I am merely trying to point out that if the farmer is fair to himself and to his land, he must keep up the fertility of his land and can only get two years' wheat crop in three years.  In 1956, the wheat acreage was 339,600.  In 1957, it was 395,400.  Therefore, we had an increase of 55,800 acres or 16.4 per cent. In the yield, which we have obtained in recent years, 330,000 acres would produce sufficient wheat for our food requirements and for seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, the price laid down by the Minister came very late this year.  It came at a time when a lot of the land for wheat was ploughed and a lot of winter wheat was sown.  This would result in an increased acreage.  I would direct the minds of Senators back to the harvest of 1957.  The farmers had the most trying time in their experience &mdash;appalling weather conditions, sprouting wheat, and one thing worse than <Col N="74" /> another.  And the worst was to come when they went to the millers with their wheat, for they were turned back time and time again.  The daily papers published photographs showing queues of lorries some of which went from the mills back to the farms as often as three times.  Some wheat was left in the fields in a deplorable condition and when it reached the mills, the price was anything but fancy.  If that was the case in 1957, the outlook is more than gloomy indeed for 1958, with more wheat grown and the price worse.</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Senator will agree that money spent on wheat or any national product is money well spent.  It is hard to expect the farmer to take a decrease in price or a lower standard of living when increases in price are being sought all round by every section of the community.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Tunney, I do not approve of a man going out and growing conacre wheat and leaving the land in a poor state of fertility.  There is an old poem which is known to most members of the Seanad in which it is stated that the farmer has to feed everyone.  I think the farmer is the last man upon whom the Minister should use the axe and I would ask him to reconsider his decision and give the farmers fair play by restoring last year's price.  This year has been a very trying one for the farmer.  He has been hit in more directions than one.  Pig prices have gone down very low.  I am not blaming the Minister for that.  The small farmers are getting it very hard also.  I would ask the Minister to be good enough to reconsider his decision and give the farmers last year's price at least.  I am sure he will be good enough to do that.</P>

      <P>Most of us here must agree that this is a blatantly political motion, inspired by the Fine Gael Party.  Some weeks ago, a similar motion was put down in the other <Col N="75" /> House, in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Eireann condemns the Government for their repudiation of the specific undertaking given to wheat growers during the election campaign, as set out in their official election literature, that only an immediate Government decision to restore the 1954 price of 82/6d. per barrel could save Irish wheat-growing from disaster.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Members of Seanad Eireann will notice how the Fine Gael Party has drawn in its horns considerably since it put down its motion in Dáil Eireann.  The terms of that motion are to the effect that the Fianna Fáil Party, in its official literature in the general election campaign 12 months ago, gave the people a specific guarantee that it would increase the price per barrel of wheat to 82/6d.  The terms of that motion were to indict the Fianna Fáil Government on the basis of the promise which the signatories to this motion said was made by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Anybody who peruses the debate, as reported in Volume 165, No. 6 of 27th February, 1958, will see that the Fine Gael speakers in that debate were singularly unable to point to one item of election literature or one specific promise from which it could be construed that a guarantee as to the price of wheat was made by a single Fianna Fáil speaker.  That is the singular thing which emerges from that debate.</P>
      <P>The terms of the motion before the Seanad now are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann deeply deplores the arrangements for the pricing of wheat of the 1958 crop as recently announced by the Government, and strongly recommends that the matter be reconsidered and that the price for the entire 1958 crop be not less than that for 1957.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no mention at all there of a promise.  There is no mention of the guarantee which was supposed to be given by the Fianna Fáil Party before the last general election.  In Dáil Eireann, they set out to prove that such a promise was made.  Right through that debate, there was a <Col N="76" /> singular lack of evidence to sustain the point.  They now come into Seanad Eireann and draw in their horns and present the House with a motion milder and weaker.  They do not now imply that any promise was made.  We can take it that they now agree with us that no promise was made by Fianna Fáil in contesting the last election&mdash; that no such promise was made either in the official election literature or by any Fianna Fáil speaker in the election campaign.</P>

      <P>A lot of propaganda is being made.  It is being alleged that we are an anti-farming Party at the moment and an anti-rural Party.  That particular point, made by some Fine Gael speakers, can be discounted very easily by a perusal of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> as published in 1957.  The House will find set out therein on page 99 the expenditure of the Department of Agriculture in each of the past five years.  In 1953, the net expenditure of the Department of Agriculture was £7,042,142; in 1954, it was £4,440,128; in 1955, it was £7,161,498; in 1956 it was £7,581,960.  In 1957, taking into consideration the recent additional Estimates, the expenditure of the Department of Agriculture in the past year will be in the region of £14,000,000. That, taking the recent additional Estimates which have had to be made in the case of subsidies on butter and bacon, will show that the total expenditure of the Department of Agriculture in the past 12 months will have been in the region of £14,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1956, it was £7,500,000; in 1955, it was £7,000,000.  The expenditure in the coming year will be in or about £12,000,000 to £14,000,000.  I also think that a simple perusal of those figures will show that more money has been <Col N="77" /> spent by the Fianna Fáil Government in the past 12 months on agriculture than was spent in the previous five years and that more money will be spent in the coming year than in the past five years.  The figure for agricultural services in 1957 was the highest since the formation of the State.  A further perusal of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> will show a similar picture in regard to county committees of agriculture.</P>

      <P>The figures in respect of expenditure of county committees of agriculture for the past five years show a similar pattern.  In 1953, the figure was roughly £421,000; in 1954 £495,000; in 1955, £484,000; and in 1956, £503,000.  In 1957, £550,000 was spent by all the county committees of agriculture in Ireland on encouraging agricultural education, in providing agricultural advisory services and the other services which facilitate agriculture provided by our county committees of agriculture.  The highest sum ever spent by our county committees of agriculture since the formation of the State was spent last year upon encouraging agricultural services.  They are the two prongs of agricultural development in this country.</P>
      <P>Those two State-encouraged organisations have spent more money in the past 12 months on agricultural services than was ever spent since the formation of the State.  Those figures are proof positive in themselves of the stupidity of this blatantly political motion which is a waste of the time of the Seanad and is put forward here only to gain political kudos.</P>
      <P>It might be no harm to go back a little on the history of wheat-growing in this country.  It might be no harm to refer to the year 1932.  I am a young man and I had no connection with the Fianna Fáil Party of that time.</P>

      <P>The history of the development of Irish politics since fully vindicates the attitude taken by the <Col N="78" /> Fianna Fáil Government which took office in 1932.  In that year, 20,000 acres of Irish wheat were grown.  In 1932, not enough wheat was grown in this country to feed us for a fortnight.  We made it one of the first principles of our policy to make ourselves as self-sufficient as possible and as practicable in regard to wheat.  We proved that that policy of self-sufficiency was right during the war when we were able to rely on our own wheat to supply the flour for our bread.  The experience of the emergency period fully justified that major policy decision of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1932.</P>
      <P>I have no need, and I do not intend, to go over the various matters in the 1930s and 1940s about our wheat policy. It is the same as happened with our industrialisation policy.  There were the same sneers and jeers as we built our industries at that time as were given to our efforts in regard to wheat.  However, we survived the sneers and jeers such as the one that a person would not be found dead in an acre of Irish wheat&mdash;a statement which was made by a one-time Minister for Agriculture who is now in the Fine Gael Opposition in the Dáil.  The position now is that we are approaching self-sufficiency in respect of wheat.</P>

      <P>Then it was decided that we could supply two-thirds of our wheat resources for flour from about 300,000 tons of wheat.  That was the target aimed at in 1954.  A guaranteed price was given and we set out to <Col N="79" /> achieve that target of 300,000 tons.  To-day, those 300,000 tons can almost be produced from 300,000 acres.  It was never the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party, or, I think, of any Government in this State that we should have a surplus of wheat which would have to be disposed of either for feeding compounds at home or in the form of exports, dumping abroad, at a loss to the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>The target of 300,000 tons has been achieved and exceeded.  The position now is that the Minister for Agriculture has decided that three-quarters of our flour needs will be met from Irish wheat and that that amount can be supplied by 300,000 tons of wheat.  That is the plan for the coming year.  However, last year, in addition to the wheat that was harvested and to the carry-over of wheat, there were about 445,000 tons on hands.  Some of that has been disposed of.  However, there is a net problem of 95,000 tons to be disposed of, the Minister for Agriculture sees fit to dispose of it with as little loss as possible to the Irish taxpayer.  The loss has been minimised to £1,250,000.  That is considerable, but it is what it will cost to dispose of the 95,000 tons.</P>
      <P>That is the net problem facing a Government which has to take all sections of the community into account in making a policy decision&mdash;farmers, trade unionists, shopkeepers, industrialists and so on.  The net problem is that we now have an excess of 95,000 tons of wheat which must be disposed of either as feeding compounds at home or exports, dumping abroad, but which will cost the taxpayer £1,250,000.  That cannot continue. In the U.S.A. in recent years, they have actually been subsidising a soil bank in an effort to get farmers to move out of tillage and into grass.  It was never the intention of our Party to do that.  Our only ambition was to step-up the measly 20,000 acres in 1932. We have stepped that up now to the point at which 300,000 tons can be grown in the current year to supply three-fourths of our needs.  The remaining 25 per cent. has to be imported for the time being&mdash;but only for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> The mover of the motion referred to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, which is actively perusing the question of an all-Irish loaf. We are all agreed that that is desirable. Instead of utilising only 75 per cent.  Irish wheat we shall be utilising 100 per cent.  Irish wheat in the making of our loaves.  That is the ultimate objective and I do not think there can be any conflict about it.  Experiments are going on at the Curragh in the production of that loaf for the Army. There are problems there.  The millers will have to adjust their milling techniques and, possibly, their machinery.  I am certain that when we leave office in four years' time, we shall have achieved an all-Irish wheat loaf.  It cannot be done over-night, but it is well to know that the institute is working on it and that experiments are being carried out.  We shall work towards it.</P>
    <P>In 1954, it was estimated that two-thirds of the flour for an Irish loaf could be milled from Irish wheat.  In 1958, the proportion is three-fourths. We hope that, by 1962, it will be 100 per cent.  In the meantime, we must face the problem that we have a surplus of 95,000 tons of wheat on hands from last year which must be disposed of and we must guard against a similar or a greater surplus in the coming year which might cost the country up to two or three million pounds.  I would remind the farming community that they are taxpayers as well.  We would hear many complaints from Senators Donegan and L'Estrange&mdash;and quite another story&mdash;if the prices of cigarettes, beer, and so forth, went up.  That would be the net effect of imposing a greater burden on the Irish taxpayer in the way of subsidising the disposal of wheat over and above that which is required. That fact will have to be faced.</P>
    <P>The thing to remember in any policy decision by a Government is that, in a democracy, a Government is elected not to take a sectional stand, not to pay heed to what the farming section may say or to what the trade union section may say or to what the property-owning section may say, but to put into operation policies which benefit the national well-being as a whole.  No Government would be worth its salt if <Col N="81" /> it gave in to any particular pressures or any particular directions.  However, we are glad to say that, in the present instance, the National Farmers' Association have shown themselves to be a responsible organisation.  They have come in with our Minister for Agriculture and hammered out a solution in the form of a married price arrangement. That means that, if we do not have a surplus, we shall have the same price this coming harvest as the last harvest, but, if there is an undesirable surplus, the price will be toned down by marrying the price with the economic price on the world market. I am certain the reduction will not be more than from 4/- to 6/-, probably, per barrel.  That is only theorising now.</P>
    <P>The decision to adopt the married price arrangement was taken after full consultation between the Minister for Agriculture and the representatives of the National Farmers' Association. There was very full consultation and eventually they agreed on the married price arrangement as being the most equitable.  I examined other arrangements. I have heard others trotted out here to-night&mdash;the contract system adopted by the beet growers and the malting barley growers of Messrs. Guinness.  The contract system appears very attractive, to limit the acreage to the needs of the home market and grow only so much, each farmer being rationed to a limited acreage.  That appears attractive in theory, but the result would be a whole army of inspectors, as the Department would have to send them out to see that the ration was observed on the wheat acreage of each individual farmer.</P>
    <P>I have heard another solution offered which appeared all right at first view, that is, that for the first 50 barrels of wheat the full price be given, as the small farmer would benefit by the full price under that arrangement.  While that is grand in theory, there is the difficulty in administering it.  I do not have to remind Senators that the scope for fraud in such arrangements is limitless, as there can be two or three people acting as a cover for one man.</P>
    <P>I personally think that one rather <Col N="82" /> simple remedy might be considered.  I do not know whether it has been brought to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture before.  I can see obvious difficulties in it also.  It is this &mdash;an absolute prohibition, a Government Order prohibiting conacre wheat growing.  I can see obvious difficulties. I can see that a man could take conacre in the name of the man who owned the property, but I do not think that it would require great investigation to deal with that.  If the Garda Síochána were alerted, a simple Government Order prohibiting conacre wheat growing could be administered and I press it on the Minister for Agriculture to consider it.  It is a very simple and very effective remedy and it could be done by a Government Order in the morning; and if the Garda Síochána were given instructions I think it would cut out a lot of this undesirable conacre wheat growing.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is undesirable. I know conacre in my country taken on two- and three-year lettings by men who grow wheat on it for two or three successive years; and they get out of it then.  Undoubtedly the heart has been taken out of that land and it is an undesirable system.  I do not know whether this prohibition could be enforced, but I recommend it as a possible remedy for that undesirable type of farming.  I do not mind the big rancher or the farmer who owns his land growing wheat on it, because he will have an interest in replacing it with proper manures. Conacre wheat growing is a menace and might be curtailed by some such Government Order.</P>
    <P>However, these are only variations on the theme, which is this: How could the Government get down to the problem of reducing the wheat acreage so as not to have this undesirable surplus which had to be dumped abroad or had to be sold at a loss on the home market?  The married price arrangement was eventually worked out and arrived at after full consideration between the Minister for Agriculture and the National Farmers' Association. That fact cannot be pressed home too often and it is the simple truth of the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> In fact, further to that, a council will meet next summer, next July, and I take it that on that council there will be representatives from the National Farmers' Association and from the Department.  That council, on which the farmers' interests will be fully represented, will decide or plan the wheat acreage.  They will decide on the acreage and on the output; they will decide how much that output is over and above the home requirements and will arrive at a price.  I can think of no more equitable or more fair way of doing it.  I would like to emphasise that.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the National Farmers' Association for coming in with the Department of Agriculture on this price arrangement in regard to wheat and I would compliment them on their intelligence and foresight.  I should like to deplore the antics of Fine Gael Deputies and Senators who seek to make political capital out of a very serious national issue, which the Department and the National Farmers' Association have overcome by a very successful price-arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we an agreed one or have we an imposed one?  During the debate that went on that year, the then Minister for Agriculture produced a minute which was on the files of the Department showing that his predecessor in office said that about 300,000 tons of wheat would be all that would be required.  When the Minister mentioned that, he was taken very grossly to task about it.  I believe we ought to have a policy to grow the amount of wheat that we require in this country, but we ought not for some years previously to convey to the people that if you change the Government, you can get whatever price you like for a larger <Col N="85" /> quantity of wheat.  I want to hear less about that in future.</P>
      <P>I believe our wheat quota should be based on the total tillage in a holding. The reason I suggest that is that if a man has, say, 24 acres of tillage, he would be able, with good husbandry, to grow each year about eight acres of wheat.  He would be able to grow sufficient roots and beet and other crops and would keep the land in good heart, and would also be able to lay down short-term leas and bring the land back into heart.  These would be farmers who would be genuinely engaged in good husbandry and that would be far better than trying to limit people because they were conacre holders.</P>
      <P>I agree in large measure in that respect with what Senator Lenihan said.  The Minister knows, as he comes from a county with a number of small-holders, that it would be easy to have some way of getting over that.  However, one could see who was the rated occupier of a holding and see what tillage he had on the farm and his quotas could be assessed in 15 minutes by the officers of the county committee of agriculture, an authority which is to be given more power very shortly.  I believe they could deal with it.</P>
      <P>I object to the reduction at the moment because the people were led astray about it.  I would much prefer the Government to have said: &ldquo;We will pay a fair price for wheat, but we will limit the acreage&rdquo;.  I believe what they should have done was to pay last year's price for wheat this year and next year, base it on the total tillage of each holding, rather than let the farmers proceed with arrangements to grow wheat and then reduce the price in the way it was done.  I hope for the future that will not be done.  I know that the Government cannot grow wheat for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan said that you can bring in black wheat from Germany for feeding purposes far cheaper than you can get the feeding here.  If the rest of our exports are going to succeed like poultry, eggs and bacon, we will have to get feeding at more economic levels.  I believe that the Government <Col N="86" /> will have to set themselves to this task. We are criticising them and we are right in criticising them for leading the farmers astray for the past two or three years.  The records of this House show that they have led the farmers to believe that if they changed the Government, they could grow all the wheat they liked and that they would get an increased price for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely intervene in this debate to say something about those who have been referred to as conacre men.  It may be that Senator Tunney and Senator Lenihan are acquainted only with business people who can keep hundreds of acres of land and can have their combines and tractors in order to rob the land of its fertility.  My experience in relation to the conacre system, and the people who go in for it, is that the growing of wheat under this system is merely a reflection of the shortage of land, the general land hunger.</P>
      <P>There are always the widows who are left with young children who cannot till the land as they would wish it to be tilled.  They must let the land in conacre, if they are to live.  There are also the aged and the people who are not very adept farmers and who prefer to let the land on the conacre system.  On the other hand, I know that there are large families where there are quite a number of farmers' sons who do not want to emigrate and who see in wheat growing a profitable livelihood.  I think it would be very wrong if any action was taken against that sort of person who has taken, at great risk, land on the conacre system and who is growing wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that perhaps some people think it follows that because there are those who are growing wheat on the conacre system and who are able to make profit out of it, the price of wheat must be profitable.  It is by reason of the big turnover that a man is able to make a profit and able to make a fairly good thing out of it.  It is in the same way as some small shops where, if there is a good turnover and a quick turnover, the shopkeeper is able to make more profit.  It would be a very bad thing for farmers' sons if any action were taken to prohibit them <Col N="87" /> from trying to make a livelihood in their own country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the motion, the only thing I have to say is that it need never have been put down, any more than the motion in the Dáil need have been put down.  The Seanad deploring the arrangements is merely an echo of the wail that has gone up since the new price of wheat has been announced. It merely sets the seal on the general disquiet that has arisen. The thing that disturbs me, as I think it must disturb most people, is that the farmers feel that there is no continuity in agricultural policy.  They have the uncertainty of the weather to contend with, which comes from God, and now they have the uncertainty of changes in political arrangements to contend with.  It is certainly making life very difficult for them.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that when in future there are appeals to the farmers for greater production they will think twice about what they will do.  That seems to me to be the greatest damage done in relation to the price of wheat &mdash;that farmers, when urged to increase production from the land, will not take any heed of what is said to them and if they do not and if the general economy suffers, it will be very difficult to leave the blame at the door of the farmers.</P>

      <P>When I first saw Senator Donegan's name down as mover of this motion, I wondered why he allowed his name to go down.  On listening to him, one must admit that he himself was convinced that he had a weak case.  He himself knew that the Minister in fixing the price of wheat did the best he could in an awkward situation.  After listening to Senator Donegan, one must admit that he had not his heart in this motion.  If one continued to listen to him, one wondered whether he advocated an increase in the price of wheat for human consumption or an increase in the price of offals for feeding stuffs.  As yet, I do not know what Senator Donegan meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be serious about the whole situation.  Let us ask how did the <Col N="88" /> Minister arrive at the price of wheat for this year?  Did he just, as a previous Minister did not so long ago, fix the price without consultation with any agricultural body?  He did not.  He called together an advisory body of agriculturists with a big representation from the National Farmers' Association and they themselves suggested to him the possible steps which he should take to remedy this situation that developed in the creation of a surplus of wheat last year.  Senator Donegan is aware that the National Farmers' Association suggested a marrying of the two prices, the price of wheat for human consumption and the price of wheat and offals for stock foods.  It was the National Farmers' Association which agreed to these terms and their members who were present were responsible wheat producers and were responsible farmers down through the years who produced wheat and beet and other crops.</P>
    <P>Would they not know what suited the practical farmer in the country or were they just talking through their hats?  They knew what they were talking about and they knew the situation which must be overcome and they were determined to lead the farmers into the position where they would be determined to overcome that situation. What has happened since then?  It is to be regretted that the National Farmers' Association allowed some of their members to repudiate the agreement their members made in that advisory committee.  We hope that the National Farmers' Association will not be allowed to wreck itself as other farming organisations allowed themselves to be, by such motions planned solely for political propaganda.  I am sure the National Farmers' Association will prove themselves bigger than to allow such a thing to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister was advised by these representatives and went a long way to meet their wishes.  As a small farmer in the West of Ireland, I regret that the Minister did not see his way to increase the price of wheat or to maintain it at last year's price, but there is an old story which we all learned when we were going to school: &ldquo;Old Mother Hubbard went to the <Col N="89" /> cupboard to fetch her poor doggie a bone, but when she went there the cupboard was bare, and so the poor doggie got none.&rdquo;  We know the Minister would be anxious to fetch the doggie a bone, to give the wheat producers the maximum price possible, but he found the cupboard was bare.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan knows very well who was responsible for leaving the cupboard bare.  Why do they not let the people know what the position is? The farmers are content to produce wheat at the prices fixed at the moment.  There are some gibes at that statement, but we remember a time not so long ago when the whole future of this country, both politically and economically, depended on whether the farmers were prepared to produce sufficient wheat to keep the country alive.</P>
    <P>We were told that land in certain areas in the Midlands, and on into Dublin, was not fit to grow wheat and that it could not grow wheat.  What happened then?  The Minister for Agriculture at that time, in certain cases, had to make some people do their duty so that the people who had no land, the people in the cities, got sufficient bread and wheat.</P>

      <P>When the nation demanded it, it was stated that the rich land of the midlands, of West-meath, could not produce wheat.  Now we find that not only can it produce wheat, but it can produce five crops of wheat in succession.  Is that going to be permitted by any Irish Government? I would safely say that Senator L'Estrange knows some of these people who have sown five crops of wheat in succession on the land.  That is why there is a glut in the mills, why there is a glut on the market, and why the mills are finding it difficult to dry the grain in good condition.</P>
      <P>I would agree with Senator Tunney and others on the other side of the House, who are responsible persons, that some steps should be taken by the Minister to see that the people who are practical farmers, who have grown wheat down through the years and who have husbanded both the crop and the land, should get the full benefit of maximum prices for wheat for human consumption.  If that can be achieved, Senators and Deputies should join together in advising the people to produce the maximum amount of the best possible wheat for our own needs.  Can that be done?  It can be done, but, first of all, we must get after those people who are only speculators.  It is not altogether the conacre people who are to blame.  There are other people to blame also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a debate on an agricultural motion in the Dáil some years ago, I mentioned one case that had been brought to my notice in Meath.  It concerned a man who was notified by the local agent that he must till four or five more acres of wheat to fill his <Col N="91" /> quota.  He agreed readily enough, but he did not proceed to plough that land. He went into it with a tractor and harrow and barely ruffled it.  Instead of sowing the proper amount of seed per acre, on ten acres, he sowed approximately 20 stones of seed.  In a fortnight's time, or so, he called in the agricultural adviser and said to him: &ldquo;Can you not see that that land will not produce wheat?&rdquo;  I hope the present Minister will not be led astray by that kind of propaganda again.  That land at the present time is able to produce three or four crops of wheat in succession.  Is an Irish Government going to permit Irish land to be exploited in that fashion?</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney has said that the farmers have gone into wheat in a big way.  They have.  Why?  Was it because they accepted the advice of a Minister for Agriculture on a previous occasion when he said the production of wheat is all cod, a rotten fraud and a waste of good land?  They did not accept the advice of that Minister and that is why they went into the production of wheat in a big way.  Machinery has been brought in to deal with wheat in a big way.  While I cannot for one moment condemn the use of combines for the harvesting of wheat, if the farmers who are practical agriculturists will give a reasonable time to the wheat to mature before it is harvested by combines, then the resultant wheat can be sold and milled in as good a condition as wheat harvested by the older methods.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have a number of people who are not farmers and who do not even see the land on which they grow wheat.  They have employed contractors to sow, harvest and place on sale wheat from conacre land.  I have seen some of this myself on the roads to Dublin.  I have also seen some of that wheat being taken away in lorries and I was not sure whether the bags on the lorries contained grass or wool, but certainly a growth of grass was to be seen through the sacks, which would indicate that the wheat had sprouted in the sacks.  That wheat was being conveyed to the mills in Dublin.  On inquiry, I discovered that <Col N="92" /> that wheat was harvested, that the bags were left on the field where they fell off the combine, lying flat for three weeks exposed to the weather.  Is it any wonder that the millers would entirely object to Irish wheat in their mills?  The Minister and the Government must combat that kind of farming, if farming it can be called.</P>
    <P>The question of producing an all-Irish loaf has been mentioned.  I know from experience, having been on bodies which approached the millers on the question of wheat and other cereals, that the millers are hostile to the production of an all-Irish loaf.  In fact, I have heard millers state that they would much prefer not to get one pound of Irish wheat, if they could manage it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they Englishmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they were not Englishmen.  We have discovered that, in Sweden, some years ago, the millers did exactly the same as they did here.  They refused to accept all-Swedish wheat for an all-Swedish loaf. The Government there had, as they had here, to import a considerable amount of hard wheat, Manitoba wheat, until a powerful farming organisation over there, something very much stronger than the National Farmers' Association here, decided, when they could get no good of the millers, to set up their own mill.  What is the position to-day over there?  Not a single pound of Manitoba wheat is imported into Sweden.  On the contrary, Swedish wheat is being exported.  If it can be done in Sweden, it can be done here, if politicians and responsible men of all shades of politics come together and advise our farmers and our people of the true position.  If the farmers could get renewed confidence, they would then produce the best possible wheat that can be produced, not only in this country but in all Western Europe, granted a reasonable harvest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tunney has referred to the small growers, the farmers who have always produced wheat and who nurse the crop and the land from which it is grown.  Those growers must be encouraged if we mean to preserve the land of this country, if we mean to leave <Col N="93" /> the land, after taking the crop from it, as rich as it was before the crop was sown.  I do not believe it is fair that they should be victimised by those other people who come in with the big machinery, who do not own the land and do not see it.  While in the present circumstances the arrangement is the best that can be made, it is one we must get away from as quickly as possible. The farmer who has produced good wheat, and has produced it always, must be encouraged to conclnue to do so.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that Senator Donegan introduced this motion.  It does no good, and I believe he has not had his heart in the motion.  Therefore, I suggest that the motion should be rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not intervene at all but for some of the statements made here.  I do not grow wheat, but I handled more wheat than anybody here in the Seanad for 25 years in the flour mills, both Irish wheat and foreign.  During the war and up to date, foreign wheat has been imported for the manufacture of bakers' flour for sponge purposes.  They have tried experiments on the all-Irish loaf over a number of years without success.</P>
      <P>Some of the Senators said that there were no promises made about the price of wheat.  Coming from one of the greatest wheat-growing counties in the country, Wexford, I know that what brought back Fianna Fáil was the promise made to the farmers by their canvassers: &ldquo;Put out the Coalition and get back your 12/6 that Dillon took from you.&rdquo;  That was repeated at every door and to every farmer at fair and market&mdash;all propaganda was used to put out the Government and get a higher price for wheat.  I wonder is the Minister's conscience pricking him at the moment when he says that the price of wheat is fair, when the price of flour is almost 8/- a stone, though the price of wheat has been reduced? That is what the people are saying in the towns.  They were expecting a reduction in the price of flour when it was announced that there was to be a reduction in the price of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is worrying the farmers is that after 300,000 barrels, there will be a <Col N="94" /> reduction of 6/- a barrel.  What has happened now?  In Wexford to-day, the wheat is paid for by the mill and is transported to Tipperary and other centres by road.  Who is buying the extra wheat from the millers at the moment?  Is it Grain Importers?  Who is selling it back to them again to be manufactured into pig feed or compound mixtures?  Those are the things which some Senators are not aware of. There is no doubt that Fianna Fáil did trick the farmers and get their majority by doing so.  Now we have the situation that, after all the millions on food subsidies, and after the £7,000,000 which the Minister for Finance mentioned at the draw, there is nothing for anyone.  What is the Government doing with the money? Where have all those millions gone to? Those are things the Minister ought to tell us.  The whole cry is &ldquo;wolf, wolf&rdquo;. When I came into Dáil Eireann in 1943, the present Taoiseach used to say: &ldquo;We are not out of the wood&rdquo;. That was the whole cry during the emergency and afterwards.  We are in the wood still, through the actions of this Government, and the working-class people are the biggest sufferers, with the high cost of living and the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to be dealing with the unemployment position and emigration here and in the other House than to be talking about greyhound tracks after the recess.  That was the only thing that faced the Dáil.  No wonder the country has gone to the dogs.</P>
    <P>Although Deputies on the other side have said that no promises were made, I listened to the present Minister for Finance during the last general election describing over the radio on 23rd February, 1957, the 1954 cut in wheat prices as &ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo;.  Can he stand over that statement to-day?</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish Independent.</i> The <i>Irish Press</i> publishes only what suits the Party and not what suits the country.  Why had we more wheat? Fianna Fáil was 20 years in office. They were 16 years in office at one period and four at another, and we had no extra wheat and neither had we butter.  It was the policy of the former Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government which brought lime to the farmer at 16/- a ton that brought the land to what it is to-day and so produced the wheat to the extent it has been produced.  Fianna Fáil farmers will tell you the very same thing as Fine Gael farmers.  It was the best scheme that ever came into operation.  It is a grand thing to see plenty in the country, but when you see plenty in the country, you expect a reduction for the consumers, but there is no reduction for the consumers. A higher price is being asked for bacon, butter and everything they buy.</P>
      <P>The only people who get the benefit are the people in England who can buy butter 1/2 per lb. cheaper than we can buy it at home.  Is that not an extraordinary state of affairs?  We have people unable to buy butter.  All they can purchase is margarine.</P>

Were it not for the change of Government in 1948, we would not be boasting to-day about our balance of payments.

You will not humbug the people all the time by telling them that no promises were made.  I can tell the House that in Wexford the farmers are swearing vengeance because of the price of wheat.  They really do not know how much they are going to get.  There is no guaranteed price.  The 300,000 tons of wheat referred to could be grown in the County Wexford in a short time. At the present time, they have two new silos.</P>
      <P>Some of the counties may not be affected as they grow only a few acres of wheat.  Wexford will be affected more than any other country, because it is a wheat producing county.

      <P>A small loaf would not do the Senator.  He would want more than a pound of bread.  A very small loaf is being given to the workers in the towns and villages of Ireland&mdash;the smallest they ever got.  They are unable to buy enough bread.  I spent 25 years in the mills and unloaded Irish wheat and foreign wheat.  What is the mystery in relation to flour?  Farmers are put on moisture content by the millers, but before the wheat is manufactured into flour, it is damped with water.  That is a thing I could never understand.  It is all humbug and codology.  In the Twenty-Six Counties, we have only 26 mills which give employment to about 2,000 people or more.  The millers at the moment are importing machinery for mass production, with consequent less employment.</P>
      <P>I remember coming to the Department of Industry and Commerce away back in 1934 or 1936.  A certain milling company was looking for a port mill.  The small mills in the rural areas were on half-time.  The Minister's Secretary told me there was no secret, but it was a secret, so far as the workers I represented were concerned. We had mill workers unemployed while people were applying for licences in order to mass produce at the ports.  They are heading for mass production at the ports, with the result that the inland mills will be closed. That is what I should like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to keep his eye on because they will tell you that it does not pay to keep a small plant running in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened since Fianna Fáil came back into office?  Two mills have closed down.  A lovely mill in <Col N="98" /> County Wicklow has been closed down and the men thrown out of employment. Are there any Corkmen present? The men in the Midleton Mills are under notice because the mills are to close down.  Why does the Minister not take action here?  We are talking about bringing over foreigners for our industries.  There are two Irish industries lying idle.</P>

      <P>I do not get all Labour votes in Wexford; I get some farmers' votes. I like to see farmers get a straight deal.  They are good, hard-working people who give employment as far as they can.  If they reduce their production of wheat because of a reduction in price and no guarantee, then it will mean less employment on the land. That is the danger which I see.  Farmers have spoken to me since the cut in wheat prices first became known. I appeal to the Minister to try to have the price brought back to the level which was being paid and which was responsible for this great abundance of wheat.  You will not get any results unless there is a good and a fair price. It is the same in industry.  If a man is not paid a fair day's pay, he will not work.  It is the same with the farmer; you must give him a fair average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers have thought of what the Taoiseach said in the Dáil in relation to a cut of 6/- a barrel in the price.  That should be reconsidered carefully.  There is great unrest in the farming community because of that statement and I do not want to say that from the point of view of Party politics.  The farmers are angry with <Col N="99" /> the Taoiseach and with the Minister because of the statement that, after 300,000 tons, the price of wheat will be reduced by 6/- a barrel.  That is something which should be reconsidered in relation to this great industry on which we would be dependent, if war came.</P>
    <P>It is strange to see the price of wheat going down and, at the same time, the price of flour and of the loaf going up. People are talking about it and asking questions.  They are asking how it is that the price of the loaf has gone up while the farmers are getting less for their wheat.  I suppose it is a two-mark question.  The Minister may make a case for it.  However, it is the wrong attitude, considering that the last Budget raised the cost of living so much.  It is a reflection on a Government which, in former years, boasted so much about the growing of wheat that, in 1958, they decide to reduce the price and not to control the price of flour and bread.  I am with the Minister if he will mend that matter, in co-operation with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Bring down the price of flour and bread.  Then the farmers will not growl, as they are growling, because the reduction is not passed on to the consumer.  That is the whole difference.</P>

      <P>At the last election, the farming community got a chance of supporting the various political Parties and I am sorry to say, for themselves, that a lot of them supported Fianna Fáil and, if they did, they are getting the results now.  I think we should discuss this matter without any heat or redness under the collar.  It has been debated in every county committee of agriculture for the past eight or ten years.  Nearly everybody who is on a county committee of agriculture has heard various statements about the price of wheat.  I am sorry that some of my colleagues in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture are not here to-night to listen to or join in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to address myself to the question of the price of wheat because no Senator can tell what the price will be next year, nor can the <Col N="100" /> Minister.  Nobody can give an accurate forecast.  The price of wheat is governed by circumstances outside the control of the Department or the Government.  One of the things which I think will increase the acreage under wheat this year is the feeling of pig producers and barley growers that it is even safer to chance an acre of wheat than to chance an acre of barley.  Every farmer in this House will agree with me that that is the position.  I believe there will be a steep increase in the wheat acreage. People had arrangements made before the price was announced.  Farmers had made arrangements to grow a certain acreage of wheat.  A good portion of that acreage had been sown and a great portion has yet to be sown, but it will be sown.</P>
    <P>An even worse feature will affect the wheat growers next spring.  There is a grave danger that, once the millers have their quota, they will refuse to accept the surplus from the farmers. It has happened this year.  I have been informed that, in parts of this country, millers have refused wheat in the springtime.  If that has happened this year, what chance will we have next year?</P>
    <P>I am very sorry my friend, the former Senator Cogan, is not here to-night. He was always in the forefront of the fray in the past three or four years on this question and he used to speak not for five or ten minutes, but for hours.  I do not know what can have happened to him this evening. He must be sowing wheat down in County Wicklow or perhaps he felt he should be sitting on this side of the House for this motion, joining in and giving a bit of advice to the Minister and the Department to accept the proposals he so ably enunciated on this matter last year.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, an acre of land at the present time could nearly double the output of wheat or any other crop in comparison with the year 1936, say, or 1939.  That has been and is being proved and nobody can deny it.  It is the result of the policy of the former Minister for Agriculture.  No one can deny&mdash;whether he agrees or disagrees with me&mdash;that he introduced the land <Col N="101" /> reclamation and the ground limestone schemes and everything else beneficial to the land.  Whereas we could not produce eight barrels of wheat in 1934 and 1935, that same land is producing 12 and 13 barrels of wheat now.  That is one of the reasons why we have a surplus of wheat.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision, in view of the promise given to the farming community. As Senator Lahiffe said, although the N.F.A. had been with the Minister, they are now disagreeing.  As a matter of fact, we see in the papers during the past week that they are not at all satisfied with the price of wheat at the present time.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter for the farming community, coming at a time when the prices of other agricultural products are falling.  The price of grade B pigs is down £2 a cwt. for the past couple of months and the price of grade A is coming down in June or July.  These things will affect wheat growing.  Where are we to sell the surplus wheat for animal feeding, if we have not the pigs to consume it? What are we to do with it?  I would advise the Minister and the Government to reconsider this decision and to stand by what they said last year and the year before, and give us at least the price we got for wheat last year.</P>

      <P>I am beginning to wonder what the purpose of the motion is, or even what motion is being discussed. None of us seems to direct his arguments to the motion on the Order Paper.  In regard to the motion itself, it has occurred to me that if some of the more sober-minded members on the opposite side, like Senator Burke or Senator Baxter, took the motion seriously, urging on the Minister to examine the possibilities of increasing the amount of Irish wheat in the grist, I could see some useful purpose being served by a number of people pooling their ideas in that regard, just as a very valuable contribution in that matter has been given by Senator Lahiffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the debate is not going along that line.  Apparently, it was not intended to serve a useful purpose. <Col N="102" /> Perhaps the cause of that is that, instead of a motion on the lines I have suggested, we had a motion by the more flamboyant members opposite.  I am referring to the proposer and seconder of the motion, and I think everyone but the two Senators concerned will realise what I mean.  Some buoyancy in speech is not a fault and, of the people opposite, it can be regarded as being fairly evident in both the proposer and seconder.  In regard to the motion itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A motion in the Dáil was discussed very recently and I have here a copy of it.  It was couched in the most flamboyant language, which was not intended to be taken seriously. Therefore, I am inclined to suggest that the people who have spoken to this motion from the opposite benches were intended to speak, not to the motion on the Order Paper, but to the motion tabled in the Dáil.  I seriously suggest that that is really what has happened and hence we have the confusion of the debate here.  Apparently, it was intended to be a political debate.  It deplores the price of wheat and asks the Government to restore the price of wheat.  Neither the proposer nor any other speaker on that side suggested what the price is.  May I say now that the price of wheat is the same price as last year?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of wheat from last year will be up to 78/6d. per barrel, having regard to the moisture content and its bushel weight.  If the production of wheat of the 1958 harvest does not gross 300,000 tons, it will be the same price as in 1957, having regard to its moisture content and its <Col N="103" /> bushel weight&mdash;it could go up to 78/6d. per barrel.  I defy contradiction on that statement and no one knows that better than the proposer of the motion. I felt that Senator O'Leary did not realise that, but if he says otherwise, I will accept his statement.  I suggest that Senator Donegan knew that quite well and he deliberately hid that fact, that the price could be up to 78/6d. per barrel, having regard to its bushel weight and moisture content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 370,000 tons last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, further, that the intention of this motion is to repeat loudly enough and often enough that the price of wheat is being deliberately reduced, even if the production does not gross 300,000 tons.  It is intended to confuse the people and create doubt and confusion among the farming community. I suggest that is why this motion has been put down by Senator Donegan.  I listened fairly carefully to what he said.  He did not give any particular price, even for last year's harvest.  He did not refer to that price at all, so I take it that the proposer of the motion was not very serious at all in regard to this price fixing.</P>
      <P>It occurred to me then that Senator Donegan's history in this matter of wheat is not very good.  I recollect reading a Dáil debate when the previous Minister reduced the price of wheat.  One of the people who defended most ardently the reduction of 12/- a barrel was the then Deputy Donegan from Louth.  If any Senator thinks back or gets the Dáil debates, he will find my statement is correct, that the most ardent defender of the reduction of 12/- a barrel, which was introduced by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister, was the then Deputy Donegan.  I agree there was a motion on this matter before the House here and I think I can claim I did not speak on that at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator says so, I will accept it.  Is it not grand that I am not speaking after the Senator now <Col N="104" /> because I might be tempted to say things which I should not say?  I am inclined to argue that there is something unreal about this motion, that its intention is not genuinely to examine the possibility of raising the price of wheat or increasing the amount of extraction of Irish wheat in the grist to the mill, but simply to make political propaganda.  I know it has been stated that Fianna Fáil promised to do this and to do that, and I wish the people who are claiming that would produce the documents.</P>
      <P>In regard to the price of wheat why is there a surplus?  I suggest the reason for a cumulative surplus each year is that people found wheat growing more profitable than other branches of farming. That is why more wheat is produced. It was never intended by the Government that we should have a surplus of wheat or engage in exporting it, or dumping it on a foreign market, or having a surplus for animal feeding.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil policy was intended to ensure that as much native wheat as possible would be used.  If the tendency is for a greater surplus of wheat every year, it should be obvious to any person that the reason why that is so is that so many people&mdash;some of whom are not farmers at all&mdash;found it a profitable transaction.  I do not consider that the Minister for Agriculture is very much in love with the system of disposal of the surpluses.  I believe that the method of marrying prices was suggested by the National Farmers' Association.  Perhaps it might be possible to suggest a better method and if people can think out a better method, it is only reasonable that it should be proposed to the Minister.  Other systems have been suggested in this debate and it struck me that some had merit but also disadvantages.</P>
      <P>I claim that it is very hard for people on this side of the House to take this motion seriously because I am convinced that the only purpose it was intended to serve was to make political propaganda for the Fine Gael Party and to level an attack on the Minister for Agriculture regarding the Fianna Fáil wheat policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any other purpose was intended, <Col N="105" /> it is not too late for the remaining speakers to amend their hand in this regard, because it is really a pity that this attempt is being made to confuse the farmers and to suggest that there is a reduction in the price of wheat when, in fact, no reduction does take place, unless there is a surplus of production over 300,000 tons.</P>

      <P>I was not anxious to intervene in this discussion because it is a bit stale to me now.  It has been discussed in the Dáil and it has been discussed in other places and I have taken part in discussions outside the Dáil, too.  I really do not take this motion seriously at all.  I do not think it was intended in a serious way.  I was not here when the mover was making his case, but some of the notes have been handed to me.  One of them is as follows: &ldquo;Feeding wheat at £26 a ton is too dear; comparable products imported are cheaper.&rdquo;  That is a very interesting point&mdash;a tremendously interesting point from a non-political Senator who is terribly disturbed because of the price the Government has fixed for green barley this year.  How do I connect these two things?  The price of £26 per ton for compound purposes may be on the high side.  Suppose it were lower; suppose it had been £24, suppose it had been £22 or suppose it had been £20, what would become of the people to whom the guarantee was given in 1957 for their barley?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not buy at all.  I suppose they are not entitled to sell it?  Of course, Senator Donegan is the knowledgable man here in this matter and even the Minister, who has been listening very quietly, is not going to be allowed to make his few remarks without interruption.  That very point made here in support of this motion that the surplus wheat which we have <Col N="106" /> now on hands being disposed of to compound mills at £14 to £15 a ton less than cost with the assistance of the Irish taxpayer, that price of £26 would not be £26, if it had not been for the fact that a predecessor of mine gave a guarantee to barley growers that they would get £2 per barrel in the green state, and that Grain Importers, Limited, in order to give reality to that guarantee, went into the market and bought 22,000 tons of that barley at that price.  Having gone into the market in that way, they indicated by their action, and by word, that that was going to be the price and that commercial buyers of barley could buy it on the understanding that, if they paid that price for it, these 22,000 tons of barley purchased by a semi-State concern would not be used at any time to deprive them of their reasonable profits to which they would in the normal, ordinary commercial sense, be entitled.</P>
      <P>That is really the confusing and bedevilling aspect of the fixation of barley prices, barley that is intended for animal food or, indeed, for oats. When I was dealing with this matter in the Dáil, I made it clear there that the fixing of £26 per ton for any of that surplus disposed of for compound purposes was determined by me in order that Grain Importers and the Government would keep their word with those commercial interests that were driven into giving the price I have referred to back in the harvest of last year These matters are all bound up together.  The price of wheat, the disposal of surplus wheat, our attitude towards the fixation of barley prices, whether we should have fixation or not, whether we should have a policy with regard to this growing of oats, whether we should have a guaranteed price for oats&mdash;all these are matters to which attention and consideration had to be given, because in the circumstances as they exist, or have existed, or having regard to the position as it existed inside the last number of months, they are all inter-connected in some way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposal of the amount of wheat that was surplus to our requirements is going to cost us about £1,250,000.  Is <Col N="107" /> it seriously suggested, except for political purposes, that that situation did not call for some sort of intelligent approach?</P>

      <P>I remember during the war years it was the practice of Ministers at that time to go to meetings of county committees of agriculture in different parts of the country, to discuss with these bodies the problems of the day, seeking their co-operation in finding the most suitable and effective solutions for them.  I always think of the reports in the daily papers of the meeting of the body of which Senator L'Estrange was a member.  He was most co-operative and that body was most co-operative&mdash;I will not say &ldquo;most&rdquo; because that is going a bit too far and maybe I am being a bit too generous&mdash;but I know the Senator himself had not reached this non-political chamber at that time.  He was always helpful and, as I say, his approach at all times could be said to be full of understanding and, indeed, I am not surprised that the effect of the atmosphere around Leinster House has even added to his worth in that regard. He is inclined to drag me off the lines along which I intended to go.  I will go a certain distance but not the whole way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to make a different kind of speech from the other speeches I made on the same sort of motion, and it is not easy to do.  As I said at the outset, I do not take the motion or the case that had been made for it in a very serious fashion.  I had read some of the contributions which Senator Donegan made in his own county on this matter and I sensed at once that <Col N="108" /> his approach was a non-political one. I know quite well that on coming here to the Seanad, he was not going to change overnight and proceed to do here what he would not be doing down in Louth.  There was one thing which really amused me in the report of the discussions in Louth which went to prove conclusively that, from a political point of view, this effort was entirely above-board.  After discussing the wheat policy of the Government and the announcement that had been made in regard to the 1958 wheat crop&mdash;that discussion, as far as I can gather from the report, had gone on for a considerable length of time&mdash; they became interested in the price of butter.  After denouncing the Government because of its failure to give better prices for wheat to the wheat growers and to grain growers in general, because, after all, County Louth is one of our best counties in that regard, they proceeded to the question of butter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan from West Cork, where they grow all the wheat and do not produce any milk or butter, will be interested in this approach&mdash;that while they wanted, in County Louth, a very high level for their wheat and their barley, they took a very poor view about this thing of an economic price for the struggler in West Cork, who was sending a bit of milk to the creamery and wanted to get something for it, too.  They wanted their butter to be at the same price as the surplus was being sold to the Englishman, heavily subsidised, of course, by the taxpayer.</P>

But it still is interesting in the build up to <Col N="109" /> support the contention that nothing political ever emanates from this House.</P>
      <P>I met the people who were interested in the growing of this wheat and in the price they would be paid for what they would grow.  It is like everything else, when you meet people who have an interest, as they had, a very vital interest, in a matter of this kind, it is not easy to find an ideal solution.  The fact is that there is no ideal solution, and the people who grow that wheat, and who regard it as an important matter from the point of view of their income and their way of living, appreciated the need to do something. They appreciated the need for having some arrangement that would bring to an end the situation which had left us with 95,000 tons of dried wheat that we had to dispose of at a loss of £1,250,000 to the taxpayers of the Twenty-Six Counties of Ireland.  The figure that was quoted here as having being used by a predecessor of mine, the figure of 300,000 tons, is proof that our policy of producing at all times roughly around 75 per cent. of our requirements has never been deviated from by us.</P>
      <P>My predecessor, speaking on a motion that has been mentioned here, moved by the former Senator Cogan, used the very figure on which I agreed with those with whom I discussed inside the last two months what the present price should be.  It is the very same figure of 300,000 tons.</P>

I really got a tremendous kick out of listening to Senators and Deputies who campaigned all down the years against almost everything at one time or another, and I am delighted to be here in order to find them now campaigning for a wheat policy that would result in our exporting wheat.  Is it not a wonderful business?  It is a change that has taken place not only in regard to wheat but in relation to a tremendous lot of other things in the last 30 years, and it is all to the good.</P>
      <P>Even if I have detected both here and in the Dáil a certain amount of the playboy mentality behind this motion, I do not resent it in the least, because, in the end, it all adds up to this conclusion&mdash;that those who plodded along the lonely furrow, to meet with criticism, ridicule, misrepresentation and abuse, have finally reached the stage where they can just lie back, as I have for the last two hours, and enjoy what I have heard, and what is to come when next we meet here, from Senator L'Estrange.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
