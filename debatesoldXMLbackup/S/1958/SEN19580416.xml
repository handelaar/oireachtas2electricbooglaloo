      <P>I understand that, at the moment, there are employees of the Irish Coursing Club who have duties at the various race tracks.  They are responsible to the Irish Coursing Club for the duties they perform there. Most of them are part-time employees, but some in Dublin are, I believe, whole-time.  It would seem that this new board will take over the function of the Irish Coursing Club in this connection as this section provides for the appointment by the board of officers and servants.  Would the Minister say if it is his general intention that the board will carry over the people already in the employment of the Irish Coursing Club at these race tracks, particularly in Dublin where they are whole-time employees?</P>

I cannot bind the board, but I have no doubt that if suitable persons are engaged in discharging duties which the board desire to have performed, they will be very carefully considered, as a matter of ordinary justice and equity, by the board, but beyond that I cannot go.</P>

      <P>I could not commit myself to that extent.  The circumstances in which this board is being established are somewhat peculiar. The board is being set up and the Bill is being enacted as a result of the report of an advisory committee.  In the course of that report, the committee found itself justified in passing certain strictures upon the conduct of certain of the existing greyhound tracks.  In these circumstances, I think the board will have to be left absolutely independent in its choice of personnel.</P>

    <Title>Tea (Purchase and Importation) Bill, 1957&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as the House is no doubt aware, is to make provision on a permanent basis for the continuance of the policy of importing this country's tea requirements direct from the countries in which the tea is grown.  That policy has been in operation now for over ten years.</P>
      <P>During that time, it has been implemented as a temporary arrangement through the organisation known as Tea Importers, Limited, which is a central purchasing and importing organisation, established, at the instance of the Government, by the tea trade, as an emergency measure during the second World War.  Tea Importers, Limited, is a non-profit-making body and its operations are financed by banking accommodation under the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It has always been intended that that temporary monopoly should be terminated as soon as circumstances permitted, that is to say, as soon as arrangements could be brought into operation which would restore to individual traders the right to purchase tea on their own behalf, according to their particular requirements and subject only to compliance with the policy of purchasing those requirements in the countries in which the tea is produced and importing their purchases direct to this country.  Accordingly, discussions were initiated with the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association which was a body fully representative of the wholesale tea trade.  These discussions centred around the arrangements which should be made for the purpose of restoring freedom to the tea trade, subject to the policy of purchasing in and importing direct from the country of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of these discussions, it was urged by the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association that it would be necessary to include in the permanent arrangements suitable provisions which would ensure that the competitive <Col N="355" /> position of the smaller trader, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the larger trader, would not be more disadvantageous than it was before the second World War began, when practically all this country's requirements were purchased in London.</P>
    <P>The reason urged by the association in support of that claim was that, because sales in India of the grades of tea which formed the bulk of this country's requirements are limited by the seasonal nature of the crop to a period of four to five months in each year, it is necessary to purchase 12 months' requirements of these grades of tea within that limited period, and that small traders would not have the necessary financial resources to enable them to pay for stock on that scale.</P>
    <P>In order to meet that position, the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association proposed the establishment, by the trade, of an organisation that would provide the necessary financial assistance for the smaller trader and which would also function as the sole importing agent for the purchases made by all traders.  The association contended that the conferring of sole importing agency rights on the proposed organisation would put that organisation in a strong position to obtain the requisite banking accommodation so that they could assist traders to make their purchases, and it urged also that the centralising of all imports would undoubtedly result in a very substantial economy in freight.  I regarded that proposal as reasonable and it has been enshrined in the Bill now before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Before going into the provisions of the Bill in greater detail, it may be considered necessary to emphasise that the policy of purchasing the country's tea requirements in the producing countries has been, as I said, in full and satisfactory operation since the end of the war.  During that period, Tea Importers, Limited, purchased the tea requirements of traders in India, Ceylon, Indonesia and elsewhere, and succeeded in passing on its purchases to traders here at prices which compared favourably with the prices prevailing on intermediate markets for similar grades and, on occasion, at <Col N="356" /> prices which were substantially lower than those prevailing on the intermediate markets.</P>
    <P>While it is satisfying to record that satisfactory position and to pay tribute to the directors of Tea Importers, Limited, for the services they have rendered, it will, I think, be generally agreed that, in present circumstances, the continuance of a State-sponsored monopoly to purchase and import our tea requirements can no longer be justified.  The main principles of the Bill are that the policy of direct purchase of this country's requirements from the producing countries should be continued; that the business of purchasing these requirements should continue to be retained in the hands of Irish citizens; and that within these limits, and subject only to these conditions, the greatest possible freedom should be permitted to individual traders.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first of the principles which I have enunciated&mdash;that of direct purchase of requirements from the producing countries&mdash;the experience of Tea Importers, Limited, during the years it has operated has established that adequate supplies of suitable quality tea can be purchased in the producing countries on better terms than they could have been purchased on intermediate markets and can be landed in this country at prices which compare favourably.  There has also been the advantage that this country has established unquestionable claims to quotas of tea in each of these countries, which may obviate a recurrence of our unfortunate experience during the last war, when we were denied a reasonable share of the available supplies from the intermediate markets on which we were dependent.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is the very important consideration&mdash;the aim of developing Calcutta and Colombo as the world's tea markets.  The Governments of both India and Ceylon restricted the quantities of tea which may be exported to other countries for re-export sale.  Evidence of the effect of that policy upon the intermediate markets of the world is contained in the British trade returns which show that the re-export of tea from Great Britain last <Col N="357" /> year represented less than 5 per cent. of British imports of tea for the same year.</P>
    <P>It seems clear, therefore, that, apart from any other considerations, on account of this policy of the Indian and Ceylon Governments to which I have referred, tea purchasing countries must, in order to get best value, deal direct from these countries, or in certain intermediate markets operating on limited supplies.  That is borne out by the fact that all the large tea consuming countries, including Canada and the U.S.A., buy practically all their tea requirements from the producing countries and many European countries buy substantial quantities direct from the same source.  That, in outline, is the case for continuing the policy of importing this country's tea requirements direct from the countries of origin.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second principle which I mentioned, I consider it necessary to explain, in order to avoid misunderstanding, that the provisions of this Bill which are designed to ensure that the business of purchasing tea shall be retained in the hands of Irish nationals simply continue a position which has been in operation since 1947. Those provisions of the Bill involve no interference with the position of existing traders and they are designed solely for the purpose of preventing the re-entry into this country of external trading concerns which never performed the function of a <i>bona fide</i> tea wholesaler and which were, in fact, an unnecessary link in the chain of distribution. The provisions specify that entrants into the business of purchasing tea for importation must be Irish citizens, but otherwise they do not preclude any person whatever from engaging in that trade.  The aim of the provisions is to ensure that all existing wholesale tea merchants and all new entrants who are Irish citizens will have complete freedom to purchase their requirements of tea in the producing countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financing and importing agency mentioned in the Bill, I should like to make it clear that it is not proposed that the monopoly at present enjoyed by Tea Importers. <Col N="358" /> Limited, should pass to the new company. The new company will have no functions in the purchase of a trader's requirements of tea.  The company will act simply as an importing agent for traders who will purchase their individual requirements of tea and, where necessary, will assist them in the financing of such purchases.  The Bill, however, contemplates that, in the event of a threatened emergency making it desirable to build up stocks of tea, the Minister may authorise the company to make the necessary purchases, but the Bill does not create a tea-purchasing monopoly, as was suggested in discussions elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The draft memorandum and articles of association of the new company which have, I understand, already been made available to the House, show that the share capital will be £250,000, divided into 100 shares of £2,500, that one share only may be allocated to each shareholder, and a share may not be allotted or transferred to any person, unless he is a tea trader registered under the Bill.  These provisions are intended to ensure that control of the company will be in the hands of Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the articles of association will restrict the amount of dividend that may be paid to shareholders. That provision is designed to ensure that the company, which will, of course, serve both shareholders and non-shareholders, will not have any inducement to overcharge for its services and thereby benefit shareholders by returning the overcharges in the form of dividends.  The memorandum and articles of association of a company can, as Senators know, normally be altered without any difficulty by a majority of the shareholders.  In order to ensure that the articles to which I have referred may not be so changed, the Bill provides that the articles of association of the company shall not be altered without the prior permission of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It will also be observed that the Bill provides that the proposed company will act as an importing agent for any registered tea trader, whether or not that tea trader is a shareholder in the company.  The purpose of that provision <Col N="359" /> is to safeguard the position of small traders and to ensure that the small traders, however small, will have the way open to them to purchase from the producing countries supplies of tea to meet the requirements of their own businesses.</P>
    <P>Tea Importers, Limited, the existing organisation, holds substantial stocks of tea at present, stocks which were purchased to supply to the tea trade, and which were financed by bank accommodation secured under guarantee by the Minister for Finance.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide for the orderly disposal of these stocks, so as to prevent the risk of trading losses which would have to be met by the Minister for Finance on foot of his guarantee for these borrowings.  The Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association has agreed on behalf of its members that each member purchasing tea for importation will enter into a binding undertaking that, for each consignment of tea imported on his behalf in the transition period, he will purchase also an appropriate share of the stocks of Tea Importers, Limited.  Suitable provision is made in the Bill to implement that undertaking and to ensure that the same conditions will apply to other tea traders who propose to purchase tea for importation.</P>
    <P>This Bill had a somewhat difficult passage through the Dáil, mainly, I think, because of misunderstanding of its provisions and implications.  In essence, the Bill is a simple measure, the principal objects of which are maintenance of the claim which we have established to quotas in the producing countries in the event of a recurrence of emergency conditions, and the application of common-sense methods to the procurement of our tea supplies in the primary markets where our experience, and the experience of other countries, have demonstrated that the best value can be obtained. It is on these grounds I recommend the Bill to the favourable consideration of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the Minister speak in the other House and here this afternoon, and I think I can divide his reasons for this legislation <Col N="360" /> into three main parts.  The first is that we should not buy tea from Mincing Lane or Amsterdam, because it is cheaper and better to buy it in the countries of origin; the second is that it will save certain handling costs and enable us to secure certain insurance rewards for the transfer here of that tea from the countries of origin; and the third is that all traders will be placed on an equal footing.  I hope to indicate to the House and the Minister that such results will not accrue from this legislation; that the Minister has been misled by those advisers of his in the tea trade; that the small trader will certainly suffer but that the consumer will suffer more grievously.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the ignorance he had encountered in another place.  I must say that when I sat behind the Minister listening while he was piloting the Bill through the Dáil, I was surprised at the amount of ignorance there was about this matter. It is a highly technical business and one cannot really be surprised if there is ignorance about it.  At any rate, the Minister can be quite sure that there is no misunderstanding in my mind about what this Bill means.  I hope to make that quite clear before I sit down.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk about this place called Mincing Lane.  I want to tell the House what Mincing Lane is.  It is not a collection of English dealers selling their wares to other English dealers or Irish dealers.  It is the world's largest tea market. When I tell the House that of last year's exports of tea from all the exporting countries in the world&mdash;the quantity amounted to 1,060,000,000 lb. &mdash;582,000,000 lb. arrived at the London docks for sale at Mincing Lane, it is quite obvious that there is nothing else to compare with it in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of tea that remains in India even for sale is limited.  The amount of tea available for purchase is very small.  What we are doing by this Bill is that we are by-passing what I have said is the largest market in the world.  I want to make it quite clear to every Senator that British tea dealers do not bring that from the East to England.  The tea is sent there by the producer for sale.  Why do these <Col N="361" /> very big tea interests in the East do that?  For the reason that they are going to the big market.  They are going to oblige the biggest customer.</P>
    <P>The tea comes from the East and is not invoiced in price.  It comes here under what is called an auction invoice. In other words, whatever it makes under the hammer in England, it will be taken at.  Sometimes they get the worst of the deal.  They might sell better in the East.  It is much more important to keep on supplying the requirement which the British market represents.  To keep all figures in proportion, I want to point out that our internal consumption is only 24,000,000 lb.  The tea is invoiced from the East in what are called &ldquo;breaks&rdquo;. I am going to be somewhat technical, but I hope the House will bear with me because very few members of either House of the Oireachtas understand this business as I hope I do.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;break&rdquo; is made up of something from 40 to perhaps 60 or 70 chests of tea.  The important thing about the &ldquo;break&rdquo; is that every spoonful of tea in those chests&mdash;a &ldquo;break&rdquo; is never more than 70 chests&mdash;is identical.  It is very important for the skilful tea buyer to have access to tasting samples of that tea.  That cannot be done from Colombo, Calcutta or Djakarta because tea is shipped in packages containing a great number of &ldquo;breaks&rdquo;.  This is one of the reasons why the English and Irish market have loomed so large in the tea business in the past.  It was because we dealers sold exceptionally fine tea.  Senators will remember the tea they drank in 1939 and most Senators know the tea they have been drinking since 1949.  It is due to the fact that we are compelled to import tea as a &ldquo;paper&rdquo; article of certain type and size without tasting it.  It means that the tradesman is denied the only tool he has&mdash;his own skill. Tasting is much more important than anything else.  If you cannot taste tea before you buy it, you are going to buy badly and not selectively.  You will provide your customers and consumers with a poorer article.  All that has been demonstrated very clearly during the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned&mdash;I am not <Col N="362" /> sure if he did so to-day&mdash;that Tea Importers, Limited, has been in operation for the past 20 years.  It has been in operation effectively only since 1947. Up to that time, we got almost a full ration from the British.  Tea Importers, Limited, have been supplying us for only ten years.  In fact, we got almost a full ration.  They must buy tea by telegram and you cannot buy tea by telegram.  If you wire to Calcutta and say you want 50,000 or 100,000 chests of a certain grade of tea, you will get anything the seller likes to send.  The people who bought the tea for us, the people who invoiced the tea to us, were exactly the same people we were buying tea from in London.  We know quite well that if this Bill becomes law the dealing we will be doing in the East will be with precisely the same people who operate in Mincing Lane, with this disadvantage, that only the very big man can go there.</P>
    <P>I will have to be a little more technical. The Minister spoke about the limited season for gathering or plucking the tea.  That is complete rubbish, of course.  In every tea garden in India and Ceylon, plucking or flushing starts in the beginning of March and goes on until the end of November.  In Indonesia, that plucking goes on all the year round.  That was one of the reasons the Minister's advisers put up to let him feel that this was a frightfully vital thing which could be done only by certain people.  Of course, that was completely stupid.  Tea is plucked for nine months of the year in the major countries in which we are interested and for 12 months in Indonesia.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the lists Tea Importers, Limited, had provided. Does the Minister know that there are 2,000 tea gardens in Assam alone and that any one of those would produce maybe 600 to 1,500 &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; in a plucking or flushing season?</P>
    <P>I want to talk about this matter of the plucking again.  Tea is gathered at the end of a day.  That finishes that particular day's crop.  It is put on wire mesh, dried, rolled and allowed to ferment, and finally fired, and when all that is done, it is graded into different strengths and sizes and it is impossible to make a common and uniform <Col N="363" /> article.  It is quite obvious that this will only be a very limited part of that season's output by that garden, and it is equally obvious to any tea buyer that that part will never be equalled or likened by any other portion of the crop of that garden for the whole year, though it is only a very small amount of it compared with the entire output.  In two consecutive days, the result will be quite different, depending on the weather, the climate on the day of flushing, and many other factors which will give the tea quite different characteristics.  There is no use in the Minister talking about the crop of a particular garden.  Every day's output is different in quality.</P>
    <P>That is why it is important that you have to taste tea before you buy it. The dealer must taste to buy well.  If you want to know the reason for the difference in quality, all you have to do is to go from here to Belfast, or even to Newry, and ask for a cup of tea at a good hotel there, and ask for a cup of tea in Leinster House.  You know what you are getting here in Leinster House.  It is as &ldquo;good&rdquo; as a dealer is able to supply.</P>
    <P>I have had to let tea into my premises at the beginning of this scheme that I was ashamed to sell.  I will tell of my experiences.  When this Tea Importers, Limited, system started, there were something like 50 or 55 primary wholesalers, and I was one of them.  You had to sell something like 100,000 lb. of tea in a given period to qualify for coming in on the ground floor, and you bought well on the ground floor, if you could.  But after two deliveries I had to cease dealing with Tea Importers, Limited, because I would not sell the tea that was coming to my premises.  I had to pay other wholesalers a very substantial profit of 2d. or 3d. a lb. for bulk buying of 25 or 30 chests of tea a fortnight, in order that I would have the privilege of testing a whole lot of samples which I could not do because of the Tea Importers, Limited, system. The paper buying system would not work for me and will not work for any man proud of the trade he is in.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All traders will be on an equal <Col N="364" /> footing.&rdquo;  I think the Minister has his tongue in his cheek when he says that. Has he thought of the money that will be involved in this matter?  Take the very smallest wholesaler, the man selling about 1,000 chests a year or 20 chests a week.  He must meet roughly £15,000 to buy several months' supply of tea, and he must buy several months' supply because of the time the tea takes to get from India into his warehouse.  The man who buys that tea, which he buys blindly, must put down 20 per cent. at least.  He does that out of his own pocket.  There are credit facilities being arranged by the new importing group.  When the tea arrives here, you may take it from them, and, at the end of the three months' period, complete your transaction, and the tea will be barely in the country when the time has arrived when they will have to give further credit for a further purchase.  That is the smallest man in the trade.</P>
    <P>Then there is another fellow who handles 3,000 chests of tea.  He is not a very big fellow, either, but his transaction comes to £45,000.  There is another fellow above him, and he does about 20,000 chests.  He is very near to the kind of fellow who is advising the Minister.  He is not in this for fun or for love of tea.  His transactions will cost £250,000 for one shipment that will be here in time for him to do at least two months' trade.  The moment it is on the water, he must start buying again, another £250,000, involving 20,000 chests.  When you think that our entire trade comes to something like 240,000 chests, it is quite obvious that there are bigger men about than the 20,000 chest man.</P>
    <P>To talk about the small fellow being able to compete in the open market or to get his hands on that kind of money is, I think, just cynical.  I do not think any small or medium wholesaler can survive under this system.  It is devised by the few to keep out the many.  The only way they could keep them out was by saying: &ldquo;You must buy in the East&rdquo;.  I reckon, as I think it was stated in the Dáil, that roughly 20 people will begin operating this new scheme, but that is going to diminish to 12 or 14.  You are handing over the <Col N="365" /> entire trade, £5,000,000 in money and 24,000,000 lb. in weight, to those 12 or 14 people.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agree with me that if forty-ninetieths of the existing wholesalers could not put up £2,500 each, there must be quite a number in the remaining fifty-ninetieths who are only a very small margin line below. It is only the big fellow who is going to survive.  I know a smallish wholesaler in Cork.  He was a primary wholesaler. He is closing down this week and taking a job as a tea buyer for one of the bigger buyers here.  He is being hunted out, and many will be hunted out, if the Minister's Bill is passed.  It is going to be inevitable monopoly. The small man will be squeezed out because in the first place, the money is too big and, in the second place, he will have to buy blindly.  His only chance of buying against the big fellow is to buy on his skill and his mouth&mdash;to taste the tea before he buys it.  If he does that, he may fight for his trade and keep it.  The bigger fellow can afford to buy blindly.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister of something that happened in this Parliament House about four years ago, when he was previously Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There was a very large parcel of tea bought by Tea Importers, Limited, not in Calcutta or in Colombo, but in Mincing Lane, over 1,500,000 lb.  I knew it had been bought there because I know the wharf marks when the chests arrive, and I knew that it had not come direct from India.  I had a question asked in the House about what that tea cost. The Minister replied that it cost 1/2½ per lb. in Mincing Lane.  I got a supplementary question asked as to what that tea was sold at, and the Minister was unable to tell me.  He had not that information.</P>
    <P>When I later became a member of Dáil Eireann, there was a discussion on this tea business and I reverted to that series of questions.  I said: &ldquo;Minister, that tea that was bought by Tea Importers, Limited, for 1/2½ a lb. was sold to the biggest possible buyer at 3/- a lb.&rdquo;  The Minister replied &ldquo;Rubbish.&rdquo;  He was then <Col N="366" /> Deputy Lemass.  I wonder will he reply &ldquo;Rubbish&rdquo; to-day when I repeat the challenge to him that it was bought at 1/2½ and sold at 3/- a lb.  That tea went from the primary to the secondary wholesaler at probably 3/4 a lb. The secondary wholesaler blended and distributed it to the grocer, who probably paid at least 3/10 a lb.  What did the housekeeper pay for it?  She paid the best part of 4/9 or 5/- a lb. for tea that had cost 1/2½.</P>
    <P>I am not grumbling about Tea Importers, Limited, taking what seems to have been a very big profit, because I knew precisely the reason they had to take the profit.  They took the profit, because, in some buying previously, they had lost very badly.  They are a non-profit-making company and they had lost a good deal of money in the previous buying.  But if there was no monopoly there then, if there was complete freedom to purchase, there would be many traders who would have been able to sell that tea to the public at about 1/9 instead of 4/9. The fellow who bought badly would either have to go to the bank or go out of business, but he could not foist his losses on the consuming public.  When you develop a monopoly of any kind&mdash; and this is a near-monopoly&mdash;that will happen and it is certain to happen again.</P>
    <P>I tasted tea a fortnight ago in Cork which was bought on the London market.  The current situation is that the tea priced for 4/6 here has a London price of 3/-.  If you pass this Bill, you are passing a very bad Bill. As was mentioned in the Dáil, and let it not be forgotten, every penny on a lb. of tea in this country represents £100,000 per annum&mdash;and, in one case alone, you have 18 pence of a difference. Are you not doing something that you will find it very hard to justify afterwards?  Is the Minister happy about this picture?</P>
    <P>There were some fallacies in the arguments in the Dáil, but I want to refer in particular to some of Deputy Norton's fallacies.  Obviously, he knows nothing about the business.  He talked about handling charges, about packing in London and sending the packets <Col N="367" /> over here, rather than employing girls on the work here.  The Minister knows that there has been no such thing in the tea trade for the past 30 years. The tea comes into this country unopened just as it left India.  All the opening, blending and packing is done by Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will answer this question.  Does he know what this new company propose to estimate as their charges for bringing tea from the East to Ireland?  Have they indicated to him what the figure is supposed to be?  I got the figure of 8d. a lb.  The corresponding London figure for bringing tea from the East, wharfing it, storing it and shipping it, is 3¼d.&mdash; compare the figure of 8d. with that of 3¼d.  I should like the Minister to send for them about this matter.  If they are allowed to make a charge like 8d. to cover all kinds of foolishness in buying and other losses that might accrue from a company that will not be very satisfactory from the beginning, it is dreadful on the consumer.</P>
    <P>Several of the men engaged in this business&mdash;the biggest men in it&mdash;have erected very large warehouses in this town for storing tea.  As far as I know, we have been able to store 240,000 chests of tea effectively enough for the past ten years.  We were able to deal with 24,000,000 lb. yearly but these gentlemen do not want to give a living or a profit to anybody else.  They do not want to give so much as £1 for storing it.  However, 240,000 chests of tea come into this country.  There will be exactly the same labour content except that if it goes through different ports such as Limerick, Waterford and Cork, as well as Dublin, that labour content will be more diversified.  We should consider whether that would not be desirable in this country.  All the blending and packing will be done here, the same as it has always been done.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the technicalities about the board&mdash;the election&mdash;because I do not mind who is on it.  However, I object to the principle of the thing, which is wrong.  I know some of the boys will be on the board.  Already they have shelved two men who were <Col N="368" /> put on for window-dressing purposes a few years ago because now the top men are coming into the open.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the trade is in favour of this measure.  He knows that, in 1953, when a ballot was taken, out of 83 members of the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association at that time, only 33 voted for these proposals.  The Minister is also aware that the remainder were advised from Kildare Street that they would not get permission to buy anywhere except in the East.  The average small fellow, particularly the small and the middle-sized fellow, feels there is a gun to his head. He knows he might be left out, that somebody might get an advantage which he will not get and he will try to keep in the race as long as he can. If the Minister thinks the tea trade want this measure, would the Minister undertake now to have a secret ballot of the registered tea wholesalers of this country and let anybody he likes supervise it, and I will abide by the result?</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of hypocrisy about the word &ldquo;nationals&rdquo; in this connection.  The Minister knows that at least two or three very big English firms are in the tea trade in this country and that they will probably be the biggest operators.  I do not care what names they have on their boards of directors.  I will not mention names, but I can say they are substantial people in the tea trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if he did permit freedom of market, these people would at once go to London and buy.  Why would they go there? I never met an Englishman yet who went anywhere except where the easier shilling was to be found.  If there was a penny more profit in Calcutta, he would go there.  If he is compelled by us to buy in Calcutta now, his organisation will make some of the smaller men in this country have a very uneasy and unsafe future. I beg the Minister to reconsider this matter.  I beg him to have a secret ballot of every member of the wholesale trade.  He knows them all.  He would be quite surprised at the result. The only reason for this policy of going to the East is to eliminate the competition <Col N="369" /> from the smaller man and the man at least as skilful.</P>
    <P>I will go to the East because I am quite sure that some of these English firms in Mincing Lane now&mdash;these dreadful people&mdash;probably buy and stock teas in the East and probably sample them by airmail, and I would be able to buy it after tasting it because I will not buy it any other way. The Minister is compelling me to go 4,000 or 5,000 miles further east.  If I have to go to Tea Importers, Limited, I will be charged 5 per cent.  I should like to know what the 5 per cent. is put on.  Is it on freight and handling charges alone or on the bulk cost of tea?  I do not know if I have other points to make because this subject has become rather tiresome to me.  I will just sum up the remarks I have made.</P>
    <P>Selective buying of tea is much more economical than bulk buying.  I defy anybody to contradict that axiom, particularly when you are a small country on the threshold of the biggest selling market in the world.  You are by-passing that market with 24,000,000 lb. and you are leaving a £6,000,000 market behind.</P>
    <P>Secondly, if you want to buy good tea and stop buying the type of tea which we get, for example, in the restaurant downstairs, you must get the tea dealers of his country to buy by taste, because you cannot buy tea on paper.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, will anybody say I am wrong in my assertion that ten years of bulk buying have proved conclusively that what you get is poorish tea at a rather high price?</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there is not equal opportunity for all dealers any more than there is in this world for all people. Those with more money can do better than the fellows with less.  That applies in particular to the tea trade.  You are creating a monopoly.  You are injuring the small man and benefiting very few.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, there is not one pennyworth of extra employment in this new system, and in fact there is no national principle in it.  In fact, I found it nauseating to find a few people who became directors of banks, who were sailing to the East with Tricolours flying bravely from the mast.  It was a <Col N="370" /> wonderful thing to do, but it did not deceive me in the slightest.  It confined the sales of 24,000,000 lb. of tea to very few people who could insure themselves. They could get together, though they were a handful only, and if they did buy badly they could ensure that they would recover their losses out of the public pocket.  As a final result, our people will be denied good tea at fair prices, because those people who are able to do so will be prevented from exercising their skill in a competitive manner.  This is a bad Bill, which will enrich a few at the expense of many.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the speech of Senator Barry, and I speak perhaps in one way in contrast, because I cannot claim any special knowledge of the tea trade, except from the consuming end &mdash;and I am not too sure even that I would be able to distinguish between what he condemned as the very poor quality of tea to be got in bulk buying, from the &ldquo;very best quality&rdquo; guaranteed us by specialised traders.</P>
      <P>In the main, I felt a great measure of sympathy with what he said, viewing it from the point of view of the consuming public.  He put one question which I do not think the Minister answered&mdash;what is the purpose of this Bill?  The Minister put up a few reasons for it, but he did not give an answer that would warrant the passing of this legislation.  He told us that he wants to abolish the present &ldquo;temporary monopoly.&rdquo;  The Bill is setting up, if not the same kind of monopoly, at least another kind of monopoly. The importing agency will have a complete monopoly on the importing side, as I understand it from what Senator Barry said.  I am aware, of course, that tea traders will have the right to ask the company to act as their agents in importing tea which they have bought in Calcutta or elsewhere. Nevertheless, the agency will have the monopoly of that importation, it will be the only agency through whom the importing can de done, it will be the only importing company, in accordance with the terms of the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is concerned to abolish <Col N="371" /> a temporary monopoly set up under emergency conditions, but he is setting up a permanent monopoly.  Why does he consider it necessary to restrict the importation of tea to one company, however freely its services may be, in theory, at the disposal of individual traders?  Then he used a phrase, something to the effect that the other object of the Bill was to restore to individual traders the right to buy tea individually.  That is true, to some extent.  He is restoring freedom with one hand and establishing the abolition of freedom with the other.  He talks about restoring freedom to the trade, but I do not think he is entitled to refer to this Bill as restoring freedom.  It is abolishing one form of restriction and putting on other forms of restriction.  He says he is restoring freedom to the trade but that the trade will have &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to buy only in the country of origin. He is restoring freedom, but a freedom that does not extend to buying tea where they like.  Therefore, it would be fairer if he were to talk about restoring some freedom, but retaining the right to interfere with other freedoms.</P>
    <P>Then he told us&mdash;and if I understand Senator Barry correctly, he seemed to agree with the Minister here&mdash;that he was concerned to protect the small traders <i>vis-a-vis</i> the big traders.  I wonder why.  As Senator Barry said in another part of his speech, in certain circumstances, in business, if the businessman cannot carry on, he goes out of business; and it is not the function of the State to put up a little barrier around him and keep him in business at the expense of the consumer.  I know that in many trades in this country that principle is observed: to get State interference in order to maintain and keep going some of the smaller and less efficient businesses; but I wonder whether that is, from the point of view of the consumer, really good business. Who is paying for it ultimately?  The Irish consumer, of course, in the price of the lb. of tea.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that the Minister answered satisfactorily the question&mdash; why should Irish tea traders not buy <Col N="372" /> tea anywhere they like, why should they not have that freedom?  I should like to hear him justifying his refusal to give the Irish tea trader the right to buy tea anywhere he likes.  It would be unfair to the Minister to suggest that he did not offer any explanation of this.  He did.  He referred to &ldquo;our unfortunate experience&rdquo;&mdash;that was his phrase&mdash;during the last war and he said that the insistence in this Bill that we buy it in the country of origin will obviate the possibility of a recurrence of that &ldquo;unfortunate experience&rdquo; during the last war, that it will maintain our right to a certain quota of tea in the markets of the country of origin.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that the Minister is successfully deceiving even himself on that issue.  Does he really think that, if we have a theoretical right to a quota of tea in Calcutta during war time when ships are being bombed and torpedoed and destroyed, the tea merchants of Calcutta in some obscure way will see to it that the tea gets to Dublin, whether Ireland is or is not involved in that war?  How is the maintenance of a theoretical quota going to affect us, if in fact we do not get the tea? The Minister thinks we will have a right to a quota maintained in the country of origin, but I would ask him who will run the blockade for us, if there is a blockade, any more than during the last war?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Shipping may do its level best, but in point of fact there is no nation and no shipping that will be prepared, on the basis of a theoretical peacetime quota, to run a blockade for our sake, if there is a blockade.  I suggest, with respect, that to envisage that, as the Minister seemed to do, is nonsense.  When the Minister refers to &ldquo;our unfortunate experience&rdquo; during the last war, in relation to Mincing Lane and so on, and the fact that Britain did not give us the quota that she thought originally she could give us, I cannot help feeling that the Minister is concerned more with his own prestige, and with a certain feeling of pique, and with the effect of some of his own blunders at that time, rather than with any <Col N="373" /> realistic view of the situation as it was then, as it is now, and as it may be again in the course of another war.</P>
      <P>We all remember an appeal by the present Minister towards the end of 1940 to stock tea.  He appealed to all the Irish public to stock large quantities of tea.  It is quite obvious that people with the capacity to store quantities of tea, and with the money to buy it, behaved quite rightly in storing tea.  The wealthier and more privileged sections of the community were in a position to follow the Minister's advice: the ordinary poorer tea-consumer could not.  Then, from early in 1941, if my memory does not betray me&mdash;within a matter of weeks&mdash;the Minister suddenly said: &ldquo;Crisis!  We will be short of tea, but we will play fair; whatever is left now in the hands of wholesalers, and what we can get in future, will be divided evenly between rich and poor alike.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister was not altogether to blame because it is true that Britain found itself in a position of being unable to fulfil a commitment&mdash;given under certain circumstances&mdash;when those circumstances had changed.  I feel, however, that the Minister is being a little petty in taking vengeance, as it were, on Mincing Lane now, for what they were forced to do by reason of the blitz and the blockade, when at the time things were not all that easy in Britain.  I feel the Minister is still annoyed by his own past blunders in relation to tea and storing tea, and the &ldquo;meticulous&rdquo; rationing of what was left at a time when some State-sponsored company should long ago have been doing the storing, and not the more privileged sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think perhaps a case might be made &mdash;the Minister did not make it, I think &mdash;for not going direct to the British market.  He might say we would like to help the people of Ceylon, the people of India, the producers, that we would like to establish more direct links, and that we do not see why we should buy through London.  But I am afraid the Irish consumers will ask: &ldquo;Is it going to cost us more for this token of political friendship towards tea-producing countries?  How much per lb. is it <Col N="374" /> going to cost us?&rdquo;  The Minister may say it is not going to cost us anything more.  If in fact, however, we are going to get better value in Calcutta and the countries of origin, why does the Minister have to prevent the traders from going to Mincing Lane, if in fact, financially, they are going to get better value in Calcutta?</P>
    <P>Is it not, rather, a fact that this Bill aims to guarantee that we must avoid buying in Mincing Lane even when the Irish consumers would get far better value there?  That seems to be the central point, from the consumer's point of view.  It is a point which the Minister has not met by producing figures.  I would differ from Senator Barry on bulk-buying.  I think there is a strong case for bulk-buying.  I think Tea Importers, Limited, have done wonderful work for the country and deserve the Minister's tribute. They have done unselfish work, and their work was not for profit.</P>
    <P>I think a case for continued bulk-buying, as at present, can be made. We talk as if we consumed a lot of tea, but while per head we have a large tea consumption we are in fact small fry in the tea markets of the world, and, therefore, it is in our interests as a community to buy in bulk.  This Bill is not for the purpose of buying in bulk, it is for the purpose of allowing us to bid against one another in the countries of origin.  I do not think even the Minister, with all his powers of persuasion, could persuade us that by going there and bidding against one another we are going to get better prices.  It is like a man bringing his wife to an auction to bid against him for a particular article under the impression that he will get a better price that way.  It is ridiculous.  It would be far better if we as a country were to buy tea as one entity, were to continue some system of bulk-buying.</P>
    <P>We are, under this Bill, to be made quite free to bid against one another in the markets of India and Ceylon. I see no advantage in that.  I see no advantage in refraining from buying tea in Britain for evermore simply because of the way they treated us <Col N="375" /> during the war, because they cut our tea quota under the &ldquo;pretext&rdquo; that they were bombed, blitzed and blockaded.  If we are in an economy which is run for the purpose of supplying goods under the best conditions to the public I think we should be prepared to indulge in bulk-buying from the cheapest market.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to give&mdash;again I thought rather unnecessarily, at any rate I did not see the need for them&mdash; the reasons why we are concerned to prevent the re-entry of certain &ldquo;external traders&rdquo; into the tea trade of this country.  Why?  I do not see why.  I think it might be good.  The Minister believes it might be good in other industries, and we are sending people around the world to persuade Americans, Canadians and Germans to come in here with the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and the capital to start this business and that business because we think it would be good for us, but such foreigners are to be kept out of the tea trade.  What is there so sacred about the tea trade that at all costs we must keep out external foreign investors, that foreign investors must be anathema?  Surely the test is, if you are behaving in that way in relation to the rest of the economy, would they be giving good value to the country or not?  It is almost as if the Minister is afraid that if they came in they might make competition a little too hot for some of our less efficient traders at home.  I see no point in keeping out the foreign investor, the foreign trader, from the tea trade, when we are welcoming with open arms all kinds of other foreign investors in practically every trade you care to mention.</P>
    <P>The new company will act, the Minister tells us, as an importing agency&mdash; an expensive and monopolistic agency, in my opinion.  I do not think I have to develop that point because it seems to me to have been amply made by Senator Barry in his speech.  This Bill aims, as I see it, at placing official trade restrictions on the whole tea trade.  To be frank, you might just as well call it the Tea Trade Restriction Bill.  Usually, when we bring in a trade restriction Bill, it is for the purpose <Col N="376" /> of preventing unfair trade practices, but this Bill is for the purpose of officially setting up unfair practices. For whose benefit are these restrictions? Restrictions as to who shall buy the tea&mdash;a list of registered traders; restrictions as to where they shall buy the tea&mdash;in the country of origin; restrictions as to the very nationality of the buyers of our tea.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the fact that in his other capacity&mdash;I will not say his dual capacity because I do not think the Minister confines himself to having just a dual personality, I think he goes well into triple and quadruple personalities, and talks in public about free trade, free enterprise, the value of competition and all the rest, but in one of his many capacities&mdash;he will be coming before us very soon to tell us it is necessary now to modify somewhat the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act in order to admit more foreigners if possible.  That would seem to be the new trend in the present Irish industrial situation.  A new trend admired and praised by the present Minister in one of his other capacities. But to-day with this Bill he is defending a Bill which asks us, under Section 4, to give him the powers to restrict entry to the trade, to regulate tea traders about whom the Minister is satisfied that&mdash;I quote paragraph (i) of Section 4:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the applicant is not financially assisted by a person ordinarily resident outside the State&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>and paragraph (ii)</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in case the applicant is a company &mdash;all the shares of the company are in the beneficial ownership of Irish citizens&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>&mdash;&ldquo;all of them&rdquo;, not just 51 per cent. or 75 per cent.&mdash;and paragraph (iii) which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the business will be managed and controlled by an Irish citizen&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>and so on.  Obviously, this is restricting very closely this trade to our own nationals.  I am puzzled by that, and I should like to hear the Minister's comment on it, in the light of his own view that we want to encourage foreign investors, to get the foreigners in with their know-how, drive and initiative, <Col N="377" /> to help put stimulus into our trade and commerce.</P>
    <P>I would comment, in passing, on this phrase that the Minister must be &ldquo;satisfied the applicant is not financially assisted by a person ordinarily resident outside the State.&rdquo;  I think it is going to be rather hard to determine by whom one is being &ldquo;financially assisted&rdquo;, and I should like to hear the Minister's comment on the interpretation of that.  I notice under another section he has even power to cancel the registration of a person who suddenly becomes &ldquo;financially assisted&rdquo; by a person outside the State.  In all that, we are having further restrictions, and I ask the question: For whose benefit are these restrictions being imposed upon this trade?  Is it for the benefit of the community, or for the benefit of the favoured few, the privileged inner circle in the Irish tea trade?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in winding up his speech, said this Bill was the way in which we will get &ldquo;the best value.&rdquo; The Minister is very good at keeping a straight face, but I find it astonishing that he could say that by putting on all these restrictions, the price of tea will be considerably reduced.  If we were to continue bulk-buying and if we were to be allowed to buy in the cheapest markets, then we should have the best value; but with a perfectly straight face he comes before this House and says that this Bill will ensure &ldquo;the best value&rdquo;.  Obviously, he does not mean it is the best value for the consumer. For whom then is it the best value?  I suggest it will be, as happens all too often in this country, a privileged and favoured group of Irish traders who will succeed in remaining on the inside of the charmed circle which this Bill is setting up.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is the establishment and maintenance of restriction and privilege within the Irish tea trade. Those are the people who will get &ldquo;the best value&rdquo; of which the Minister speaks.  Who will be the losers by these restrictive practices, if this Bill becomes law?  The losers, of course, will be the public, the consumers, and I would regard this Bill as another example of legislation for the protection of the chosen few, at the expense <Col N="378" /> of the patient, the all-too patient many, and for that reason I shall vote against it.</P>

      <P>There is one point I should like to make in relation to what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said in reference to Section 4, that is, the section which the Minister stated keeps the tea trade in the hands of our own nationals.  I should like him to consider that section again, in the light, or in the possibility, of a branch of a big company in Mincing Lane or anywhere else starting up as importers, and the possibility of an Indian firm coming over here, sending representatives over here, and starting off as an importing firm in this country.  Not alone would they have the expert knowledge of both sides of the business&mdash;that is not my chief point&mdash;but, in addition, such a firm starting a business here might possibly lead to a greater interest, though maybe only in a small way, in our trade with India.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a pity not to leave a way open by way of licence from the Minister for such a firm as that coming over and starting business in this country.  They could import tea and might import other things, and this might possibly lead to a greater export trade with India.  This is quite possible at a time when we are looking to get people from abroad to take an interest in manufacturing in this country.  In any case, it would be a possible outlet for some of our manufactured goods.  If a national of India were encouraged to come here and start a trade, it might lead to greater things in the future.</P>

It seems very strange that he is now engaged in defending the claims of external traders to handle our tea trade, to make a profit on it and to sell tea to us here cheaper than we can buy it ourselves in the countries of origin.  He talked about 1940 and 1941 and said that this Bill is doing away with the system that obtained during <Col N="379" /> those years.

The Bill is designed, as anyone who reads it will learn, to continue the system of buying from the countries of origin.  As has been stated, both here and in the Dáil, the purpose of the Bill is to bring to an end the arrangements for the importation of tea which began during the war.  For our part, we believe that the policy of purchasing directly from the producing countries is the best.  I do not claim to be an expert like Senator Barry, but I do know that Tea Importers, Limited, was a non-profit-making concern set up under emergency conditions with a guarantee from the Minister for Finance regarding its bank accommodation. Now that conditions are normal, or are regarded as such, the temporary arrangements are being replaced, as I read it, by this measure.</P>
      <P>Most businessmen who have had experience of emergency conditions will readily agree with the arguments put forward by the Minister in the Dáil in support of this measure.  He said, and I quote from the Official Report, Volume 165, No. 2, column 248:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I regard it also as a matter of prime importance that the permanent measure should provide that the smaller traders will not be in any more disadvantageous trading position <i>vis-a-vis</i> their richer competitors than was the case before the war when both operated on the London market.  This Bill is the outcome of discussions which were initiated as far back as 1953 with the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association of Ireland, an organisation which is fully representative of the trade. The association are taking steps to form and register a company which <Col N="380" /> will be known as Tea Importers (1958), Limited, and the terms of this Bill must be considered in relation to the memorandum and articles of association of that company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to outline the financial structure of the company and he put in a qualification regarding the alteration of the articles of association which says that the permission of the Minister must be sought before any alteration is, in fact, attempted.  That could be described as a wise decision. It is also to be noted that there are about 90 wholesalers in the country and that new entrants can register, provided they can show the necessary qualifications.  This provision gives to those genuinely interested a chance to become a tea dealer.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been attacked because, as has been said, it rules out buying tea in the London market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>I hope to disabuse a number of the Senator's colleagues also.  Senator Barry is a tea merchant of repute and much experience.  So far as I know he is the only member so qualified in the Seanad.  Therefore, Senators will attach to his words a great deal of weight, and, perhaps, visualise this debate as one between an ill-informed amateur like myself and an experienced operator like Senator Barry.  I think, however, Senators must take cognisance right away of the fact that the great majority of the reputable and experienced tea wholesalers of Ireland do not agree with him.</P>

      <P>The Senator put forward that challenge knowing quite well he was safe in doing so, because I could not and would not accept it at this stage.  This matter was submitted to the tea wholesalers of Ireland and the proposals which have come to me and which are embodied in the Bill are those which have been adopted by the majority of them.  I want the Seanad to remember that, even though Senator Barry has all the authority which his experience and standing in the trade give him, he happens in this matter to be in the minority in the trade.  The majority of the tea wholesalers think he is wrong.  Unfortunately, the majority of the tea wholesalers of Ireland are not represented in the Seanad and they have to speak, if they speak at all, through me.</P>

      <P>Senator Barry spoke with authority on the Bill and Senator Sheehy Skeffington began by saying he knew very little about the tea trade and made that more obvious as he proceeded with his remarks.  We have a position in which the statutory basis upon which the tea trade is now carried on in this country is coming to an end <Col N="382" /> on the 30th June next.  It would have ended on the 31st March last but I secured the passage through the Oireachtas of a temporary Bill continuing it for another three months' period.</P>
      <P>What will happen after the 30th June?  There are three courses.  We can, as the previous Government did in 1956, decide to continue the temporary arrangement for a further period.  We can decide to remove all restrictions upon the tea trade and allow everybody to deal in tea by any method he wishes or we can decide, as this Bill suggests we should decide, to institute permanent arrangements which will be beneficial to the country and particularly to the tea consumers of the country.  I think very few people can argue in favour of maintaining the present position.  I am not quite sure why the previous Government so decided in 1956.</P>

      <P>That was the explanation given in the Dáil by Deputy Sweetman who was then Minister for Finance.  He said that Tea Importers, Limited, were so heavily in debt that they could not be allowed to terminate their existence until the debt had been discharged.  That information appears to conflict very much with Senator Barry's assumption that they were selling tea at an exorbitant profit.  If they were selling tea purchased by them at an exorbitant profit they could not have accumulated that debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to do that now.  I am not sure whether Senators are giving this matter consideration from the viewpoint of securing the most practical and efficient arrangement of securing the tea requirements of this country, or from some consideration as to how the external trade of the country could best be carried on generally.  It is quite true that when this State came into existence its distribution system was based in England. All the primary wholesalers who purchased the requirements of this country were located in England.  The warehouses in which the stocks required to meet the day to day needs of retailers were held were located at English ports.  That applied not merely to tea but to tobacco and almost every commodity which has to be imported into this country.</P>
      <P>It was perhaps inevitable, in the days when Ireland and England were one political unit, that the centre of trading activities should be in England.  It was not considered then that that was good for Ireland, and it is rather astonishing to find the idea advocated now that it would be good to get back to that position.  So far as tea is concerned, we have got out of it.  We got out of it by the accident of the war.  Up to the outbreak of war, that situation had remained unchanged, as far as tea is concerned, though it had changed in relation to tobacco and was changing in relation to things like citrus fruits and other commodities, where markets were being opened up in this country and for which warehouses had been built by harbour authorities and other organisations.</P>
      <P>In the case of tea, the situation was more or less unchanged.  In fact, it was even becoming more pronounced, because while Senator Barry talks about some primary wholesalers going out of business now, a lot of Irish primary wholesalers were going out of business before the war.  The British primary merchants were then carrying on an aggressive campaign to secure complete control of the trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of competition provided we can ensure that competition does not lead to monopoly, as it often does, and it was tending to do in this country before the war when the tea trade was largely getting into very limited hands.  Anyway, here we are out of the situation we had in those pre-war days.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington says that I am worried about my prestige.  I pay very little attention to remarks of that kind.  It is not true that this Bill is based on a lingering recollection of the treatment we got during the war.  No doubt the decision to do something to improve the position of the tea trade in this country after the war was taken then, but the measures proposed can, I think, be justified on their merits.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about getting tea during the war was not that we did not have access to India.  If, in another war, there is a blockade of the country and a physical difficulty about transporting tea, we will do without it, as every other country in the same circumstances will.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington was not facing up to the problem which arose in the last war in that connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that, before the last war, we were not buying tea in India, and when the Indian authorities began to allocate tea <Col N="385" /> during the war on the basis of pre-war sales we had no claim to any tea because we were not direct purchasers. The tea we had purchased came through London and the benefit of our purchases of tea accrued to the tea trade of Great Britain.  It is no harm to remind the Seanad that much of the tea that was intended for this country never got to it, because it was blocked in London in circumstances which perhaps it is not necessary to recount, but which certainly could have been brought to an end, if one single important London wholesale merchant had objected to them.  I asked them to do so and none of them would.</P>
      <P>As I said, however, that has nothing to do with the position we are in now. Here we have to decide to do something about the future of tea.  Are we going to allow a situation to develop in which the pre-war conditions will be re-established, or to do something which would appear to be far more to our advantage, to build up a wholesale tea trade of our own, to establish direct contact with the producers of tea in the countries where it is produced, and to organise direct shipments from those countries to our markets?  All the evidence is that, by direct purchase and shipments, we get better tea at lower prices.</P>

I say that the evidence is that, so far, all during the greater part of the 11 years that Tea Importers, Limited, were operating, the average retail price of tea here was lower than in London.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to discuss that, because so far as I know the tea merchants of this country were in a position to get through Tea Importers, Limited, any qualities of tea they wanted but, of course, it was very convenient for a merchant who wanted to lower the price of his tea to buy from <Col N="386" /> Tea Importers, Limited, grades slightly below those he normally had procured and then to meet complaints from his customers by saying: &ldquo;It is not my fault.

No importer in this country tasted tea that was imported for the last 11 years.  That is the point, the only point.  No importer tasted it, whatever about the man in Calcutta who bought it and sold it on commission or brokerage.  We did not taste it.</P>

I am certain that those who were buying tea on their behalf were as competent in the tea trade as any merchant in London or anybody employed by London.

We are both the biggest consumers of tea in the world.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington thinks we are of no significance in the tea market.

      <P>I should not like it to be thought that our trade is of no importance to India.  The Indian Government and the Indian Tea Council have repeatedly emphasised the importance they attach to our trade. Our total imports of tea from India represent considerably more than the re-export of Indian tea from London. Therefore, it is wrong to think of Mincing Lane as a great international market; it is not.  We now have to take into account the policy of the Government of India.  It is to discourage the sending forward of tea on consignment to be auctioned at markets abroad.</P>

      <P>The policy of the Indian Government is to discourage specifically the sending forward of tea for auction.  For that reason, they are imposing a quota on the total quantity of tea that can be exported from India. They are thereby restricting the quantity of tea coming up for auction in London and the other intermediate markets.  Their policy is to encourage auctions in India itself.  Therefore, in the face of it, it seems obvious that we can do better by buying our tea in the auctions in India, rather than in the restricted markets which are now operating in other centres.  By doing so, we are making our policy come into conformity with that of the Government of India.</P>

      <P>They will not be bidding against Irish merchants only. The Senator thinks that, by bulk purchasing of tea, we can do better.  I do <Col N="389" /> not think so.  I will accept Senator Barry's argument that it is far better that we should allow individual merchants to purchase the varieties of tea which they think they require to meet the needs of their trade, having regard to the taste of their customers and perhaps the quality of the water available in the towns they serve.  This Bill is designed to get away from bulk purchases. Where all the requirements of tea were bought by bulk purchases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is quite true, therefore, that what I am trying to do is to get out of a situation in which tea was purchased in bulk by a single organisation <Col N="390" /> and to create a situation where every merchant will be free to buy whatever tea he likes, provided he buys in the country of origin.  Having bought the tea, he must use this organisation as his importing agent.  There, the aim is to secure the economy of bulk shipment which is different from bulk purchase.  Senator Barry asked me what the new company will charge for bringing in tea from the East to Ireland. He says he knows who will be on the board of the company and that they will charge 5 per cent. commission. I do not know that.  Senator Barry must have a crystal ball because this company is not in existence yet.</P>

      <P>Any tea merchant in Ireland is free to become a shareholder of the company.  I am told 50 or so will become shareholders of the company.  They will meet and elect their directors.  The company will then be conducted in accordance with the articles of association already drafted. These articles preclude them from making profits for the purpose of distributing undue dividends to their members.  The dividend is limited. The company will not be interested in making any profit on its transactions over and above the amount required to remunerate the capital employed in it and to meet their operating expenses, so that they will have no reason for treating their shareholders any differently from any other tea traders, those who do not decide to become shareholders.</P>
      <P>When I talk about confining the trade to Irish nationals, it is true, of course, that firms who are now in the business will be allowed to continue&mdash; and some are externally controlled organisations, and some are very big organisations.</P>

      <P>A lot of them operate chain stores here which are a very important part of the retail organisation of the country.  All we say is that anyone else who comes into the trade must be an Irish national, as defined in the section.  The idea is to prevent the reappearance in our market of these &ldquo;brass plate&rdquo; merchants, who were undermining the genuine Irish wholesale merchants and who were operating before the war; and indeed producing a situation which at that time was causing a great deal of concern here.  Subject to that limitation, that the people must be Irish nationals, there is certainly no intention of having any limitation on their number or any selection of individuals.  Any person who conforms with the conditions defined in this Bill is entitled to become a tea merchant and if he is registered as a tea merchant he is entitled to become a shareholder and cannot be refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, of course, you cannot expect to come into any business without some money.  There again, I was concerned with the possibility that, because of the greater amount of money required to finance purchases direct from the country of origin than would be required to purchase, say, from a wholesaler in London, the smaller merchant would be at a disadvantage compared to the larger merchant.  It was to meet that particular problem that it was proposed that this organisation to be set up by the tea trade would undertake to finance the transactions of any merchant, whether he is a shareholder or not, whatever the scale of his operations should be.  If his problem in buying it in the country of origin is a financial one, they will provide the finance.  One of the reasons for the single importing system, for giving them the sole importing rights, is that, in that situation, they can hope to raise from the banking system of Ireland the substantial amount of money which may be required to provide finance for tea merchants in that way, without the aid of a Government <Col N="392" /> guarantee which the existing company has.</P>
      <P>Senator Cole talked about the possibility of an Indian firm setting up as a wholesale tea merchant here.  I should hope that, in the course of time, we would move in a different direction altogether.  I have said that it is the present policy of the Indian Government to discourage the sending forward of tea on consignment to be auctioned in international markets.  I do not know whether that policy will be maintained or not, because at least one of the States of India is acting in a contrary way and by doing so is in conflict with the policy of the Central Indian Government.  If there should be a change of policy there, I would hope to see developing in Dublin a tea auction, a tea market such as Mincing Lane or Amsterdam, where tea would be sent forward by Indian producers on consignment for auction here in Dublin.  On the whole, I think that is the system which would be most beneficial to us.  It is not likely that that will happen for a considerable period of time and, of course, it may not happen at all if the policy of the Central Indian Government becomes effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to pretend that I can argue with Senator Barry at all upon the technique of the tea trade.  I cannot. I am relying on the fact that the proposal which I am putting to the Seanad now is a proposal which was made to me by the majority of the wholesale tea merchants in the country. I asked them in framing their proposals for the conduct of the tea trade after the ending of the present temporary emergency arrangements, to keep in mind only two requirements of Government policy&mdash;one was that we should maintain the practice of buying tea where it is produced and, secondly, that we should confine the wholesale tea trade in Ireland to firms in Irish ownership and under Irish management.  I felt that, notwithstanding these limitations, it was possible for the wholesale tea traders to institute arrangements for the acquisition and sale of tea which would enable us to get tea here cheaper than we could otherwise get it and in such qualities as the merchants <Col N="393" /> themselves wished to have it.  I am not going to say that our merchants will always buy the best quality.  No doubt, purely commercial considerations will determine the range of qualities they will buy; but they are certainly free to buy any qualities they like and it seems to me obviously common sense that we can get that tea cheaper without having to pay commission to middlemen in other countries and by shipping it direct from the countries of origin in cargo lots.  That is the justification for the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Local Government Bill, 1958&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In all major branches of the public service, there is a compulsory retiring age.  Power was given to Ministers by Section 23 of the Local Government Act, 1941, in respect of offices for which each such Minister is the appropriate Minister, to declare an age limit for all or any of the various categories of posts in the local government service.  The section contemplated that this might be done in a piecemeal way because of the wide variety of jobs and the differing conditions surrounding them.</P>
      <P>As regards offices for which I am responsible as Minister for Local Government, Orders were made in 1942, 1943, 1946, 1951 and 1957, fixing 65 as the retiring age for holders of local offices who would be entitled to a pension when they retired.  The 1957 Order is the &ldquo;age limit Order&rdquo; referred to in the Bill.  It is a consolidating Order and completes the process of fixing an age limit for all local offices for which the Minister for Local Government is the appropriate Minister.  Only a small number of offices remained to be dealt with: the others have been covered by previous Orders which the comprehensive 1957 Order superseded and revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act of 1941, and the subsequent <Col N="394" /> amending Acts, are intended to be a complete code of law governing the appointment and tenure of officers of local authorities.  Accordingly, they apply not only to officers appointed after 1941 but to all serving officers, whenever appointed.  A major feature of the Act of 1941 was the age limit section; and age limits, as I have explained, were progressively applied to all existing officers of local authorities. The issue of whether it was correct to alter the tenure of existing officers in this way and to require them to retire when they had reached the age limit was decided in 1941.  Since then, many hundreds of local officers then in office have been retired under age limit.  Special superannuation arrangements exist to compensate those who retire with less than full service.</P>
    <P>Virtually all local officers had, before the Act of 1941, a legal tenure that they hold office &ldquo;until they die, resign or are removed from office&rdquo;.  This tenure was granted under statutory regulation. In a few cases the equivalent tenure was granted under statute.  An Order under Section 23 of the Act of 1941 could override a tenure itself granted by statutory regulation, but some doubts arose in cases in which the tenure was granted by statute.  Section 24 of the Local Government Act, 1955, and the Second Schedule of the Act, which amend Section 23 of the Act of 1941, were enacted to remove those doubts.  By these provisions, a declaration fixing an age limit in respect of an office or offices was to relate to them</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... notwithstanding any other provision made by or under statute in relation to holding such offices ... (including in particular a provision for holding office until death, resignation or removal from office) and in any such case the declaration and this section shall have effect notwithstanding such other provision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was specifically addressed to existing holders of these offices.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the special legislation in the Act of 1955 was that all the local officers concerned should be treated alike.  A development such as an age <Col N="395" /> limit introduced during one's service is naturally unpopular with the officers affected by it.  It is fair only where it applies equally to all officers, and this element of fairness takes on a special point where the senior officers are concerned.  That is the position it was sought to secure under the Act of 1955 and the Order of 1957.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the definition of &ldquo;relevant offices&rdquo; in the Bill and from the repeals in Section 3, the offices with this special statutory tenure are those of county manager and city manager.  No doubt arises about county managers: the 1955 Act effectively equated their tenures with other local officers and they are mentioned in this Bill simply because to leave them out might lead to doubts at a subsequent date as to why they were not dealt with now.  But some doubt remains in relation to the four offices of city manager, because of the fact that each of them gets its tenure from a specific provision of a specific Act. One of these offices has been vacant for some time and of the other three only one&mdash;the city managership of Cork&mdash;has been held by the present holder since before the passing of the Act of 1941.</P>
    <P>To the layman, and indeed to a number of lawyers, the intention and the effect of the Act of 1955 are clear enough; but it appears that the intention and the effect have not been put beyond all doubt.  For that reason the Government decided that the issue should be finally resolved by legislation.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, therefore, the Bill raises no new issue of principle: it merely clarifies something that it was definitely intended to provide for in the Act of 1955.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to facilitate the <Col N="396" /> provision of finance for the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, with a view to making available additional capital for the development of industry.  It is part of Government policy to expedite and increase the flow of capital to productive investment and, in this context, great importance must attach to the rôle of the Industrial Credit Company as the only specialised institution for the provision of capital for industry.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Credit Company was established in accordance with powers given under the Industrial Credit Act, 1933.  The authorised share capital of the company is £5,000,000 in £1 shares of which £2,000,000 has been issued and paid up.  Of the £2,000,000 issued capital, shares to the nominal value of £1,991,393 are held by the Minister for Finance&mdash;all acquired by way of underwriting public issues of the company. The balance of £9,000 odd is in private ownership.</P>
      <P>The present Bill will facilitate the financing of the company in three important ways: firstly, it will enable the Minister for Finance to take up directly shares in the company without the necessity for a public issue; secondly, it will enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee the principal and interest of borrowings by the company; and thirdly, it will enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee the payment of a minimum dividend on shares of the company held by parties other than himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first point, under the provisions of the 1933 Act, shares in the company can be taken up by the Minister for Finance only when an issue has been made by the company for public subscription and the Minister has agreed to take up such shares as the public do not apply for.  In effect, therefore, State assistance to the company has been restricted to the underwriting of public issues of shares by the company.  This is an awkward and unnecessary restriction which does not apply in the case of other State-sponsored companies.  From time to time, market conditions may make a public issue by the company inadvisable, but as the law stands it would have to go through all the formality <Col N="397" /> and incur the expense of a public issue before the State could invest further in the company's shares.  Under the arrangements now proposed, it will be possible to make advances from the Central Fund for the purchase of shares, if so desired, without any prior offer or issue of shares being made to the public, who up to this have, as I indicated, taken up very few shares in the company.  With the present restriction removed, it will be easier to increase the capital resources of the company.  The power to purchase existing shares will also be available should the necessity arise.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as I said, it is proposed under the Bill to take power to guarantee borrowings by the company. This power will extend to borrowings whether by way of the issue of debentures or loan stocks or otherwise within a limit of £5,000,000 on the amount of borrowings which may be guaranteed from time to time.  Thirdly, as I mentioned, power is being taken to guarantee the payment of a dividend on the shares of the company held otherwise than by the Minister for Finance.  No immediate occasion for the exercise of this power is envisaged but it is desirable that the company should have it in reserve as a possible means of attracting capital resources in the future.</P>
    <P>It will be apparent that the extensive powers being taken in this Bill should give the company all the latitude necessary to meet any foreseeable requirements in the raising of additional capital and this in a manner appropriate to the special position of the company in financing new industries.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Company has now been in existence 25 years during which period it has played a most important part in the development of Irish industry.  It is still the only organisation in the country devoted solely to acting as an underwriting and issuing house for industrial securities and operating generally as an industrial financing body.  During the period of its existence the company, with a relatively small permanent capital, has been responsible for the provision of some £16,000,000 of capital for Irish industry. This substantial sum has consisted <Col N="398" /> in the main of capital moneys raised by public flotations underwritten by the company.  The balance has been provided in the form of loans, advances, guarantees, etc. for industry. By the test of its ability to secure capital for industrial enterprise on a scale much greater than its own permanent resources the Industrial Credit Company has been quite successful in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Not only have the company's activities been beneficial to the economy as a whole but, so far as the narrower Exchequer interest is concerned, I am glad to be able to say that the moneys invested in the company have yielded a return to the taxpayer.  The company has made a profit from the beginning and for many years now it has been paying a dividend of 4 per cent. on its share capital.  This is a very creditable achievement when it is remembered that little or no return may be obtained from its investments in new industries during their early years and I wish to pay a special tribute to the directors and staff of the company for the success which they have achieved.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some time now that the resources of the company would have to be enlarged to enable it to discharge more effectively its duties of encouraging new and financing the expansion of existing industrial enterprises. It may be expected that the new industries of the future, directed in the main towards export markets, will require rather heavy capitalisation, apart from the fact of the substantial post-war rise in the cost of capital equipment.  Adjustment to conditions of freer trade in Europe would necessitate considerable outlay on the adaptation and modernisation of existing industries.  We must, therefore, face the position that the scope and importance of the activities of the Industrial Credit Company will undoubtedly increase.</P>
    <P>The authorised share capital of the company, which is £5,000,000, appears sufficient for the present but, if and when the necessity arises, proposals will be brought forward to increase it. As I declared earlier, £3,000,000 of further share capital can, of course, <Col N="399" /> still be issued within the existing limit. This together with the facility of £5,000,000 guaranteed borrowings envisaged for the company, by the present Bill, will bring the total amount which it will be empowered to raise by way of fresh issues of share capital and by guaranteed borrowings to £8,000,000.  The company also has power to borrow where this does not involve the issue of debentures or a Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have been taking place with the Irish commercial banks to secure their participation in the provision of fresh capital for the company. The banks have, of course, played their part in the financing of industry directly by way of advances for working capital and even for long-term capital purposes.  It is, however, a common feature of industrial financing in other countries that the banks provide most, if not all, of the capital for specialised institutions like the Industrial Credit Company.  This method of financing industrial development offers advantages to the banks themselves as well as being in the national interest. It spreads the risks of individual banks over a wide field and precludes identification with the fortunes of individual firms.  Also, it places at their disposal for investment purposes the experience and specialised services of an organisation established to cater for the particular needs of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to the banks that they might consider participating by taking up a substantial block of shares in the company, if necessary, with a guaranteed minimum dividend.  But I understand, however, that they would prefer to make their contribution in the form of guaranteed loan stock rather than shares and they have agreed in principle to make a contribution amounting to £1,800,000 in this way. This will enable the Industrial Credit Company not only to discharge completely its own overdraft indebtedness and to finance directly its liabilities under existing bank guarantees, but also to have available, over and above this, a balance of about £400,000 for new business.  Further, a provision of £500,000 was included for the company <Col N="400" /> in the State Capital Budget 1957-58. This sum could not, as I explained earlier, be issued to purchase directly shares of the company pending the enactment of this Bill.  The amount will, however, be brought forward and used to purchase shares in the company as soon as this Bill is enacted.  The company will, thus, have almost £1,000,000 at call for new projects apart from whatever may become available to it by the turning over of its existing capital.</P>
    <P>This is the first occasion on which the banks have participated on a long-term basis in the financing of the Industrial Credit Company and I would like to express the Government's appreciation of their co-operation and practical assistance in this, no less than other aspects of national development.</P>
    <P>As to the company's further capital requirements, I hope it will be possible to arrange for tripartite financing on the basis of contributions by the banks, insurance companies and the Exchequer.  Apart from being an agency through which Irish savings can be made available for productive industrial development, the Industrial Credit Company could also serve as an agency through which investment of foreign institutional capital in Irish industry might be made.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the enlargement of the resources of the Industrial Credit Company, Limited, it is proposed that the system by which loans for industrial purposes are guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts should be replaced by an alternative system by which similar loans will be provided by the Industrial Credit Company.  One advantage of this change is that applications for assistance in this form can be dealt with more expeditiously and with fewer legal formalities than are necessary under the present system.  There is also advantage in having one organisation dealing with the provision of assistance from State sources for industrial development by way of share and loan capital.</P>
    <P>From the date of the change the acceptance of applications of the ordinary <Col N="401" /> kind from industrial firms by the Department of Industry and Commerce will cease.  In all cases which would previously have been referred to the Advisory Committee set up under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, the applicants will be referred to the Industrial Credit Company.  In settling the amount of resources to be provided for the credit company from time to time account will, of course, be taken of any additional needs of the company for the purpose of their new function.</P>
    <P>The statutory limits fixed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts have nearly been reached, and no further loans of any size could be guaranteed unless amending legislation were enacted.  It is not proposed to repeal the Acts, but it is intended that recourse to them will be made only in very special circumstances to deal with cases which would not come within the functions of the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>I do not have to labour the need for increased productive investment.  There is now, I think, a general awareness that we must increase significantly the proportion of the country's capital resources devoted to such investment if the economy is really to expand.  The new arrangements which I have outlined are designed towards this end in the industrial sector.  The Government are resolved to ensure that the resources of the Industrial Credit Company will be adequate to meet all the reasonable requirements of the financing of industry and they would indeed be very glad to see a continuing growth in these requirements.  They wish to ensure that no industrial project with reasonable prospects, particularly in the export market, will fail to go forward for lack of the necessary capital and I hope that this knowledge will give a confidence and incentive to industrialists to establish new and to re-equip and expand existing industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that the Minister gave us some little information over and above what he gave to the Dáil.  At the same time, he was extremely careful not to disclose anything <Col N="402" /> of the unfortunate history of some of the biggest enterprises that have been established by the Industrial Credit Company since the war.  Since the Minister did not see fit to do so, I am not going to do it, either.  The Minister might have made some reference to the difficulties which patently came about through the investment of the very large sums of money in certain enterprises in which the money is now solidified, iced up&mdash;call it what you like.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for what it does. I particularly want to speak on behalf of the small companies, the small institutions. The Minister informed us at the end of his statement that the trade loan guarantee system would go into disuse.  If that is the case, the Industrial Credit Company will want to change their attitude very much towards the type of enterprise that I have in mind.  I tried to get them to assist a couple of these enterprises of excellent standing and with a good deal of antiquity in this country.  I failed to get any assistance for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister repeated what he said about the Government expressing their appreciation of the co-operation of the commercial banks.  I have no objection to that manner of expressing it, but I do take serious exception to the manner in which this was publicised in the daily newspapers, with inch-high headlines, as if the commercial banks were doing something quite unexpected and that it was of great benefit to the development of industry.</P>
      <P>When that matter came up, Senator Lenihan said at column 165, Volume 9 of the Official Report during the course of his speech on the Central Fund Bill in the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it is a heartening sign that £1,800,000 of that has been advanced by the banks.  It is a very heartening sign to see that expression of confidence in the future of the country, that the banks have seen fit to advance £1,800,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Official Report then continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. O'Donovan: Nonsense.  They had advanced it already.  They only moved it down one niche on their balance sheet.</P>

      <Col N="403" /> Mr. Lenihan: Senator O'Donovan is on his old hobby-horse again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I was on a hobby-horse or not.  I do not know what kind of a horse Senator Lenihan was riding.  What happened to him was that, in his hurry to prepare his speech, he read only the Minister's statement part of the way.  When he came to the end of the paragraph, he dropped off.</P>
    <P>To prove my point, I will read out what the Minister said in the Dáil and what he repeated to-day more or less but, perhaps, not word for word.  Here is what he said in the Dáil at column 715, Volume 166 of the Official Report on Friday, 21st March, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was suggested to the banks that they might consider participating by taking up a substantial block of shares in the company, if necessary, with a guaranteed minimum dividend; but I understand they would prefer to make their contribution in the form of guaranteed loan stock rather than shares.  What matters&mdash;and I am glad to announce this&mdash;is that they have agreed in principle to make a contribution amounting to £1,800,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan stopped off at that point.  I have no objection to the manner in which the commercial banks handled this, but the Minister went on to say in the next paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This will enable the Industrial Credit Company not merely to discharge completely its own overdraft indebtedness and to finance directly its liabilities under existing bank guarantees, but also to have available, over and above this, a balance of about £400,000 for new business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that the commercial banks were going to allow the Industrial Credit Company to convert £1.4 million of overdraft into an investment.  In other words, taking the statement in the last number of the <i>Quarterly Statistical Bulletin</i> of the Central Bank, it means moving it down from item No. 4 in the banks' balance sheets to item No. 5, No. 4 being loans and <Col N="404" /> advances, and transferring it down to item No. 5.  Again, should we be unduly grateful to the banks for doing this?  I do not think so.  The investments in item No. 5 in their balance sheet in this country are about £34,000,000.  The investments across the water in Britain are £109,000,000 approximately, so that we have invested here about £34,000,000 and over £109,000,000 invested across the water.</P>
    <P>Again, I am not concerning myself with the position of the commercial banks in the matter.  I think they have been co-operative, but what I do not like to see is this soft-pedalling on the part of the Minister of a position which really should have been frankly exposed by him.  I should be quite entitled to disclose it.  It is common property round this city what companies they are whose shares cannot and are never able to be sold on the stock exchange and who have never been able to make a profit of any sort.  I think it would have been better if the Minister told us frankly what the position was, straight, fair and square, especially in view of the fact that in Dáil Éireann he said at column 717:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is unnecessary for me to speak at length on the need for increased productive investment.  There is now general appreciation that we must increase significantly the proportion of the nation's capital resources which is devoted to such investment if the economy is to expand&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the Minister, but let me say this about it.  There are really three sorts of investment.  There is the social investment which does not pay for itself at all, that is to say, what is called the housing of the labouring classes.  I use the phrase &ldquo;housing of the labouring classes&rdquo; because that was in the Acts traditionally. There is the other group of housing, under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, which does pay for itself and is quite as productive as anything else.  There can be no difference of opinion about that.</P>
    <P>Then you go into the territory of production in the sense of the producing of goods or services which can be exported.  You have one that is productive, in the sense that it pays <Col N="405" /> for itself financially and one which is not productive in that it does not do so.  A great deal of the talk about increasing production is doing grave disservice to the political system in the manner in which it is being floated around the country week after week, because there is too much evidence in one part of the economy, at any rate, that increased production gives rise to talling prices.</P>
    <P>It is all right, of course, for a monopoly concern that is producing a single article within a closed economy. It does not have to worry about falling prices, if it can sell its product within the community.  But I do notice again in the Minister's statement in relation to the banks to-day that he has made what I take as a hint of something which has been agreed with the banks.  I see no objection to making £400,000 available from the commercial banks and £500,000 from the Minister out of his Budget for capital purposes to the Industrial Credit Corporation, if too much of it is not sunk in one or two big disastrous investments, such as have been incurred at certain stages since the war.  Perhaps that is a good hint that it should not be put into very large-scale investments unless there is a great deal of assurance that those investments will pay for themselves and be worth while.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day used a phrase which, I think, was new and was not in his statement to the Dáil, that this arrangement insulated the banks against the financing of individual firms.  That was probably desirable, that they should be insulated in that fashion and should make moneys available in a block way to the Industrial Credit Company and that then they would not be expected to finance enterprises in which there was an undue degree of risk.  It does not, I hope, suggest what I have been referring to, that we might again have investments in new firms on such a large scale that sizable sums of money would be lost.</P>
    <P>It is true, indeed, that when you have continuous inflation and a falling off in the value of money, you can never be quite sure that money is lost, <Col N="406" /> since it may eventually be caught up on, and therefore investments made ten years ago might eventually pay off through the loss in the value of money. But I do hope that the Industrial Credit Company, when it gives these new moneys, will show a great deal more regard for small firms which require £5,000 or £10,000, instead of putting sums of the order of £250,000 into individual concerns.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the Minister is to be complimented for having made these arrangements.  It gets the Industrial Credit Company out of a jam, and I suppose the banks are no worse off, as between having an overdraft of £1.4 million, which is frozen, and having debenture or something of that sort, guaranteed loan stock, at the same amount.  In fact, what the commercial banks are doing, for Senator Lenihan's information, is putting up £400,000.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to speak on this Bill.  I simply rise to ask a question which the Minister might perhaps elucidate in his reply.  The Minister referred to the desirability of building up additional export industries, and we know that this is the subject of another Bill which will be coming before the House in a couple of weeks' time, the External Investment Bill.  In the excellent brochure which was published by the Industrial Development Authority for foreign circulation, it was stated that one of the advantages in this country was the presence of the Industrial Credit Corporation to assist in the raising of capital.  I should like to know from the Minister, because it does not appear to me to be clear in this Bill or the other Bill, whether facilities will be available by the Industrial Credit Corporation for new external companies which will come into this country under the External Investment Bill, which has changed its name in the course of its career.  I am asking genuinely with a desire to get information, and there is no question of making any point.</P>

      <P>I wish to make one observation. On the Central Fund Bill, I referred to many of the disadvantages which a private company was suffering from under the law here.  I wish to <Col N="407" /> inform the Seanad that recently I had to approach the Industrial Credit Company with regard to raising capital for private companies, and I was informed by the Industrial Credit Company that one of the disadvantages that corporation laboured under was the fact that they were not permitted to lend moneys to private companies as redeemable preference shares, and that if they had that power and authority, they would in many cases assist those smaller companies. Senator O'Donovan mentioned that we are all thinking of the person who wants a quarter of a million pounds, but there are hundreds of companies who want £5,000 or £10,000, and we ought to bring the law up-to-date in order to be in a position to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan said that I should have made some reference to the unfortunate experiences of the Industrial Credit Company.  I have some knowledge of what Senator O'Donovan is hinting at, and I think he will find, if he waits a while, that some of these experiences have not been as bad as they might appear at present.  In any case it is not a good thing to give the impression that a company of this kind has been unsuccessful in its investments.  It has been there for 25 years and paid 4 per cent. on its capital, and I take it that they did that without being unduly liberal in paying out money for interest.</P>
      <P>In dealing with a finance company, we must treat their affairs with a certain amount of reserve.  People who deal with them like to have their affairs treated in confidence and we cannot, of course, mention names, but on the whole we must claim that the company has been very successful.  It would be miraculous if a company like that could go on over 25 years without coming up against a bad case here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan said that, if the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts facilities were removed, this company would have to change its attitude somewhat. I am informed they have lent to very small companies.  I was told, when I made the inquiry myself when preparing this Bill, that they have actually <Col N="408" /> come down as far as £2,000 in one of their loans.  There, they are not too big to consider the case put up by the small man.  As Senator Burke pointed out, there is a difficulty about a certain type of private company.  It would be impossible for me to put that right in this Bill.  It must be made right in a Bill dealing with company law, which is due to make its appearance.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donovan said we should not be unduly grateful to the banks.  I suppose we should not be unduly grateful to anybody, but we do not want to be churlish so we try to take the middle course and say we are thankful to the banks for what they have done.  Senator O'Brien asked me about their attitude towards foreign companies.  There is nothing to preclude their making a loan to a foreign company which comes in here to set up for export business.  So far, I do not think they have done so.  It is left an open question.  I think that, if it were the deciding factor in bringing in a desirable company to do export business, it would be well that we should give them the power to make a loan to help them to get into business.</P>

    <Title>Price of Wheat&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann deeply deplores the arrangements for the pricing of wheat of the 1958 crop as recently announced by the Government, and strongly recommends that the matter be reconsidered and that the price for the entire 1958 crop be <Col N="409" /> not less than that for 1957.&mdash; Senators Donegan and L'Estrange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent action of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government in reducing the price of wheat is a retrograde step and one which may have a far-reaching effect. We all know that, for the past ten or 15 years, the farmers have been called upon to increase production, to work harder and to produce more for the Irish nation.  We know that they have done so and they deserved better of the Minister and the Government than a sweeping reduction of this kind.</P>
      <P>The farmers find themselves in a difficult position at the present time. It was unfair of the Minister to wait until January, until the farmers had their land ready for sowing, before he made any announcement.  We remember how often over the past few years Deputy Dillon was twitted in the Dáil about not making an announcement during October or November.  We know that many farmers were unable to stock their land, due to the high price prevailing for cattle; and we know that cattle prices collapsed during 1956 on account of the glut of Argentine beef on the British market. Due to those causes, over which the farmers had no control, many farmers went in for increased tillage.  The farmers should have been given at least a year's notice.  The price for 1958 should have remained the same as for 1957 and the farmers should have been given a year in which to try to readjust themselves.  The Government are to a large extent to blame for the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various speakers on the Government side of the House state that no promises were made.  We all know that is altogether wrong.  Promises were made.  I myself attended Mass in Leighlinbridge during the by-election and the Minister for Agriculture addressed the meeting after Mass.  He strutted up and down like a peacock from one chapel gate to the other; and, indeed, he warmed the farmers' hearts there that day, by promising them, as he promised&mdash;and I defy contradiction on that point&mdash;that if they were returned, they would give <Col N="410" /> the farmers the price that Deputy Walsh gave them for wheat&mdash;a price of 82/6 a barrel.  There was a definite promise to the farmers of Carlow and Kilkenny.  The canvassers going round from door to door made the very same promise to the farmers of Carlow and Kilkenny, that if they were returned, the price of wheat would be increased to 82/6 per barrel.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his radio address spoke about the cruel and unjust price of wheat.  Can anybody who was listening to that say that it was not a definite promise, that if Fianna Fáil were elected, they would restore that price?  Instead of that, they have reduced the price by at least a further 12/6 per barrel.  In 1954, after the reduction at that time, Deputy Walsh, the late Minister, stated, and it appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i>, that the farmers of Ireland were losing £2,000,000, due to the drastic reduction in the price of wheat.  We know that the farmers were fooled into voting for Fianna Fáil, believing that if they were returned to power, the price would be increased immediately.  What is the position to-day of the farmer?  Over the past few years, many of them went to the Credit Corporation and to the banks and went into debt to mechanise their farms as they were told by different Governments and Ministers to do.</P>
    <P>Many of them bought their machinery on the hire purchase system.  They bought extra tractors, combines, and combine drills, and now we find that those people are to suffer and suffer very heavily because of the Minister's action.  I say that the Minister and the Government are to blame to a very large extent.</P>
    <P>I quote from Volume 161, column 43 of the Official Debates in the Dáil. Deputy Corry had the following question down to the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, in view of the absolute necessity for increasing the wheat acreage this year, and in view of the endorsement of the wheat policy by the people, he will state what steps he intends to take to secure by financial inducement an increased wheat acreage this season and if, in view of the lateness <Col N="411" /> of the season, he will make an immediate statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken had the full facts and he could have stated to Deputy Corry that he knew there was enough wheat being grown and there was no need for any further financial inducements to grow more wheat, but he allowed that question to be asked.  The reply which he gave was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No alteration of the price of wheat in these last days of March could appreciably affect the acreage of wheat this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know that that, in itself, can also be taken as a definite promise last April, because if the Minister wanted to face up to the situation, he would have stated at the same time: &ldquo;We believe that the present price is high enough and sufficient wheat will be grown to supply our home needs.&rdquo;  That is the answer that any Minister would have made, if he did not want to fool the people and make political propaganda out of this whole question.  It is only right that we should expose the fraud, the dishonesty and the broken promises of Fianna Fáil regarding the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the inter-Party Government were faced with a similar problem and they took courageous action.  They told the people the truth.  They told them exactly what they were going to do and they told the farmers exactly what they would get for their wheat. At the present time, the farmers have no stability.  No farmer to-day knows what he will get for one barrel of wheat next September, October or November, when it has to go into the mills.  We all know that Radio Eireann tried to fool the farmers by the announcement they made on the day the Minister made the Order.  The announcement was that wheat prices were to be the same as during 1957. That was a misleading statement by Radio Eireann.</P>
    <P>There are those who state that the Fianna Fáil Party made no promises. Fianna Fáil had a paper called <i>An Gléas</i> which was sent to Deputies and some of the Senators, and it was the official organ of the Fianna Fáil Party. Here is what that paper had to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" />&ldquo;A few days ago the Taoiseach received a deputation from the National Farmers' Association which put the case for restoring the price of wheat to the 1954 level.  From every point of view it is to be hoped that the Government would overrule Mr. Dillon and accept the unanswerable case which has been made for a restoration of the Fianna Fáil price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What did that mean?  The Fianna Fáil price was 82/6 and was not that again a definite promise to give them 82/6, if Fianna Fáil were returned to power? The article continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is now recognised by all that the slashing of the wheat price was a grave error of judgment by the Government....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the help the Government of that day got and they had to take action similar to the action being taken by the Government at the present time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The result of this error will become still more serious should there be a further fall this year in the acreage under wheat.  Only an immediate Government decision to restore the 1954 price can save Irish wheat growing from disaster.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And still, with the reduction of the price of wheat, this article and the people who wrote it have been proved completely wrong.  Instead of an increase in the price of wheat, we have the very opposite.  A glut of wheat went to the mills during the past two years.</P>
    <P>In March, 1956, the same organ stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1954, the Coalition Government cut the price of wheat by 12/6 a barrel and so brought about a reduction in the wheat acreage of 120,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was more lying propaganda. Perhaps we should not blame the Minister altogether for trying to throw the blame elsewhere because we all know that we have a &ldquo;towny&rdquo; Government and Cabinet at the present time.  At the same time, I cannot understand the course taken by <Col N="413" /> the Minister.  I know he was in a difficult position and I suppose it was very hard for him, being the one lone farmer in the Cabinet, to put any argument up on behalf of the farmers. It goes to show what a strong Government can do and even if there was no opposition in the Cabinet to that price, we know that Fianna Fáil T.D.s and Senators throughout the country are at present lamenting the cut in the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the <i>Kilkenny People</i> of April 5th, we see where Deputy Gibbons spoke at length about the reduction in the price of wheat and went on to say that this indication of Government policy was most disturbing. He was not satisfied about the reduction, but, of course, with the strong Government, the lone farmer who is trying to stand up for the farmers had got very little chance and his words were not listened to.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party state that we are growing too much wheat, that our agricultural policy has become lop-sided. Perhaps some of us would agree with that, but that nobody is to blame for that but themselves.  As I stated before, when Deputy Dillon pointed out in 1954 that we were going to have a glut of wheat, Fianna Fáil told the farmers: &ldquo;Not at all; we will restore the price, and instead of having a glut, we are not going to have enough.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil led the people to believe that if they were returned to power, the farmers would get 82/6 a barrel for wheat.  We in Fine Gael remember the sneers and gibes when our first industries were started, when the beet factories and the Shannon scheme were begun, when they were supposed to be &ldquo;white elephants.&rdquo; Were it not for the fact that the Shannon scheme was started in 1924, we could have had no industrial expansion during the 1930's and 1940's. I remember when the people on the Fine Gael side of the House were referred to as grass farmers, as ranchers, when they were supposed to be supplying beef to John Bull.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is obvious that what we ought to seek to export are the things which give the best returns. At the moment, it appears that cattle give the best returns.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Taoiseach did not see the light 20 or 25 years ago when he was telling us that the British market was gone, gone forever, thanks be to God, and instead of keeping cattle, the farmers should keep bees.  We in Fine Gael always believed in a balanced agricultural economy and not in a lop-sided economy.  We never tried to kill the cattle industry, though there was a time when one was not considered a good Irishman unless he went in for nothing but wheat.  If a farmer was raising and selling cattle, he was referred to as a British agent, a rancher or a grazier.</P>

      <P>We in Fine Gael have always believed in a balanced agricultural economy.  We have always believed that farmers should do a certain amount of tillage and keep a certain number of cattle.  They should not go in for cattle or tillage alone. As Deputy Dillon, the previous Minister for Agriculture, pointed out, we should preserve the fertility of our soil.  We have 12,000,000 acres of fertile soil and a population of 2,500,000 people.  We have five acres for every person in the country and if our farmers were given fair play&mdash;they have got that to a certain degree during the past ten or 12 years&mdash;if they got a proper lead from the top, they could solve all our ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told in the past that Fine Gael were an anti-wheat party.  It is extraordinary that it was during the term of office of Deputy Dillon that we <Col N="415" /> had a surplus of wheat.  It should be borne in mind also that we got the surplus from less than half the acreage of land which we had under wheat in 1946.  We got that surplus from a little over 300,000 acres of land and that is something of which we should be proud. It is something we should encourage the farmers to do.  These 300,000 acres were producing more wheat than was produced by 600,000 acres in 1946, and the other 300,000 acres were producing cattle.  Now we all know the value of cattle to our national economy.</P>

      <P>When the inter-Party Government were faced with a similar situation in 1954, when the price of wheat was 82/6 a barrel, they took certain action by reducing the price of wheat by 12/6 per barrel.  They had to do that in the national interest and they got very little support or sympathy from the people who were in opposition at that time.  However, the farmers knew what they were going to get for the wheat which they would produce during 1955 and 1956. In the present year, 1958, it is anticipated by people in the know that the price of wheat will be reduced by at least 12/6 per barrel.  That means that, taking an average of eight barrels to the acre, there will be a sweeping reduction of £5 per acre for every acre of wheat the farmers produce.  Taking a small farmer who has 30 acres of land, though it must be remembered that 70 per cent. of the farmers have less than 30 acres, if he grows four acres of wheat, he will lose £20 in his income by the Government action taken recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if the Government think that farmers' profits are <Col N="416" /> too high.  We know that during the past ten or 12 years a certain amount of progress has been made by the farmers, but the majority of our small farmers, who are the backbone of the nation, are the hardest worked and the worst paid section of the community. These are the people who will be asked to bear a further loss of £5 per acre on every acre of wheat they sow this year.  The profit on wheat, even in the past, has been small. Senator Lenihan, when he was speaking here on 12th March, as reported in Volume 49, column 79, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is the net problem facing a Government which has to take all sections of the community into account in making a policy decision &mdash;farmers, trade unionists, shopkeepers, industrialists and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they have taken all sections of the community into account, but I do know that the heavy hand of this Government has fallen on the farmers.  The trade unionists have got a 10/- increase in their weekly wages.  Civil servants have got £1,200,000 extra during the past week. Industrialists have been allowed to get increases for any commodities they are producing or selling of 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. and the millers got a gift of £130,000.  Biscuit manufacturers are now getting flour at the export price of £20 a ton, £70,000 of the taxpayers' money being devoted to supporting the biscuit manufacturers.</P>
    <P>If, as Senator Lenihan said, the Government are trying to be fair to all sections, what have the farmers got? The price of wheat is cut by at least 12/6 a barrel.  There is a reduction of 5/- per cwt. in the price of pigs.  There is a 9/- reduction in the price of barley, taking the 1956 price.  Farmers' rates are still increasing throughout the country and the farmer's wife has to pay 6d. extra for a loaf and 3/- extra for a stone of flour.  I do not think it can be said that the Government are treating all sections fairly.  The farmers have always been prepared to pay their fair share of the burden.  They did it in the past and any time they were called upon to increase production or help the nation, they did so.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Government <Col N="417" /> that they cannot have one policy for the industrialist, the miller, the civil servant and the non-agricultural consumer and another for the farming section of the community.  The farmers will not become hewers of wood and drawers of water.  No Government&mdash;I do not care who they are&mdash;will stay long in office, if they attempt to make the farmer the pack mule for the non-agricultural interest in this country. That is what is being done at the present time and very few can deny that.</P>
    <P>The farmers have been in the front line trenches in every war in this country in the past, national, social and economic.  They saved this country during the emergency.  Despite the fact that they were short of machinery and fertilisers, they produced enough wheat for us in this country.  Instead of getting a pat on the back or a little encouragement, they get a drastic cut in prices.  No other section of the community has been asked to work harder and produce more, and having worked harder and produced more they find that, instead of getting increased remuneration, they suffer a decrease in their income.  That is very unfair.</P>
    <P>We may be asked what we would do. As far as we are concerned, at the present time, it is the Fianna Fáil Party who are in power.  It is they who made the promises to the people and told them before they were elected what they would do.  Now, having been elected, they are not living up to the promises they made to the people in 1957.  I would say that if our Party were in office, they would tell the people the truth.  If the price of wheat had to be reduced, they would say they were reducing the price of wheat by 5/-, 6/- or 10/- a barrel, or by whatever sum they thought it right or necessary to reduce it.</P>
    <P>Nobody can tell what the price of wheat will be next September or October, or whether it will be 60/- a barrel.  I see a Senator smiling.  Is a farmer not entitled to know just the same as any other member of the community? If a man goes to work in an industry, he is not told at the end of the week that he will get £8 or £10. He knows, when he is going in, what <Col N="418" /> he will get.  Farmers are asked to work in the dark without any stability and without any knowledge of what they will get next October or November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows at the present time.  Surely the farmers are entitled to know.  There are many, indeed, who say that the farmer may have to sell his wheat for as low as £3 a barrel.  The cost of living has increased; his rates have increased; his overhead expenses have increased; and the price of fertilisers has increased since 1954.  What would happen to the farmers if they had to sell their wheat next harvest at 60/- per barrel?</P>
      <P>If we are relying on a quota of 300,000 tons of native wheat, it means we must import 125,000 tons of wheat this year, at a cost of £3,500,000 to the taxpayers, at a time when we are told that money is scarce.  I remember we were told by a certain Party which stood for self-sufficiency and self-support that if all the ships were sent to the bottom of the ocean, we would do without the rest of the world. Now, when farmers are producing all the wheat we need, we are not prepared to take it from them.  We are taking only 70 per cent. of our needs. We are going to import 125,000 tons at a cost of £3,500,000.  The present quota means that only 70 per cent. of native wheat will be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that 95 per cent. of Irish wheat be used in the grist, with <Col N="419" /> an extraction rate of 75 per cent.  On all available evidence, this would produce a first-class loaf.  It would mean that about 390,000 tons of native wheat could be used for flour making.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated yesterday that the biscuit manufacturers were getting 8,000 tons for biscuit manufacture.  The 390,000 tons, plus the 8,000 tons, would mean that the millers would be using 398,000 tons or, roughly, 400,000 tons of native Irish wheat.</P>
    <P>Last year, the production of Irish wheat was in the region of 370,000 tons. According to estimates that are being made, we may produce at least 400,000 tons or perhaps 405,000 tons of wheat this year.  If the Minister agrees to the suggestion, it would mean that there might be a reduction of only around 2/6 or 3/- per barrel in the price of wheat.  That would be fair to everybody in the country, and I would say that it would not be too hard on the farmers.  The Institute of Industrial Research and Standards has shown that a 100 per cent. Irish loaf can be produced, even with an 80 per cent. extraction. I think it has been produced by some of our commercial bakeries, and for a lengthy period, it was used in the Curragh Camp, and the quality of the bread produced there was excellent. There have been very few complaints about it.  Even if the Minister was not satisfied with an 80 per cent. extraction rate, we could reduce it to 75 or 72, which would still make a loaf of very high quality and almost all Irish.</P>
    <P>Sweden is a country similar to ours and grows the varieties of wheat which we grow, and it can produce a loaf made 100 per cent. from flour from its own wheat.  The Swedes say that they have no complaints and that it is a first-class loaf.</P>
    <P>I have not very much more to say, except this, which I know will arouse laughter&mdash;that the Party politicians should stop threshing wheat and the whole question should be taken out of the realm of Party politics.  Perhaps Senator Carter might remember when he was in the other House in 1954, 1955 and 1956, when the price of wheat was reduced and he was listening to the former Senator Cogan and others <Col N="420" /> who were Deputies at that time speaking about what had happened.  It was a very different story then that the Fianna Fáil Deputies had to tell the electorate.  In any case, I think that there should be a wheat board set up something similar to the peat board. It should be comprised of representatives of the producers, the millers and the Department.  If we had that, perhaps it would be better for everybody in the end.  The farmer might get a fair crack of the whip and we could have stability and a fair price for all.</P>

A person who used an expression like that seems to be very lucky when he is able to define for himself where he will be found dead and that he will not be found dead in a field of wheat.  What amuses me is that those people must have lost all sense of responsibility to come in now and speak about the price of wheat.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not rise very often in this House, but I rise to speak as a farmer.  I have listened to the tirade of Senator L'Estrange.  I can call it nothing but a tirade of abuse of the personnel of the Cabinet and of everything else.  To my mind, it would be amusing, if it were not so serious, to listen to the whole thing.  We all know quite well that we would not be discussing the price of wheat here this evening, were it not for the attitude of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1928, a commission was set up to discuss the growing of wheat in this country and they rejected it, and said that wheat could not be grown.  There is a minority report there, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, Deputy Ryan and others, can be found on the files in the Library down to 1932.  We advocated that policy off the public platforms and we are proud of it.</P>
      <P>In 1932 we had, as Senator Ó Donnabháin has mentioned, only 22,000 acres of wheat.  It would have been very easy to define the price of wheat at that time.  It would not cost the Exchequer very much.  Fianna Fáil advocated the growing of wheat and when the war was thrust upon us, we were able to feed ourselves.  Not alone were we able to feed ourselves, but the people who despised that growing of wheat and everything else found they were able to eat it, that it was highly nutritious and produced good bread.  We regard the growing of wheat in this country at present as the fruit of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
      <P>We have a surplus of wheat.  Senator L'Estrange talked about the mechanisation of farms, what they have put into it, and so on.  It is significant, however&mdash;as Senator Tunney said here the other evening&mdash;that men can be found who will pay £20 to £25 per acre for land on the 11 months' system for the growing of wheat.  I suggest they are growing wheat for what they can get out of it and not from national or any other motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see some system such as the sugar beet system in relation to the growing of wheat.  I believe <Col N="423" /> there will have to be an acreage allocation in the future.  We are faced with the problem of a surplus of wheat. Can the Opposition suggest what we should do with that surplus?  We know what it has cost the Exchequer to dispose of it.  Not alone have we a big surplus of wheat on hands, but, as Senator L'Estrange said, we may have an even greater surplus after this year's harvest.  People have gone in for wheat growing now because there is money in it.  In 1932 and in succeeding years, there was a great prejudice against wheat growing.  It was decried from the housetops by certain Parties and there was no secret about it. Despite all the prejudice, it has been proved that wheat can successfully be grown in this country, just as it was grown in the past.</P>
    <P>In discussing a matter such as the price of wheat, we should endeavour as much as possible to come down to fundamentals and leave out personalities. Fianna Fáil brought the growing of wheat to its present high standard.  Senator L'Estrange said that we had the highest yield in 1954.  Our people got into the growing of wheat. They forgot their prejudices and, apart altogether from the national aspect of the matter, they found wheat growing remunerative.  That is the reason why many people who knew practically nothing about wheat went into its production on a large scale.</P>
    <P>I believe there will have to be a quota system somewhat on the lines of the sugar beet crop production.  In that way, the real farmers, who have always produced wheat, can live by it and rear a family.  In doing that, the Government would be doing a good thing and they would not then be faced with the terrible problem with which we are now faced, namely, the disposal of the surplus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenihan said that this motion was a watered-down version of the Fine Gael motion on wheat growing in the Dáil.  If he takes the trouble to go to the Seanad Office, he will discover that this motion was put down long before the Dáil motion. It was put down in the normal parliamentary way in the workings of <Col N="424" /> democracy.  The Fine Gael members in the Seanad decided they would put down a wheat motion and they gave to Senator L'Estrange and myself the task of wording the motion.  The wording of that motion is exactly similar to the wording of an earlier Fianna Fáil motion and it was put down long before the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil decided to put down their motion.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly stated, among other things, that my history, as he put it&mdash;I did not know I had any history&mdash;as regards wheat growing was not very good.  As reported at column 103 of Volume 49, No. 1, of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann, Senator O'Reilly is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It occurred to me then that Senator Donegan's history in this matter of wheat is not very good.  I recollect reading a Dáil debate when the previous Minister reduced the price of wheat.  One of the people who defended most ardently the reduction of 12/- a barrel was the then Deputy Donegan from Louth.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For Senator O'Reilly's information, the time allowed and agreed for the motion on that occasion was four hours.  I sat for the four hours, but I was not able to get speaking.  If the Senator will go back to that Dáil debate, he will discover that, when making his statement in this House on 12th of last month, he was relying not on that debate but on his imagination. If he wants to know my history as regards wheat growing, he can go to County Louth and find out whether or not I have done anything for wheat growing in that area.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his speech, would have been expected at least to address himself to the various questions which were raised.  The pricing of wheat and the very complex arrangements in relation to wheat are not easily understood and, while the general framework has been made known, the minor details which, in truth, can very often become the major details, were not made known.  Various questions were raised by me and other speakers, but the Minister totally ignored them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Brady is the first <Col N="425" /> Fianna Fáil Senator who suggested a means by which wheat growing can be regularised.  I may say that I disagree with him, as I do not think it could be done, but the fact is that he suggested a means.  I suggested a means by which it could be done; I suggested a means by which matters could be improved; I suggested a means by which an investigatory procedure could be set in motion now which would help the Irish wheat grower and make him believe something was being done for him with regard to his future crops.  It was unfair of the Minister to ignore my remarks.  His absence to-night is also unfair.  He is in Leinster House, as I saw him.  He is not occupied and I feel he should be here.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister said the Louth County Committee of Agriculture expressed disparaging views and views which were not fair to our producers of milk and butter.  I want to refute that statement.  The Louth County Committee of Agriculture discussed the price of milk and butter. At no time did one member on any side of that assembly make one statement which was in any way selfish, in the interests of the Louth people or injurious to the producers of milk or butter.  The entire discussion was devoted to the subsidy on butter and whether or not it should have been removed.  That is a completely domestic matter which has nothing whatever to do with the price of milk or the price of butter.  It is wise to put that on record.  It was totally unfair of the Minister to make that statement.</P>
    <P>I also drew attention to a discrepancy in figures and I mentioned&mdash; there is no point in quoting it again &mdash;the statement by the Taoiseach in the Dáil that the losses of the Exchequer on the disposal of surplus wheat would be £1,250,000, whereas the figure included in the Book of Estimates is £800,000.  The Minister saw fit completely and absolutely to disregard my question about that discrepancy. That discrepancy is very important.  If there is to be another £400,000 spread over the loss to the wheat grower next year, it is going to mean shillings per barrel.  No one <Col N="426" /> knows where it is to come from.  The Taoiseach says it is £1,250,000; the Book of Estimates says it is £800,000. Are we not entitled in this Assembly to an explanation by the Minister for Agriculture in relation to a sum of that magnitude?  It is most unfair that we have not got it.</P>
    <P>Senator Carter challenged Senator L'Estrange.  He asked: &ldquo;What is going to be the price of wheat?&rdquo;  He knows perfectly well that no one can say at this moment what the price of wheat is going to be.  The asking of unanswerable questions by politicians is a very old practice indeed&mdash;it has been done since the year one.  I will refer Senator Carter to a relevant figure.  If the amount of wheat delivered to the mills is 400,000 tons, the reduction in the price will be approximately 11/3.  If Senator Carter is inclined to be a little sporting, I lay him 1/- or £1 per 1,000 tons up or down, on 400,000 tons.  He is half way out now and he can have it in shillings if he wishes.  I am sorry that he has left.</P>
    <P>Grave exception was taken by Senator O Donnabháin to Senator L'Estrange's contribution.  We all make our contributions to Assemblies such as this in different ways.  I think Senator L'Estrange was perfectly fair and honest in his way of doing it, and if Senator O Donnabháin did not like it, that cannot be helped.  I do not like many contributions I hear here, and I am sure no one else does, but it is the right of a member to make a contribution in his own way, and I do not think there was anything wrong with the way Senator L'Estrange did it.  If Senator L'Estrange's very measured contribution&mdash;I use that word with intent&mdash;is to be considered as Party-political, it is of great interest to read what happened in relation to the 1958 price of wheat at a Fianna Fáil convention in County Tipperary. I quote from the <i>Nenagh Guardian</i> of 1st March, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Killbarron cumann moved a motion expressing dissatisfaction with the wheat price arrangement for 1958 owing to the injurious effects on the small farmer and that the full price should be paid on the first 200 <Col N="427" /> barrels submitted by the farmer.  A Killbarron delegate said they had been told at the last general election to produce more wheat and they put in a Government that docked the price by 10/- or 11/- per barrel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He agrees with me.  This continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The more they produced, the less they were paid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The same argument applied to the price of pigs and poultry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is outside the terms of the motion, so I will not deal with it.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. W. Brennan said the general public was dissatisfied with the price of wheat and the present arrangement hits in the first instance the unfortunate poor small tillage wheat-grower whose livelihood was going to be reduced.  Mr. Brennan referred to a statement said to be made by the Minister for Agriculture that the sooner the small farmer goes out of the country the better.  Mr. Fanning, T.D., said that the resolution should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Mr. P. Ryan, M.C.C., at the same convention, said they could not stand up to the Opposition because it was actually promised from the platforms at the election that the price of wheat would remain as it was, and it was coming bad from a Fianna Fáil Government to reduce the price of wheat, barley and oats.  He did not know how they could face the country and something would have to be done to counteract it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I tried not to make that sort of contribution. Maybe I am not doing half as bad a job as someone who was.  There has to be a sting in the tail, but there is a queer old sting in the Killbarron tail.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the <Col N="428" /> Government side of the House had the opportunity to produce <i>The Kerryman</i>, and he did not do it.  He had the opportunity during this motion.  In 1955, a situation developed where the farmer produced more wheat, at the then inclusion in the grist, than could be absorbed.  The farmers have a fundamental right to the market for the maximum amount of Irish wheat that can be included.  In 1954, the then Government were faced with this surplus of wheat, foreseen by their predecessors when they decided by Cabinet decision in December, 1953, that 300,000 tons was the amount that could be absorbed.  There was no test by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to which they could have recourse; there had been no samples sent by the National Farmers' Association to Sweden; there had been no large-scale test in the Curragh; and the Government of the day were faced also with the fact that there were farmers growing 1,000 acres of wheat. It took a decision.</P>
      <P>In the years that followed, two things happened.  It became completely apparent that wheat farmers all over Ireland had sold stock and had purchased large amounts of tillage machinery&mdash;valuable machinery depreciating fast, at the rate of perhaps £400 or £500 a year&mdash;and they had also gone to their bankers and had got bank overdrafts for that purpose.  Therefore, the opportunity of these men to revert to the old policy of &ldquo;walking it off the land&rdquo; was interfered with. These men just had to continue to grow wheat.  The surplus which existed in 1954 has now become a permanent surplus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A permanent surplus of wheat has developed.  I told the Minister here that, in my opinion&mdash;and I do not err in very bad company, as the National Farmers' Association and other farming bodies and many men inside the trade and outside the trade are of the same opinion&mdash;that it is the duty of the Government now to do what Messrs.  Arthur Guinness Son and Company did with regard to malting barley many years ago, that is, set up large-scale milling and baking tests on Irish wheat with a higher inclusion than is at present in the grist.  There is no reason in the world why the Government could not have arranged, for the expenditure of a comparatively small sum, to mill 20,000 barrels of Irish wheat at 90 per cent. inclusion in the grist and perhaps 82 or 72 per cent. extraction, put the bread or flour on sale and see what the quality was like.</P>
      <P>The Irish farmer has a fundamental right to that market.  There is a market worth £3,000,000, which is represented by the import of foreign wheat.  The farmer is entitled to know whether or not he can supply that market.  On the present motion, the Minister came in here and when that suggestion was made to him, he spent 35 minutes speaking about other things, including what the Louth County Committee of Agriculture said about butter, and he deliberately ignored that suggestion; and then he did not come in the following night.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister in my opening speech that his figure for the sale of surplus wheat to compound millers, farmers and others, at £26 per ton at the nearest railway station in six-ton lots, was unfair and too high.</P>
      <P>I quoted imports over the past six months of flour middlings, which are, in fact, black flour, and I baked a cake to find out if they were.  They were exactly like the flour here during the war, possibly 90 or 95 per cent. in flour middlings.  These were available in this country, c.i.f. Dublin, at £22 10s. and later at £24 per ton.  They were milled and ready for inclusion in compound meals for hens and pigs.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, at column 106, Volume 49 of the Official Seanad Report, in reply to me:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That is really the confusing and <Col N="430" /> bedevilling aspect of the fixation of barley prices, barley that is intended for animal food, or, indeed, for oats. When I was dealing with this matter in the Dáil, I made it clear there that the fixing of £26 per ton for any of that surplus disposed of for compound purposes was determined by me in order that grain importers and the Government would keep their word with those commercial interests that were driven into giving the price I have referred to back in the harvest of last year.  These matters are all bound up together.  The price of wheat, the disposal of surplus wheat, our attitude towards the fixation of barley prices, whether we should have fixation or not, whether we should have a policy with regard to the growing of oats, whether we should have regard to the price for oats&mdash;all these are matters to which attention and consideration had to be given, because in the circumstances as they exist, or have existed or having regard to the position as it existed inside the last number of months, they are all interconnected in some way or another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was completely incorrect. The position with regard to barley last year was that in order to see to it that there was a floor of £2 per barrel on the farm, for barley of 20 per cent. moisture content, he put Grain Importers in the market to appoint agents and purchase that barley and put it in store.  In fact, those agents dried it in store.  Grain Importers' instructions were that if they wanted to sell any of this barley before March 31st, or not so very long ago, that they must include full storage and financial charges up to March, to see to it that the barley of ordinary commercial interests was used first.  There is not as much barley held by ordinary commercial interests as would keep this country going for a fortnight.  The Minister was completely free to fix the price of surplus wheat, which will eventually find its way to the unfortunate pig feeders and poultry breeders, at whatever figure he likes.  The price is £22 or £24 per ton, but it certainly is not £26.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the fundamental rights of the farmers to the entire <Col N="431" /> wheat market, I would refer the House to the reply given by the Tánaiste to Deputy Dillon in the Dáil yesterday and reported in to-day's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass told Mr. Dillon (F.G.) that wheat for the production of biscuit flour was issued to millers at the animal feed price, on the basis of one barrel of native wheat for each sack of flour supplied to a biscuit manufacturer.  The flour requirements of biscuit manufacturers amounted to about 70,000 sacks a year, so that, on the assumption that the arrangements remained in force throughout the financial year 1958-59, about 8,750 tons of native wheat would be utilised in that way.</P>
    <P>The price to be paid for biscuit flour was a matter for negotiation on a competitive basis between the biscuit manufacturers and the millers, so that it was not possible to indicate precisely the differential per sack in price between the normal price of such flour and the price at which it was supplied by any particular miller, but, normally, it would be of the order of 20/- to 30/- per sack.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is plenty of leeway there.  The quotation goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass said the Deputy would understand that the biscuit manufacturers would not be given any increased protection against imports from abroad, because the rate of duty appointed was very low and was fixed under the Trade Agreement with Great Britain and could not be changed.  Therefore, unless they could get flour at the same price as their foreign competitors, the result would be the importation of biscuits and the loss of markets. There was no question of a subsidy; the use of the term &lsquo;subsidy&rsquo; was completely misleading.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Firstly, I want to say there is a subsidy. Of course, there is.  Take the framework of the subsidy when flour was at the cheaper price.  The losses of the Irish mills on native wheat were made up, plus 6 per cent. for profit. This was computed on the average loss <Col N="432" /> of the then 31 mills.  Is there not a complete and absolute parallel there, when you think that Irish wheat is being given to the biscuit manufacturers at £26 per ton, or in the form of flour based on £26?  In other words, the price of the flour to the biscuit manufacturers is subsidised by the Exchequer.  Is there not an absolute parallel?  Of course, there is a subsidy, but the difference is this, that here we have no guarantee that the price of biscuits will be reduced.  That is the first thing wrong.  The second thing is that the Irish farmer is now being deprived of a further portion of the market which he should enjoy. There are 8,750 tons of wheat to be sold this year to the biscuit manufacturers at the cheap price.  The precedent has been created.</P>
    <P>It has been a fundamental principle that the pig feeders and the poultry feeders got their offals, no matter what the price of wheat or bran was, at world prices.  There were, in fact, accusations during the term of the previous Dáil, notably by Deputy Corry, to the effect that this practice had been discontinued.  Seeing that the margin is so small which poultry breeders enjoy, it has been a fundamental principle that they got their bran and pollard, outside their compounds, at the same price as the foreign competitors in the British markets got theirs.  The ports are open and if a man wanted to bring in a shipload of bran or pollard, he could, and he could sell it here, and the mills had to reduce their price to meet that competition.  This meant a loss to the Exchequer, but at times when there was not a subsidy it would mean some fluctuation in the price of flour or bread.</P>
    <P>The price of pollard has been fixed and, strangely enough, ten days before it was fixed, it was increased by £1 per ton.  It was fixed at the increased price.  That price is £22 10s.  The S.S. <i>Floria</i> is docked in Dublin to-night with a cargo of Argentine pollard and the price of the pollard, brought forward, is £19 15s.  That is the last licence that has been issued for the importation of foreign pollard.  When that is gone, the Irish pig and poultry feeder will pay £22 10s. for Irish <Col N="433" /> pollard, whereas his foreign competitor on the British market will be able to buy pollard at something less than £19 15s., because there is also the cost of transhipment from Liverpool to be taken into account, and the Englishman has the pollard cheaper, anyway. That is not fair.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the Government are bearing all the loss this year. Of course, they are not bearing all the loss; the unfortunate pig and poultry feeders are bearing the loss, a loss amounting to £3 per ton.  The Government are only trying to blind people's eyes in that respect, and, if evidence of that is required, I can lay it on the Table of this House inside a week.  I have mentioned the fact that the Minister saw fit to ignore completely the suggestion regarding milling and baking tests.  That slows up the whole procedure and maintains the <i>status quo</i> with 79 per cent. Irish wheat in the grist.</P>
    <P>In the two or three years prior to 1955, and after 1955, to a lesser extent, there was a movement of Irish farm capital from stock into machinery in the wheat areas.  The Government placed large advertisements in every paper in the country urging the farmers to grow more wheat and to speed the plough, and these are responsible for that movement of capital into machinery. The road back for the farmer is a hard one, but he is able to recognise the road back.  He has to get back to a self-contained herd, with a high level of tillage, selling some of his cereal crops for cash and feeding the remainder to his stock, or walking it off the land in the form of various agricultural products.</P>
    <P>The Government might be forgiven for their previous action, if they were prepared to announce some scheme which would give the farmers capital to enable them to walk that hard road back.  Instead, the members of the Government have spent their time since 1954 in telling the farmers that, if they got back to power, the price of wheat would be increased.  To a certain extent, I think the farmers did put this Government into office, and now they know that the more they grow, the less they will get, and they <Col N="434" /> also know that there is no agricultural policy forthcoming to help them out of the unfortunate position in which they find themselves.  The Government must meet their responsibilities.  They must produce some form of an agricultural policy that will give the farmers hope.</P>
    <P>I suggested, in my opening contribution to this debate, that there should be a scheme of loans for farmers and, where a farmer was growing too much wheat, it should be made a condition of a loan that he would reduce his wheat or grain acreage, and that he would not sell all his barley or wheat for cash, that he would keep some of it to walk off the land in various forms of agricultural produce.  However, the Government have done nothing.</P>
    <P>To give an idea of what the Government now feel about wheat, I refer to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 14th April under the heading &ldquo;Wheat Scheme Not Very Attractive&rdquo;.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wheat scheme which had been decided upon for 1958 was one which he personally did not find very attractive, but it was the only one that could be decided upon under the prevailing circumstances, said Mr. Smith, Minister for Agriculture, at a Meath Fianna Fáil Convention in Navan.</P>
    <P>Mr. Smith said that since 1955 there had been a surplus of wheat grown in this country and no serious effort was made to deal with the problem.  It was not a sound national policy to produce wheat for export at a price of only £20 a ton.</P>
    <P>In the course of drafting the announcement for the 1958 crop he had gone out of his way to have it phrased in such a fashion that it would bring home to every grower what to expect at harvest time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there was a considerable swing this year towards wheat growing and so far as he could gather it would appear that the acreage would be higher than heretofore.</P>
    <P>If the arrangements for the 1958 crop did not work out satisfactorily, he would do everything in his power to devise a more suitable scheme and <Col N="435" /> would consider any constructive suggestion that might be put to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put a constructive suggestion before the Minister in this House and he saw fit to ignore it and, furthermore, he did not come into the House the following night.</P>
    <P>Before sitting down, I should like to nail one statement that has been floating around the country for the past 20 or 30 years, that is, the general statement supposed to have been made by the ex-Minister for Agriculture, &ldquo;that he would not be got dead in a field of wheat&rdquo;.  Every statement has its context and I would like the Fianna Fáil Senators to know the exact context in which that statement was made. If they want to, they can read it for themselves in the Official Reports in the Library.  The statement was made at a time when a certain very wealthy combine, which also owns a film studio, opened the most modern mill in Europe, at that time, in Limerick. They were importing more than 95 per cent. of their wheat.  Boats came to Liverpool and discharged three-quarters of their cargoes into a mill owned by this wealthy combine and then they came to Limerick and discharged the rest of their cargoes there. <Col N="436" /> Only 5 per cent.  Irish wheat was used in Limerick and a sack of flour costing 20/- in Liverpool cost 30/- in Limerick. In those circumstances, in a small country, it is fair to say that the statement appears to be an altogether different one.</P>

      <P>It was raised here and it should be answered.  Let the Fianna Fáil Senators read the Dáil debates of 1933 and they will find that for themselves. I charge that the Government have not lived up to their responsibilities, if only for the reason that the Minister for Agriculture did not answer the things he should have answered on the last night.  This country will definitely support an honest man.  An honest man can come in here and say what he believes, but the Minister did not come in here and make any statement.</P>
