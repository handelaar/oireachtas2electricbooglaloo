      <P>There are three amendments.  Perhaps, it would be <Col N="484" /> better if Senator Dooge took them together.  I suggest we take amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (a), page 2, line 28, to delete &ldquo;managed&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;supervised&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any real conflict of views on amendments Nos. 1 to 3.  This is a matter of wording and a matter of choice between the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;supervise&rdquo;. I think there is general agreement in the House and with the Minister that the public should be protected in so far as compounding and dispensing should be carried out either by an authorised person or by somebody else who is well controlled and well supervised by him.  This is an important aspect of the matter which is the subject of the Bill if we remember that there are something like 1,700 pharmaceutical assistants in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; which appears in the Bill was introduced first, I think, in the 1890 Act.  I would suggest that the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; as used in 1890 has a connotation somewhat different from that of today.  In 1890, one thought immediately, probably, in terms of managing a horse&mdash;something that is done directly.  Today, the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; connotes, rather, control, at a remote distance, of a rather complicated operation.  I suggest in amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 that the word &ldquo;supervise&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; wherever it appears&mdash;not that there is any tremendously great difference of meaning between the two words except that &ldquo;supervise&rdquo; has a connotation of personal presence and it is just that point that I wish to see introduced in the Bill&mdash;in other words, that the authorised persons should supervise in the sense that their control and their management of their assistants should be something which is not remote, should be something which cannot be done from another part of the building or from another place.  It is for these reasons that I move that the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; be replaced by the word <Col N="485" />&ldquo;supervise&rdquo; in the various subsections of Section 2.</P>

      <P>I cannot subscribe to the statement that &ldquo;manage&rdquo; in the year 1890 had a connotation that applied only to the exercise of horsemanship.  It is true that somewhere, I think about the year 1603, or something like that, it may have had that meaning.  However, I am accepting the Senator's amendment.  I think it does, perhaps, slide a little closer to the bone.  There is a hair's breadth of a difference between them but it is a point, and I am accepting the Senator's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to raise on the section in order to have them clarified, or at least mentioned in the course of the debate.  One refers to subsection (1) (c) which deals with the position where a corporate body employs an authorised person.  The position is that the section, as it stands, prohibits an authorised person from acting on behalf of more than one corporate body.  I should like the Minister to give some clarification on that point and to say if this section, or some other section, is sufficiently strong to prevent an authorised person from acting for two shops or establishments owned by the same corporate body.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> There is another point on subsection (3) of the same section which I should like to raise.  In this Bill, the qualification of licentiate of the Apothecaries Hall entitles a person who has taken a diploma in pharmacy to keep open shop.  I should like to ask the Minister what is his position in regard to the control of the standard of this diploma.</P>
    <P>I think we are all agreed that for the sake of the protection of the public, a licentiate of the Apothecaries Hall should not be allowed to keep open shop at any time in future if his standard of training falls below that which the Minister would consider appropriate.  I think he should not be allowed to keep those rights for merely historical reasons.  If the Apothecaries Hall were to reduce the amount of training in pharmacy which they give, beyond the proper training in medicine, to something of the order of giving training courses for one month or less, I should like to ask the Minister what the position would be. Would he have power under this or any other Act to protect the public against the damage which might be done by such a person keeping open shop?  Those are the two points in Section 2 on which I should like clarification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, of course, that we have to bear in mind that the scope of the Bill is very limited.  It does not touch what might be described as the fundamental principles of the general body of law relating to the practice of pharmacy.  Therefore, there is nothing in this Bill which will interfere with the right of certain persons to practise the profession of pharmacy.  All it provides is that certain people who are outside what might be described as the prescriptive rights which are now written into the statute will, if they want to practise, have to comply with certain regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not deal at all with the qualifications of a person who is entitled to practise pharmacy, except to provide that he must be a registered member of the Pharmaceutical Society, or that he must, in certain circumstances, be a licentiate of the Apothecaries <Col N="487" /> Hall.  The qualifications of a licentiate are matters for the Medical Registration Council over whom I have no control.  We must, of course, remember that the operation of the Act will be kept under review, and if it appears that the possession of a licence from the Apothecaries Hall does not guarantee sufficient <i>expertise,</i> so to speak, in the profession, the matter will be looked at again.  We are not dealing at all with the question of qualification.</P>
    <P>On the other point raised by Senator Dooge as to whether an authorised person could manage more than one establishment, up to this the practice has been that the Pharmaceutical Society maintain that he is not entitled to manage more than one.  The position has been generally accepted by everyone. I do not think it has been challenged in the courts, and I think that if it were challenged, it would be upheld.  We may take it that so far as the existing practice is concerned, it will not be amended or altered or affected in any way by the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said about the existing practice, but would the fact that paragraph (c) of subsection (1) makes the point that the same person may not manage for two of the corporate bodies not be held to mean that because it is so designated there, in other cases it would be legal for a person to manage or supervise two establishments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, line 33, before &ldquo;take&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in connection with any business or employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of amendments Nos. 4, 5 <Col N="488" /> and 6 is identical.  As the Bill stands it is an offence, subject to a fine o £20, for any person to take or use the name of pharmaceutical chemist, taking that as an example, unless he is on the Irish register.  I am proposing an amendment to this that we insert the words &ldquo;in connection with any business or employment&rdquo;.  I submit that on the section as it stands, there are certain persons for whom it would be an offence to describe themselves, even privately, as pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    <P>I shall give a few instances.  It appears that under this section it would be an offence for the President of the British Pharmaceutical Society on a visit to this country to describe himself as a pharmaceutical chemist because he would not be a person on the register of the Pharmaceutical Council of Ireland.  Similarly, a person who had taken a qualification in pharmacy and did not enter the practice of pharmacy but continued to study, say, for a medical degree, would commit an offence and be liable to a fine of £20, and a continuing fine if he described himself as both a medical undergraduate and as a pharmaceutical chemist.  Also, a person who is retired, who has been in practice in pharmacy, would commit an offence if he described himself as a pharmaceutical chemist or if he did not take down from the wall the diploma indicating he was a member of the Pharmaceutical Society.</P>
    <P>I think it is reasonable we should amend the section and make it an offence for a person to describe himself as a pharmaceutical chemist only when doing it for a profit.  The amendment would cover any particular case in which difficulty is likely to arise. For example, a medical representative who represented himself as being a qualified pharmaceutical chemist would be covered if the section were amended as I propose.  Similarly, since we have put in any occupations, I suggest also that a person who perhaps for the purposes of gaining money by a trick, describes himself as a pharmaceutical chemist would also be covered by this amendment, if we consider that being a confidence man is an occupation.  I am given to understand <Col N="489" /> the Pharmaceutical Council who would be the people to suffer if I am endeavouring to make the laws too lax in this respect have no objection to the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to refer briefly to some of the effects of the provisions under this section.  I understand the position to be that due to the recognition of courses in University College, Dublin, courses will be carried out partly in the College of Pharmacy and partly in University College, Dublin.  It is well that it should be perfectly clear to the Seanad and everybody concerned that this does not involve a complete relief of the burden of education on the College of <Col N="490" /> Pharmacy.  I understand that in the initial years, two-thirds of the work will be done in the College of Pharmacy and that even after the new science block has been completed at Belfield, 50 per cent. of the lecture and laboratory work will still be done within the College of Pharmacy.  This indeed throws a very great burden on the College of Pharmacy who have to endeavour to train their students to the standard of other countries where 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the cost is borne by the State.  On the Second Stage, I indicated to the Minister that I thought perhaps a lump sum payment to the College of Pharmacy would indeed be an act as much of justice as of generosity on the part of the State.</P>
      <P>I have one further point to urge on the Minister, that even if the State is not in a position to give large sums of money to the College of Pharmacy, he should make a special effort to see if it would be possible for members of the staff of the College of Pharmacy and members of cognate subjects in UCD to be sent abroad for special training.  It might be possible to use some of the Fellowships now available. If we cannot give them money for the superlative equipment available in other countries, perhaps something could be done to see that the laboratories will be staffed by extremely well-trained men.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices in order to try to secure that members of the College of Pharmacy and cognate subjects in UCD should get special training abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear the Senator is misdirected a little bit.  After all, there is nothing in this section providing for the subsidisation of courses in the College of Pharmacy and if there were, I should not be the Minister in charge of the Bill because that relates to the subsidisation of education, vocational education, if you wish, and therefore I submit it is slightly over the borderline of relevancy.  On the other matter, the question of scholarships, the number available to the Minister for Health and other bodies here, is very limited and we have a great many things, apart altogether <Col N="491" /> from pharmacy, which is very desirable, in relation to which our people should have an opportunity of going abroad and acquiring a greater knowledge in the techniques being evolved in medicine, surgery and cognate subjects. But if the opportunity arises, and if their claims should not obviously rank below that of other people who are making a claim upon me, I shall endeavour to see that a fair allocation is made to pharmaceutical lecturers and educators of one kind or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>At the end of subsection (2), page 5, line 56, to add:&mdash;&ldquo;Fees of different amounts may be determined in respect of annual fees for Fellows and ordinary members.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is merely to give flexibility to the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society in regard to the annual fees which it will charge for membership of the Society.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8, which is a Government amendment, meets the point which I seek in amendment No. 7 and, accordingly, I have no hesitation in withdrawing amendment No. 7 in favour of No. 8.  Amendment No. 9 covers a separate point.  It was designed to relieve a junior employee in a pharmacy from paying the same annual fee as those in the position of manager.  However, it would appear that the effect of exempting these junior employees would be to exempt also persons who were pharmaceutical chemists and directors of corporate bodies engaged in the retail trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this point, I understand that the Pharmaceutical Council considers that the administration of this particular matter would be one of extreme difficulty.  It would be very difficult to determine who was a manager or who was a junior employee <Col N="492" /> at a given time.  Accordingly, I do not intend to move amendment No. 9.  So I withdraw amendment No. 7 in favour of amendment No. 8 and I do not wish to move amendment No. 9.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <P>(a) in respect of membership of the Society by persons on whom the title of Fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has been conferred pursuant to section 7 of this Act and in respect of such membership by other persons, and</P>
    <P>(b) in respect of the retention on registers maintained by the Society of persons referred to in subsection (3) of this section who keep open shop for the dispensing or compounding of medical prescriptions or the sale of poisons or are employed in a shop so kept and in respect of such retention of persons referred to in the said subsection (3) other than those aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 6 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small point I should like to make.  At the moment there are about 1,100 paid up members of the Pharmaceutical Society.  It is impossible to tell at this stage how many would be members of the new clean register of the Pharmaceutical Society.  However, I think it would be wrong to budget for more than 1,800, which means 700 extra persons.  We do not know what type of fee would be charged under this section by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society but it is interesting to realise what the income would be at certain fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible under the Bill to pay only a retention fee and not the full fee, and it is quite probable that <Col N="493" /> persons who have not joined the Society up to now might content themselves with payment only of the retention fee, after the passing of the Act. If that were at the rate of three guineas a year, 700 persons would bring in only another £2,000.  If it were four guineas, it would bring in only £3,000. In the past ten years the Pharmaceutical Society has been running at a deficit of £2,000 a year and it does not have the inspectorate staff it would like to have.  By the charging of fees of the order of three or four guineas, the Council would only bring itself into balance and it would need to charge fees in excess of this amount if it wished to provide for expansion. Anybody concerned with this problem should not be in any way complacent that the power given to the Pharmaceutical Society to increase its finances under this section will make them a wealthy body.  I think they will have to introduce substantial fees, if they want to maintain anything more than a critical balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to empower the Society to charge fees.  The amount of the fee which they will charge will, of course, be subject to regulation by the Minister and presumably they will not fix those fees at a level which would be insufficient to provide them with the necessary income.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled that amendments 1 and 3 to 9 inclusive, standing in the name of Senator Fitzpatrick, are out of order on the grounds that they involve potential charges on State funds.  The Senator has been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks which I think will express my views on a number of sections in the Bill.  I put down a number of amendments and, if I may say so with respect, the Chair very correctly ruled them out of order on the grounds that they would involve potential charges on State funds.  I do not propose to make any case that the amendments should be accepted.  I think I am in order in saying that in my view this section and Sections 3 and 4, and other sections of the Bill, are ineffective as they stand.  I think that Section 2, as drafted, will be impossible to enforce.  In fact, I suggest that it is very nearly meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the right of the district justice to grant a legal aid certificate.  Subparagraph (b) provides that the district justice may grant a certificate if the court thinks &ldquo;that by <Col N="496" /> reason of the gravity of the charge or of exceptional circumstances it is essential in the interests of justice that he should have legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his defence before it.&rdquo;  You will see, therefore, that before the district justice has power to grant a legal aid certificate there must be exceptional circumstances and the charge must be a grave one.  One would think that those two conditions&mdash;the gravity of the charge and the exceptional circumstances&mdash;should be sufficient to warrant the granting of a legal aid certificate by the district justice.  However, the section as it stands goes on to say that the district justice must be satisfied that it is essential in the interests of justice that a legal aid certificate should be granted.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister and his advisers, I would say that it will be impossible for the district justice ever to grant a legal aid certificate if he is to be satisfied that it is essential in the interests of justice that he should do so.  Indeed, some district justices might take the view that an accused person might get a more sympathetic hearing from a judge and jury if he were not professionally represented.  Some district justices might think that if an accused person, before a jury, were not professionally represented, the onus would then be cast upon the trial judge, even to a higher degree, to put the defence case before the jury and that the defence case, coming from the judge instead of from a legal adviser employed by the accused, might get more sympathetic consideration from the jury.</P>
    <P>I could think of a multitude of reasons why a district justice, if he wanted to do so, might decide that it was not essential in the interests of justice to grant a legal aid certificate. I would say to the House, and say it with all the force I can command, that the section as drafted, with the words &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; and &ldquo;gravity of the charge&rdquo; in it, would be much more effective if a lesser word than &ldquo;essential&rdquo; were substituted.  I think then the court would have a discretion which it could exercise.</P>
    <P>If this section as it stands is strictly <Col N="497" /> interpreted by the district justices and by the other courts, with which later sections in the Bill deal, then an accused person would never be entitled in my considered opinion to get a legal aid certificate.  I would strongly urge on the Minister, even at this late stage and in the interests of the proper working of the Bill, to reconsider this section.  I urge him to have another look at it with a view to inserting a more flexible word, a word that will leave the courts with some discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Seanad is probably aware, we had a great deal of discussion in the Dáil on the difference between &ldquo;essential&rdquo; and &ldquo;desirable&rdquo;.  I want to point out to the House that this is a limited scheme, a very experimental scheme.  It is something quite new to our society, to our legal system and to our courts.  We are very much in the dark as to how it will work out.  We hope it will serve a very beneficial purpose at a reasonable cost but, at this stage, we are, as I said, considerably in the dark as to what the cost will be. In that situation, it is only prudent for us to begin with a restricted scheme as set out in the Bill.  I think that that is just common prudence.</P>
      <P>There are a great many things that are desirable and that we should all like to see provided.  However, our total resources are limited and the portion available for social welfare matters of this sort can be applied for a very large number of deserving purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this particular social purpose deserves some portion of our resources but I do not think that, at this stage, we can accurately determine the total amount involved.  Certainly I do not think this is something we should walk into blindly, regardless of expense.  That is the principle on which the Bill is framed.  The Government have decided that the scheme should be confined, in the beginning at any rate, to cases where it is essential in the interests of justice that the accused should get free legal aid.  That essentiality can arise in two ways.  It can arise because of the gravity of the charge or the exceptional circumstances. <Col N="498" /> That leaves it fairly wide. We are pinning it down to the case where it is necessary, or essential in the interests of justice, that the accused should be defended free of charge and the cost of the defence paid by the State.</P>
    <P>I am absolutely optimistic that this scheme will work out well in practice, and that the courts will operate it sensibly and with discretion, as it has been operated in Northern Ireland for 16 years.</P>
    <P>I submit, with respect, that Senator Fitzpatrick is not consistent.  He wants discretion given to the district justice in this regard, but when it comes to appointing a solicitor to defend the accused he does not want the district justice to have any discretion whatever. Senator Fitzpatrick cannot have it both ways.  The difference between &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; and &ldquo;essential&rdquo; is largely one of degree.  At this stage we must put a limiting factor on the scheme. Later on, when we see the exact cost, we may find it possible to enlarge the scheme.  On the other hand, we may have to tighten it up because the cost may prove to be disproportionate.  It may be grossly extravagant.</P>
    <P>In any event, we propose to begin prudently with a restricted scheme.  I am not at all sure that when we come to see in what way it can be extended we may not decide that it would be better to extend it in the sphere of giving legal aid and advice on the civil side rather than on the criminal side as Senator Fitzpatrick suggests. In any event, the decision will have to be taken in the light of experience.  At this stage I think we are being nothing more than prudent in insisting that the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; remains in the section.</P>
    <P>I should like Senators to be reasonable and sensible in their approach to the scheme.  After all, it is a big advance on the present position.  Even where it is essential in the interests of justice that a person should get free legal aid he cannot get it at the moment.  I appeal to the House to allow the scheme go through as it is. Admittedly, it is a restricted, limited scheme but it cannot reasonably be otherwise at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the Minister might appear to establish that this is a completely new idea, in the interests of accuracy I venture to put on record that it is merely a very limited extension of the idea already in practice here, namely, assignment in murder trials. For some years a person without means has been assigned solicitors and both the junior and senior counsel in murder trials, and the State are responsible for the fees.  It is not a very great responsibility, I hasten to add.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked the House to approach this matter in a sensible and reasonable way, almost implying that any argument or any proposal which purports to disagree with what he recommends is either unreasonable or nonsensical.  I do not think the best can be got from a deliberative assembly by an approach of that kind.</P>
      <P>The discretion of a district justice in nominating solicitors and in deciding on the gravity of a matter necessary to qualify a person under the section are two completely different things.  I do not think for one moment that Senator Fitzpatrick is being inconsistent when he challenges the one and requires something quite different in the other set of circumstances.  If, as the Minister has intimated, there is to be any extension of this principle of what he calls social welfare legislation in the light of what we can afford at some future time, and if that extension is to be devoted towards the civil side, that in my opinion would be a mistake. There has been a niggardly approach towards the criminal side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the whole business of assignment in murder trial of solicitors and counsel, grave offences and lack of means give rise to much wider issues and merit the consideration of the district justice.  The assignment of solicitor and counsel should be on a permanent basis but I do not think I would be in order, or that it would be relevant to deal with that broad issue on this section of the Bill.  The fluctuations of patronage with changes of Government do not make for the competence we all desire.  Over short periods between changes of Government the practitioners cannot get the experience which begets the competence <Col N="500" /> that is really desirable and essential.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (c) (ii), page 3, lines 14 to 16, to delete</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been set up),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the granting of legal aid certificates in cases of trial on indictment.  It is only the more serious type of offence that is sent forward by the district justice to the Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court for trial before judge and jury. It is a long-established practice in this country&mdash;indeed, since the setting up the State and before it&mdash;that a person who is charged in the district court with a serious offence, where depositions are taken in the district court and the district justice decides that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established, the accused person invariably reserves his defence.</P>
      <P>In other words, he does not disclose his defence in the district court.  There is no obligation on him to do so.  That is a privilege enjoyed by the accused person.  Indeed, there would be no point whatever in disclosing his defence at that stage because once the district justice decided a <i>prima facie</i> case had been established no defence the accused person could put forward would entitle the district justice to refuse informations.  The district justice in a case that may be tried on indictment is not entitled to decide who is telling the truth and is not entitled to decide whether he believes the witnesses for the prosecution or the witnesses for the defence.  Once a <i>prima facie</i> case is established it is his duty to return the accused person for trial by a judge and jury.  Subsection (2) of this section says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  A legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate shall be granted in respect of a person returned for trial <Col N="501" /> for an indictable offence if (but only if)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  application is made therefor,</P>
    <P>(b) it appears to the District Court or the judge of the court before which the person is to be or is being tried that the means of the person are insufficient to enable him to obtain legal aid, and</P>
    <P>(c)  either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the return for trial is upon a charge of murder, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  it appears to the District Court or the judge of the court before which the person is to be or is being tried (as the case may be) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been set up), it is essential in the interests of justice that the person should have legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his defence at the trial.</P>
    <P>I object to that part of the section, which invites the district justice, or the judge, to consider the nature of the defence, if any, which is being set up or which it is proposed to set up.  As I say, that section invites the district justice&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I say that subsection invites the court to inquire if the person has any defence.  It invites the court to say: &ldquo;This man has not disclosed his defence.&rdquo;  Otherwise, there is not really much point in it.  The court might well say: &ldquo;If he had set up a defence I might consider granting legal aid.&rdquo;  The judge might say: &ldquo;It is a serious offence, the person has no legal aid and no means to get legal aid but he has not disclosed any defence.  Therefore, it appears to me that he has not any <i>bona fide</i> defence <Col N="502" /> and I shall not give him a certificate entitling him to any free legal aid.&rdquo; I would say those words are really dangerous words to put in the section because they might encourage a member of the Garda Síochána to say to the accused person &ldquo;If you disclose your defence you will get legal aid or if you disclose your defence you have a better chance of getting legal aid.&rdquo;  If the Minister will forgive me again for using the word &ldquo;meaningless&rdquo;, I would say the words are meaningless if they do not mean that the person who discloses his defence has a better chance of getting legal aid than the person who does not disclose it.  If that is the object of putting those words into the section they are taking from an accused person in necessitous circumstances a right which he has enjoyed for a long number of years and which has been regarded in the legal profession as a valuable right, because up to now the accused person was entitled to withhold his defence until the prosecution case closed before the judge and jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to be unfair to put an accused person in necessitous circumstances in a less favourable position than an accused person who is able to provide his own defence.  The whole object of this Bill, a very worthy object, is to try to prevent a miscarriage of justice.  I think, and those who have long experience in criminal practice will agree with me, that a miscarriage of justice could be brought about by encouraging a person, who at that stage is not legally represented, to disclose the nature of his defence.  I would say that could lead to a miscarriage of justice and that instead of the Bill attaining its object it could bring about that state of affairs.  I do not think the Bill gains a lot by having those words in it.  I do not think it will save the Exchequer or the taxpayer any considerable amount of money by including those words in the subsection.  The subsection as it stands is undesirable.  There is nothing contentious in either the section or my amendment.  My amendment has been put down with an honest desire to produce an Act that will be work- <Col N="503" /> able and fair to the accused person and to the State and which will achieve the object which the Minister had in mind when introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will forgive Senator Fitzpatrick for using the word &ldquo;meaningless&rdquo; if he will forgive me for appealing for commonsense in approaching this Bill.  I do not understand the Senator's difficulty with regard to those words and I hope I may be able to persuade him that they are, if I may use this rather debated word, &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.  The argument used in the Dáil with regard to this particular section was that the phrase &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances of the case&rdquo; was sufficient, that once you used those words it was not necessary to elaborate on them in any way.  But there is a danger in the use of these words &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances of the case&rdquo; and no more.  The district justice in returning a person for trial, or the Circuit Court judge in considering the application for legal aid, might say in relation to those words: &ldquo;This means I must have regard to all the circumstances. The nature of the defence is one of the circumstances of the case, a very relevant circumstance&rdquo;&mdash;he might say&mdash;&ldquo;so I must require the defendant to disclose his defence to me.&rdquo;  I am in full agreement with Senator Fitzpatrick that it should not be necessary for the defendant to disclose his defence.  These words were inserted to ensure that he does not have to disclose his defence and they are a safeguard because otherwise the justice or judge might say the nature of the defence was one of the circumstances to which he had to have regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands achieves what both Senator Fitzpatrick and I desire, namely, that if the defence has been disclosed the nature of that defence will be one of the factors a judge will take into account and if it has not he will not be required to inquire what it is.  The phraseology here is exactly the same as is used in Great Britain.  The Rushcliffe Committee which examined this matter in Britain, on the basis of whose report <Col N="504" /> the comprehensive scheme of legal aid was introduced, quoted from, and made no adverse comment on this statement in the <i>Justice of the peace:</i></P>
    <P>Under the repealed Act of 1903, it was undoubtedly necessary that a defence should have been disclosed before legal aid could be granted; the Act of 1930, however, required the certifying authority to take into consideration the defence, if any, thus clearly implying that the disclosure of the defence is not now a condition precedent.</P>
    <P>The 1930 Act has exactly the same wording as we have.  The words were inserted as a safeguard and as the Bill was going through the Dáil we changed the wording to strengthen that safeguard.  The Draftsman had assured us that the original wording was clear but some doubts were expressed in the Dáil and so we reworded it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and myself are now <i>ad idem</i> in so far as both of us think it is undesirable that an accused person should be invited to disclose his defence.  In those circumstances I would ask the Minister to make a simple amendment by making &ldquo;including&rdquo; read &ldquo;excluding&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Surely the nature of the defence is one of the factors that would in certain circumstances dictate whether the granting of free legal aid was absolutely necessary.  The defence might be of such a nature as to indicate that there was a complex legal issue involved.  The Senator's proposed substitution would preclude the justice from having regard to the nature of the defence even if it had been set up and I suggest the Senator would not like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the section as it stands is open to abuse in so far <Col N="505" /> as an accused person may be encouraged to disclose his defence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Fitzpatrick at all.  The only matters that are to be taken into account are the circumstances of the accused, whether it is essential in the interests of justice.  If the accused has already set up his defence, if I go into court and indicate that I want free legal aid for this man, I submit that it is in the interests of justice he should be represented by a lawyer because his defence is such and such.  I actually set up the defence then.  The court is entitled to take it into account; otherwise, the court cannot consider it or, by reason of the insertion of the words in the section which Senator Fitzpatrick wants excluded.  I submit that if they were excluded they would give the section the meaning which Senator Fitzpatrick wants to avoid. One of the facts to consider is whether the man has any defence or no defence. Is he pleading guilty?  Under the section as it is the man has not to disclose and it excludes the court considering the nature of his defence unless it is already in anticipation of being set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I still remain unconvinced. I think that the section as drawn is open to the abuse of encouraging a person to disclose his defence and some words should be put into it to make it obligatory on the judge to warn the accused person that he need not do so.  I do not press the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> Before section 8 to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;8. (1) Where the Court of Criminal Appeal awards costs under section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, or section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, to a person who holds a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate covering the proceedings in respect of which the said costs have been so awarded, such person shall give credit for the costs payable under said certificate.</P>
    <P>(2) Where the Court of Criminal Appeal awards costs under said section 34 or section 5 to a person who holds a legal aid (appeal) certificate covering the proceedings in respect of which said costs have been so awarded, such person shall give credit for the costs payable under said certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section as it stands means that the Court of Criminal Appeal is precluded from awarding an accused person costs, as is the position at present.  If a person is convicted before a judge and jury and if that person appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the Court of Criminal Appeal sees fit to set aside the conviction on the grounds that the trial was unsatisfactory or on some other valid ground, then the Court of Criminal Appeal has jurisdiction at the moment to award the accused person the costs of the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the costs of a new trial if a new trial is ordered.</P>
    <P>The costs to which that person is entitled are such costs as will tax on a solicitor and client bill.  The bill is submitted to one of the Taxing Masters of the High Court.  He taxes the costs and the accused person can get only such costs as are properly taxable.  The section as it stands takes that right away from an accused person who has been granted free legal aid.  In other words, once the person is granted free legal aid he must stand or fall by his legal aid certificate even if the State, in presenting their case in the court of first instance, before judge and jury, make a mistake in presenting the case or present some evidence which <Col N="507" /> should not be presented, or if the trial judge misdirects the jury.</P>
    <P>The accused person then has to appeal but he is not to have the right which he now enjoys of being awarded solicitor and client costs by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I agree with the Minister it would be absurd that the person should get costs under his legal aid certificate and costs on a solicitor and client basis.  Nobody wants that. However, I think it was admitted that the costs that a person will get on a legal aid certificate will be substantially less than the costs to which he would be entitled on a taxed bill of costs basis.</P>
    <P>My amendment means nothing more than that if a person in the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal is wrongly convicted by a judge and jury, and has his appeal allowed, he should be entitled to be allowed full solicitor and client costs but must give credit for the costs which he has been awarded under the legal aid certificate.  That is only reasonable.  I think that this section, as it now stands, is another instance of the accused person who seeks legal aid being placed in a worse off position than his wealthy fellow citizen.  I do not think that that was ever the intention of the Bill.  I think that the State would not lose anything by accepting this amendment.  There is nothing more that I want to say about it.  I think it is a reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  I should like to explain my reasons to the House. The provisions to which the Senator refers, that is, Section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, and Section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, were introduced in circumstances when there was no scheme of free legal aid.  The very fact that we are now introducing a scheme of free legal aid changes that situation radically.  It is logical to expect that where we introduce a scheme of free legal aid, where we grant a man a free legal defence at all stages from the District Court to the Circuit Court up to the Court of Criminal Appeal, we should be expected to retain in regard to that man <Col N="508" /> provisions which were introduced to cater for entirely different circumstances, that is, circumstances when there are no scheme of free legal aid in existence.</P>
      <P>I think it is only fair that if an accused person proves to the satisfaction of the court that it is essential in the interests of justice that he get free legal aid, and proceeds to avail himself of it, he should then continue under the scheme to the end and should not, when he comes to the Court of Criminal Appeal, be able to opt, as it were, into a different system which Senator Fitzpatrick seems to assume will provide a more satisfactory scale of costs than the one we propose. The Senator is assuming that the scale of costs that will be worked out under this Bill will be entirely unsatisfactory &mdash;at least that it will be less satisfactory to the solicitor and counsel than the present position in the matter of costs.</P>

      <P>What I have said in the Dáil on this very point is that I hope we shall be able, in drafting regulations in consultation with the Law Society and the Bar Council, to provide a scale of fees which will be acceptable to both professions.  When I say that they will be acceptable I suggest they will be acceptable, bearing in mind the tradition of both professions of voluntarily providing free legal aid in deserving criminal cases.  When we take that tradition into account, which is in our present system, I am confident the scale of fees to be prescribed under this Bill will be accepted by the members of both professions as satisfactory.  I do not think we should assume otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick wants to ensure that where a person receives free legal aid and gets as far as the Court of Criminal Appeal under the scheme, he <Col N="509" /> will then be able as it were to throw that scheme overboard and opt for a different set of costs&mdash;the costs which apply at the moment, when there is no free legal aid scheme in existence.</P>
    <P>I think the proposal in the Bill is a fair one.  We shall still have accused persons going to the Court of Criminal Appeal, winning their cases and being awarded costs under the old provisions. We are not interfering with that at all.  We are stipulating that where a person proceeds to avail himself of the benefits of this scheme and gets as far as the court of criminal appeal under it, he must stick to the scheme and cannot at that stage opt for a completely different system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is somewhat different.  It is all right defending an accused person who has been returned for trial before a judge and jury.  Once that trial is disposed of, if it ends there, I think the professions would be satisfied, but if either the people employed by the State or, with the greatest respect, the learned judge makes a mess of the trial and the accused person appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the Court of Criminal Appeal holds that the person has grounds for dissatisfaction and is entitled to a new trial and orders a new trial, there you have not one trial, but one, two, three trials.  While a person might be prepared to accept somewhat reduced fees for the first appearance, it is unreasonable that he should, through the fault of the State, be compelled to follow the accused up to the Court of Criminal Appeal and back down to the Central Criminal Court for the same limited remuneration.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, but as against that they take many cases, lose, and get nothing.  We are introducing a rational element into the situation in which solicitor and counsel will be employed and paid in cases which go to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      <P>There may be somewhat of a difference of opinion between myself and the two professions as to whether what we pay will be adequate.  At least I hope it will be substantially adequate.  In those circumstances I think the logical thing to do is to have the two systems, bearing in mind that we are not doing away with the old tradition under which the Court of Criminal Appeal is entitled to allow costs.  In future it will remain in relation to the persons who have not availed themselves of free legal aid, if they have to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal will continue to be in a position to award solicitor and client costs.  Side by side with that the new system will operate and the person who got free legal aid will get it right up to the Court of Criminal Appeal and for any new trial that may be ordered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> In subsection (1), page 6, line 48, before &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;having consulted the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to make it obligatory on the Minister to consult the Incorporated Law Society and the Council of the Bar of Ireland before he makes regulations under Section 10.  I know the Minister has said it is his intention to consult the two branches of the legal profession before making these regulations.  I think he told us that in fact he had already consulted them.  I think the Minister is very wise in that because unless he and his Department get the co-operation of both branches of the legal profession on this scheme it is doomed to failure before it starts.</P>
    <P>Under the section as it stands, there is no obligation on the Minister to consult either branch of the legal profession. It may be his intention to consult the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council&mdash;he has given that assurance and I am sure he will honour it&mdash;but how do we know what some successor of his will do?  How do we know what approach he will make to this matter?  There is another point; if it is written into the Bill that the Minister must consult the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council before making regulations, those professional bodies will feel they are part of the scheme, and that they are being asked by the Oireachtas to help the Minister in running the scheme.  Notwithstanding the Minister's remarks on Second Stage, it is more likely that he will get the co-operation of the professions if he goes to them and asks for their advice and help, and if he accepts that advice and help when he gets it.</P>
    <P>If it is the Minister's intention as he has told us&mdash;and I am sure it is&mdash; to consult both branches of the profession before making regulations, then surely there is no valid objection to writing that into the Bill.  That is a desirable and sensible approach and I think it is an approach that would be <Col N="512" /> calculated to get the goodwill of the solicitors' profession and the Bar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I regret I must differ from my friend Senator Fitzpatrick on this amendment.  Our experience in the solicitors' profession has been that the Minister has invariably conferred with us on matters which materially and fundamentally affected the profession.  He has already conferred with us in relation to this Bill, and he has stated in the Dáil that it is his intention to confer with us before drafting the regulations.  Therefore, for my part&mdash;and I think I am expressing the views of a great number of my profession&mdash;I would prefer to rely on what the Minister has said rather than appear to doubt his word by having written into the actual Bill that he must confer with us or must consult with us.</P>
      <P>There is a very big difference between conferring or consulting with a body and co-operating with a body. You can write in that you must consult or confer if you like, but it is a very different matter from co-operation. We in our profession welcome this Bill and we hope to act in co-operation with the Minister.  That co-operation could be got very much better both on our part and on the Minister's part with a spirit of good-will which heretofore existed&mdash;and I am speaking only for my own branch of the legal profession&mdash;between the Minister and ourselves.</P>

      <P>None of us is in a better position to know the mind and outlook of the Law Society on this or any of these matters, than Senator Nash.  He is a distinguished ex-President and a very honoured member of the Council and I must say that I fully agree with what he has said. He has put it much better than I could have put it.  I am very happy to be able to tell the House that as <Col N="513" /> Minister for Justice I have the most excellent relations with the Law Society and I hope they will continue for a long time.  I feel sure that if I give an undertaking here as Minister for Justice that I will consult the Law Society or the Bar Council with regard to making these regulations any such undertaking would be honoured by my successor in office, no matter from what Party he came.  He would feel he had a certain obligation to do that.</P>
      <P>The simple truth of the matter is we have already discussed the matter with both professions and will do so again. I fully agree with Senator Nash &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The discussions would lose something if they were obligatory.  It is desirable that a Minister when consulting with a vocational body should do so freely and voluntarily.  If there were a statutory obligation on him to do it I think he would be more likely to carry out the consultation as a mere gesture.  I think Senator Fitzpatrick would be the first to admit that the writing of these words into this statute would mean nothing unless the Minister of the day were prepared to take them in the proper spirit.  Otherwise he could simply consult with the Law Society and the Bar Council in a perfunctory fashion and then forget all about it. What we really want is co-operation between the Department of Justice and the two great legal professions. We have it at the moment and I have no doubt that we shall be able to continue to have it.  I really do not think that those words are necessary at all and that indeed the section would lose something if we were to put them in.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1) (c), page 6, line 55, at the end of the paragraph to add: &ldquo;provided that the accused person shall be entitled to have assigned to him the solicitor of his <Col N="514" /> choice, provided the said solicitor is available and willing to act on the terms provided by the regulations made under this section.</P>
    <P>This deals with the regulations which the Minister may make under Section 10 without consulting the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council. Paragraph (c) of Section 10 says that the Minister may make regulations prescribing, amongst other thing:</P>
    <P>That manner in which solicitors and counsel are to be assigned pursuant to such certificates.</P>
    <P>From a discussion in the Dáil and in this House it became apparent that the Minister is of the opinion that the district justice or the trial judge should in the final analysis decide what solicitor will represent the accused.  The Minister has accused me of being inconsistent in that I wanted to give the district justice a discretion in deciding whether or not it was essential in the interests of justice that a legal aid certificate should be granted, and that I did not want to give the district justice a discretion in selecting the solicitor by whom an accused person should be defended. With the greatest respect I say there is no comparison whatsoever, good, bad or indifferent, between the two things.  In Section 2, I think it is, when the district justice is deciding whether or not it is essential that a person should have legal aid he is exercising a judicial discretion.  He is giving a decision on circumstances and facts before him.  My argument then was that the court was tied up by the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo;, that it could not exercise discretion in the discharge of what was clearly a judicial function. In my opinion it certainly is not a judicial function to decide by whom a person should be defended.  I think that it is really only behind the Iron Curtain, or very near to it, that the State decides by whom a person is to be defended.</P>
    <P>In the earlier discussions on this particular section we had all sorts of talk about the administration of justice being obstructed by accused persons exercising their rights of choice of solicitors in an unreasonable manner. <Col N="515" /> Nobody wants to confirm on an accused person the right to obstruct the court or the administration of justice by nominating some solicitor who is not available, or who might not be available for weeks.  It was even suggested that an accused person in Cavan might call for a solicitor from the city of Cork to defend him. That would be absurd and nobody contemplates such a situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good solicitor down there, all the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, the choice that I am seeking for the accused person is a very limited choice.  It is the right of the accused person to choose from a panel of solicitors attached to the court before which he is to be tried such solicitor as may be available and willing to act for him.  As I say, it is the intention of the Minister to prescribe regulations whereby there will be attached to every court a panel of solicitors who intimate that they are prepared to defend accused persons in that court on the terms prescribed by the regulations.  In cities and larger towns you may have several solicitors on such a panel.  In smaller towns you might only have two or three.  My amendment simply asks that an accused person be given the right to say: &ldquo;From solicitors A, B and C, all of whom are on the panel and who are willing to defend me on terms acceptable to the Minister, I select solicitor B instead of solicitor C or solicitor A.&rdquo;  Is there anything objectionable about that?  Is there any likelihood that the administration of justice will be obstructed or impeded?  If two of the three solicitors are away and there is only one left, then the accused person must take him, but that situation could arise even in the case of a comparatively wealthy person.  But that is a very different state of affairs from an accused person being told that solicitors A, B and C are available but that he must be defended by solicitor A.  If an accused person who wants solicitor A is told that he must have solicitor B, he will go down into his grave believing that if he had been given the solicitor of his choice he would have been acquitted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Fitzpatrick on that.  I am quite satisfied that if the Minister had the experience in the district courts that solicitors have from time to time he would feel that often difficulties arise which are not, perhaps, easy to solve and it is possible that feelings of anti-pathy or at least tension could arise from time to time.  I feel that if an accused attends in court with his solicitor, whether the solicitor comes from Cork, Donegal or anywhere else &mdash;you may have a case of a man involved in a motor accident 40 or 50 miles from his home town and he may like to have a solicitor from his home town to defend him&mdash;there is the question of travelling expenses.  I do not know whether the Minister means to allow travelling expenses or not.  If he is allowing them there could be some difficulty but I do think that if an accused selects a solicitor and the solicitor is present in court, then it should be obligatory and the court should have no choice in the matter. If the Minister would put something into the regulations it would get out of the difficulty but I feel myself that it will create friction in certain cases between members of the profession if a regulation of that kind is not incorporated. Perhaps, he would agree to incorporate it in the regulations if he does not agree to amend the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Nash in his last few sentences put his finger on the important point, that is, that as the Bill stands at present, there is nothing to prevent my framing the regulations to give effect to what Senator Fitzpatrick wants.  The only difference between us is that Senator Fitzpatrick is proposing to write into the Bill a provision which would make it obligatory to do what he suggests is desirable.  My approach is that we are embarking on something which is experimental.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to have my hands tied to any excessive extent.  The Bill therefore provides for the making of regulations to govern the detailed operations of the scheme.  Initially I do not propose that those regulations will envisage a complete freedom of choice to the accused but after the scheme has <Col N="517" /> been in operation for a year or two it will be reviewed.  During that review the manner in which it has been operating will be scrutinised and if it then appears that the danger to which these two eminent practitioners have referred is there, there will be nothing to prevent us from changing the regulations to give limited freedom of choice to the accused.  I would not like, in the initial stages at any rate, to go as far as the two Senators suggest and I do not think we should write it into the Bill.  For that reason I think the amendment could be withdrawn and the position obtain whereby the initial regulations would leave the final choice to the district justice, bearing in mind that the regulation will also provide that he should have regard to the wishes of the accused.  But having listened to the accused, the final choice would rest with the district justice.  I think that is a wise precaution to take initially. There is the danger that the habitual criminal would use this provision to delay the whole process of justice and make the scheme unworkable.  I want to avoid that, in the experimental stage at any rate.  I have every hope that district justices will operate this scheme sensibly, reasonably and fairly. There will, of course, always be associations, the powerful law society itself, to bring to the notice of the Minister for Justice any complaints which they may have in regard to the operation of the scheme.  But I think that that is the right way to do it.  I think that that is the right approach to have.  I think that, initially anyway, until we see how this will work out, it would be wise to leave the final selection to the district justice.  If that does not appear to work out satisfactorily, after a year or so, then we can consider what changes should be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully invite the Minister to reverse the position.  If he cannot see fit to accept this amendment and in the first regulation provide for limited free choice of solicitor and if that leads to abuses, which I certainly do not think it will &mdash;if that leads to abuses contemplated by the Minister&mdash;then it is time enough to depart from what has been the <Col N="518" /> accepted privilege of the citizen in this country all down the years.</P>

Naturally, I would have to have regard to such a responsible approach.  There is not much between us now.  I think we all agree that the Bill, such as it is, should be enacted.

In other words, they suggested that they should have the right to decide whether or not any barrister might put his name on any panel drawn up for a particular court or circuit under the Bill.  Their thinking is along the same lines as my own&mdash;to the extent that there should be control in the initial stages.

On the Second Stage of the Bill I stated that if it ever became necessary to apply the Act to house-to-house collections I envisaged that collections made for religious and other obviously legitimate purposes would be exempted.  Having given the matter further thought I feel it is desirable that ordinary parish collections held for ecclesiastical purposes should be specifically exempted from control and this is achieved by the two amendments now proposed.  I should explain that the term &ldquo;charitable object&rdquo; in its legal sense includes the advancement of religion, the advancement of education, the relief of poverty and other purposes beneficial to the community.</P>

In subsection (b) of amendment No. 3, we read &ldquo;held in accordance with the laws, canons and ordinances of the religion concerned.&rdquo; I imagine some of the more recent religions, if I may put it that way, may not have all these three things. In law, would they be entitled to benefit under that section if they have not got laws, canons and ordinances?

      <P>I have re-examined the provisions of the Bill which impose obligations in regard to the furnishing of information to the Gardaí by applicants for collection permits and by holders of such permits and I have come to the conclusion that Section 12 is unnecessary and should be deleted.</P>
      <P>The matters on which a Chief Superintendent will normally require information for the purpose of considering an application for a collection permit will be those mentioned in Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Bill, and I feel that he should be able to satisfy himself about these matters independently of any information which he may obtain from the applicant.  If an applicant were to furnish information which was false or misleading, the Chief Superintendent would be in no better position than if he had received no information from the applicant.  Furthermore, the section might be construed as enabling a Chief Superintendent to insist on the production of accounts of a previous collection and this would be at variance with what is proposed under Section 24, as I will explain in relation to amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>The deletion of Section 12 will not prevent a Chief Superintendent from asking an applicant for a collection permit to furnish information in connection with the application.</P>

      <P>It is unwise to put Acts on the Statute Book which are impossible to enforce, and which indeed will never be enforced.  A political Party or the Gaelic Athletic Association could decide to take up chapel gate collections all over the country, and under the section as it stands the name of the person who is to stand at the table to take up the collection must be known beforehand, and he must hold or have in his possession an authority signed by the holder of the permit.  Amongst the details which must be contained in that authority is the name of the person standing at the table and his age.  Admittedly, if he is over 21 years it is sufficient to say he is of full age. Perhaps the Minister will tell me that the power to give this authority may be delegated by one person to another but surely it may be delegated at, shall we say, county level?  If anyone here tells me that he knows in advance the name and address of every person who will stand at a chapel gate to take up a collection on a particular day, I find it hard to believe but I congratulate him.  I should like the Minister to explain&mdash;perhaps there is an explanation&mdash;exactly what this section means. I may then have another word to say.</P>

      <P>I should have thought the section was fairly straight-forward. I do not think it will give <Col N="524" /> rise to any of the difficulties the Senator envisages.  He is inclined to think of some national secretary or central person issuing permits for the country as a whole.  That will not happen.  The provision in the Bill is that permission must be got in each Chief Superintendent's area.  We begin at that level.  The whole purpose and aim of the Bill is to control collections. This provision is necessary if we are to ensure that that control is a reality.  There is nothing whatever to prevent any organisation, the GAA or possibly the best organisation of them all, the Fianna Fáil organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know that this has been raised before but I should like to raise it again in this House.  I am not jesting about this matter.  I lived in County Tipperary for a number of years, and it was part of the yearly cycle of events for these men &mdash;they are not all boys; they are mostly men&mdash;to go around on St. Stephen's Day and celebrate the very ancient ceremony of the King of the Birds.  I feel deeply about this because there is a very ancient traditional parallel to it in ancient Greece&mdash;the Swallow Song.  It is one of the oldest ceremonies in this country.  Similarly, there are the mummers in Wexford, and all over the country children dress up on Hallowe'en.  These are ancient and honourable traditions, and I should like to be sure that they will not be prohibited by any restriction.  I notice in Section 8 (c) that fancy dress may be prohibited.  However, I think it is true for Tipperary that the wren boys there do not demand money. They ask for what is best called &ldquo;refreshment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The wren boys are as dear to my heart as to the heart of any Senator.  I can give the assurance which the Senators are seeking.  In the first instance, as I said on the Second Stage, I know, and most Senators would be in a position to confirm it, the wren boys as such do not collect money but if they happen to have it thrust upon them it is largely incidental. Apart from that, there is this aspect, the wren boys' operation would be in the nature of a house to house collection.  The provisions in regard to house to house collections do not automatically come into operation with the passing of the Bill.  They will have to be specially brought in by order.  I do not know if it will ever be necessary to bring in those provisions but in the event of it becoming necessary to bring in provisions governing house to house collections by order, then we have authority in the Bill to exempt certain forms of collection.  I want to assure the House that if I am the Minister in question at that time, and if that time comes, I will certainly favourably consider exempting wren boys from these provisions.  I am afraid I cannot speak for my successor in office but I am sure he too would value these ancient traditions as the House does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to have a look at Section 20 in conjunction with Section 25 and see if there is something inconsistent. Section 20 says that:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may demand of a person acting as a collector in a collection his name and address, and if the person refuses or fails to give to the member his name and address, or gives a name and address that is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>He shall be guilty of an offence if he does not give his name and address. Section 25, subsection (2), says that:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person whom he finds committing an offence under any provision of this Act or who, when his name and address are demanded of him under this Act, gives a name or address that the member knows or reasonably believes to be false or misleading.</P>
      <P>Under those circumstances, if you have a gentleman who simply does not give his name at all, he may be a stranger in the locality, the Garda is not enabled to arrest him.  But if he gives the name of John Brown which the Garda thinks is incorrect the Garda can arrest him.  I wonder is that the intention, that the Garda should not be able to arrest a person who refuses to give his name but may arrest a person who gives a name or address that the Garda knows or reasonably believes to be false or misleading.</P>

    <P>(II) to permit the Chief Superintendent, or any member or members of the Garda Síochána designated by him, to inspect any accounts kept by the person and any receipts or other vouchers relating to the collection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the obligations imposed on the holders of collection permits to keep accounts and to furnish information to the Gardaí about the proceeds of collections.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands provides that every person who has been granted a collection permit must keep full and proper accounts showing, in such detail as may be appropriate to the circumstances, the amounts collected and the application and disposal of the money together with all proper receipts or other vouchers.  The section furthermore provides that a Chief Superintendent may, within six months after a collection is held, require the permit holder to furnish a written statement showing the amount collected and how it was disposed of and allow a member of the Garda Síochána to inspect the accounts required to be kept under the section.  During the debate on the Bill in Dáil Éireann the view was expressed that Section 24 would impose a very undesirable burden on the organisers of collections and it was urged that the provision about the keeping and submission of accounts should be deleted. Having since given the matter further careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the section is somewhat severe and that it ought to be modified in such a way as to retain the right of obtaining information and of inspection only in appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposed new section a Chief Superintendent will be able to apply to the district court for an order entitling him to obtain information and to carry out an inspection on the grounds that it would be in the public interest to do so or that the proceeds of the collection are being devoted to an illegal organisation.  The question <Col N="531" /> of whether the public interest is involved will be a matter for judicial determination as the district justice will have to be satisfied that the granting of an order would be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Collections for religious or ecclesiastical purposes are being excluded from the scope of the section.  In general, these are the old-established charitable collections with which Senators will be familiar.  Such collections are not subject to inspection by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, and in this connection I should like to refer to a minute of a meeting in 1866 of the Board of the Commissioners in connection with changes then considered desirable in the Charitable Donations and Bequests Act, 1884.  I quote:</P>
    <P>It should be remarked that no substantial difficulty has arisen from the want of any compulsory powers of enquiry whereas at this stage sufficient information is generally obtainable voluntarily from various sources.  Such powers are, therefore, not introduced into the above suggestions. On the contrary, it seems to be the unanimous opinion of those who have closely studied the subject that it would be highly objectionable and unsuitable in the circumstances of this country and tend to defeat rather than promote the efficient work of the Board.</P>
    <P>In the Charities Act of 1961 no powers of inquiry or inspectors are given to the Board and, indeed, the Board's attitude on this matter has not changed since 1866.  Where charitable funds are improperly concealed, withheld or misapplied, the Board, with the consent of the Attorney General, may sue for their recovery and they may certify to the Attorney General any case in which it appears to them that legal proceedings should be instituted.</P>
    <P>The new section therefore, if I may say so, gives the necessary protection against bogus collections, while at the same time not imposing any unreasonabe or onerous burden on genuine collections.  I am now satisfied that the section in its original form would <Col N="532" /> have allowed for inspection where, in fact, inspection is unnecessary and undesirable.</P>

      <P>Is it not possible for the House to resolve otherwise? It does seem a pity to leave such a big backlog.  We have the time to deal with them.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dundalk Gas Order, 1962, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 6th day of June, 1962, under subsection 4 of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <P>The Dundalk Gas Company is a statutory company set up under a private Act of 1887 and is not subject to the ordinary provisions of Company Law.  Any alterations in the statutory provisions relating to the company have to be effected by means of a Special Order under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to grant additional powers to the company. Before the Order is made, it has to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given, I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>The Dundalk Gas Company has applied to me for a Special Order. Notice of the proposed Order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and a local newspaper.  Copies of the draft Order were sent to the local authorities in Dundalk and other public bodies who might be concerned.  No objections to the proposed Order were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> The object of the Order is to bring the Dundalk Gas Company into line with other gas undertakings in this country.  Its main provisions are to authorise the capitalisation of undistributed profits of the company by way of bonus shares so as to bring the capital of the company more into line with its capital investment; to enable the company to deal in other fuels such as liquid petroleum gas in order to improve its competitive position and to remove existing restrictions on the appointment of officials of the company as directors of the company.  The other provisions of the Order consist of a number of minor amendments in the legislation under which the company operates.</P>
    <P>Gas undertakings no longer enjoy the monopoly position they had at one time and they now have to meet stiff competition from other types of fuel. It is desirable, therefore, that outmoded restrictions should be removed. If the company were a non-statutory company, the changes being effected by the Order could be made in the normal way in its Memorandum and Articles of Association under the Companies Acts.  I am satisfied as to the need for this Order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the Order for the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
