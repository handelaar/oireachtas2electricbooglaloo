      <P>I have received notice from Senator Stanford that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House tonight, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The interference with television and radio transmissions by electrical machinery.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 p.m. to 10 p.m., or earlier if the business for the day concludes.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the business as announced by the Leader of the House, in discussion with the authorities, I find that my motion No. 11 is not in order, due to the fact that it is out of date in that what it asks under heading (i) has already been attained in the cease fire or, as it is called, the hold fire that prevails in Katanga at the moment.  The second part of the motion calling for &ldquo;a full investigation by representatives of the present members of the Security Council into the alleged atrocities in Katanga and events leading up to the present hostilities&rdquo; cannot be discussed because it was contingent on the first part.</P>
      <P>I accept that ruling and consequently I beg leave to withdraw the motion in its present form, but I hope within the next few days to put down a motion which will cover the material in subparagraph (ii) calling for this investigation, to widen the scope of the discussion considerably and to provide material for a full scale debate on the United Nations in this Chamber.</P>

      <P>Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an Seanadóir Mac Loingsigh oiriúnach i ngach aon sórt sli chun obair na Cathaoirleach a dhéanamh.  Tá an tabhairt suas air, an taithighe aige, an t-eolas agus an oiliúint is gá chun na hoibre seo.  I dteannta an méid sin is léir go bhfuil aige na tréithe aigne a chuirfeadh ar a chumas na dualgaisí a comhlíonadh mar a deineadh riamh anseo iad. D'fhoghluim sé agus rinne sé staidéir ar an Laidin agus ar an nGréigís tré Gaeilge i gColáiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh.  Deirtear go gcuiduigheann sé sin go mór chun soléireacht, cruinneas agus tuiscint a thabhairt do dhuine i dtaobh brí focal agus sin nídh a theastíonn go géar ón gCathaoirleach nó ón Leas-Chathaoirleach. Geobhaidh an Seanadóir Mac Loingsigh an tuiscint atá aige ar na neithe sin go léir a chur ag obair ar aon oráid nó tairiscint a dhéanfaí ins an tSeanaid pé acu i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge an chainnt.  Tá me deimhneach de go dtabhairfeadh sé cothrom na Féinne do gach aoinne.</P>

    <P>Senator Lindsay has the education, the experience, the knowledge and the training necessary for a Senator who goes into the Chair in this House. Apart from training and experience he has the qualities of mind which would enable him to do the work as it should be done.  He has done a course in Latin and Greek through the medium of Irish in University College, Galway, including a post-graduate degree.  That kind of course helps to give clarity, accuracy and understanding on the precise meaning of words.  Such an understanding and such a clarity are essential qualifications for the Chair. I think the Senator has the qualifications, therefore, which would enable him thoroughly to understand and to appreciate points that might be made to him whether in Irish or in English <Col N="55" /> during a discussion here.  He has had several years' experience in Dáil Éireann, including a period as a Minister. The procedure and practice in the Dáil are identical with ours with the single important difference that we have no financial powers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Senator Lindsay has some experience as a teacher which I think Senators will agree is very valuable and is very relevant to the position here.  He is a member of the Bar, a Senior Counsel, skilled in examining and in interpreting legal documents. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is Chairman of the Committee on Private Bills and legal experience would be of very great use in that position.  I am sure that if the Senator were elected he would be, as has been the practice here, at times indulgent but firm when the occasion arises and always fair.  I am confident he would uphold the good traditions which have been created in this House by the Chair.  Accordingly, I move that Senator Patrick J. Lindsay be elected as Chairman.</P>

Breis agus aondéag bliain ó shoin, i mí Meitheamh, 1950, do toghadh i mar ball de'n tSeanaid do'n chéad uair.  Tá eolas math againn, a obair leithi annseo ar fud na blianta ón am sin, ar na cáiliochtai thar barr atá aici.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to propose Senator Miss Davidson as Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Senator Miss Davidson was first elected to the Seanad in June, <Col N="56" /> 1950, and those of us who have worked with her in this House in the intervening years will be aware of her admirable qualities.  I feel that her patience and understanding, together with her knowledge of the working of the Seanad, make her an admirable choice as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Labour trade union group in this House has increased its representation as a result of the recent election.  It is separate and distinct from other groups.  It asks for the support of Miss Davidson's nomination as Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Murphy.  In doing so, I should like to endorse what he has said of our candidate.  Senator Miss Davidson, as Senator Murphy rightly pointed out, was first elected to this House in June, 1950.  Over the intervening period, I think those of us who have worked with her as members of the House will all agree she has filled the office of Senator with a dignity and ability which nobody could possibly doubt.  I am perfectly satisfied that she is quite capable of upholding all the traditions of this House.  I believe she is very fully equipped intellectually and from her long and able service to the House and her practical experience in many capacities of the operation of the work of the House to discharge the duties of the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach to the complete satisfaction of everybody on both sides of the House.</P>

      <P>The position of Leas-Chathaoirleach is traditionally filled by a member of the Opposition. On former occasions, there was only one candidate who was elected unanimously.  This time, there are two. We feel that the choice should be made by the Senators on the other side of the House and we have, therefore, decided to leave it to them.</P>

Chualamar, i gcás an Seanadóir Mac Loingsigh, go bhfuil Gaeilge aige ach ní duírt na daoine a mhol an Seanadóir <Col N="57" /> Iníon Níc Dhaibhidh focail faoi'n chálaíocht sin a bheith aici.  Is deacair é do dhuine cosúil liomsa, a chuireann an méid sin tabhacht in eolas na teangain le h-aghaidh post mar seo, a aigne a shochrú ar cad is ceart a dhéanamh ach, mara gcloisimid níos mó ó na daoine a mhol an tSeanadóir Nic Dhaibhidh, tá faitchios orm go gcaithfimid í a fhágáil as an aireamh i dtaobh an toghacháin seo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a rather extraordinary situation that the majority of this House should make a decision here today not to take part in a matter of such great importance.  I would be surprised if the Taoiseach nominated eleven people to come in here and not to vote on an issue such as this.  I am quite sure that, among the eleven he nominated, there are two industrious ladies who, if they were not tied up in a political knot, as one might call it, here today, would be glad to cast their votes for another lady who is going forward for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that none of those who roamed through the various counties interviewing councillors and asking for votes during the Seanad election would tell any of the people whom they asked for votes that they would abstain in such an important matter as this.</P>
      <P>It is not so long ago since you, a Chathaoirligh, were elected to the Chair and said what a great honour you considered it was to be elected to the Chair.  I remember that you thanked the Senators from your heart for the great honour they had bestowed upon you.  Here today the majority of this House refuse to cast a vote to bestow the next greatest honour that we could bestow on anyone in this House.  It is for that reason that I maintain that Senators should not be prevented from voting on such an important issue.  I also think that we are creating a precedent, that a minority of this House will vote on such a major issue as the appointment of Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Senator raised a point about Irish. I am quite certain that if Senator Miss <Col N="58" /> Davidson is elected Leas-Chathaoirleach she will find no difficulty as regard the amount of Irish she will have to deal with in the Chair.  The Party that puts the great importance on Irish here today, when a Senator of their own, who had no Irish, was elected Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, advanced every argument on that occasion as to why Irish was not so important.  That is not so long ago.  It is wonderful how they can show today that Irish is important and even say that it is an absolute necessity that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should have a fluent knowledge of Irish.</P>
    <P>I would ask the people on the other side of the House who have made this decision not to vote here today to unloose that knot and to give Senators an opportunity to cast their votes on this very important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the last speaker very strongly in this matter.  It is deplorable that the majority of the House should abstain from voting on such an important question as this.  Neutralism of this kind, whether in national or international politics, is most regrettable.  It will be open to some members of the House in future almost to say &ldquo;This is not our Leas-Chathaoirleach.  We had nothing to do with the election&rdquo;.  I do think it is a sign of pusillanimity on the part of the majority Party in this country not to take sides on this issue.</P>
      <P>All of us had the courtesy and many of us the pleasure to vote for the present Chairman, or against him.  At least, we expressed our opinions.  Now we are going to have the position where, in a very important decision, half of the House will be immobile, neutral, silent.  I regard that as a most regrettable decision, and I do hope it will not set a precedent.  I think the last speaker was very well justified in raising that point.  As he says, a majority of a minority will now elect the Leas-Cathaoirleach and, whatever the decision is, that decision will be lacking in authority on that account.  The members of the majority Party here must face the responsibility for that most regrettable decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to add another stricture to what the last Senator has said.  It is <Col N="59" /> regrettable that in the second meeting of this House Senator Mullins should talk about &ldquo;the other side of the House&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Opposition&rdquo;.  Now, whether he always takes it for granted or not that the majority of this House is devoted to purely political Party reasons and not to the vocational ideals which they are supposed to uphold, whether he believes that or not, let him please remember and let all members of the House remember that there are some Independents in this House who refuse to be classified as &ldquo;this side&rdquo; or &ldquo;that side&rdquo; of the House except in a purely geographical context.  I object to the Leader of the House for introducing this partisanship at such an early stage and for introducing it in connection with a policy of regrettable neutralism.</P>
    <P>What we have to decide now is who will be the best Leas-Chathaoirleach of the House, the most efficient, the most fair and the most experienced.  That alone should be before our minds.  It will certainly, I hope, be the only thing before the minds of the Independents, who may decide this issue; and I appeal to them at least, not to &ldquo;this side of the House&rdquo; or to &ldquo;that side of the House&rdquo;, but to those of independent mind that they keep only these three criteria in view&mdash;fairness, efficiency, experience.  These certainly are the criteria by which I personally intend to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the two previous speakers.  It is regrettable that the Leader of the House should, at the very start of this session, have continued to divide Senators into groups because we all like to believe that the Seanad is, in some sense or other, a vocational body.  In fact, most of the members of this House have been endorsed by certain vocational groups and their political affiliations were only secondary in the consideration of their suitability to represent those vocational groups. Consequently, I appeal to those who represent vocational groups here to act as those vocational groups would like them to act, to take their stand on this issue for whichever candidate <Col N="60" /> they consider best suited to discharge the duties of the Chair.  I hope this session will be marked by a far greater effort by vocational groups, first of all, to brief the Senators who represent them here so that the interests of the vocational groups are kept uppermost in our discussions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am criticising the decision of the majority of the House not to take part in this vote and surely I can give my reasons for that criticism.  The reason is primarily that I consider that such a decision is an affront to vocationalism and is an insult to those vocational bodies who shelved their own political leanings in one way or another and rallied behind the candidates of their choice in order to get them here.  Senators were not sent here to stand under the whip on this very first issue that has come before us.</P>

      <P>I came here today with the intention of casting my vote for Senator Miss Davidson out of the esteem and regard I have for her and my belief in her ability as an administrator and the knowledge she has derived, through the years, of political matters.  It is only right that I should remind people here present that we in Ireland had the great honour to have had equal suffrage granted in the Proclamation of our Republic.  We have had the great honour of electing the first woman M.P.; of having the first woman Cabinet Minister, of having the first woman ambassador, not only in this country but in the world.  Russia, before us, had a legation representative but not an ambassador as we have.  I think it only fair that, having regard to the ability and the knowledge of Senator Miss Davidson, we should now add to all those honours the honour of electing the first woman Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have slightly departed from the subject matter but the debate appears to be in reference to the fact that the largest Party in the House have no interest in the decision that will be made as to who will sit in the chair when you, Sir, vacate it.  That appears to be the issue before us and notice has been taken of that and surprise is expressed that the majority Party should have no interest <Col N="62" /> in who on this side of the House will be elected.  That would appear to convey that the minority side of the House will make the decision.  I think that should be examined again because whoever is elected should, in my opinion, have the majority support of the House.</P>

    <Title>Pilotage (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to modify certain provisions of the Pilotage Act, 1913, to facilitate the introduction of a more efficient, economical and up-to-date pilotage service at the port of Dublin.  There has been a progressive increase, in recent years, in the cost of operating the existing pilotage service.  It is clearly desirable to avoid further increases and, if possible, to reduce costs, as they are reflected ultimately in the cost of goods transported.  For these reasons, I have been pressing the Dublin Port and Docks Board, who are the Pilotage Authority at Dublin, to introduce a comprehensive reorganisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme which they have prepared follows a comprehensive review of the technical and safety aspects of the pilotage service, the mechanics of providing the service and the relevant statutory provisions.  The possible effects of the proposals on the remuneration and working conditions of the pilots concerned have also been borne in mind.  The present elaborate system is, I am advised, no longer warranted having regard to improvements in the manoeuvring qualities of ships, radio and navigational aids, and the deepening of and other improvements <Col N="64" /> to the harbour.  It is against this background that the Pilotage Authority has devised the proposed new arrangements. The Dublin pilots have agreed in principle with the proposals.</P>
    <P>Pilotage at Dublin is compulsory in an area bounded, on the seaward side, by an imaginary line which runs from Bray Head through points on the Kish Bank to Ireland's Eye.  These limits are set out in the Dublin Pilotage Order, 1925, which was confirmed by the Pilotage Order (Confirmation) Act, 1926.  With certain exceptions, every ship navigating in the district for the purpose of entering, leaving, or making use of any port in the district, must be under the pilotage of a pilot licensed by the Pilotage Authority.  Among the exceptions are the cases where the Master or Mate of the vessel holds a certificate from the Pilotage Authority empowering him to pilot his vessel in the area, or the ship is of a class which is exempted from compulsory pilotage by the Pilotage Authority in accordance with statutory powers.  In practice, and owing to the altered technical and physical conditions I have mentioned, the real need for pilotage has, in recent years, arisen in an area much smaller than that at present defined and the need for compulsory pilotage for smaller types of vessels has been reduced.</P>
    <P>The obligation of the Pilotage Authority to provide service up to the limit of the existing district has made it necessary for the Authority to maintain a more expensive types of service than is now warranted.  It is intended to reduce the compulsory pilotage district to an area bounded by an imaginary line through points between the Baily Lighthouse and Sorrento Point, extending some distance to seaward. Under this arrangement pilotage will have to be provided only in the area where it is, in fact, required.  This reduction in the compulsory pilotage district can, however, be effected by means of a Pilotage Order made under the provisions of the 1913 Act, and it is not, therefore, necessary to deal with it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Among the existing statutory exemptions from compulsory pilotage is one <Col N="65" /> which applies to coasting vessels up to 200 gross tons, not carrying passengers.  The reorganisation proposals include raising this tonnage exemption limit and extending it also to Home Trade ships.  Initially, the exemption would be conferred on certain unladen vessels but the Board propose to confer and extend exemptions gradually and over a fairly long period.  This method will obviate any question of redundancy among the pilots and is, of itself, prudent, as it will enable the Authority to assess the practical effects of each exemption before considering any extension.</P>
    <P>The procedure for exempting vessels from compulsory pilotage is laid down in the Pilotage Act, 1913.  A pilotage authority may, under pilotage bye-laws, made under the Act and confirmed by the Minister for Transport and Power, exempt coasting and Home Trade vessels not carrying passengers from compulsory pilotage.  Where, however, a bye-law appears to exempt a class of vessels which was not in practice exempt at the passing of the 1913 Act, the bye-law cannot become effective unless confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This procedure, which is a relic of a more leisurely parliamentary era, would in this case be unduly cumbersome as it would involve a fresh confirming Act at each stage of the proposed gradual extension of exemption. It is proposed, therefore, to repeal this requirement and to provide instead that when an exemption from compulsory pilotage is conferred by bye-law and the bye-law is confirmed by the Minister for Transport and Power, the relevant instrument shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by Resolution within 21 sitting days.  Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide accordingly.  It is an additional safeguard that, as in the case of pilotage orders, proposals to amend pilotage bye-laws must be publicised before being submitted for confirmation by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board has carried out studied based on the assumption that the exemptions from <Col N="66" /> compulsory pilotage would eventually extend to incoming vessels of 500 tons gross and out-going vessels and vessels shifting up to 750 tons gross.  These studies suggest that if the exemptions mentioned were conferred there would be a reduction of about 45 per cent. in the number of vessels to be piloted. This would represent a very substantial relief both to the Pilotage Authority and to ship owners but would mean a loss of about 27 per cent in the revenue from pilotage charges.  In terms of cash a loss of 27 per cent. of revenue would amount to about £11,000 per annum.  The Board would find it necessary to recover part of this loss in order to render the pilotage service as a whole economic and has decided that it would have to impose a special reduced charge on the vessels it now proposes to exempt from compulsory pilotage; the special reduced charge is not yet settled but a rate equivalent to one-third of the appropriate charge for pilotage is under consideration. Such a charge is justified by the fact that a pilotage service will be available on call to these vessels if required. The charge will, in effect, amount to a contribution towards having this on-call service available.  Under existing legislation, the proposed special charge could not be made, and the necessary provision is, therefore, being made in Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The measures described are designed to reduce to an appropriate and realistic level the demand for pilotage service which must be met by the Pilotage Authority.  This will, through time, reduce the cost of the service and confer savings in both time and cash on users of the port.</P>
    <P>The Board also intends, under the powers to make bye-laws which it already enjoys, to introduce economies and improvements on the operational side of the service.  The principal change will be the substitution for the existing pilot vessels of a shore pilot station from which ships will be served by small fast launches.  The shore station will, also, improve the working conditions of the pilots.  They will have recreational facilities while they wait on call and will be relieved of the <Col N="67" /> discomfort and inconvenience involved in living aboard ship until their services are required&mdash;especially so in bad weather.  I feel that the Board are to be congratulated on the thorough review they have carried out and the constructive proposals they have prepared.</P>
    <P>The Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann contains, in Section 4, some minor provisions to amend Section 22 (1) of the Pilotage Act, 1913.  The purpose of these was to revise in a minor way the arrangements for obtaining statistical returns from Pilotage Authorities and to relieve the Minister for Transport and Power of the obligation to present these returns to the Oireachtas.  The wish was expressed by the Leader of the Opposition at the Committee Stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann that the requirement that these returns should be presented to the Oireachtas might be retained and I undertook to have the Section dropped from the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that in so far as the reorganisation proposals are concerned this Bill is an enabling measure. It will not, of itself, introduce changes in arrangements for pilotage at Dublin. These changes will be brought into effect by Pilotage Order and Pilotage Bye-laws made in accordance with a statutory procedure which is designed to safeguard the interests of all interested parties and to permit them to voice their views.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure, as the Minister has said, is an enabling Bill and is intended to bring up to date certain matters with regard to pilotage about which I personally cannot express any expert opinion.  It does bring matters up to date and does enable our very competent Port and Docks Board to take certain steps for the benefit of the Dublin port.  It is interesting, too, that apparently the interests of the pilots who may become redundant have been safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing which strikes me and the Minister might possibly regard it as relevant&mdash;I am not sure whether it is.  In recent days we have been <Col N="68" /> hearing fog horns very frequently. There have been fog horns for as long as my memory goes back and I am far from being a young man.  They must be a very old and out of date method of giving warning.  The noise is discordant and by no means a comforting one.  I wonder whether modern scientific methods have been found which would enable us to dispense with the discordancy of fog horns.  I am putting the question to the Minister without knowing whether he can give me an answer offhand.  It strikes me as having some relevance to pilotage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill, and in welcoming it, I should like to pay a tribute to the Dublin Bay pilots for the fine work they have been doing for many years now.  I do not speak without knowledge in this matter.  From my own hillside in Dalkey, I can survey the whole area from Sorrento Point to the Baily.  I have seen the pilots do their jobs bravely and efficiently in very stormy seas.  I do not think that a Bill such as this should go through the House without some tribute being paid to them. I also welcome the fact that better conditions are to be provided for those men.</P>
      <P>This, too, I think, is the time and the place to recognise with gratitude the forward-looking policy of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  One needs only take a walk or drive a car down to the Alexandra Basin in Dublin to see the steady progress that has been made and the effective vision the Board has had throughout the years in developing the harbour.  It is a source of pride to a member of my university that the designer of the great extension to the Alexandra Basin was a graduate of Dublin University.  I mention these facts simply because I believe that the Dublin Port and Docks Board is a most worthy and efficient body, and I do not think this Bill should pass through the House without some recognition of their good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people will welcome the exemption of smaller ships from pilotage.  As a matter of fact, I understand that unofficially many of them were already coming into harbour <Col N="69" /> without pilots.  It is well to legalise that.  The provision for recovering the money that will be lost seems to be just and equitable.</P>
    <P>I was also glad to hear the Minister say in his closing remarks that he intends to restore the provision in the original Bill that certain information should be put before the Oireachtas. Section 4 of the Bill as it now stands before us provides for the deletion of subsection (1) in the original Bill, which states that &ldquo;any returns so delivered shall, as soon as may be, be laid before both Houses of Parliament.&rdquo; The arguments against deleting this were well made in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will welcome the restoration of a democratic check of this kind.  As was pointed out in the Dáil, it is some small encouragement to the men who make these decisions that at least they are on the Table of the House to be read and consulted even though it may happen that they are not consulted more than once in ten or 20 years.  I welcome the decision by the Minister to restore the provision.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that it is most desirable that something should be done about the fog horns, if I may dwell on them for a moment.  It seems to me that possibly they could be focused better, if I may say so.  There is a very loud fog horn at the end of Dún Laoghaire pier and it seems to make as much noise inland as out to sea.  Surely some scientific method could be found of sending its beam more out to sea and less inland.  When I lived nearer Dún Laoghaire I found that it could keep one awake far into the night because it sounds every 15 seconds if I am not mistaken.  I should like to ask the Minister to go down to Dún Laoghaire pier and judge for himself whether or not it is approaching a public nuisance.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what ships or what types of ships are exempted from the Dublin Port and Docks pilotage service.  I assume that the mail boat service and the British and Irish Shipping Company are exempted.  Are there others?  I should like to know as a matter of information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the members of the Seanad for the manner in which they have received this Bill.  In regard to fog horns, all I know is that it is a requirement for ships at sea.  It is quite possible there may be some substitute but I imagine the substitute would have to be an electronic one, with corresponding equipment for receiving whatever signal there was. From my limited knowledge of telecommunications I think several devices exist but the difficulty would be to force the owners of smaller ships to equip their ships with the receiving apparatus as well as having the transmitting apparatus.  Of course, fog horns do not arise under this Bill and all I can do is draw the attention of the Dublin Port and Docks Board to the matter. I do not think it is relevant but comes in under another statute.</P>
      <P>A variety of ships are exempt by the pilotage authority at the moment and it would be impossible to give any one definition of them&mdash;ships which are accustomed to use the harbour frequently, and so forth.  It would be impossible to classify them in any particular way.  So far as the returns are concerned, while Senator Stanford was glad I had decided to drop Section 4 of the Bill I want to make it clear that, so far as I am concerned, it was done simply because I did not feel very strongly one way or the other.  I am absolutely certain that the returns of pilotage have not been read by any member of the Oireachtas for many, many years except for curiosity sake but, if members of the House want to see them continued to be placed for examination I am quite willing although, as I said in the Dáil, full particulars could be obtained by way of Parliamentary Question at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to meet the need for more Garda Inspectors in the Dublin Metropolitan Division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 (2) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, provides that the Garda Síochána shall consist of such officers and men as the Government shall from time to time determine, not exceeding the total number of officers and men respectively specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.  That Schedule specified a maximum strength of 60 for the rank of Inspector but this number was increased to 90 under the provisions of Section 2 (a) of the Garda Síochána Act, 1945.  The approved strength of the rank was recently raised from 82 to the full statutory limit of <Col N="72" /> 90 in order to implement, in part, a scheme of reorganisation for the Dublin Metropolitan Division which was recommended by the Commissioner following investigation made by a firm of management consultants into the organisation of that Division.  To implement the scheme in full it will be necessary to appoint a further 13 Inspectors bringing the total strength for that rank to 103.  The Bill provides for a statutory maximum of 110 as it is considered prudent to provide a margin of 7 in order to meet future contingencies.  This would obviate the necessity for further legislation.</P>
    <P>The scheme of reorganisation to which I have referred is aimed at improving the present administrative system and increasing crime prevention efficiency in the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  It will allow of the establishment of the posts of a Communications Officer to take charge of 999 calls, telephone and teleprinter services and of a Crime Prevention Officer whose duty it will be to study crime prevention, advise and lecture to the Force on preventive methods and enlist the co-operation of the public in the taking of steps to protect and safeguard their property.  The scheme will also make possible: the assignment of an Inspector for supervisory control at each of the seven District Detective units; the appointment of four Inspectors for each of the six central city stations to maintain adequate supervision of these areas and the allocation of an Inspector with full station responsibility to each of 15 of the 17 other city stations.  In the 2 remaining stations, Kill O'Grange and Raheny, where individual control at Inspector level is not, in present circumstances, considered necessary, responsibility will vest in the Inspectors of adjoining stations&mdash;Dalkey in the case of Kill O'Grange and Clontarf in the case of Raheny.</P>
    <P>It is confidently expected that the additional appointments which have already been made, together with those which will be made under the authority of this Bill, will provide a big improvement in the machinery for criminal investigations and will, also, provide for adequate control of stations and <Col N="73" /> adequate outdoor supervision in the important central areas of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would all be in favour of this Bill.  It evidently recognises the importance of the Garda Síochána&mdash;indeed their growing importance.  Everybody would like to see conditions in which the public would co-operate with them a great deal more that it does at present. It is lamentable to see examples in the newspapers, even in Dublin, of cases where a member of the Garda Síochána in discharge of his duty fails to get the co-operation of citizens who are present.  I agree entirely with the terms of the Bill.  It strikes me that while there must be statutory establishment with regard to the number of officers and men in the Garda Síochána those who passed the Bill in 1925 must have billed it, so to speak, very well because there was no amendment until 1945 and now we have an amendment in 1962.</P>
      <P>One wonders whether the Minister should not have a greater degree of flexibility and whether in fact he is allowing himself sufficient play to deal with this whole question.  There are the conditions under which the police have to function and the conditions with which they have to cope are constantly changing.  I gather the Minister is proposing to take authority to appoint 20 more inspectors but is in fact at the moment appointing only 13.  That leaves him seven others.  One wonders whether that is sufficient.  I realise the Minister has advice from competent authorities who have given this matter considerable study and have great experience of it.  While there must be an establishment fixed by statute, it does seem rather hampering that it should be necessary constantly to have legislation to increase the number of inspectors.  I was wondering whether the number now set down, 110, is sufficient in the conditions now present and which are bound in the nature of things to get rather more complicated than simpler.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond wishing the Minister well in his efforts, particularly his efforts towards crime prevention and towards <Col N="74" /> interesting the public in crime prevention, the only comment I would make on the Bill is that I would like to see in it the greatest possible degree of flexibility, consistent with Parliamentary authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, we note it is a product of an investigation by management consultants. The Bill applies to the Dublin Metropolitan District alone. We would like to know from the Minister whether the investigation extended to the country as a whole and whether the increase contemplated for Dublin city will be applied to the country as a whole.  If so, we must take it that the existing legislation permits that.  We all welcome any effort designed to increase crime prevention facilities.  First, we all appreciate the excellent work done by the Garda and we realise how fortunate we are to have such a high standard of integrity and incorruptibility in our police service, but we cannot but be slightly apprehensive about the number of unsolved murders we have had in recent years.  I hope that the new standards contemplated here may go some distance towards solving some of those murders.</P>
      <P>Again, we are also very concerned with the growth of vandalism when we see the defacement of road signs, park facilities and even school facilities. It shows an immaturity of citizenship and it is high time we took more positive steps to combat it.  In other countries, especially in England and America, such vandalism would not be tolerated for a moment.  I hope in this reorganisation the Minister will have this aspect very much in mind. One pleasing feature about this problem of vandalism is that preventive measures would more than pay for themselves.  If we add up the cost of this vandalism, I am sure it would be far greater than the cost of the increase in the police force necessary to cope with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that a single officer is being appointed to lecture on crime prevention to the officers of the Dublin Metropolitan <Col N="75" /> District.  I should like to see that go much further and to see the organisation of public lectures both in schools and elsewhere to bring home to the younger generation the obligations of citizenship and the importance of the prevention of vandalism.  In that case the Minister would have to join forces with the Department of Education so as to reach the young people through the schools.  If the Minister comes back to this House to ask for a greater increase in the police force for the carrying out of these duties, the House will readily accede to his request.  We cannot but feel ashamed every time we see a broken road sign and a defaced park and unfortunately these are all too prevalent at the moment.</P>

      <P>Bá mhaith liom cuidiú mór leis an mBille seo. Taobh amuigh de chúrsaí tuarastail, níl aon rud chomh tábhachtach in aon ghairm-bheatha ná ceist dul chun cinn. I seirbhís ar bith nuair ná bhfuil caoi ag daoine iad féin d'fheabhsú ann, éiríonn na daoine mí-shásta agus bíonn locht le fáil ar a gcuid oibre dá dheascaibh. Is maith an rud é go dtabharfadh an Bille seo seans do bhreis daoine sa Gharda Síochána dualgaisí nua a ghlacadh agus iad féin d'fheabhsú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to welcome this Bill very much.  While it is primarily an <i>ad hoc</i> provision for the purpose of improving the service rendered by the Garda Síochána, it contains a by-product in that it provides greater opportunities for promotion.  While the provision of opportunities for promotion is not the main purpose of the Bill, nevertheless it is a very welcome development.  It is well known that in many services here frustration arises because of a lack of opportunity for promotion and this has a detrimental effect on the services rendered by the personnel of these services.  This provision is to be welcomed, therefore, because it will help to remove a lot of the frustration which seems to exist in the ranks at present.  Every person, in no matter what service he may be engaged, has an inborn right to promotion, to get ahead in that service, to improve his condition in society and <Col N="76" /> to increase his capacity in order to accept greater responsibility.  The Bill goes a long way towards removing much of the frustration which seems to sap and debilitate initiative in the service at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill seems to refer to the position in the Dublin Metropolitan Area alone.  It would be most welcome indeed if it could also have some effect throughout the country, especially in the stations in the larger areas.  Where opportunities for promotion do not exist, some provision should be made either in the scales of salary or by way of long service increments.  I welcome this proposal by the Government and I think it should have the full support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to support this Bill because I feel it goes a good way towards removing an old-standing grievance arising from what was considered to be unfair treatment in the matter of promotions and because it contemplates a reorganisation scheme in the interests of a more efficient service.  The Minister stated in the Dáil that over the next six years some 869 promotions will require to be made in consequence of age retirements alone and that promotion prospects for the Garda were never better than at the present time.</P>
      <P>Most of us are aware that over the years there has been an amount of discontent, particularly among the men with long service, because of their feeling of frustration on seeing men with, it is claimed, no greater, and sometimes even less ability and much less service being promoted over their heads.  This has resulted in the resignation of men of ability in special types of Garda work and with most valuable experience.  It has been claimed that the delay in apprehending the perpetrators of certain unsolved crimes is due to a shortage of men who had special training in the type of investigation necessary.  I have no way of proving this claim, but it is obvious that such resignations are a big loss to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has stressed that in any such force, only a proportion of the members can attain promotion and, as <Col N="77" /> a consequence, there will be some disappointment. This situation is accepted by all reasonable people but it underlines how gravely necessary it is that as far, as is humanly possible all favouritism, or even the appearance of favouritism, should be avoided and that men who have become experienced through years of satisfactory service should get special consideration and not be lightly passed over when promotions are under consideration.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be so frustrating to a Garda, or indeed to anyone, as to find himself placed junior in position to a young man with short service, with perhaps a very good theoretical knowledge of the rules, regulations, codes and practices of the force but with little real experience of putting his knowledge to the test in the hard and rough work of a policeman.  No doubt we want these intelligent men in the Garda Síochána but a few years' wait, while they accumulate valuable practical experience, will be all to the good for them, whereas, when the older man is passed over, he may decide to retire, seek private employment to augment his reduced pension and take away with him his accumulated experience&mdash;experience which is lost to the State and to the younger members of the force.</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister's references to the promotion ages over the past three years and I hope this indicates that some of the changes I seek are already being put into practice.  Any cases of resignations through promotion grievances of which I have personal knowledge arose more than three years ago.  Handling promotions will always be a difficult problem and as reported at columns 359 and 360 of Volume 192 of the Official Debates of the Dáil for 16th November last, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Other things being equal, preference is given to senior men, but suitability for higher duties and not seniority, is the determining factor.</P>
    <P>I can imagine that &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; phrase causing some suspicion.  I gathered from the Minister's Dáil statement that suitability would be decided by a written examination which, to a <Col N="78" /> young Garda, would present little or no difficulty as examinations with him have been normal routine until recent years, whereas the older man, with his examination routine well behind him, could well be unnerved by the requirements of the written test.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be very careful in measuring even considerable knowledge and little practical experience against a little less ability to tackle a written examination, but a storehouse of practical knowledge gained from satisfactory service in the carrying out of Garda duties, sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances. There is no text-book that can give experience and we should guard against losing our experienced men through frustration over promotion prospects.</P>
    <P>The scheme of reorganisation to which the Minister also made reference is welcomed and I hope it will result in greater all-round efficiency. Perhaps it would not be out of place if I mentioned a few points where I believe the Garda services could be improved and where they are badly needed.  In and around Dublin, many new housing areas have sprung up. To reach the more distant parts of these estates, it is sometimes necessary to travel stretches of lonely roads, often badly lighted.  We know through the Press that there have been a number of attacks on unprotected women and young people in these outlying areas and, as far as I know, the attackers have not been apprehended. Consequently, there is a deal of anxiety when women have to make journeys after dark.  There is also the problem of the safety of young persons coming from evening classes and such like.</P>
    <P>Parts of these housing estates are far from the bus routes, so that the residents must travel considerable distances on foot, and when it is remembered that the public lighting is switched off at midnight, the danger will be clearly realised.  If an attack were made on a person even near a house, the chances of attracting help would be very slight because, with the radio programmes we have today, a scream of distress would make little <Col N="79" /> impact&mdash;it would most likely be dismissed as the vocal climax of some of the so-called singers of today.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Minister that he would consider having a police squad car from the nearest Garda station patrol every part of these housing estates, particularly the less frequented approaches to them.  If a patrol car were to travel slowly&mdash;I would emphasise &ldquo;slowly&rdquo;&mdash;at different hours, at least once late at night, it would give a sense of security and lessen the possibility of attacks on unprotected persons.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this patrol service&mdash;and I realise this would be the concern of another Minister&mdash;I should like to see erected a number of telephone kiosks where a person could take refuge from a marauder and keep him at bay at least until 999 was alerted.  I think the expenditure involved in providing this protection would be worthwhile and would dispel much anxiety, particularly during the hours of darkness.  I ask the Minister to consider these suggestions and to see how far he can go in the interests of public safety.  As I said at the outset, I welcome the Bill for the hope it contains of better conditions for the men in the Garda Síochána and for the improvement in the service which it contemplates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I should like to say that I think we have been very lucky in the fine body of men we have had in the Garda Síochána since its formation in 1922. Under the Garda Síochána Act of 1945, the maximum strength of inspectors was fixed at 90.  The Minister now says we need a maximum strength of 103 and he is asking us for approval for a maximum strength of 110.  I am inclined to wonder with Senator Hayes whether the Minister is asking for enough.  The scheme of reorganisation which is presented to us here today has been formulated by the Commissioner in consultation with his senior officers and on the recommendation of a firm of management consultants. That is a very good idea which could be adopted by all State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> I should like to ask the Minister whether anything has been done as regards the rest of the country.  He tells us this has been done for the Dublin area.  If so, he has left room for the appointment of only another seven inspectors.  If it is intended to do this for the rest of the country another 10 or 12 might be needed. Perhaps the Minister has more information than we have and in all probability he is doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's action in introducing this measure leads to a reduction in crime we shall all welcome it.  There is no doubt serious crimes are being committed both in the city and in the country.  Many people are dismayed at the fact that there were five murders committed inside the last four or five years for which nobody has been brought to justice so far and that in all probability means that there are five murderers at large amongst the people of the Twenty Six Counties.  It is an unfortunate feature of recent years not only here but throughout the world&mdash; perhaps we are luckier here than in other countries&mdash;that crimes are on the increase especially crimes of violence against old people and people living alone.  As Senator Miss Davidson has stated and as was stated in the Dáil, there is also the fact that the incidence of attacks on unprotected women on the streets, particularly in the City of Dublin, is assuming serious proportions. I think it is agreed that many of these cases are not reported to the police which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>A great deal of public anxiety exists because of that.  In certain parts of the city, girls are afraid to go out alone and parents are apprehensive for the safety of their children and of their daughters. The duties of the Garda are such that, no matter how well trained members of the force may be and no matter how many extra inspectors the Minister may appoint or we may agree to have appointed, they are unlikely to be successful without public co-operation. I am very glad the Minister has stated that he intends to appoint a crime prevention officer whose duties will be to advise and lecture and to enlist the support of the public.  Public co-operation <Col N="81" /> is essential in the fight against crime because the fight against crime demands teamwork between the Garda and the members of the public.  An appeal should go forth from us here to the general body of citizens to co-operate with the Garda in their efforts to crush the activities of the criminal elements operating here.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the police do not get from the general public the co-operation and the information to which they are entitled as was borne out by the public Press at least three times in Dublin last year.  I know of one incident where a young Garda had apprehended a burglar and had him cornered.  The man took out a knife and, according to the reports in the newspapers, the Garda appealed to the people looking on, over 100 able bodied men, to come forward but there was not one person in the crowd who had the moral courage to come forward and assist him in performing his duty.  Instead of that they encouraged the criminal to escape which he eventually did.  Such cases also occur in connection with car accidents.  I know a man who was in a car accident not so long ago.  He was not in any way to blame&mdash;another car pulled up in front of him&mdash;but there were four people standing on the bridge watching him and as he walked over to ask them to give their names the four people went away.</P>
    <P>I believe that some of the murders I spoke of earlier on could be solved if certain people had the moral courage to come forward and give the information which it is believed they have. Appeals have been made by the Church and by the State that people with vital information should give it to the police but they have refused. That is a deplorable state of affairs. Perhaps at one time in our history there was a good case to be made for non-co-operation with anybody in uniform in this country but it is completely different today.  People should co-operate with the Garda Síochána when they are trying to do their duty. It should be remembered by all Irish people that these people are our own force, that they are our own brothers and sisters, perhaps cousins, with Irish <Col N="82" /> officers, with an Irish Minister and an Irish Government.  It is their duty to protect our lives and our property and people should be eager to assist them in the detection of crime of any description.</P>
    <P>All law-abiding citizens of the State will agree with the Minister as to the desirability of crime prevention and I wonder whether, instead of making just one appointment to the city of Dublin, the Minister should make three or four appointments for different parts of the country as well.  It may be his idea to test it out here in the city and then, if it succeeds, to apply it to the rest of the country; I do not know.  We all agree that every effort should be made to wipe out crimes of violence.  Those guilty of crimes of violence deserve no sympathy.  Members of the public should do everything in their power to assist the Garda to prove to those people that crime does not pay.  It is agreed by all that if the detection percentage is high and people realise they are running a grave risk of being caught then fewer people will indulge in crime.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that many law-abiding citizens, while deploring crime, are not always willing to assist in its prevention or in the discovery of the culprits.  They withhold information which could be of great help to the police force.  In the city at the present time we have teddy boys.  They roam the streets in gangs of five, six or seven. They jostle people and push them off the streets.  You see them pushing girls off the streets.  If you say anything to them their language is anything but parliamentary.  I wonder if anything could be done to put down those young blackguards.  Perhaps they do not commit a crime serious enough to lodge them in jail.</P>
    <P>We all know that those teddy boys have a peculiar dress and are very fond of a long hair style.  I have read that in some foreign countries the authorities concerned cut every bit of hair off their heads and then let them out. Permission should be given to the Garda to bring in those people and to clip every single bit of hair off their heads.  That would keep them indoors <Col N="83" /> for two or three months.  It might do some good if that system were adopted here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Mention was made of crime prevention officers.  They are to advise, to give lectures, to try to prevent crime and to enlist the support of the public.  The crime prevention officer is to give lectures.  Would it be a good idea if he gave lectures in our schools?  He is to give lectures to the Garda, in any case, and he is also to enlist the support of the public. Now that we have our own television service I think the officer should make full use of it in this regard.  He should make use of it to appeal to the general public to co-operate with the Garda and assist them in every possible way in the detection of crime and the apprehension of criminals.  It should be impressed upon our people that in helping the Garda they are not informing but doing a public duty.  Many Irish people are under the impression that if you tell anything to the Garda you are an informer.  They should be told and our children should be taught in schools that by helping the Garda they are not informers but are performing a public duty.</P>
      <P>The crime prevention officer should also request parents and teachers to see to it that children for whom they are responsible are taught to have a little more civic spirit and to have more regard for private and public property. It is deplorable that children are inclined to deface road signs and damage public property.  Appeals should also be made to teachers and especially to parents to recognise the desirability of quelling any criminal tendencies in young children.  They should sternly discourage lack of respect for private and public property as well as anything in the nature of larceny or vandalism or crime of any description, no matter how it may appear in young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to get the full co-operation of the people, they must not think there is one law for the rich and another law for the poor.  All citizens of the State <Col N="84" /> should be treated alike, irrespective of class, creed or politics.  If a member of the Garda performs his duty he should have the full backing of the State.  Unfortunately, we find that, instead of that, for certain people, for those with influential friends and perhaps especially friends in politics, laws are figments upon parchment, whereas for others, they are stern facts whose mandate must be obeyed.  Rightly or wrongly, many people are under the impression that the jingle of gold drowns the voice of justice.  That should not be so.  In England, for example, we know that no matter how influential a person may be, even the daughter of a Prime Minister or a member of the judiciary, if such a person is found under the influence of drink, for example, the full rigour of the law will apply.  Unfortunately, that is not the case in this country.  It is one of the reasons the general public are not prepared to throw their full weight and their full resources behind the members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>It is more than important that every member of the Garda Síochána, from the youngest to the oldest, should be satisfied in his mind that if he faithfully discharges his duties, then, no matter how influential the person he apprehends may be, the Garda will be supported and sustained by his superior officers and by the Minister for Justice.  If we allow or accept in Ireland a dual standard under which certain influential people are exempted from conforming with the law and, immediately they are apprehended breaking the law, get in touch with a Teachta Dála, a Senator, a Parliamentary Secretary or perhaps a Minister and get their case quashed, I believe it will be impossible to establish and maintain a decent police force here.  It is of paramount importance to establish definitely that if a Garda does his duty, no matter who the culprit may be, instead of being sent, perhaps, to the West of Ireland or to some outlying station, as has so often happened in the past, he will be sustained and supported by all his superiors.  I wish to say that I welcome the Bill.</P>

Is olc an scéal, <Col N="86" /> ach is baoghal gur fíor, má bhíonn fear gabhtha annseo le mí-iompair ar sráid Átha Cliath, ná beidh cabhair le fáil ag an Garda ó'n phobail.  Is luatha go mór go mbíonn an cabhair le fáil ag an gcuirptheach.  Gheobhaidh seisean cabhair le dul as greim an Garda Síochána.  Sin an rud go bhfuil gádh le na atharú agus go bhfuil gádh le teagasc chun a tatharú sin a dhéanamh, go mór mór mar gheall ar an dream óg atá ag fás anois.</P>
    <P>Is uathbhásach an scéal é an rud a luaidh an Seanadóir L'Estrange annseo: Garda Síochána ann; greim ar cuirptheach aige; agus 100 daoine i láthair ná tugann lamh nó cos chun cabhrú leis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I wanted to say has largely been said by Senator Miss Davidson and Senator Brosnahan but there is one aspect of the Bill and its effect on the members of the Garda Síochána that I want to develop.  I am sure the Minister wants to get the most efficient Garda service possible and I suppose he will be told immediately that he can get that if the pay and the conditions are satisfactory.  I do not want to develop the question of pay, except, in passing, to say that I hope the Minister will succeed in getting a machinery of negotiation which will be suitable and satisfactory to the members of the force.</P>
      <P>In regard to conditions other than pay, again, in passing, I would say that the Minister might have regard to the fact that the newer generation, the people coming into the service now, are not content to put up with the conditions their predecessors put up with.  Conditions in barracks which might be tolerated by the older generation are intolerable to the younger generation.  Probably it is the same in every employment; young people coming in have different standards, expect conditions different from those tolerated by their predecessors.  I hope the Minister will see to it that something is done to improve conditions in the barracks.  It is deplorable to read in the newspapers of the conditions said to exist in barracks throughout the country.  We probably have a backlog of improvements to be done but I urge the Minister to put those things in hands quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter on which I want to speak at somewhat greater length is what I term &ldquo;job satisfaction&rdquo;.  We are recruiting into the Garda young intelligent people with a very good education and from my knowledge of dealing with people of that type I think it is essential that they <Col N="88" /> should have reasonable opportunities of promotion, of advancing in the service.  People of that educational standard are not content, and feel frustrated, if they have no opportunity of taking on greater responsibilities and developing as persons, getting promotion within the service.  The Minister is a young man and he has not met that problem of frustration. I think he is young enough to see my point that for this type of people it can be soul-destroying to them as individuals, as persons, if they have no opportunity of advancing in the service, of becoming what I term bigger persons.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say, as quoted by Miss Davidson, that in determining promotion matters, suitability would be the prime factor&mdash;perhaps these are not his exact words&mdash;but that service would count other things being equal.  My experience in dealing with these problems of promotion in other fields is that &ldquo;other things&rdquo; are never equal.  The management&mdash;if I may so describe the Minister and his Department&mdash;are always concerned to get the most suitable person when a promotion arises.  I can quite see their point.  They want the most suitable person irrespective of the service of the applicants.  I sometimes fear that regard is not had to the damage done to the morale of the staff as a whole when good, faithful and efficient service is overlooked.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take a somewhat different approach to the problem. It would be in the best interest of the service as a whole that the senior man should be given the promotion if&mdash;and this is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;he can reasonably do the job which he seeks. If, however, it is deemed by the people in charge that he cannot do the job because of some failing on his part, those responsible for so deciding should have the courage to tell the person in what way he has failed.  I think that approach to the vexed problem of promotion would be better than the approach of selecting the person regarded as most suitable and, where other things are equal, having regard to seniority.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I must admit that no matter what system or what <Col N="89" /> approach the Minister takes, it is probably impossible to solve this problem of promotion because of what I would term the wrong age structure in the Garda as a force. Generally, they were all recruited at a certain time and we had people of the same age group competing for promotion.  There was not an even flow of promotion as a result and now we shall have the same problem again.  In the past few years there has been a heavy influx of young people into the Garda and, for the next few years, they will have very good opportunities of promotion, but when they have been promoted, the prospects for those who come in subsequently will be very poor.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the Minister can do much about this except by trying to encourage people to retire at an earlier age and by trying to get an even flow of recruitment and a corresponding evening-out of promotions.  Unless that is done it will be bad for the service and I would ask the Minister to give some consideration to this problem at a later date although frankly I cannot see any ready or easy solution but I am drawing his attention to the matter in the hope that some way can be found to even up the flow of recruits and correspondingly even up the prospects of promotion.</P>

      <P>In welcoming this Bill I should like to add to the compliments that have been paid to the Garda as a force.  Since its foundation its members have earned themselves a very high reputation for efficiency, fearlessness and integrity.  It is a very good thing that the force still enjoys that reputation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just one or two points I should like to raise with a view to enabling the force to carry out its duties more efficiently.  There are two points in relation to enforcement of the Road Traffic Act passed last year.  We all hope that that Act will be effective in reducing the slaughter on our roads and making the roads safer for those who use them.  The Minister told us today that he will make provision for the giving of lectures by an officer on the prevention of crime.  I suggest the Minister should also take steps to have <Col N="90" /> lectures on the road traffic code in every school, not necessarily by a commissioned officer but by a member of the Garda who would, I am sure, be highly competent to give such lectures. It may be some lectures are given but they are not given on anything like an extensive scale.  A few lectures in every educational establishment in the country would go a long way towards instructing young people in the rules of the road for their own safety and the safety of others.  Many more young people are now cycling to school and it is often alarming to watch their behaviour on the roads.</P>
    <P>Again, I think a number of motor cycle patrols should be provided in every country.  The provision of such patrols should not be very expensive. It has been said, time and again, that breaches of the road traffic code come to light only when a serious accident occurs.  It would be far better to cure the cause of accidents rather than wait to cure the result of such accidents.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to living conditions in barracks.  Equally important are housing conditions for married members in the different towns in which they serve.  These men are birds of passage; they flit from station to station, and from town to town.  One cannot expect them to provide houses for themselves under these conditions.  Despite what has been done in relation to housing, there is still a shortage of housing in most towns.  Such a shortage often makes it difficult to transfer a married man to a particular district even though his transfer to that district might mean greater efficiency generally.</P>

Where a countryside has become completely depopulated, <Col N="91" /> naturally a case cannot be made for keeping a station open but, by and large, the policy of closing down stations is not a wise one.  It is very useful to have men on the spot because they are much more likely to get useful information about criminals and crime than are people coming in from a number of miles away in a squad car. Those are the principal points I wish to raise.  On the whole I welcome the measure.</P>

      <P>I come from a rural area.  I listened with interest to the glowing account of night life in Dublin as depicted for us this evening by Senator Miss Davidson and Senator L'Estrange.  While things may not be as good as we would like them to be in the country, I am happy to say that they are nothing like as bad as the picture painted here this afternoon. Indeed, I am not prepared to accept the picture <i>in toto</i> because a few years ago a distinguished visitor to this country, the New York Commissioner of Police, paid tribute to the fact that he found here a minimum of juvenile delinquency.  &ldquo;A policeman's lot is not a happy one&rdquo; according to Gilbert and Sullivan in <i>The Pirates of Penzance.</i>  Sometimes something happens and there is no policeman on the scene.  People stand around, wringing their hands, and saying: &ldquo;They are never where they are wanted&rdquo;.  On the other hand, when they do appear to enforce the law, they are accused of being over-officious and looking for promotion.  A policeman's job in this country is certainly not a happy one.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the closing down of stations.  That is a policy with which <Col N="92" /> I do not agree because the presence of even one policeman can be very effective from the point of view of morale.  The introduction of patrol cars does not provide a satisfactory answer to the closing down of stations. In the case of hit-and-run accidents, the police were able heretofore to telephone from station to station, thereby keeping a check on cars. Civilians were able to telephone to stations giving information.  Listening to Radio Éireann, I am often amazed at the number of police messages broadcast seeking information about accidents.  Surely in a city like Dublin, where accidents seem to occur daily, people can be found without an appeal on the radio to them to communicate with the police.</P>
      <P>The point has been made by Senator Murphy and Senator Fitzpatrick that we are dealing now with a new generation of Gardaí and that they are not prepared to put up with the conditions of those who went before them.  With regard to the condition of the stations, in one station in my own area I have had a complaint about the heating.  I should be glad if the Minister, if it is in his power, would do something about improving the heating or drying facilities in that station.  It seems that the stations are carrying greater numbers of personnel than was originally intended.  I saw the fire grate in a station in Leitrim.  With great effort, I could warm my hands as it, but the Gardaí could not dry their clothing when they came in out of some of the weather we had in November.  A complaint has already been made to the Minister about the matter and I hope that something will soon be done, even as a temporary measure.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the detection of offences under the Road Traffic Act, I have always had a pet idea.  If the stations had been kept open, it would have been very easy to patrol our main roads on a 24-hour basis, and Gardaí from one station could meet Gardaí from another.  Their actual presence on the road would have a slowing down effect on some of those people who have hurled other people into eternity without giving them time to say a prayer.  I do not think the patrol car has been the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="93" /> I am not casting any reflection on the Minister, Department, or the Garda, when I say that we must ask ourselves questions about bringing to a successful conclusion the investigation of those crimes which have not yet been solved.  Some years ago, there was only one unsolved crime in the country, and it was a hardy annual and was always mentioned as the one outstanding crime.  Something seems to be wrong and the public must accept some responsibility.  We would be better off if, instead of appointing lecturers to schools, we got the people to realise their responsibilities in bringing up their families to be good citizens and to respect their rights as citizens. If there were respect for public property, I venture to say the work of the Garda would be easier.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, I should like to refer to a matter which arose in a discussion this morning, outside the House, of course, with regard to the alignment of the city and the country boundaries. We have the ordinary Garda within the city boundary and the Dublin Metropolitan section of the Garda also within the city boundary.  I should like to ask the Minister if that can be rectified quickly because it requires rectification.  A big built-up area within the city or the city boundary area does not come under the control of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda at present.  The possibility is that <i>vice versa</i> some portion of the rural areas will be controlled and patrolled by the Dublin Metropolitan Garda.  I am satisfied from discussions that there is not a rural alignment with the boundary of the built-up city area, including Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock.</P>

      <P>The question of promotion within the ranks of the Garda Síochána has been completely exaggerated here today.  Educated young men are now joining the ranks and I am quite certain that many of them would not do so, if they had not a chance to better themselves.  I feel that the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on the recent announcement that new houses are to be provided for the Garda throughout the country.  In my area where it is proposed to build, quite considerable satisfaction exists within the ranks of the Garda.</P>
      <P>However, I should like the Minister to undertake a tour of the Garda barracks in the rural areas.  There are many, particularly in the border areas, which are in need of considerable improvement.  The day room of a Garda barracks, with a wooden floor and hard chairs, should not be the only place a young Garda has to relax in, in his time off.  If the Garda barracks had a more homely atmosphere, things would be better and there would be more satisfaction in the ranks.</P>
      <P>Mention was made here today of co-operation with the Garda in the detection of crime.  I believe that it is time to abolish the jury system in rural Ireland.  I feel that on many occasions it hinders the work of the Garda.  In Donegal, it is well known that a jury will never convict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank the House for the manner in which they have received the Bill, and for the helpful and constructive <Col N="95" /> suggestions, all of them, I suppose, relevant to some degree, which have been made.  If I might deal <i>seriatim</i> with the main points which have been made in the discussion, in the first place, Senator Hayes and other Senators, including Senator Quinlan, mentioned the fact that I was leaving myself a margin of seven inspectors only in the statutory limit laid down in the Bill.  I agree that at first sight that might seem to be a small margin but the Seanad will realise that there is a fairly important principle involved &mdash;indeed Senator Hayes mentioned it &mdash;the principle of Parliamentary control of the level of the police force.</P>
      <P>We are not a police State and we never intend to be one and, therefore, it is good that the Executive should have to come to the Oireachtas on any occasion when they want to increase the establishment of the Garda Síochána and get parliamentary permission to do so.  Therefore, it would be wrong to seek too high a number in regard to any particular rank of the Force.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators asked if this investigation which was carried out was confined to Dublin city and of course the answer immediately is that it was not.  The force as a whole was examined by the management consultants who were brought in and the result of their examination was mainly to the effect that no reorganisation of the type contemplated for Dublin was necessary for the rest of the country. Therefore, broadly speaking, we can take it that over the rest of the country there will not be any need for an expansion in the number of inspectors and therefore the margin of seven which we are allowing ourselves in the Bill will be adequate for any slight increase which may become necessary in the country, or any reorganisation which population shifts in Dublin city may render necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Seanad that the whole police force was examined by the management consultants and that we are quite satisfied that the margin of seven inspectors is ample.  In that regard, I want to point out that crime is almost exclusively a Dublin problem. <Col N="96" /> There is no doubt that outside Dublin city crime is very substantially and very satisfactorily on the decrease at the moment and could not be regarded as anything like a real problem. Recently, I had occasion to visit one of our rural divisions and before visiting it, I inquired what the detection rate was for that division.  To my astonishment, I was informed that the detection rate for the division as a whole was 95 per cent.  You can gather from that, as a typical rural division, the position with regard to crime in the country.  It is essentially a Dublin problem and that is why these measures which we are now contemplating, this reorganisation, are devoted exclusively to Dublin city.  That is not to say, of course, that other parts of the country and major urban areas do not receive attention from Garda headquarters. They do.</P>
    <P>The fruits of the labour of the crime prevention officer whom I mentioned in my opening remarks will be available to the force as a whole and his work in that way will be available throughout the country.  The main benefit which will flow from his labours will be in Dublin city and the type of job he will do will be, as his title indicates, the prevention of crime. As you know, the efforts of the Garda, for 90 per cent. of their time, are devoted to detection work, the detection of crimes committed and the bringing of offenders to book.  But there is this separate aspect of their work, namely, an endeavour to see that as far as possible the actual commission of crime is prevented.  It is in that field that the crime prevention officer will labour and his main function will be to work out ways and means whereby the public can assist and aid in the prevention of crime. For instance, he will advise householders and owners of business premises and factories, and other premises of that nature, about what steps they should take to try to obviate the commission of crime.  He will also, as I said in my opening remarks, lecture the force as such on what steps it should take to try to prevent crimes being committed, but, in the main, his work will be devoted to that other type of activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> Senator Quinlan, Senator L'Estrange and other Senators mentioned the question of juveniles, &ldquo;teddy-boys&rdquo; and so on.  That picture is not as encouraging as it might be and juvenile delinquency is a problem which is very much with us and is one of the less satisfactory aspects of this whole matter in the administration of justice and the prevention of crime. Again, the Garda can contribute to this situation mainly in the field of detection.  A high detection rate by the Garda of crimes committed by juveniles is the best single contribution they can make to dealing with this problem.  I know the House will readily agree with me when I say, as I have publicly pointed out on other occasions, the main effort must come from parents, education authorities, religious leaders and voluntary bodies associated in that field, and it is to them that we must look for the main effort in trying for the best results.  In so far as the Garda can help, they will certainly do so.</P>
    <P>It is a problem to which my Department has given a great deal of thought down through the years and has constantly under observation.  Indeed, it is a problem with which every country in Western Europe is concerned at the present time.  It is one of those impracticable, insoluble problems at which you can only keep nibbling away.  It is not as much a problem with us as it is with practically every other country in Western Europe, but I would reiterate that the main effort with regard to it must come from parents, religious instruction and from education authorities.  I was very heartened recently when I visited the Civics Institute on the occasion of their annual general meeting to find that this voluntary body has the matter in mind and are devoting a great deal of care and attention to it.  I am quite certain that in any effort which we make to deal with the problem from time to time, we will have a very great deal of co-operation and assistance from organisations and institutions of that sort.</P>
    <P>I should like to correct a misconception on the part of a number of Senators.  At present crime is not on the increase in the country.  Crime is <Col N="98" /> largely a Dublin problem.  Taking Dublin and the country as a whole, crime is on the decrease at the moment.  It is a peculiar thing that crime seems to come in waves over the years.  We have the number of crimes being committed increasing over a period and then decreasing and then increasing again.  At present, I am glad to be able to tell the House, the curve is on the downward turn.  It is not terribly significant but it is at least a downward turn.</P>
    <P>Some Senators spoke about the fact that on occasion Gardaí have not been able to procure the ready assistance of the general public.  There have been instances of that sort and I know every Senator will agree with me in regretting that such instances have taken place. We could get a wrong impression from newspaper reports of this sort of thing because while there have been instances in which the public glaringly has failed to come to the assistance of the Garda, on the other hand, there have been countless occasions when citizens, conscious of their duty, have come forward, indeed at some risk on occasion, to help the Garda in the execution of their duty.  I should like to take this opportunity of commending the members of the public who have done so and I should also tell the House that the number of instances over the whole country in which people have come to the aid of the Garda far outweighs and outnumbers the few isolated instances which have received so much publicity.</P>
    <P>Senators Miss Davidson and L'Estrange were concerned with the incidence of attacks on women, mainly in Dublin city.  I agree we have a problem in this regard but again I should not like the House or the general public to exaggerate the extent of the problem.  The fact that newspapers tend to seize on instances of this sort and give them a certain amount of prominence, because I suppose they are sensational, might tend to obscure the picture as a whole.  It is a problem and we are giving attention to it.  Perhaps to some extent it is on the increase, but it is far from being anything like a really serious menace.  We are very aware it <Col N="99" /> is a problem and are doing all we can to deal with it.  Over the last couple of years we have drafted into Dublin city more than 200 extra Gardaí, mainly to do patrol work in these suburban areas in which this type of attack is likely to occur.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Miss Davidson that the patrol car can be very useful in this regard.  We are all the time increasing the mobility of the force. This year again we hope to increase not alone the number of squad cars but we also have plans to increase the mobility of the force in other ways by means of motor cycles, scooters and so on.  I do not want to take from the extent of the problem but I do want to get rid of any notion that there is a particularly serious menace, that people should be afraid to go out at night or anything like that.  These attacks do take place in isolated instances but they are not anything like as widespread as the treatment they get in the newspapers from time to time might lead one to believe.</P>
    <P>There are two factors in this situation which it might be no harm to mention.  In the first place, the Garda are to some extent hampered in their attempts to deal with it by the reluctance of people concerned to give information about this type of incident. Why people would be embarrassed by doing so is readily understandable. On the other hand, some of these stories of attacks are pure fabrications.  I was myself in the annoying position recently of reading in the paper of an allegedly sensational attack which had taken place on a women which I knew to be a complete fabrication, but I was prevented by the circumstances of the case from making any statement to that effect.  But that sort of incident does happen and in considering this problem we must bear in mind it has those undertones and sidelights.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange referred to something the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil mentioned&mdash;indeed I was struck to some extent by the similarity of the phraseology in both Houses.  I was able to give the Leader of the Opposition an assurance.  I think he accepted it and I think recent events <Col N="100" /> have confirmed my statement.  I was able to give him the assurance he sought and that Senator L'Estrange sought&mdash;that any Garda who does his duty need not feel he will suffer in any way because of the influence or importance of the person concerned.  I would hope that the House would accept that assurance, because I would not like it to go out from this House that it was otherwise.  I am quite sure the Leader of the Opposition did accept it, and I hope Senator L'Estrange and other Senators will accept it also.</P>
    <P>Senators Miss Davidson, Brosnahan and L'Estrange mentioned the question of promotion.  This is a question we discussed at some length on this Bill in Dáil Éireann.  It is a problem which will naturally loom very large in any service like the Garda, where you have a considerable number of members who will never be promoted. The very nature of the service is such that they can never be promoted.  In that situation there will be disappointment. But, as I said in the Dáil, I think the main objective must be to try to see to it that that natural disappointment does not degenerate into frustration and despair, such as some of the Senators spoke about.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear to Senators that we have had no resignations as a result of annoyance, frustration or disappointment over promotions, certainly not in my time and not to any extent in recent years. The Garda Síochána, no matter what they may say, no matter what grouses they may have, like to be members of the Garda Síochána.  One of the things I have noticed about members of the force is that they tend to stay in it and indeed lots of them tend to stay in it as long as they possibly can.  I do not deny there are grumblings and murmurings about promotions and the promotional system.  As I indicated in the Dáil, I intend to talk with the Commissioner about it and to make sure that the system is not alone fair but that it should be seen to be fair by all concerned.</P>
    <P>Here I want to explain to the House there is one particular feature about the Garda as a force&mdash;that we do not <Col N="101" /> have a cadet system with regard to officers.  Any Garda who joins the force can go right to the top and can look forward to being an officer, a superintendent, chief superintendent or assistant commissioner.  This is essentially a matter for the Garda authorities, but when considering promoting people we must have regard to their suitability for higher rank.  The position is that as far as possible, other things being equal&mdash; a phrase to which Senator Murphy takes exception&mdash;preference will be given to seniority.  But since members of the force can go straight into higher rank, one must always have regard to suitability for higher rank.  That suitability is not determined, as Senator Miss Davidson seemed to think, by written examination.</P>
    <P>The written examination done by members of the force at different levels is merely a qualifying examination. Promotion subsequently is for those who have qualified in that written examination on the basis of selection by superior officers and interview. Their whole records are taken into account.  Their experience and everything else are taken into account and they are placed in order of merit accordingly.  It is not just a simple case of the younger members of the Garda being able to do better at examinations than the older members and therefore get ahead of them on the promotion ladder.  The written examination, at which, maybe, a younger member would have a better chance, is merely a qualifying examination and thereafter all other factors are taken into account in placing people in order of merit.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Ó Siochfhradha poinnte chugam mar gheall ar na Gárdaí.  Cheapaim go dtuigeann na Gárdaí go bhfuilimid brodúil asta agus go bhfuilimid taobh thiar díobh ins an obair tábhachtach atá idir lámhaibh aca.  If I might give an illustration of this, very recently the Government agreed to expend the necessary moneys to erect a very fine memorial in the Depot to members of the Garda who gave their lives in the execution of their duties.  I hope that that decision by the Government will give very clear-cut evidence to members <Col N="102" /> of the force that the Government and the people appreciate in a very special way the service the Garda as a whole have rendered and in particular the service of those Gardaí who gave their lives in the execution of their duties.</P>
    <P>I also hope it will serve as an inspiration to the younger members of the force in the years that lie ahead to keep intact these great traditions of service, loyalty and devotion to duty which have been so firmly established. I fully endorse what Senator Ó Siochfhradha said when he pointed out that the keeping of law and order is essentially a matter for the people and that in this respect the Garda are only our instruments and our servants and only do what we all should be doing to a greater or lesser degree&mdash; preserving the public peace and law and order.  This is a matter for all of us and the Garda are entitled to our fullest co-operation.</P>
    <P>I appeal in this House, and shall continue to do so elsewhere, for the fullest possible support for the Garda in their work.  I am sorry if I felt constrained to interrupt Senator Fitzpatrick on the question of Garda accommodation.  A number of other Senators mentioned the same subject. I just want to point out that the Government, the Department of Justice, and the Garda headquarters are all very much alive to this problem.  We realise that proper accommodation more than anything else is the thing that will contribute to an efficient and effective police force.  That accommodation is, of course, not alone the accommodation in the Garda Stations but the private accommodation in which members of the force have to live.</P>
    <P>What have we done about it?  We have done, I think, a great deal and have given very clear evidence of our consciousness of the problem and of our desire to do something about it. The Government have made provision for the erection over the next five years of no fewer than 1,000 private houses for occupation by members of the force in all parts of the country. Now we have allocated a sum of £200,000 per annum for the improvement <Col N="103" /> of Garda stations throughout the country.  We have embarked upon a programme of replacement of stations and between those two programmes there will be expended approximately a total of £3 million during the next five or six years.</P>
    <P>We have made special administrative arrangements to expedite these programmes.  We have set up a special architectural section in the Board of Works and we have specially strengthened in the Department of Justice the section which deals with Garda buildings.  Not alone have we made available the money to go ahead with this programme but we have endeavoured, in so far as we could, to see that the administrative arrangements are there to put the programme into effect.  I hope that in the next few years we shall see a very satisfactory improvement in Garda accommodation in both aspects&mdash;the provision of better accommodation in Garda stations and of new houses for occupation by members of the force.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Murphy that there is a problem in regard to the age structure of the Garda Síochána. By and large, the Garda were all recruited at the same time and they tend to leave the force very much at the same time.  We are conscious of that problem.  It does mean, of course, that there are wonderful opportunities for young members at the present time but, from the long term viewpoint, it is a bad thing for the force as a whole.  We are keeping it in mind and are endeavouring to get an evening-out between the different age groups.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned the closing of rural stations.  I want to assure the House that before a rural station is closed we carry out the most careful examination and I think no rural station is closed unless we are satisfied, first of all, that the work of the station can be effectively and efficiently carried out by a neighbouring station and, secondly, in almost all cases we get figures which show that there has been no indictable crime in the area during the previous five, six, seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> In that respect I should point out the structure of these rural stations was determined when the police force here was not just a police force but, at the same time, an occupation force. Recently when I went to open a new station in Roscommon I was struck very sharply by this fact.  The old Bridewell in Roscommon town was capable of holding approximately 100 prisoners.  The new Garda station there has cells for only two prisoners. I think that will give the House an illustration of the changed times in rural Ireland generally from the point of view of crime and the House will accordingly realise that, in thinking of this problem of the closing of rural stations, the picture now is completely different from the days when these stations were built.  No rural station is closed unless we are absolutely satisfied there is no need for it and that, in fact, it would be a waste of public money to keep it in existence.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the question of road traffic and road traffic offences.  Of course, in that respect, the main work must be the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and indeed of the local authorities throughout the country, who combine in that matter.  The function of the Garda is, to a large extent, restricted to putting into operation and giving effect to traffic regulations and legislation laid down by the Department of Local Government.  I feel sure we can expect a very considerable improvement in that because of the passing of the new Road Traffic Act last year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I mention the question Senator Ó Donnabháin asked as to whether the boundary of the Dublin Metropolitan Division coincides with the municipal boundaries.  It does not, but I do not think it matters because the substantial difference between the old D.M.P. and the police force throughout the rest of the country disappeared in 1945 and now we have a national police force which is the same in Dublin as in any other part of the country.  The arrangement of the divisions and the placing of members of the Garda in Dublin and <Col N="105" /> around it are determined on the principle of police requirements which are changed from time to time, not in accordance with municipal boundaries but in accordance with what good police work would seem to indicate as being necessary and desirable.  There is therefore no reason why the Dublin Metropolitan Division should correspond with the municipal boundaries. I hope I have dealt with most of the points raised by Senators.  I shall conclude by thanking the House for the constructive and helpful manner it has received the Bill.</P>

      <P>The matter which I have the Chair's permission to raise is that of electrical interference with radio transmission.  My aim in raising this matter is definitely not to suggest any censure or criticism of the Minister and his Department.  At the moment he and his Department are basking, I think, in well deserved credit for their policy in connection with Irish television.  I do not want to cast any shadow on that lustre.  On the contrary, my aim tonight is to offer the Minister an opportunity of stating here and now what his intentions are and of gaining further confidence and esteem from the public.  I <Col N="106" /> do think that a statement from him now on this question of radio interference would be very welcome throughout the country.  I think it is especially appropriate that it should be made in this House because the Broadcasting Authority Bill of 1959 was first introduced in this House.  It is a Seanad Bill and so I think it is only fitting that we should have the benefit of the Minister's statement this evening.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister has already received a report from the committee of experts which he has set up, a committee of scientists and manufacturers and dealers and others. I know it is an interim report but I do think it would be well for him to make an interim statement here and now on this interim report, and I hope there is a possibility that here and now, or at least within the next few weeks, he can take some steps to ameliorate the present regrettable situation.</P>
      <P>At present in fact there is a state of anarchy in the Greek sense of the words, as far as interference is concerned. The Leas-Chathaoirleach, whose scholarship in Greek, Latin and in Irish has already been referred to in the House, will appreciate, and others I am sure too, this meaning of <i>anarchia</i>, an absence of legal control. There is anarchy in this sense now, and it is regrettable.</P>
      <P>Since 1st January, something like 100,000 of our citizens are liable to pay £4 for the privilege of watching the excellent Irish television service, so it becomes more urgent that they should be given proper reception.  At the moment many of our citizens are not receiving either the Irish programmes or the foreign programmes even reasonably well.  May I confess that I am not an owner of a television set at the moment and that I do not often look in but I have my responsibility to my constituents and to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that there are four kinds of interference with television at the moment in this country. I shall use popular terms to describe them.  The first is the snowstorm in which a quite unperturbed speaker continues to make his imperturbable <Col N="107" /> utterances apparently in a blizzard falling steadily from the ceiling.  I understand that is the result of a weak signal and will not be experienced as far as Irish television is concerned where, if anything, the signal is too strong rather than too weak.  Therefore, we can leave out consideration of the snowstorm.</P>
    <P>The second type is what may be called the herringbone kind of interference. This has the effect of putting fishbones moving across the screen. Again, I understand this is not likely to occur on Irish television.  It is the result of interference from other stations which are nearly as strong as the station one is tuned in to.  We can for the moment disregard the snowstorm indoors and out of doors and concentrate on the other two forms of interference.  One consists of zig-zag lines across the screen which I understand are the result of interference by smaller electrical machines and possibly by passing motor cars.  Here something can be done and should be done because you will get these zig-zag lines even on our strong Irish television.</P>
    <P>The fourth kind of interference is the worst of all.  This consists of broad bands which cut out part of the screen entirely.  This is the really diabolical form of interference which ruins the programmes and I regret to say, ironically enough, a great deal of it comes from hospitals.  It is not their fault.  It is the result of using diathermy apparatus.  It is also caused by certain machines which are used in the operating theatre.  These diathermy contraptions, if I may use the word, are also apparently used by industrial plants.  Therefore if people are in the neighbourhood of hospitals using diathermy apparatus or these industrial plants, their television programmes may be ruined while those contraptions are working.  These last two kinds are the serious ones: the board bands and the zig-zag lines.  Here the Minister can do something and should do something as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are in a state of anarchy and also in a state of uncertainty. The traders, the viewers and <Col N="108" /> the general public do not know just what is going to be done.  The main two questions in the public mind are, I think, these: first of all, will the responsibility for fitting suppressors be laid on the suppliers or on the buyers; and, secondly, will suppressors be made compulsory for already existing sources of interference?  It will be simple enough to make a regulation, a Ministerial order, saying that all future sources of interference will be controlled, but what about the many sources that are already around us?</P>
    <P>I know, and the Minister knows much better, that this is a most complicated problem.  There are scientific difficulties; there are financial difficulties. Even questions of interference in another sense, interference with personal rights and liberties, are involved. Some of us are naturally apprehensive of Orders which will enable officials to search houses, and so on, being made by the Government.  We need hardly fear it, but we cherish our personal rights.  Here I personally stand for, and I imagine the House would stand for, the principle that interference is justified to prevent interference, and that a moderate degree of control of personal liberties in the interests of the greater number is desirable.</P>
    <P>I look forward greatly to what the Minister has to say.  I understand that he has power already under the Broadcasting Authority Act to do a good deal.  Will there be need for further legislation?  Whichever is the case, I urge on him that there is need for prompt and decisive action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Stanford for raising this question. It gives me an opportunity to make a statement on this very important matter of interference with reception.  I notice that Senator Stanford addressed himself mainly to the question of interference with television reception.  However, as interference is not confined to television, I propose in my statement to deal with both radio and television.  I assume that Senator Stanford expected to get some information on this subject.  I realised in advance, that that is really <Col N="109" /> what the Senator wanted and that he wished to have the information available to the Seanad and to the public. Therefore, I think it best that I should read the prepared statement setting out the position in so far as it is possible for me to set it out at present.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to deal effectively with the problem of interference with radio and television programmes by simply legislating by Act or Order that all electrical equipment must be fitted with suppressors to prevent electrical interference.  Such a requirement would be too vague to be effective. Moreover, the fitting of suppressors is not practicable or effective in regard to certain kinds of interference. The problem is not one of preventing interference altogether&mdash;this is virtually impracticable&mdash;but one of reducing undue interference to a level which will not trouble the listener or viewer.  This involves specifying requirements for different kinds of electrical apparatus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While much can be done to reduce electrical interference substantially there are practical limits to what can be done.  For one thing, reduction of interference to a level permitting enjoyable reception constantly can be expected only for the home sound and television services.  There will, in fact, be considerable difficulties even in achieving this.  It will not be possible to eliminate all interference with reception of programmes from outside our territory and particularly from distant stations because, in general, their signal strength here is too far below what is necessary for good reception.  Moreover, even if interference from all other sources could be eliminated, inter-station interference, that is between stations on the same or adjoining wavelengths, would persist. This is so because in crowded wavebands, wavelengths can be shared by two or more stations only on the basis that the programmes from each station are free from undue interference within a certain limited area only.  International arrangements for sharing wavelengths aim at nothing more than this.  It is of little use therefore for a listener to complain that some outside programmes in which he is particularly interested are being constantly <Col N="110" /> interfered with by another outside station.  However, if he is still using an old set&mdash;say, one some 15, 20 or more years old&mdash;he would be well advised to give a modern efficient receiver a trial.  The improvement in reception and selectivity can in many cases be surprising.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that an efficient aerial system will of itself minimise interference and it goes without saying that the electric equipment used within the household should be in proper working order.  These are the first things that viewers and listeners should satisfy themselves about.  It will be found, now that television programmes have commenced here, that the signals in the Dublin area will be strong enough to be received with a simple aerial but interference-free reception should not be expected except with a satisfactory aerial system.</P>
    <P>The legislative powers necessary to deal with interference are contained in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960 (Part II of the Third Schedule).  This amended and extended the inadequate powers to deal with interference which were in Section 12 of the Wireless Telegraph Act, 1926.  The extended powers authorised the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make regulations, if he saw fit, prescribing the requirements to be complied with in the case of electrical equipment likely to cause interference with wireless telegraphy.  In order to advise me in this matter, I set up an Advisory Committee of experts.  The Committee held its first meeting on 12th June, 1961, and has just furnished its first report and recommendations.  The Committee considers that regulations should first be made to cover small electric motors (motors of less than 1 h.p.) which are used to a considerable extent in industrial and in domestic appliances; they are one of the most numerous and most widespread causes of interference.  The regulations will apply to sellers, hirers and users of the equipment.  The draft regulations are being prepared and the Statute requires that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> (a)  he shall cause a draft of the proposed regulations to be prepared and shall cause the draft to be published and placed on sale by the Stationery Office,</P>
    <P>(b)  he shall give notice to the public, in such manner as he considers suitable, of his intention to make the regulations,</P>
    <P>(c)  the notice shall contain an intimation that copies of the draft of the regulations are available for purchase and that, during a specified period of not less than two months, representations suggesting variations of the draft may be made to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(Sect. 12 (A) (4) Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926).</P>
    <P>Within the next few weeks it is hoped to have the draft regulations on sale and two months must then elapse before the regulations may be brought into force.</P>
    <P>An appeal was made earlier this year to manufacturers, assemblers and importers of the kinds of electrical goods which are known to cause undue interference to take all practicable measures to prevent such interference before the goods reach the public.  The response was heartening. It would seem, however, that electrical goods in an unsuppressed state are being imported and offered for sale and in the absence of regulations little can be done to stop this.  Persons who intend to purchase electrical goods should therefore satisfy themselves in advance that they will not cause interference with radio or television programmes.</P>
    <P>All powers appropriate for the investigation and detection of interference with radio and television were conferred on Radio Éireann under the Broadcasting Authority (Control of Interference) Order, 1960.  Progress in the matter of enforcing these powers will be slow until the regulations settings out the requirements to be complied with come into force.  The staff in Radio Éireann dealing with complaints of interference has recently been strengthened somewhat.</P>
    <P>Hitherto Radio Éireann did not investigate <Col N="112" /> complaints of interference with television reception in any systematic way, but now that we have our own television service the staff has been strengthened to deal with television as well as radio interference.</P>
    <P>During 1960, complaints of interference investigated by Radio Éireann were traced to 1,225 sources.  I do not think it necessary to give a complete analysis of these sources.  It is interesting to note however that ESB networks and poles, fluorescent lights and drills, grinders and sanders accounted for almost 60 per cent of the causes of interference which were traced, and that another 25 per cent. was due to items of household equipment, television receivers and inefficient or defective radio sets, aerials or earhs or domestic wiring faults.  The remaining sources of interference included flashing and neon signs, factory and garage equipment, motors and generators, accounting machines, hairdressing equipment, hospital equipment, etc.</P>
    <P>From the list I have given, which of course is not by any means exhaustive, it will be clear that a very wide and varied technical field has yet to be covered.  The first step will be the Regulations to cover small electric motors but it will be some considerable time before Orders or regulations can be made setting limits to the suppression of other categories of electrical appliances.  Until such time as these sources of interference are covered by Regulations it will be necessary to depend to an increasing extent on the co-operation of all those through whose hands these goods flow, be they manufacturers, suppliers, importers or users.  The Radio Éireann experience is that the initial response is often very lukewarm but constant pressure produces results in quite a large percentage of cases.  Sometimes, however, an absolute refusal to co-operate is experienced.</P>
    <P>It is hoped, in the long run, that a mixture of exhortation and compulsion will result in making both listening and viewing more tolerable than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need add anything to that statement or deal with any of the specific instances Senator <Col N="113" /> Stanford has raised.  I shall have his statement examined.  The points he raised in connection with any specific matter of interference will be brought to the attention of the Department and can be examined by the people whose business it is to have these matters <Col N="114" /> examined.  Whatever action, if any, that will be decided upon will certainly be taken by me.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.25 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
