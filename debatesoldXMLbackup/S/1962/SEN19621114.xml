    <Title>Official Secrets Bill, 1962&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide comprehensively for safeguarding official information, that is, of course, in so far as it is possible to do so by the provision of adequate penalties for unauthorised disclosure.  The Bill will replace the Official Secrets Acts, 1911 and 1920, which, although adapted by an Adaptation Order made in 1928, are largely inappropriate in our present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deficiencies in the Acts were recognised during the emergency, when the necessary provisions were made by way of emergency powers orders. Since then, by the Defence Act, 1954, certain other provisions of the Acts have been replaced, such as those relating to trespassing on or photographing military installations. Obviously a major overhaul and re-enactment in modern form of the remaining provisions is long overdue. The present Bill is put forward therefore as containing the provisions which are necessary and appropriate for safeguarding, <Col N="1366" /> on the one hand, the ordinary type of confidential information which circulates among Government Departments and Government commissions and, on the other hand, information whose disclosure would be serious enough to be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the first class of information, that is, ordinary departmental information and confidential information in the possession of State contractors, where normally the safety of the State would not be involved.  It also deals with certain offences relating to official dies, seals and stamps and the forgery of official documents.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which is also in Part II, deals with the retention of official documents and articles and empowers a Minister or authorised officer to give directions for the return or disposal of official documents in cases where the persons in whose possession they are have no longer any right to retain them.  Special provision is made for secret or confidential official documents retained by persons who formerly held office as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.  Subsection (3) of the section gives power to direct that these documents be returned but the power is limited to original documents and the power of giving directions may be exercised only by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Part III is concerned with the communication of information to the prejudice of the safety or preservation of the State.  The main provision is contained in Section 9, which makes it an offence to obtain, record, communicate, publish or possess certain information relating to security matters in any manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State. Senators will appreciate that it would be difficult in many cases to prove positively that a person accused of communicating information did so in this prejudicial manner.  For this reason the provisions of Section 10, which are complementary to Section 9, make it <i>prima facie</i> evidence that a person charged under Section 9 has done the act in respect of which he is charged in a manner prejudicial to <Col N="1367" /> the safety or preservation of the State if he has been in communication with or has attempted to communicate with a foreign agent or with a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that Section 10 does not create an offence of itself and it allows the person accused an opportunity of proving that the communication he has had or is presumed to have had with a foreign agent or a member of an unlawful organisation is quite innocent.  The prosecution will have to establish, first of all, that the act of communicating or obtaining or any other act mentioned in Section 9 was in fact done by the accused: Section 10 merely raises a presumption, in certain circumstances, that the accused, when he did the act, had a particular object in mind.</P>
    <P>Section 12, which was amended as a result of representations made in the Dáil, enables proceedings for an offence under Section 9, or for an offence under Part II committed in a manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, to be held <i>in camera.</i>  In its original form the section enabled the prosecution, on application, to have the entire proceedings&mdash;other than the verdict and sentence&mdash;heard <i>in camera.</i>  The provision as it is now stands in the Bill limits the power to have an <i>in camera</i> hearing in two respects.  First, it requires the prosecution to specify that the publication of any particular evidence to be given or any particular statement to be made would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State; and secondly the section now provides that only the part of the hearing which is concerned with that particular evidence or statement must be <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>I did not find it possible to accede to a further request that the court should have power to direct that a hearing should be held in public not-withstanding the prosecution's contention that particular evidence, if disclosed, would be prejudicial to the safety of the State.  I am firmly of opinion that the responsibility for deciding what evidence is or is not <Col N="1368" /> prejudicial to the safety of the State should be a matter for the Executive and not for the courts.  It is the Executive, and not the courts, who are responsible for the national safety and it would be undesirable that such matters should be the subject of a public hearing.  Moreover, the Executive very often have information which would make it clear that an innocent-looking document held an entirely different meaning for other persons.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains provisions about legal proceedings and other supplementary provisions.  Senators will see that Section 13 distinguishes between ordinary offences under Part II and offences under Section 9 or any offence under Part II committed in a manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State. In the ordinary Part II case, the accused person must be tried summarily and the maximum penalty on conviction is a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both fine and imprisonment.  In the second case, the accused is triable on indictment and the maximum penalty is a term of penal servitude not exceeding seven years.  This section emphasises the fundamental difference in character and in seriousness between the two types of offences.</P>
    <P>I think the maximum punishments provided for in each case fairly reflect the views of most people as to what should be the punishment for the most serious offence that might be committed under the two different provisions.  I was surprised to find it suggested that a civil servant, who disclosed confidential official information in breach of trust, should not be liable to any criminal sanction whatever and that the disciplinary penalty of dismissal would be adequate punishment for his action.  I cannot accept this at all.  It has long been the law that disclosure of ordinary confidential departmental information is a criminal offence, quite irrespective of whether the security of the State is involved in the disclosure.  Civil servants are entrusted with a great deal of information about people's private affairs and considerable damage could be caused by unauthorised disclosure. <Col N="1369" /> Leakage of official reports and other confidential information might result in considerable financial gain to some persons.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if citizens felt that the only sanction against disclosure of information entrusted by them in confidence to Government Departments or commissions was the penalty of dismissal, they would be likely to be reluctant to come forward and produce the information at all.  There is no proper analogy between information voluntarily entrusted to private firms and that entrusted to Government Departments, usually in response to a specific requirement and with the threat of penalty for failure to make a full disclosure.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that proceedings may not be taken for any offence under the Act without the prior consent of the Attorney General.  The only exception relates to Section 9 offences, that is, where the safety of the State is involved.  In these cases Section 14 allows arrest and remand in custody or on bail before the Attorney General's consent is obtained but it provides that no further proceedings shall be taken until that consent is given.</P>
    <P>Turning to Sections 15 to 17, Senators will observe that these provisions are concerned with offences under Section 9.  As might be expected in such circumstances, powers are given of arrest without warrant and for obtaining search warrants and information about suspected offences under Section 9, all of which partake of an emergency character.  It is always difficult in peace time conditions to regard with equanimity any provisions of this kind and, indeed, it is to be hoped that the necessity for operating them will not arise.  But it is unfortunately necessary to have these provisions available in case they are required and to take care that, in the event, they will prove to be adequate for bringing to justice any persons who may put the lives of our citizens in jeopardy.  I do not think that, from this point of view, the provisions of Sections 15, 16 and 17 are anything other than a reasonable balance between the legitimate rights <Col N="1370" /> of ordinary citizens and the vital necessity for taking prompt and effective action either in an emergency situation or in the circumstances obtaining before an emergency is formally declared.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to say a word about the provisions of subsection (3) of Section 2, which was the subject of detailed consideration, and indeed criticism, while the Bill was passing through the Dáil.  This subsection provides that a certificate given by a Minister under his seal that specified information is secret or confidential is to be conclusive evidence of that fact.  I can appreciate that there is a reluctance to concede the principle of obliging courts to accept certificates of particular facts to be conclusive evidence.  But I was satisfied, after a very full debate on all the various aspects of this provision, that it is a reasonable and practical one.  I want to emphasise that the certificate must be given by the Minister personally under seal and not departmentally by one of his authorised officers.  This is, in effect, a continuation of a tradition in accordance with which the courts have always accepted the word of a Minister of State that it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose particular information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal fully with that on the section.  That is a discipline which the courts have imposed voluntarily on themselves.  It is the Minister and the Minister alone who, as the person responsible for the administration of the particular Department or office, can say whether or not particular information circulating in his office is or is not secret or confidential.  Moreover, when this provision is taken in conjunction with the definition of official information, and the penal provisions of Sections 4 and 5, the overall change in the law is not in my opinion substantial so far as public servants are concerned.  At present they may be prosecuted for the disclosure of information and the <Col N="1371" /> prosecution does not have to prove that it is secret or confidential.  It is only necessary to show that they had the information by virtue of their office. The Bill makes it necessary for the information to be secret or confidential before any offence of disclosure can arise.</P>
      <P>From the practical point of view, the accused person will have open to him what I consider to be the real and substantial defences in proceedings of this sort, that is, establishing either that he did not disclose the information in question at all or that he did disclose it but was authorised to disclose it, or disclosed it in the course of his official duties or when it was his duty in the interest of the State to do so. Once a person is a public official at all, a person entrusted with confidential information, and he discloses it without being authorised, he is, to my mind, <i>prima facie</i> guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>May I conclude by saying that I hope that it will not be necessary to invoke the provisions of this Bill at all, either what I might call the non-emergency provisions in Part II or the clauses elsewhere in the Bill which would not normally arise except in emergency or pre-emergency conditions. Certainly our experience since the establishment of the State gives cause for hoping that the Bill, when enacted, will not have to be availed of frequently.  But it is necessary to have an Act such as this on the statute book, not only as a measure to deal effectively with future leakages of official information but also for the sake of the deterrent effect it will undoubtedly exercise.  If only for that reason alone I think it will be agreed that the Bill will be a worthwhile addition to the increasing number of our consolidation statutes.</P>
      <P>May I add that I shall welcome any suggestions which Senators may have for the improvement of the Bill and will give careful consideration to them. I trust the Seanad will agree to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this is a measure to deal comprehensively with the matter of official secrets. <Col N="1372" /> Before I heard the Minister's explanation it seemed to me that the word &ldquo;comprehensively&rdquo; was a very adequate and proper word in the circumstances.  The Minister dealt with the Bill in his Second Reading speech as if it were an ordinary thing, as if there were nothing peculiar about it, or nothing strange about it.  In fact, he said it is in our tradition.  I wonder. This is the first Irish Bill dealing with Official Secrets in the past 40 years, in the whole existence of the State.  Up to now, we have been working on a British Act of 1920 which amended an Act of 1911.</P>
      <P>There are two parts in this Bill, one dealing with the preservation of the safety of the State and the security of its citizens.  With regard to that matter, so far as we on these benches are concerned, and I think so far as everyone is concerned, we would be prepared to give the Minister very substantial powers, and to listen to any suggestion of this Minister or any other Minister in regard to the powers which he desired to have for the safety of the State.</P>
      <P>The Bill as we have it here seems to me, and to everyone I think, to go a great deal further.  We have been satisfied with the British Act for the past 40 years.  The British Act was passed in 1911 when Britain was only two years from a great war and yet it does not contain so far as my researches go anything at all corresponding to subsection (3) of Section 2.  We got along with the British Act in circumstances in which we had a civil war, and we had the greatest war in history, and apparently we were not too hampered by the absence of the powers which the Minister is now claiming for himself and his successors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see little change in the provisions dealing with civil servants.  We once had a situation in which the Minister's Party were working very hard to pervert and seduce civil servants and had a few successes which they rewarded with substantially high office at the cost of the State.  Presumably their long periods of office have cured them of those practices but they do not seem to have cured them of the idea of getting more and more power.  Although the Minister plays down <Col N="1373" /> Section 2, I should like to state what seems to me to be the meaning of it, as I read it.  First and foremost, the words &ldquo;official information&rdquo; are certainly very comprehensively defined. In line 19 of Section 2 it is stated that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;official information&rdquo; means any secret official code word or password, and any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information which is secret or confidential or is expressed to be either...</P>
    <P>When you come to find how the expression is given you go to subsection (3) which provides that:</P>
    <P>A certificate given by a Minister under his seal that any official code word or password or any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information specified or indicated in the certificate is secret or confidential shall be conclusive evidence of the fact so certified.</P>
    <P>In other words, anything the Minister certifies as secret or confidential is secret or confidential and the courts have no power to make any inquiries about it.  I take issue with the Minister on that.  I deny that he is right.  I assert that he is not right in saying that the courts have always accepted the Minister as the judge of what is secret and confidential and have imposed penalties upon persons in accordance with that certificate.  That, I think, is not so.  There is the question of privilege but that is a different question.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister, when he was speaking, under what circumstances the certificate could be given and if it can be given retrospectively.  Would the Minister answer that?  Is it possible to certify now in 1962 that a document of 1922 or 1932 is secret and confidential?  I wonder would the Minister tell us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he will deal with it later but it seems to me at any rate to give him power on which there is no limit.  I shall read it again:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> A certificate given by a Minister under his seal that any official code word or password or any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information specified or indicated in the certificate is secret or confidential shall be conclusive evidence of the fact so certified.</P>
    <P>This certificate under subsection (3) of Section 2 is completely without limit.  It has no limit, no proviso, no restraint, no time limit, and no court can inquire into it.  I wonder is that necessary?  Why is it necessary?  How is it that we have got on so far without any such provision?  The Minister provides later under another section that cases may be heard <i>in camera</i> and, indeed, he purports to compel the courts to hear them <i>in camera.</i>  If that is so, why should the Minister have any more power than that the certificate is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts certified?</P>
    <P>I do not understand at all why this power should be inserted and I do not know whether the Minister can give us any more information.  In his Second Reading speech he gave us certain details about the Bill but evaded telling us what precisely subsection (3) means.  Perhaps we will hear more about it, but it seems to me that the Minister is taking power which no Minister before him took and which British Ministers have not got.  After all they must have much bigger problems than we have.</P>
    <P>I must say that when you accept the definition of &ldquo;official information&rdquo; and give powers to the Minister to certify anything he pleases as secret and confidential, you are arriving at a situation in which unscrupulous Ministers&mdash;and we may have such people&mdash;would be able to impose their wills upon citizens in a most extraordinary manner.</P>
    <P>I also wonder how far the powers go that are taken in Section 6.  I happen to be a former Minister and there are a number of others.  Section 6 provides that in the case of officials who have not been Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries the Minister or the Secretary of a Department can compel them to return documents <Col N="1375" /> in their possession, but in regard to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries a special Order must be made by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 6 provides:</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may give directions as to the return or disposal of any original documents specified or indicated in such directions which constitute or contain official information and which are in the possession or under the control of any person who formerly held office as a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary and any such person shall comply with all such directions.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the meaning of &ldquo;original documents&rdquo;.  I have a number of documents that were circulated to me as a member of the Cabinet in 1922.  Of course, they must be copies because every member got the document.  If I got an original document is it possible to compel me to return a document which I received in the course of holding ministerial office long ago?  Is it possible to exercise that power, for example, for the purpose of preventing me or anybody like me from disclosing certain facts about certain controversial events, and does that apply not only to me but to other persons at later periods? I wonder how it is proposed to work this or what the words &ldquo;original document&rdquo; mean and whether a direction can be given in regard to documents over any period of time. How far back can the Taoiseach go? Is it 5, 10, 15 or 40 years?  There is nothing here to indicate that.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right in using the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo;.  It is an extremely comprehensive Bill.  There was power, it seems to me at any rate, to prevent the writing of history and the Minister knows, of course, young and all as he is, that history has been persistently perverted by newspapers under the control of his Party and by the use of the Government Information Bureau for the same purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know it. Is there additional power in this Bill to prevent the disclosure of documents which might be detrimental to that spurious and perverted case they have made?  Perhaps the Minister in his own particularly calm way will be able to give us some comprehensive statement when he comes to discuss these matters in committee.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into this matter in great detail now.  I conclude by saying that where the preservation of the State is concerned, I have no objection to the powers being taken by the Minister and it is possible to argue that the penalty imposed, a maximum of seven years, is too small a penalty but that is another question. We have no objection to that but with regard to the other matters contained in the Bill and to the extraordinary powers taken in subsection (3) of Section 2, I certainly intend to combat those and if possible to amend them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with Senator Hayes that this Bill is far too drastic for the purpose of dealing with matters which are in the national interest as distinct from matters which concern national security.  There is no need, I think, to define the difference there.  It is clear to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we would agree very largely with what the Minister said on vital matters of national defence, military secrets and that kind of thing.  That has been said very fully in the Dáil and I do not intend to repeat the arguments. But when it comes to matters like the divulging, possibly, of examination papers, or of what may be said on commissions or something of that kind, to tie those up with espionage and betrayal of one's country is far too drastic.  There is also the risk, as Senator Hayes said, that these very drastic powers could be used to conceal matters prejudicial to the Government in power.  There is the risk that if some information would do damage to the Government Party or to members of that Party these drastic powers could be turned on with their fullest <Col N="1377" /> force to prevent something being stated which it was definitely in the national interest to reveal.</P>
    <P>At Column 632, Volume 194 of the Dáil Debates of 27th March, 1962, Deputy Dillon expressed this matter better than I could.  I should like to repeat it:</P>
    <P>We all agree that there are certain confidential documents which no public servant ought to discuss and there are certain documents, such as examination papers, which are in the hands of a contractor and which must be kept secret, but it seems, other than that, to seek to provide in the same piece of legislation for offences of that character and offences of espionage and sending out information on the confidential affairs of the State to a foreign power is not the proper procedure.</P>
    <P>A fundamental fault in this Bill is combining these two aspects of breaches of confidence if they may be called that.  I am afraid the rigours that we perhaps would agree should be applied to betrayal of one's country's interests might also be applied under a different Government, under a more angry Government, under a more malevolent Government than the present one, to matters of that kind. I do think we need to go over this Bill very carefully in this House, and I hope the Minister will on further reflection accept amendments in committee that he was not prepared to accept in the Dáil.  I think he also ought to tell us at this stage whether, as Senator Hayes inquired, some of these enactments will be retrospective or not.  Is it the Minister's intention to tell us at this stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, we must vote on this stage fairly soon and it is no use to be told that if we pass the Second Stage we shall have enlightenment later.  I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two matters of detail in the Bill that perhaps I might mention but which will come up more specifically on the Committee Stage.  In <Col N="1378" /> relation to Section 9 (3), can a Minister authorise himself to betray his country?  It is worth considering.  I shall quote Section 9 (3):</P>
    <P>It shall be a good defence to a prosecution for a contravention of this section to prove that the communication was authorised in writing by the Minister or State authority or by the party contracting on behalf of the Minister or State authority.</P>
    <P>In other words if the Minister is going to betray his country&mdash;and that could happen&mdash;can he authorise himself to give away information which no one else would authorise him to do?  That brings us to a basic point in the Bill.  If the Minister is in some way to be the final authority in deciding what is confidential and what is not, if that Minister intends some betrayal who can deal with him?  He is above the courts in this.  There may be other ways of dealing with him but I should like the Minister to tell us how under the Bill such circumstances would be dealt with.  That brings me to the last general objection that I have.  Setting aside the wisdom, the experience and the impartiality of the courts, as to some extent is done in this Bill, is always dangerous to the national welfare.  I should like him to consider very carefully again whether some of the amendments that were suggested to him in the Dáil to preserve the final authority of the courts of the land should not be incorporated in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that in approaching this Bill we should bear in mind that it is a peace time and permanent piece of legislation.  At first sight we might be inclined to regard it as a measure which was being put on the Statute Book to deal with an emergency situation or a state of war or something like that.  It is nothing of the kind.  It is a normal piece of legislation being introduced here with an invitation that it be passed and that it become part of our statute law; and we should view it in that light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister told us, the Bill might be divided into two sections, one which deals with the disclosure of confidential <Col N="1379" /> information calculated to endanger or prejudice the safety of the State.  That section of the Bill deals with a very serious breach of the law and is one which, as Senator Hayes has said, this Party agrees with.  In fact, I think the penalties provided in this Bill for, say, the selling of confidential information about our defences to an enemy are inadequate.  For some reason or another, the Minister has reduced the maximum penalty for spying or selling information to the enemy from 14 years' penal servitude to seven years' penal servitude.</P>
    <P>The second section of the Bill deals with the disclosure of confidential information by civil servants or others who have acquired such information&mdash; confidential information of a kind which does not endanger the safety or the interests of the State.  Why that was included in this Bill, I do not know.  It confuses the issue and mixes up unlike with like, if I may say so.</P>
    <P>The first time I read the Bill I came to a full stop at subsection (3) of Section 2 and I said to myself: &ldquo;That is an extraordinary provision to put into this Bill&rdquo;.  The effect of that subsection is to enable the Minister to certify whether a particular piece of information is secret or confidential or not and once the Minister has issued a certificate that a certain piece of information is secret and confidential, that is the end of it and the person who is charged under the Bill cannot put up the defence in court that it is not secret and confidential.</P>
    <P>In my considered opinion, a person might have in his possession today a piece of information which he thought, and honestly thought, was harmless and was not either secret or confidential and tomorrow he might find himself charged with an offence under Section 9 and he might go into court to answer that charge, to be met with the certificate of the Minister certifying that the information was secret and confidential and depriving the court of the right to inquire into the matter.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious departure from normal procedure and I should like to say here that I see nothing in <Col N="1380" /> this subsection to prevent its being used retrospectively.  I have read the Dáil debates and I have seen there where practitioners of much longer experience than I hold the same view. I will read the subsection and I think, with all respect, it is relevant on the Second Stage because it goes to the root of the Bill; it is fundamental. The subsection says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A certificate given by a Minister under his seal that any official code word or password or any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information specified or indicated in the certificate is secret or confidential shall be conclusive evidence of the fact so certified.</P>
    <P>Mark this and mark it well.  That subsection does not create the offence. That provides the evidence for securing a conviction on the offence charged.  The other sections of the Bill create the offence.  That subsection provides the conclusive evidence beyond which an accused person cannot go and beyond which the court cannot inquire into.</P>
    <P>As I have said, people of great experience believe that it can be used retrospectively.  People with the same legal training as the judges who will be trying cases under the section believe that it can be used retrospectively. I know that the Minister has stated in the Dáil that in his opinion this section is not retrospective and is not intended to be retrospective.  I will ask the Minister to indicate to the House in his reply to this debate that, if he is not prepared to remove this objectionable subsection from the Bill, at least he is prepared to put the question of it being retrospective beyond doubt, once and for all.  If he and the Government insist on this very objectionable subsection standing, the question of its being retrospective can be put beyond doubt by the addition of half a dozen words to the subsection.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I was surprised when I read the subsection in the Bill because I regarded it as an extraordinary departure from the normal procedure in the court.  Then some time later I read the debates in the Dáil and I was even more surprised <Col N="1381" /> that the Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate in that House was surprised that any exception should be taken to this objectionable subsection on the grounds that he regarded it as normal.</P>
    <P>I shall take the liberty of quoting from the Minister's speech.  At volume 194, No. 5, column 690 of the Official Report for 28th March, 1962, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I must apologise to the House and to Deputy Dillon in particular for the fact that the explanatory memorandum did not refer specifically to subsection (3) of Section 2. One of the most endearing characteristics of this House is its unexpectedness.  There is no reason why this particular provision should excite a great deal of argument or comment.  It seemed to me in putting it into the Bill to be a perfectly normal piece of machinery which was necessary to facilitate the working of the Act.</P>
    <P>I do not say this in any offensive way but, if that represents the approach of the Minister and his Department to criminal legislation in his country, it discloses a very dangerous trend; it discloses a very dangerous mentality; it discloses a mind that is prepared to put exceedingly dangerous weapons into the hands of himself and his successors.</P>
    <P>This subsection takes away drastically from the right of the citizen to defend himself in open court.  It takes away drastically from the right of the courts to inquire into the case for the prosecution and the case for the defence.  Here a man is held to have proved against him one of the most serious ingredients of the crime with which he is charged.  He cannot offer evidence to prove he is innocent and the court cannot inquire into his innocence or otherwise.  I should like to appeal to the House to look upon this subsection very seriously, not alone because of its presence in this Bill but because of the trend in criminal legislation which it discloses.</P>
    <P>It is very unfortunate that Section 2, which deals with the disclosure of <Col N="1382" /> what I would call harmless information, is inserted in the Bill at all.  I cannot see why a civil servant should be liable to conviction and two years' imprisonment for disclosing some harmless piece of private or confidential information any more than an employee of a county council, a clerk employed by a solicitor or a receptionist employed by a doctor.  I cannot see the difference.  If the information does not prejudice or endanger the safety of the State, the person concerned could very well be dealt with under the ordinary rules and regulations applying to civil servants.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which reduces the term of penal servitude from 14 years to seven years for a serious disclosure of confidential information which would endanger the State is a retrograde step.  Sections 9 and 10 deal with the disclosure of information prejudicial to the State to foreign agents or members of an unlawful organisation.  It is unfortunate that members of an unlawful organisation have been dealt with in these sections, especially Section 10.  Section 10 says that if a person in possession of information mentioned in Section 9 does certain things, he shall be presumed to be guilty of an offence until he proves the contrary.  For example, it says that if an individual in possession of information mentioned in Section 9 goes to the address of a member of an illegal organisation, it shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence he is acting in a way prejudicial to the State.  The State need not prove he has disclosed the information to that person.  It has occurred to me that if a member of an unlawful organisation was the owner of a small hotel, or indeed a big hotel, and if a person in possession of the information mentioned in Section 9 went to that hotel on some other business, he might then have to go into the court and defend himself on a serious charge under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are several matters which I agree might be dealt with more appropriately on the Committee Stage. I think my objection to subsection (3) of Section 2 goes to the root of this Bill and if the Minister insists on retaining that section as it stands at <Col N="1383" /> present, the House should refuse to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I want to make on this Bill, both of which have been touched on already.  The first matter that struck me reading the Bill was the maximum penalty of seven years' penal servitude for spying.  It struck me that was a very small penalty.  I did not know until the debate this afternoon that the corresponding penalty in Britain was 14 years.  If the present Government lead us into some defence alliance with continental countries or with Britain, it seems to me it would be very much easier for people to engage in spying here with a lower penalty than across the water.  Spying, I believe from newspaper reports, is a very remunerative profession.  If we are now going to have a maximum penalty of seven years as against 14 in Britain, we possibly will provide some employment for such people here.  I am sure the Minister in his reply will explain to us why seven years is regarded as an adequate sentence for what could be a very, very serious offence.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to deal with concerns the poor civil servants.  It seems to me they can in the future find themselves in a very difficult situation.  I know in some Departments already if a civil servant expresses a viewpoint in a speech and is reported in any way in the newspapers, what he said is very carefully scanned in the Department and in many instances he is called before his boss to explain why he expressed any viewpoint at all. Now it seems his opinions might be formed on documents he had read in the course of his work, which is very natural, and he might be told he has disclosed official information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is dealt with in Section 2, which has been mentioned by nearly all the previous speakers.  In reading it, it struck me it would be a better section altogether if, in line 22, instead of saying &ldquo;which is secret or confidential or is expressed to be either,&rdquo; we said &ldquo;which is secret or confidential and is expressed to be either.&rdquo;  What I have in mind there is that, of necessity, some documents&mdash;a limited number&mdash;being <Col N="1384" /> dealt with by civil servants would be secret and confidential. What is to prevent their being marked as secret and confidential? If then they are so marked as &ldquo;secret and confidential&rdquo;, it would be an offence for a civil servant to disclose subsequently either any information he had got from these documents or the contents of the documents themselves.  I am not a lawyer and I cannot attempt to construe this, but it does seem to me as a layman that if this section goes through in its present form, a document need not now be marked.  It need not be marked &ldquo;secret&rdquo; or &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; but, nevertheless, disclosing information got from that document can be an offence.  If the Minister accepts my suggestion in regard to this that will meet my point. It will certainly do something to safeguard the position of civil servants who, in the course of their duties, do come across information.  If a document is clearly marked &ldquo;secret and confidential&rdquo; they will know then what they are dealing with and, if they subsequently disclose that information, they will know the consequences they will be facing.  Would the Minister in his reply kindly deal with that point because it will certainly affect my approach as to whether or not I should put down an amendment in line with the view I have expressed on this Section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this subsection, I should like the Minister to explain how he envisages the certificate being used.  It seems to me that, if I were accused under this section of the Bill and I arrived in court, and the Minister's certificate is there saying that the information I had disclosed, or had in my possession, was confidential, then as far as the court is concerned I have committed an offence. But how is the court to know what penalty to impose?  There is a stage, it seems to me, at which there must be disclosed in some way to the court the enormity of the offence I have committed and therein is, I think, the safety valve as it were for the citizen. That is how I envisage the subsection working.  The court itself would have to decide the enormity of the offence <Col N="1385" /> and the appropriate penalty.  I do not know if that is the Minister's view.  I should like a little further information on the point.</P>
      <P>With regard to Part III, I wonder should we not go further in Section 9 and say that, if a person discloses information communicated to this State by other States, not necessarily prejudicial to the safety of this State, but possibly prejudicial to the safety of other States, certain appropriate action will be taken?  I can envisage other States giving us information on defensive, or other matters, out of international courtesy.  That might be disclosed by a civil servant of this State. If we do not take on ourselves the punishment of such people, what other body can?  I should like to see something more in Section 9.  Each subsection finishes with a reference to this State.  I should like to see the position safeguarded in relation to any information given to this State by other States.</P>

      <P>There are just a few matters I want to put simply by way of question and not by way of argument. I should like to know what the actual or apparent necessity is for this Bill at this time.  Secondly, I should like to know what were the shortcomings or inadequacies that had to be dealt with by the emergency regulations to which the Minister referred in his opening speech.  Thirdly, I should like to know what, in reference to civil servants under this Bill or under regulations, is not adequately covered already and, if that is so, how they fail or are defective in relation to ordinary Civil Service regulations. What is the purpose, if any, in combining the Civil Service within the State, foreign agents&mdash;I take it both in times of war and in times of peace &mdash;and illegal organisations within the State at all times in one Bill of this kind?</P>
      <P>Lastly, I should like to know whether the Minister is prepared to state categorically that the certifying of a document by him as secret and confidential will date the secrecy and confidential nature of that document simply from the date of certification and that there will be nothing retrospective in relation to it?</P>

      <P>As most Senators have remarked, this is really a Committee Stage Bill and the arguments or discussion to be made on it can be made far more effectively on the Committee Stage.  A few specific questions have, however, been addressed to me and it would be more advantageous to reply to them now.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to deal with subsection (3) of Section 2 which has caused so much excitement and perturbation.  I disagree fundamentally with what Senator Fitzpatrick says.  He was at some pains to emphasise that this is a dangerous trend and that we are taking away drastically from the capacity of a person to defend himself.  We are not doing anything of the kind.  The simple unadorned truth is that we are not making any change of substance in the law.  There is no new trend.  This has been the law here and in Great Britain down through the centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is dealing with privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the British courts and our courts have always recognised and immediately accepted the statement of any Minister that a document is secret or confidential and that it would be against the public interest to disclose it, and the courts will not inquire behind that assurance of the Minister.  That has been the accepted legal principle governing these matters.  It is the law at the moment, without this Bill at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister but I suggest that what he is dealing with now is the position when a Minister is asked to produce a document as evidence. He can refuse to produce it on the ground that it is confidential.  The position is different in the case of a man being charged; whether or not a document is secret or confidential in the latter case is the very essence of the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the utmost respect for the Senator as a member of this House but I claim that in this matter I am as competently advised as he is.  I am told by my advisers and I accept&mdash;and I think it is <Col N="1387" /> beyond contradiction&mdash;that the courts, both in Britain and here, have Ministers without question.  They have never inquired behind the Minister's certificate.  They may from time to time have grumbled at the reluctance of Ministers to disclose information, but they never suggested that the privilege attaching to the State in this regard should be interfered with. Therefore, I deny emphatically that there is any new trend evident in the Bill which is not there already.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes adverted to this point and asked why was it necessary to do this now, and why it was not necessary before.  He asked why it was not in the 1911 Act or the 1920 Act. The simple reason is that it was not necessary in either of those Acts for the authorities to seek this power because it was not necessary under these Acts for them to prove that information was secret or confidential in order to constitute an offence.  It was a basic principle of the law in England that this situation prevailed and that the statement of the Minister was unhesitatingly accepted by the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with it more fully when we come to the section. I am asked specifically by Senators about this question of retrospection and I feel there may be some little confusion which I shall endeavour, if I may, to clear up.  Two different things are involved.  First of all there is certification under subsection (3) of Section 2 by the Minister as to the fact that a document is secret or confidential, and there is in the definition section, Section 2, a definition of &ldquo;official information&rdquo;.  This point was also adverted to by Senator Murphy.  The definition is that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;official information&rdquo; means any secret official code word or password, and any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information which is secret or confidential or is expressed to be either...</P>
      <P>I want to deal for a moment with that aspect.  It is quite clear that the expression of a document or a piece of information to be secret or confidential must be done at the time the person either has it in his possession or discloses it.  There can be no element of retrospection with regard to stamping or expressing the information to be secret or confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be two types of cases involved.  The first type would be that the document was stamped secret or confidential.  It is clear&mdash;and I assure the House that what is intended is&mdash;that the stamping or noting on the face of the document as being secret or confidential cannot be retrospective in any way.  It must be on the face of the document at the time the official had it in his possession or was disclosing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is so important would the Minister not put it into the Bill?  What he is saying will never be the law; what is in the Bill will be the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We must go on from there.  There is the information which is inherently secret or confidential but cannot be stamped as such, for instance, information which can be disclosed by the Minister or someone else to an official by word of mouth.  There could be no question of stamping it or having any written indication that it is secret or confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fourth now, information which is inherently confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the same as what Senator Fitzpatrick means.  We are dealing now with official information and its definition and it is defined as information which is stamped as such or information which is in itself official information.  In regard to the latter one, what I am concerned about at this stage is to indicate that stamping of statements and documents cannot be done afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not put that in the Bill?  A good many of us would be more satisfied if he would.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear from the wording of the definition of &ldquo;official information.&rdquo;  If it is not, and if some Senator can suggest a better form of words which would show that what I say is not the literal interpretation of the definition, I will reconsider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the other aspect of subsection (3) of Section 2.  I want to admit that there must be some element of retrospection here, but again I think confusion may arise in the minds of <Col N="1390" /> the House.  Obviously certification by the Minister in accordance with Section 2 (3) will only happen when a case goes to court or is about to be brought to court.  Therefore, as presumably disclosure will have taken place some time before the case goes to the courts this particular certification will be done in the courts or immediately before the proceedings.</P>

      <P>I do not think we should get involved in a detailed argument at this stage.  I am asked for certain specific explanations and I am endeavouring to give them to the best of my ability.  In regard to subsection (3) of Section 2 there is necessarily that element of retrospection.  I want to differentiate between that technical retrospection or mechanical retrospection and what I think is in Senator Stanford's mind.  I think he is here really concerned that no one would be capable of being prosecuted for a crime which was made a crime by retrospective legislation.  There will be no question of that.  When this Bill becomes an Act it will operate only from the date it becomes law, and there will be no question of its provisions applying retrospectively to anything that was done before it became law.  The certification referred to in subsection (3) can only be, as I say, as a mechanic of evidence when the case is being conducted in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it Senator Hayes's question arose out of Section 6.  I shall answer it as if it did, because I think it is worth clearing up this point.  I understood the gist of Senator Hayes's question was whether or not the document which came into his possession 40 years ago could now be demanded by a Taoiseach and whether he could be asked to hand up such a document.  The first thing I want to emphasise is that it must be an original document.  In that regard I would not like to be too explicit but it would seem to me that a document of which there were a number of copies could not be regarded as being an original document.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>At any time over the past 40 years the law governing this matter has been the same, namely, that anybody who discloses official information could be prosecuted.  The significant change we are making now is that it must be secret or confidential. Up to now it did not have to be secret or confidential.  The disclosure by Senator Hayes, or by any other Minister or ex-Minister, of official information which came into his possession by virtue of his position was and is a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>And, of course, our sense of historical perspective.  What is dealt with in this Bill has been the law for 40 years.  We are not suddenly going to go haywire in prosecuting people for offences against this code. There is practically nothing new in this measure.  It is to a large extent consolidation.  We are merely putting down in a modern statute what has been the law and what has been contained either in the principles of common law or in the two Acts of 1911 and 1920.  I think the fears that were expressed are unreal and unwarranted. I do not think there are any other points with which I have been asked to deal specifically at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is something I am prepared to discuss.  Generally speaking in these matters there has been a tendency over the past <Col N="1393" /> number of decades and I think throughout the past century for the courts to reduce prison sentences and sentences of penal servitude well below the maximum terms provided by law.  It was in conformity with that trend that we put the period of seven years into the Bill.  However, if there is a feeling in this House that the period should be longer and if an amendment to this effect is put down I shall certainly be prepared to listen to any arguments advanced in favour of it.  I would point out that very rarely does anybody serve more than 10 or 12 years of a life sentence.  In murder cases where sentences of execution have been commuted to life imprisonment the average length of the sentence served has been fairly short.  I do not think the average number of years served in these cases would be greater than seven years. Therefore the seven years' maximum in the Bill must be considered in that light.  However, I shall certainly be prepared to listen to arguments put by Senators here.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Lindsay's question as to what was the need for this Bill, that is a relevant question to be addressed to me at this stage. The only answer I can give is that there is no real specific need at this stage except that it is part of the general programme of legal reform on which we are embarking.  It is my idea and objective&mdash;and I think the Seanad generally would agree with this&mdash;that all our statute law should be contained in Acts of this Oireachtas and that we should as rapidly as we can get away from the position where we have to rely in any field on British statutes applying to this country by the Adaptation of Enactments Act.</P>
      <P>That is the main reason for the repeal of the 1911 and the 1920 Acts and for the introduction of this measure. In addition there is the necessity to make some amendments and to bring the law up to date and that is what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lindsay also asked a question about the position of civil servants and whether this whole matter could not be simply left to the regulations governing civil servants. <Col N="1394" /> I thought I had dealt with that in my opening remarks.  It is my view that despite any disciplinary regulations which may exist in the Civil Service it should still be a criminal offence if a public servant entrusted with confidential official information discloses it in an unauthorised fashion. That is necessary for the common good.  People have to disclose all sorts of information to Government Departments whether they like it or not from time to time and they are entitled to this security, to know that if that information is disclosed it will be a criminal offence for the official who discloses it and that it will be something more than just a breach of regulations to be dealt with as a matter of internal discipline in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Subject to the arguments on particular provisions which I realise from this debate a number of Senators will put forward on the Committee Stage, I feel that this Bill should be acceptable in principle to the House.  As I have said, I am prepared to consider any amendments or suggestions that can be put forward for the improvement of the Bill.  Indeed, if somebody can suggest a manner in which I can achieve the object of the Bill and still make subsection (3) of Section 2 more acceptable, then I will be prepared to consider that position.  I think that in principle, at this stage anyway, the Bill can be accepted and that the House could agree to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill sets out in the Schedule some 170 enactments which it is proposed to repeal either in part or totally.  These Acts, or the words in them which it is proposed to repeal, are in fact dead or obsolete already.  The present Bill deals only with Pre-Union Irish statutes, that is, Acts passed by a Parliament sitting in Ireland at any time before the Union of 1800, but further statute law revision Bills, dealing with obsolete English and British enactments still applying in the State, are in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>When this mass of dead wood has been cleared away it will be possible to produce a comprehensive Chronological Table and Index to the whole of the statute law in force in the State. It will also make possible the publication of a series of volumes containing the whole body of the living statute law.</P>
      <P>The last Statute Law Revision Acts dealing with Pre-Union Irish statutes were enacted by the British Parliament in 1878 and 1879, following which a revised edition of the Irish Statutes in one volume was prepared by William F. Cullinan of the Irish Office, Westminster, and published in 1885.  This volume, commonly known as Cullinan's Edition, contains the enactments then surviving, together with a chronological table of all the statutes.  All the enactments which it is now proposed to repeal are in that Edition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that at this stage it might be useful to Senators to know why the various classes of enactments in the Bill are considered appropriate for repeal.  In the first place a number of the statutes reprinted in Cullinan's Edition were even then clearly obsolete, but were reproduced in that Edition because they had been left untouched by the Statute Law Revision Acts. For example, statutes relating to ecclesiastical courts and ecclesiastical law ceased to be in force on the coming <Col N="1396" /> into operation of the Irish Church Act, 1869, by which the Church of Ireland was disestablished.  Again, the various Acts relating to the settlement of Ireland, and others of a similar character, which, having long since served their purpose, would be regarded as spent were left untouched by those Acts and are included in Cullinan's Edition.</P>
    <P>Statutes relating to the Pre-Union Irish Parliament, so far as they may have survived the Act of Union by which that Parliament was abolished, are inoperative since the establishment of the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann. The most notorious statute in this category is, of course, the Act of Union itself; it appears on the last page of the Schedule.  Senators will appreciate that the Act of Union was already repealed in substance when the Oireachtas was established (Article 73 of the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann), and all we are doing now is to remove it formally from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Statutes relating to the style or title of the Crown, or succession to or demise of the Crown, so far as they survived the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act, 1936, and the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, were impliedly repealed by the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>Enactments relating to practice and procedure in the superior courts have been superseded by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, by Rules of Court made under that Act or under the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1961, and by the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>These are the main types of enactments which are being repealed by virtue of Section 1 of the Bill.  The Schedule, to which the section refers, also provides for the repeal of enactments which are otherwise obsolete or spent.  Senators will notice that in certain cases only a few obsolete words are being repealed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might also draw attention to the italicised notes after each enactment in the second column of the Schedule.  These are intended purely as an explanation of why the statute or the relevant words in it (as indicated in the third column) are being repealed. <Col N="1397" /> The notes are by way of assistance to those who may wish to study the Bill in detail and, as is usual in statute law revision measures, they will not appear in the final print. Strictly speaking they are not part of the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill sets out the usual saving provisions.  These are in addition to the general saving provisions applying in the case of repeals contained in Section 21 of the Interpretation Act, 1937.</P>
    <P>One of the first practical benefits which should flow from the enactment of the Bill will be the publication in due course of a revised edition of the pre-Union Irish Statutes&mdash;what one might call an up-to-date version of Cullinan's edition.  Because of the extent of the repeals now being provided for it will be a rather slim volume.  It will make a good start to the job of publishing a complete edition of the Statutes Revised.  It will also be of considerable assistance to the various Departments by enabling them to examine the particular enactments with which they are concerned with a view to their modernisation.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Seanad will agree to give this purely technical Bill a Second Reading.  Indeed, having regard to the courtesy and good treatment which I always receive from this House, I might even get all Stages.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, although it contains only six small sections, is a Bill of great importance. It is important because it proposes to provide more money to vocational education committees.  By means of this additional finance committees may be able to continue and to extend the excellent work that they are doing in the spheres of culture and social and economic development.</P>
      <P>Vocational education, as you all know, is financed jointly from funds obtained from local rates and from grants from the Central Fund.  Existing legislation fixes a maximum rate for vocational education in the various local rating authority areas.  In most cases this maximum rate is 15d. in the £, though there are a few areas in which there is a maximum of 18d. in the £.  With the development of the vocational education service in recent years, and the increasing costs apart from development, many of the vocational education committees have reached this maximum of rate income. They find that further development will be impossible&mdash;and, indeed, maintenance of the present standard of the service will be difficult&mdash;unless more money is made available.</P>
      <P>The work and the achievements of the vocational schools have been so often and so widely extolled that it is scarcely necessary for me, on this occasion, to praise them further.  But this I would like to say: these schools will be called upon to play a major part in the great effort which we must make, as from now, to adapt ourselves to the rapidly changing conditions in which we live.  I feel that the record of progress, development, advancement which is the story of vocational education over the past 30 years is such that we can feel confident that the vocational education committees, the teachers and all others connected with the system will play that part well and will capably discharge the responsibilities laid upon them.  To do this they will, of course, need help.  Financial help is their most immediate need&mdash;an gad is giorra don scórnaigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, proposes&mdash;in Section 2&mdash;that the maximum rate for vocational education be increased to <Col N="1400" /> 24d. in the £ for all areas.  This does not mean, however, that the vocational education rate would jump immediately by sixpence or by ninepence.  At present, a vocational education committee may, on demand, obtain an additional rate of 1d. in the £ from the rating authority over the amount provided in the previous year.  I am not proposing any departure from that existing situation.  I am not asking that a vocational education committee should be able to increase its income from local rates, as of legal right, by more than one penny in the £ over the rate for the previous year.</P>
    <P>There is, however, in existing legislation a provision that permits the local authority to grant an increase of more than one penny, but not more than two pennies, from one year to another. Almost invariably, when a committee has found itself in the position that it must approach the rating authority for a rate increase of more than one penny, the additional amount has been granted.  That this has been the case is a clear indication that the work of the vocational education committees is very highly valued, locally.  In Section 3 of this Bill, it is proposed that this limit of twopence on the amount which the rating authority may give should be advanced to threepence.  Industrial and economic development in some areas will, I am sure, be such that immediate demands for vocational and technical education will be great, and may warrant a heavier call on the local rates than the ordinary one penny annual increase.  I should like to point out, however, that there is no element of compulsion in this section.  It is permissive, merely.  And, of course, it does not affect the over-riding maximum of 24d. provided for in Section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is rather technical.  The principal Act&mdash;the Vocational Education Act, 1930&mdash;states in Section 2:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;rateable value&rsquo; means the annual rateable value under the Valuation Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For the past 30 years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a rate of one penny in the pound in so far as vocational education was concerned was equivalent to the income <Col N="1401" /> which a penny in every pound of the gross valuation of a rateable area would produce.  For example, if the schedule of valuation gave a figure of £100,000 for a particular area in a particular year, the vocational education committee would get 100,000 pennies in respect of each penny rate available for vocational education. Certain rating authorities have recently challenged this interpretation and have claimed that the value of the penny rate should be calculated on the figure of valuation on which rates are collectable.</P>
    <P>I understand that the question could not be determined except by submitting it to the courts, or alternatively, by clarifying the law.  It appeared to me that the occasion of submitting a Vocational Education Bill to the Oireachtas was an opportune time to remove all possible doubts in this matters.  As regards Section 5, this merely provides that the provisions governing the payment of travelling and maintenance expenses to members of county vocational education committees shall be on the same basis as provisions in other legislation concerning similar payments to members of county councils, members of joint mental hospital boards and members of county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill by An tOireachtas will, of course, mean that the State grants to vocational education committees will also be increased, since State grants are related to the amounts provided from local rates.  I have no doubt that An Seanad will agree, as the Dáil has agreed, to this measure for the provision of more money for a very important branch of our educational system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Minister that the Bill is a welcome one.  We need to keep our educational system up to date and to meet the new needs arising from time to time.  To do that we require to invest more money in every branch of education.  So far as this Bill is a Bill to provide more money for vocational education, I welcome it. I think I can speak for many here when I say that we are all agreed with regard to it, but there may be certain points in relation to the financing of <Col N="1402" /> it with which certain people may not agree.  I do not intend to go into that.</P>
      <P>The Principal Act in 1930 was introduced by a colleague of mine in University College, Dublin&mdash;Professor John Marcus O'Sullivan.  I think it is only fair, when discussing a vocational educational Bill, to mention his name. But we should go even further back and say that our vocational schools Act goes back to technical schools organised under the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction under a British Act of 1899.  At that time agricultural and technical instruction were combined, and very substantial work was done.  In fact, that Department was, I think, under T.P. Gill, really the beginning of an almost self-governing Irish Department.  I saw in last night's newspaper that a new vocational school was opened in Borrisokane in North Tipperary.  This is a school in which a number of young farmers will do a special course under the auspices of the County Committee of Agriculture and the Vocational Education Committee of the County. There is, of course, a connection between the two.  We have separated them, but we have, since 1922, continued to develop both of them.</P>
      <P>It should be said also that, although these schools were called technical schools, they went from the very beginning beyond being merely trades schools.  They taught languages.  They got grants for Irish.  It should be remembered to the credit of T.P. Gill that, under his régime under the British, grants were given to summer schools for teaching the Irish language. The system has worked very well and with considerable flexibility.  Adaptability and sometimes originality have been displayed by both executive officers and teachers.  These schools have made a considerable difference in rural Ireland and in towns outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In University College, Dublin, we run a number of adult education classes, following a lead given by University College, Cork.  When we were organising classes in certain places in Leinster we found it was indispensable to have the assistance of the chief executive officer of the <Col N="1403" /> vocational committee.  Not only have these schools trade and commercial classes, but an effort has been made in Dublin and elsewhere to meet other needs by a programme of public lectures on the problems of the day. The Minister will agree with me, however, that we should not allow anything to obscure the fundamental idea, which is, in the case of these schools, the acquiring and improving of skills.  Our great need today, whether or not we enter the European Community, is for technicians and craftsmen.  Those of our people who emigrate make very poor headway if they have no special skills.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make in relation to vocational schools.  We have to look to education as a whole.  We must consider its parts as well.  There is necessarily some overlapping but there has been a tendency in certain places for pupils to leave the primary school at the early age of 12 or 13 and go to the nearby vocational school, what they call the &ldquo;new tech&rdquo;.  The latter is very often a brighter and better building than the primary school, but I do not think it is desirable that the vocational schools should be what one might call continuation schools.  We have a primary certificate which boys and girls may take at the age of 12. There is a tendency, I think, when they get that certificate for them to leave the primary school and go to the vocational school.  I am not sure that that is a good thing.  I think it would be better for them to remain in the primary school until 14, doing a suitable course, and then go on to vocational school properly equipped to pursue a course in craftsmanship, commerce, or any other course offered.</P>
    <P>I spent some time in Dublin Technical Schools teaching French and one of the difficulties experienced at the time&mdash;I do not think the position is quite the same now&mdash;was that the people coming to the school for the course had either not been long enough at a primary school, or were too long away from school, and had gone rusty.  It would be much better if pupils could be kept in primary school until 14 and then enter a vocational <Col N="1404" /> school.  There seems to be, if I may say so, some uncertainty or hesitancy as to what is to happen in the primary school between the time a pupil gets the primary certificate and the time he or she leaves to go to work at 14.</P>
    <P>It should also be said&mdash;I hope it will not be regarded as irrelevant&mdash;that the vocational school would be much more crowded were it not for the fact that there is a very big increase in the number of pupils in secondary schools.  In accordance with the rules which Governments seem to follow, irrespective of Party, once the vocational schools came under the aegis of a Department of State they got good buildings.  The old Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction built a magnificent College of Science, which University College has now, to train teachers, but the British Government gave a very mean grant for University College.  At present, the vocational schools are well built, well lit, and pleasant to work in and to attend, but the secondary schools are in a very difficult position where building is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to argue this now.  I know he will not.  I also know there are difficulties with regard to grants for secondary school buildings. These are all privately owned, but they are doing national work.  I think the Minister will agree with that. They are doing a job which is becoming almost impossible now because of the position with regard to building. Building costs too much.  If the Minister were to come along with an offer of money I am sure he would have no difficulty in talking himself and the owners of the school out of whatever difficulties they are in.  A grant to the secondary schools would prove a solvent of their difficulties.  I should like to say quite seriously that the building of secondary schools is one of our great problems.  It is relevant inasmuch as you cannot solve one of the problems in isolation from all the others.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been done in the vocational sphere.  The secondary schools will have to have some solution of their building difficulties. There is a certain amount of talk <Col N="1405" /> about vocational schools helping us to prepare ourselves for entry into the European Community.  Whether or not we go in, we will certainly need training in craftsmanship, design, commerce, and continental languages.  I do not think vocational schools can make a very great contribution in regard to continental languages because they are, in the main, dealing with people who are already working all day.  There is some misunderstanding&mdash;this may be the occasion to clear it up&mdash;with regard to what will happen us educationally if we enter the European Community.  We will certainly gain some educational advantages. There will be a great dissemination of documents, an interchange of teachers and an interchange of students.</P>
    <P>The EEC has done a certain amount of groundwork in economics, and a great deal in education, but no one should go away with the impression that the intention of the people in Brussels is that there should be cultural uniformity.  If we make any preparations for going into the European Economic Community they should be based upon the notion that we are going to remain very firmly Irish. There is no intention of making a Dutchman less Dutch, or a Frenchman less French.  We should not lessen in any way our essential Irish-ness.</P>
    <P>We can make a better contribution to the European Economic Community if we remain Irish, but we should make an endeavour to learn some Continental language.  If this country is ever in the position that educated people know no language but English and Irish, they will have become more Anglicised than ever before.  I feel that perhaps the Minister should give a lead in the vocational schools in language teaching.  One of the difficulties is that people are not quite clear what they are aiming at.</P>
    <P>I know the French language and I have taught it.  It seems to me to be quite futile to make a young fellow who is not a specialist in the language, who is simply learning it in the ordinary way as a pass student, translate Irish or English into French and do free compositions or write essays in a <Col N="1406" /> language which has the best writing in the world and which he would have no chance whatever, even if he had tuition, of writing satisfactorily.  Particularly if we are to have more European connections we should frame courses which would enable the ordinary student to read a modern language and we could even go a step further and teach him to read it out aloud reasonably well instead of trying to speak polished sentences.  In that way we would give him something on which he could build later.</P>
    <P>If that could be done in French and the other Continental languages, instead of trying to teach people grammar or how to write or speak polished French&mdash;which they will never be able to do&mdash;and if we could give them an interest in the life behind the language, it would be a step in the right direction. Lectures in schools, even in English, on the life of other countries would do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>Indeed, as I am on that point, I think that the reason for part of the failure in regard to the Irish language movement is that the people who are taught Irish begin to feel that it is a collection of irregular verbs.  They do not know what is behind it.  If that movement were successful it would have taught Irish children &mdash; and particularly city children&mdash;something about rural life.  In that respect, in my judgement, it has not been successful at all.  It is very desirable that both in regard to Continental languages and the Irish language something of that kind should be done.  The students should be taught something about the life behind the language so that we would have a window upon the world and know that there is something in the world outside the island next to us with which at one time we were at loggerheads but to which we now seem to be getting closer and closer as we get more and more independent.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the Minister that this is a desirable Bill.  It is expensive, perhaps, but the expense is inevitable.  It is something that is needed and well worthwhile and upon which its originators in 1930 or in 1899, and those who have worked it since, should be complimented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister summed up the Bill fairly well when he said that financial help is the most immediate need.  I would agree thoroughly with that statement.  If the Minister had not introduced this Bill there would be absolute chaos in every vocational committee in Ireland this year.  As a matter of fact our vocational committee made a demand last year for twopence and, having made it, we were told by the county council that we had exceeded our limit by a farthing, so last Monday we made a demand for a penny-three-farthings but unless the Bill became law we could <Col N="1409" /> not continue our vocational scheme. With this penny-three-farthings, that is 16¾d., we are told that to run our vocational business for a year will take about £56,227.  The average attendance of day pupils in vocational schools in Westmeath is 500 so we see that it takes an average of £112 per year per day pupil attending the schools.  I would like to see these figures compared with the amount it takes per pupil to run primary schools.  I am sure I would get quite a shock to see how much less it takes in primary schools than in vocational schools.</P>
      <P>If we exclude Dublin I could safely say that the problems confronting committees in the rest of the country are more or less identical.  Having been at a congress in Athlone this year, I could say that the problems every committee throughout the country have to face are exactly the same as we have to face in our own country of Westmeath.  The problem at the moment with us is that we have got the green light to erect two more schools and extend two of the present schools.  We could not proceed with that work unless this Bill this evening to provide more money became law.  I am of the opinion that the Minister will get the full support of the Seanad to implement the Bill.</P>
      <P>Personally I do not agree with the Minister's policy regarding the erection of schools.  I am all in favour of central schools and the provision of transport to bring the pupils to them.  I can see all the difficulties in the erection of two, three and four teacher schools, the difficulties of schools in rural areas, of getting staff to stay, of getting teachers to take a real interest and settle down in a country area.  You find that at night time they move off to towns and will not remain among the people.  In the two or three or the three or four teacher school, the number of subjects the boys can do is very limited.  They can do woodwork, metalwork perhaps in a four teacher school, but in a three teacher school they cannot do metalwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Girls can do domestic economy and needlework.  They will not have art or music or several other subjects which they should have in any vocational school.  It is my opinion that if <Col N="1410" /> the Minister decided on central comprehensive schools it would work out much cheaper eventually.  My contention is that in the next four or five years we will require at least two schools in every county.  That would be 50 schools and the average cost per school would be £30,000.  If we work that out, we find that the Minister will be spending at least one-and-a-half million pounds on the erection of vocational schools in the next three or four years.  It is for that reason that I think the Minister should at this very moment decide whether three and four teacher schools are the solution to our vocational problem or whether the solution is the comprehensive school with transport provided.</P>
    <P>For the first time since vocational schools were erected in Westmeath we had the privilege this year of getting transport from an isolated area to the school in Mullingar.  The general opinion of parents at present is that the worst day they ever saw was when a school was erected three or four miles away from them.  It is much better to have to find transport&mdash;money and transport with help from the Department is the solution.  A bicycle would cost many parents much more than to pay over a year a third of the cost of transport to a vocational school.</P>
    <P>We have had trouble recently about getting teachers.  We have very many teachers in our schools at present on a temporary basis and teachers who are not really fully qualified.  Our biggest worry is to find metalwork teachers.  I understand the Department supplements the education of people who wish to become metalwork teachers but, when they come out of training colleges fully trained and qualified to take positions in vocational schools, they are snapped up by various industrial concerns who give them a greater initial wage than we could give in a school.</P>
    <P>In Athlone, in spite of the fact that on four different occasions over the past three months we have advertised for metalwork teachers we got no reply from anyone who wanted to take up any vacancy.  I understand that these teachers are trained at the expense of the Department of Education to a certain extent and when they come <Col N="1411" /> out of training instead of going and teaching in vocational schools these people go into industrial concerns because their initial wage is much better than ours.  The Minister should take note of that fact.</P>
    <P>I happened to be on a deputation to the Minister some months ago and discussed central schools with him on that occasion.  I went home with the opinion that the Minister was not in favour of extension of the provision of central schools.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister on no occasion in the future to sanction the purchase of an old building for a vocational school.  That was done in the past.  It was done in our county, in Athlone, and it created a terrific problem for the vocational committee &mdash; the very fact that the old workhouse was purchased.  Some time ago we asked for two extra rooms to be put on there at a cost of £20,000. It went up to the Department and came back to us and we were informed that in the opinion of the Department the extension we were thinking of was not sufficient for our needs.  We asked for an opinion from the architect and it was before us on Monday evening of this week.</P>
    <P>The architect was of the opinion that what the Department wished would take £40,000, and he also makes the recommendation not to spend it there, that the vocational committee should seek a new site and build a new school instead of throwing away £40,000.  I agree with that report which came in from the architect because there are no facilities around the vocational school.  In fact, there is barely enough space to put up the building and when the children are on recreation they must have their recreation on the streets of Athlone. This should be avoided at all costs. I am sure that the Minister so long as he is Minister will not ever advocate, agree or sanction an old building being taken over and converted into a vocational school.</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage when the Minister should consider the provision of regional colleges of technology. These should be located in <Col N="1412" /> such a way as to cover the maximum area so that top-class pupils in vocational schools could continue their education by means of scholarships. It is a problem that should be faced because outside Dublin there are no facilities at all for higher education. A child can only get his group certificate and get out into the world. The Minister should take this seriously and do something.  In the future our committee could make use of the 9d. extra given here to provide these, perhaps, but when we come to higher education the Minister should take the bull by the horns and see that the State provides the colleges required.</P>
    <P>When I mention scholarships it prompts me to beg the Minister not to reduce scholarship ages to the 11 to 13 group.</P>

      <P>There was something else I wanted to say about scholarships but I had better not.  As regards the allowance for vocational education committee members, I can assure the Minister that no Party has been hurt more than the Labour Party because of the fact that there were no allowances for people living within a certain radius.  I do not think that the concession he has given meets the case. <Col N="1414" /> Take a tradesman.  There is a tradesman in the town of Mullingar who is a member of the county council. His rate of pay is 5/- an hour.  A meeting of the county council starts at 11 a.m.  If he spends his day at that meeting he gets an allowance of 13/6 but loses the 45/- he would otherwise earn.  The same would arise in regard to the vocational education committee, but not to the same extent because their meetings are usually held in the evening.  A man may lose two hours work and the least he should get is two hours pay.  We have lost very good members of the vocational education committee for the simple reason that they were workingclass people who were of great ability but they could not afford to give their time to vocational education committees or county council business or anything else.  I welcome the move to give these people some concession.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I should like the Minister to know that there is a big change in the situation as regards adults attending courses.  For example, in the boat building class in Mullingar there was always an enrolment of 20 or 30 and nine or ten had to be eliminated.  There was a class in farming started in Moate two years ago for which there were 60 applicants. This year, there were eight.  It is worth noting that in Mullingar the art and craft classes were combined because of low numbers and the cookery class closed down.  There was not a single application for an itinerant Irish class whereas there were 54 applicants for a French class in Athlone and 52 applicants for a French class in Mullingar.  It is an extraordinary trend.  Attendance by adults at vocational school classes is diminishing.  That is a matter the Minister should consider when schemes are being drawn up in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. We are about to allow vocational education committees to spend more money on vocational education. Money spent on education is money well spent.  The investment now will pay dividends in the years ahead.  As to whether or not more money should come from the central authority or some other body, as a member of a local body I believe that it is our duty to live up to our responsibilities and provide extra money for education in the different counties.  At the same time, I think the present system is unfair.  It is a definite hardship on the poorer counties.  Consider the position of Leitrim or Longford, where the rates are 50/- in the £.  A penny in the £ brings in only £500 or £600.  Apart from that, it constitutes a grave hardship in these counties to put on another twopence or threepence in the £.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are few industries in these areas and the boys and girls educated in these vocational schools eventually find their way to Dublin or Cork, or <Col N="1417" /> Galway, or to other more highly industrialised counties.  Because of that, I think there are good grounds for giving greater grants to the poorer counties.  In some ways the system seems to be unfair.  Some hold that it is designed to develop a small intellectual élite.  In other countries there is what might be described as education of the masses with subsequent selection based on quality.  The danger I see in our system is that it may exclude valuable talent because so many go no further than the national school.  I believe the school-leaving age should be raised.  Perhaps that does not arise on this Bill.</P>

      <P>These boys and girls should be encouraged to attend vocational schools.  Education unquestionably stands high in priority as a charge on our national resources. We have very little natural resources, very little underground wealth.  The ability of our nation to earn its keep and to improve its standard of living in the years ahead will be founded more on brains and skill than on mineral or other wealth.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of vocational education is to equip for life the thousands of young people throughout the country who have to go to work at an early age.  All vocational education students come from the primary schools.  Some few receive a higher education in other institutions.  In the rural areas the bulk should attend classes provided by the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there should be closer liaison and closer co-operation between the three branches of education.  There should be more co-operation between the vocational committees of education and the county committees of agriculture. Primary education and vocational education are undoubtedly complementary. There should be closer co-operation between these groups, officially and unofficially.  As a result of a joint memorandum issued by the Departments of Education and Agriculture in 1946, or 1947, there has <Col N="1418" /> been growing up over the years in Counties Westmeath and Longford a greater realisation of the benefits which can be gained by closer co-operation between the staffs of the vocational education committee and the county committee of agriculture.  A harmonious association between these groups in the great task entrusted to them is not only desirable but necessary. I hope that the aim of educational policy in the future will be to co-ordinate the activities and the objectives of these, to my mind, complementary organisations to the greatest possible degree.  We have a young CEO in Westmeath who did wonderful work as headmaster in Castlepollard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the present position of vocational education shows a growing demand for this branch of education which has consequently called forth an effort on the part of the committees for further progress and development in every sphere.  Because of that increased development extra money is now needed in every county in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the administration of vocational education there is a trinity of organisations. There are the committees and their chief executive officer, the body of teachers and the Minister.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that if a scheme is to succeed in any county there must be complete harmony between all three.  Such harmony can only be achieved by a complete understanding by all of each other's role, position and difficulties.  This calls for the fullest consultation between all parties, and it does not exclude criticism. I believe healthy criticism can be of great benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational education as it is operated in Ireland requires a high degree of dedication on the part of the <Col N="1419" /> teachers and the members of the committees who are, to a large extent, doing voluntary work, and also on the part of the Minister.  The sacrifices asked from the teachers are balanced, I suppose, by the restraint required from the individual members.  The present system has been successful because the over-riding consideration at all times has been the welfare of the student.  The remarkable success&mdash;and we have to agree there has been a remarkable success&mdash;of vocational education is due to the harmony that has existed at all times between all concerned: the different Ministers for Education, the teachers and the committees.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to say that vocational education is, of necessity, of a very complex character.  It has to meet not only different needs in different areas but also demands which change from session to session in the same areas.  I suppose it is peculiar to its nature that it provides training to meet the many vocations that exist in modern agricultural, industrial and commercial life. We will all agree that flexible machinery can easily adapt itself not only to the changing vocations, but to the alterations in the vocations, and to the methods in use in agriculture, industry and commerce which are changing daily.  We have new methods as invention follows invention.</P>
    <P>If vocational education is to be really effective it must keep pace with these changes&mdash;the revolutionary changes as well as the evolutionary changes.  It must afford to the students instruction based on the most up-to-date methods and by its ability to do that it will be judged.  Our present system is responding well to that test.  To-day more than ever before, with the advent of our entry to the Common Market, I hope in the next year or two, the country needs skilled hands and the technical knowledge which only vocational schools in town and country can give.</P>
    <P>If we are to expand production in industry and agriculture&mdash;and I think that is the earnest hope and desire of each and every one of us&mdash;we must increase our technical and scientific <Col N="1420" /> skills and we must bring the opportunities to avail of this knowledge to our people whether they live in the country or in town.  I know you can bring a horse to the water and at times it may be hard to get him to drink, but I believe the Irish worker must be put, as fully as our resources permit, on a basis of equality with his foreign competitor.  Even if some people claim we are spending money to educate people for emigration, we must remember that education is no weight to carry and even if they go abroad they will be in a position to get good employment.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees are engaged in work of a very high nature.  Any of us who are members of such committees know that our aim is the provision of such training as will turn out Irish citizens who are intelligent and cultured, people who have a sense of responsibility towards the community, boys and girls capable of earning their own livelihood because they have been taught a craft and also capable of providing for those who are dependent upon them, people who are alive to social justice and charity, and young men and women who are fitted to be the heads of Christian families.</P>
    <P>This may not be very relevant but when I look at the papers I wonder are we succeeding in turning out as good citizens as we would desire. When I read of the calls that are made by the police for people to come forward and give information which would help them, I often wonder are our pupils in our schools being taught enough about civic spirit, and are they as good citizens as we would all like them to be.</P>
    <P>The importance of the aims of vocational education both to the individual pupils and for the country as a whole cannot be exaggerated.  I claim that of all the educational services, vocational education has the most directly stimulating effect on national production.  That is my opinion although I have heard a contrary view expressed here to-day.  It has close links with agriculture, industry and commerce, and it has numerous ties with organisations such <Col N="1421" /> as Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Tuaithe, Macra na Feirme, the Irish Country-women's Association, the different apprenticeship committees and other organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>While our system of vocational and technical education has shown excellent progress during the past decade much more remains to be done.  I wish to bring the following urgent reforms to the notice of the Minister.</P>
      <P>First, all vocational and technical students should have the opportunity of proceeding to higher education, that is, to technological colleges in areas outside Dublin, as well as in Dublin, and to the universities.  At present the deplorable lack of scholarships and our failure to make secondary education free to all who can benefit from it prevents the exercise of this natural right of both parent and student.  The Minister and his Department should pay attention to those often-repeated proposals of such bodies as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the vocational teachers, the Irish national teachers and the secondary teachers.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Department of Education should forget the idea that vocational education is the poor man's university and should recognise the claims of such areas as Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick, Wexford, Kilkenny and other towns, to technical colleges. Thirdly, it is necessary to add a third year to the present two-year vocational course.  The present course is too short.</P>
      <P>I suggest that as regards agricultural education, this badly-needed development should take place under the vocational system in consultation with the Department of Agriculture.  I was surprised to see the lack of consultation with the vocational teachers' organisation in the preparation of the report on small farms in the western area.</P>
      <P>Lastly I desire to congratulate the Minister on the technical survey now being undertaken and the OECD national education survey.  I hope he will really influence the Department to accept the need for such change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a few brief remarks on this Bill.  First I should like to welcome it very much as we should welcome any move to provide greater educational facilities.  We should avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the teachers concerned.  It would be rather indivious to select the vocational teachers from among the body of teachers because all our teachers are doing excellent work whether on primary, secondary or vocational school level. We should congratulate all.  Despite the many handicaps under which they work&mdash;the greatest of all being the depressed position in the salary scale which they occupy relative to other groups &mdash; they are doing excellent work.  I hope the good work of raising their position in the salary scale will be continued by the Minister who has already done very good work in this regard.</P>
      <P>A few remarks on vocational education in general.  It is well, I think, to recognise in this age of modern transport that distances covered by schools can be increased considerably.  Previously a three or four mile radius might be regarded as much as could be served by a school, but now that can be extended to six, eight or ten miles. I would specially make a case with regard to certain specialist activities like highly expensive engineering work done in technical schools or other types of work which involve fitting out a very expensive workshop.  Where such are available within eight or ten miles, or even more from a particular centre, rather than incur the very heavy additional expenditure involved in fitting another school in the centre, the Minister should consider the provision of free travel or assisted travel for students outside the area served by the vocational school which has got these facilities.  This would enable the provision of a better workshop and better staff in that particular subject in the vocational centre selected.  It would also encourage the student body to take the subject and they by their numbers alone would help one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I would suggest for the Minister's consideration is all the modern talk about schools of <Col N="1423" /> technology.  That is all very nice and proper in its own place but I would suggest to the Minister that he should be careful to avoid any wasteful overlapping here and to see that, on the one hand, the universities are not doing the work that should be done in the technical schools and, on the other hand&mdash;and perhaps it is of more relevance at the moment&mdash;that the technical schools are not attempting to do the work that should be done in the universities, that is, by attempting to provide full degree courses in subjects at night.</P>
    <P>It would be a far better use of the taxpayers' money to give scholarships to worthy students who would otherwise have to take their courses at night&mdash;scholarships that would permit them to attend the regular classes in the university.  Again, this would be in the direction of rationalisation and it would enable the facilities in that subject to be increased at the university centre and greater contribution to be made.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is a matter of study at all times to know where the line is to be drawn but we should be very careful in this regard about the confusion that arises in the very name &ldquo;institute of technology&rdquo;.  In America, institutes of technology are really at the highest level and are what you would call scientific universities in the fullest sense.  All that distinguishes them from the older type of university is that their range of degrees is somewhat narrower and they do not provide courses in the humanities or perhaps B.A. degrees like the regular universities do.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, they are in every sense the modern approach to the scientific training in a university.  I would say to the Minister that there is no case whatsoever for our vocational schools to aspire to that title, to that range of subjects.  There is plenty of work to be done by all engaged in the field of education and all we require is simply to prevent any undue overlapping and to co-operate in the best interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>Also, I should not like it to be felt that because one system of education <Col N="1424" /> may have slightly better contacts or be more closely under control by the Department of Education it would be regarded as being favoured over others that are slightly more removed. We might take it that vocational education is somewhat more closely linked to the Department than either secondary education or university education.  We would like to feel that that incidental linking would in no way impair either the harmony of working between or the co-operation between the various bodies and the Department concerned.</P>
    <P>One other point I would put up is that vocational education is such a wide subject today that there is a need for continuous study of developments abroad and seeing how these can be fitted to our developments at home, a continual need for the modernisation of courses, and so on.  To carry out those studies, I suggest to the Minister, requires many trained people.  It is not right or proper that the Department of Education should be expected to do all that work itself.  I would suggest to the Minister that he has in the body of vocational teachers themselves splendid material from which to draw such staffs.  It could become quite a feature of vacation work during the Summer.  A certain team would be selected to do a six or seven weeks' study of some facet of vocational education.  Of course, that should carry its proper remuneration because salaries in vocational education are all too low.  It would be a very good idea that there should be supplements available for those who were prepared to do such needed work during the summer vacation or at any other times.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would suggest that in the consideration of vocational education for the future we have a question which is intimately connected with the question of raising the school-leaving age because it will affect the numbers considerably.  I would suggest to the Minister that when that happy day comes about, when the school-leaving age will be raised the Minister should always provide a certain, not exactly escape clause, but alternative, by which those who had a bent for vocational education or for <Col N="1425" /> the most practical type of craftmanship would be able to meet the requirements of the raised school-leaving age by attending a regular evening or night session in a vocational school and taking the necessary examinations something that would ensure that they would put in an equivalent amount of study as they would put in if they were full-time day pupils.  At present the boys released from work to attend vocational schools cannot aspire to that.  One day a week is certainly no substitute for increasing the age.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that before long the Minister will see other ways and means of increasing the amount available to all education and to vocational education as one of the branches of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the welcome extended to this Bill.  It is a Bill to provide further money for technical education.  For that reason, I am very glad that it has been introduced.  It enables the local authority to provide further money from the rates for technical education and it follows that further money will also be forthcoming from the State.</P>
      <P>At the present time the State makes available in grants £ for £ raised by the local authority, but I understand that the same rate of grants is not paid in all counties.  I should be glad if the Minister would clear this point up for me when he is replying because it is not possible in this House to put down Parliamentary Questions.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that several counties in Ireland are given more than 50 per cent.  grant, or given more than the £ for each £ raised locally. Some people say that only happens in cases where the maximum rate of 15d. in £ has already been reached locally, but I understand that that is not so.  I understand that, even in some counties where the local rate has not reached 15d. in £, additional grants have been given.  I should like to know if that is so.  If it is so, I should like to know the reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators have advocated the establishment of larger technical <Col N="1426" /> schools in which advanced technical instruction could be given.  I certainly think that at least one such advanced school should be provided in each county.  It is not possible to give all the instruction necessary, or required, in every technical school in the country.  It is not possible to give such instruction in the three-teacher or even the four-teacher school.  I agree with the Senators who said that there should be, in this year of 1962, a large school in the county town or in some central town in each county, equipped to give advanced technical education in engineering and, to some degree, in science and other subjects. At the moment vast areas are debarred from benefiting in the employment given by the ESB because there is no instruction locally in electrical engineering.  That is the position in the town of Cavan.  I know there is a fairly large technical school there, but there is no instruction given in electrical engineering.  The result is that local boys cannot become technicians with the ESB.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say a word about departmental delays.  I hold the view that local vocational committees are doing excellent work, but I believe some of the members are disappointed and frustrated because of the length of time it takes to get a project through the Department.  I fully appreciate that the Department must give considerable thought and perhaps considerable time, before deciding that a technical school should be built in a certain place but I believe that, having approved in principle of the building of a school in a certain place, there should be no further unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, unreasonable that it should take from the month of December, for example, until the following October or November to approve of a site.  It should be possible to approve of a site in a month or six weeks.  It should be possible to approve of plans within a reasonable period, say a couple of months.  The experience of some committees is that it is a matter of years from the date on which the building of a school is approved in principle until the tenders can be invited.  I say that is unreasonable. <Col N="1427" /> I say it has a bad effect on the local committees.  I say it would be really better not to give the approval in principle until the Department is ready, financially and otherwise, to go ahead with the project.</P>

      <P>In considering the difficulties under which vocational education operates in this country, I think the first and major consideration is the approach of parents who are in favour of secondary education and who are prejudiced against vocational education.  At the end of the primary stage a choice has to be made and in 999 cases out of 1,000 the parents plump for secondary school irrespective of the aptitude of the child.  I think this is due primarily to a failure on the part of people to appreciate the different functions of the two types of school; and that failure has led to the position in which secondary schools have on their rolls many pupils who are entirely unsuited to secondary education and who have no aptitude for the type of education the secondary school provides. Even though the child may fail in the intermediate certificate the parents will still insist in presenting the child for the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the considerations that motivate parents in taking this attitude. There is, first of all, the widespread <Col N="1428" /> idea that vocational schools are intended for the intellectually inferior. There is also the undoubted confidence that parents have in institutions run by religious as opposed to those run by lay people.  Arising again out of that, there is the undying hope in the breasts of most parents that little Johnny will one day be a bishop and that desirable end can only be achieved by sending him to a secondary school. Vocational education has no avenue towards that end.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal with this very closely but one of the most powerful considerations that operate against it is the fact that the secondary school is still nearly the only gateway to higher things, whereas for the majority of vocational pupils a dead end is reached at the age of 15 or 16 years after a couple of years in the school.  For that reason I am very partial to the suggestions that have been made in the other House and in this House that regional colleges of higher technology should be established here and there throughout the country, with adequate scholarship schemes to support them which would ensure that interested and deserving pupils of vocational schools would have an opportunity of developing their technological aptitudes to the full. It is only in the realm of agriculture in the various parts of the country that any higher outlet is afforded to the pupils who go to technical schools, and also in the big centres of population such as Dublin and Cork.  There must be a great waste of talent and ability all over the country amongst the pupils of the rural vocational schools who have no further outlet for their abilities than the local schools, and then, possibly, a dead and job.</P>
    <P>In the educational expansion that is envisaged in this Bill, it is obvious that the system which is best for expansion is the vocational one.  After all, in proportion to our population the numbers attending our secondary schools are not small.  They really are not out of proportion as compared with other countries.  It is obvious that any great expansion that is to be made has to be made in the realm of the vocational schools and that, of course, in the context of our proposed entry <Col N="1429" /> into the Common Market&mdash;because a consequence will be a demand for skilled craftsmen and it is the function, and should be the function, of vocational and technological schools to provide that man power&mdash;anything that could be done to break down the prejudice against them and promote confidence among the people should be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Such a change of attitude should be natural and spontaneous.  Otherwise, I see no alternative to providing some system of selection at the end of the primary school period and that, as we know, is fraught with serious difficulties and dangers and should be avoided if at all possible.  I mention these things because I should like to point out that no matter how much is provided in this or any other Bill for vocational education, it will not have its due effect unless the people accept vocational education as being equal to any other system of education they have.  The money will be squandered in trying to attract teachers and perhaps erecting palatial buildings because it will have little effect if we cannot attract the pupils into the schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the wish of the Minister to get through the Bill as quickly as possible I shall be brief.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  Many people imagine that there is a certain amount of jealousy as between the various groups of teachers, but I should like to say as a member of the Irish National Teachers' Executive that we most heartily welcome provisions which will extend our educational facilities and I think they will be welcomed by everyone who takes an objective view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already referred here on the Appropriation Bill to the low expenditure on education and I shall not reiterate the point.  It is well known that we are not spending sufficient money on education, but we are concerned that when money is collected and is to be expended it should be expended in the proper fashion.  Looking at the Statistical Abstract which gives the figures for education for 1961, we observe that those who participated in whole-time day continuation courses <Col N="1430" /> amounted to 25,368, while those who participated in whole-time technical courses amounted to the small figure of only 954.  We must ask ourselves are we squeezing all we can out of vocational and technical education, unless these figures are completely wrong &mdash;and when I look at them I become suspicious of the fact that there are only 954 genuine technical students in the whole set up in the whole country.</P>
    <P>We should not get too confused about the glitter of vocational education because it is glossed over to a considerable extent by adult education courses in mountain climbing.  Those courses are very fine and very attractive, and they provide a wonderful opportunity for adult education, but we should not lose sight of the fact that our chief aim at this critical hour in our history is to ensure that technical education is fulfilling its real function.</P>
    <P>Another point about which many people are perturbed is the nature of the day continuation courses.  Many of us who look at this question in an objective way, and not in a carping critical way, feel that more could be done in the day continuation courses. We welcome the fact that many thousands of students participate in the whole-time technical education.  That should be our objective.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Quinlan's remarks about the remuneration of teachers.  I shall not say any more on that subject except that no system of education can rise above the level of its teachers.  If they are kept on a low level of remuneration, as compared with people in other services, you cannot expect the best, and above all you cannot expect the enthusiasm which one should find in a teacher.  When you have a person in charge of a class who is not enthusiastic, and who has not the proper spirit, outlook and drive, he has a withering and blighting effect.  You cannot have enthusiasm, drive, perseverance, and the proper outlook, if you keep the teachers on a low level of remuneration. If they are jealous of the people in other services you will not get enthusiasm no matter what curricula you devise or what buildings you erect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> I agree 100 per cent. with Senator Quinlan's remarks about having more propaganda on the difficulties of vocational education.  Let us look for the reason.  We all know that parents can try to fulfil their own emotional needs in the careers of their children and want their children to be what they were not, or to be what they would have liked to be themselves.  We know this is a big factor which comes into play when parents are sending their children on for education.  It is a bit hackneyed to say it because everyone is talking about it, but the time has come for some form of direction when children are due to cross the bridge between primary and post-primary education.  There should be some direction there, some form of guidance and consultation so that the child would have a reasonable chance of being diverted into the right course.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make I shall state briefly because I do not wish to delay the Minister.  It is in connection with the over-all educational picture. Many of us are not happy about it at all.  While this is a very good provision it is only patching a leaky craft.  We should take a look at the whole vessel and see how it is carrying us through.  You cannot take this whole question of education piece-meal as we have been doing up to the present, having a report on this and a report on that.  Nobody has been set the task of looking at the whole problem and of reporting on it.  That is what is needed.</P>
    <P>We must consider seriously raising the school leaving age and ensuring that no child is deprived of further education through lack of means. Those two things are the <i>sine qua non</i> for any advance in education.  It is a significant thing that the recent report of the European Economic Community showed that the only country in it which had a surplus of labour was Italy.  It is significant from this point of view, that it carries the greatest number of illiterates of all the people concerned.  It has about two million illiterates.  There is a surplus of labour there and there is a <Col N="1432" /> surplus of labour here.  We have been cheaply supplying the British labour market whereas John Bull ensures that his children will not leave school until they are 15.  In Scotland they do not leave until they are 16 and in Northern Ireland until they are 15. Here they leave at the age of 14.</P>
    <P>If we are to face up to the conditions within the developing economic scene we must ensure that child for child our children will be on the same educational footing as the British child, the French child or the Danish child.  Patching the craft is not sufficient. A good over-all look at the situation is what is needed because we are involved in spending money and we should ensure it is spent to the best advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel a little disconnected having listened to so many views.  I started off with a Bill which is intended to provide some more money for vocational education committees but certain matters have been raised about which I should perhaps say something. One of them is in connection with taking a look at the whole craft, this leaky barge which has floated for so long.  I should like to assure the Seanad that I am taking a look at the total system of education.  I am very conscious, as I am sure is anybody who is familiar with the system, that through natural growth it is a very peculiar system, and when I say &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; I mean peculiar to Ireland, in that the different parts of it have grown up separately through our history.</P>
      <P>At this time I am very earnestly aiming at a post-primary system of education which will be available to every child who can benefit from it. It is one thing to plan something and another thing to achieve it but the Government, as an earnest of their intention, have brought about a scholarship scheme which ensures that 5,000 to 6,000 extra scholarships will be available to children who have the capacity to benefit by this post-primary education.  The same Act also provides for about 500 extra university scholarships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said that was just a <Col N="1433" /> beginning of the implementation of Government policy to see that every child who could benefit by it would have this opportunity to go the whole way up the educational ladder and would not be stopped from so doing by lack of means.  Secondary education is not available to all children in any country in Europe but post-primary education is a possibility; again it might not be demanded by everybody.</P>
    <P>The school leaving age here is 14. In Great Britain and Northern Ireland it is 16; I think in some of the landgraves in Germany it is 15 but not in the other landgraves.  In very few countries in Europe is the school leaving age anything more than ours; it is 15.  The attendance at school of children over 14 years, say, in the 14-16 age group, is very high.  Two-thirds of our children in that age group are in full-time attendance at school and this figure is higher than in those countries with a 15 year old statutory leaving age.  I mention these facts because sometimes we may be discouraged by hearing how badly off we are.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Senator meant to cause a misunderstanding when he said there is a surplus of labour in Italy which is related to a high illiteracy rate there and that there is a surplus of labour here.  If we were to take that in a logical way it would convey there was a high illiteracy rate in Ireland.  That is not true.  We have, as Senators have said, a very high standard of teachers and teaching in the country.</P>
    <P>The overlapping of the functions of the technical schools and the universities is a problem which I have left for the present to the deliberations of the Commission on Higher Education and I expect they will make recommendations to me on that.  I do not think it would be proper for me to deal with it here now while they are considering the matter.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senators who state that one of our real needs at the moment is for technicians.  As regards the question of so few people taking technician courses, if I were to go into <Col N="1434" /> it&mdash;I have not the book with me&mdash;I think it would show them to be full-time technician courses in an older age group.  The real purpose of the vocational schools is to give continuation education, not just to supply technicians. In other countries the technical schools are absolutely limited to supplying technical education but here our vocational schools are doing a very good job in supplying continuation education and as well as that when it comes to examining the value you are getting for your money from the vocational committees you must remember that apart from the continuation education, technical education and adult education courses, very useful services have been made available to the rural community in particular through the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>There is an explanation for the funds but it gets so complicated that sometimes you wish you had a blackboard when you are trying to explain it to any group.  The first part of the rate raised for vocational education is called the minimum annual liability of the county and in most counties, in all indeed except Cork, it is a penny three farthings.  That was there when the 1930 Act was enacted.  Above that the State gives usually £1 for each £1 collected by the county from the rates. If the county therefore collected £50,000 the State would give £50,000. The idea is to give a fund to the vocational education committee out of which it can provide adequate vocational educational services.</P>
    <P>There are some schemes&mdash;not counties&mdash;quite incapable of doing this on a £1 for £1 basis.  One is Cork city which is a very limited area and a very big scheme.  Others like Tralee are smaller.  These cannot, on their own rate, raise the money to give a scheme.  Those are getting £4 for £1. Certain counties are not able on a £1 for £1 basis to get the money for schemes because they were regarded as being in some way poor or others had a Gaeltacht area and one at least had a special scheme which warranted extra expenditure by the State.  They got a ratio of £2 to £1, some all the way up above the minimum annual liability and some on a part of their <Col N="1435" /> own contribution.  Apart from this contribution by the State in ratio to what is raised by the local rating authority, the central fund can also give special grants to certain committees and this has been done in several of the counties because many counties have already gone up to the maximum permitted by law which they can collect from the rates but could not continue without help.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann considers that a dynamic farm apprentice Scheme is urgently required.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for the opportunity for presenting to the Seanad tonight the results of many years of study and discussion on this particular topic.  I hope I shall be able to show that this is one of the vital concerns at the moment in preparing for the Common Market, that is, the ensuring that in future our agriculture will be developed at its maximum potential.</P>
      <P>I have to begin by taking some figures.  Take the figures given in <i>Economic Statistics</i> as issued by the Central Statistics Office each year.  I am quoting from the 1962 figures. We find at page 23, table 7, the record of the number of males engaged in farm work as counted on 1st June each year.  We find that in the ten year period covered in the most recent issue, from 1951 to 1961, the total has dropped from 452,000 to 380,000&mdash;a drop of 72,000 in ten years.  That is an alarming drop&mdash;72,000, or 7,000 per annum.  Recent figures show that the rate is still substantially the same as that; taking the average from 1954 to 1961 we get an average of 6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> We may not be over-alarmed at this figure because we are told the numbers on the land are dropping everywhere, that we are no exception, that there is this flight from the land in progress all over Europe and America.  We are going down at the rate of 6,000 per annum.  At present the figure is at 380,000 and we are not unduly worried at that figure because we feel we will go down and would it not be all for the better if we levelled out at 300,000 fully occupied and profitably employed workers on the land, than our present position? The alarming fact that I want to establish at the outset is that at present we are drifting, not to a population of 300,000 on the land but to a population of, at most, 150,000&mdash;a little over 40 per cent. of our present total.</P>
    <P>How can I make that conclusion from the figures?  It is very simple. We find that the numbers have been going down at the rate of 6,000 per annum.  The number of deaths in the farming community, taking national averages, is somewhere in the region of 9,000 to 9,500&mdash;the average for such a group.  The statistics show that about 6,000 young boys go to work on the land each year, whether as farmers' sons who stay at home or as young boys going to work on the farms.  The statistics show a total of about 20,000 of the 14 to 18 age group, which gives a rough estimate of about 6,000 intake but, when you put an intake of 6,000 against the drop of 6,000 it means that, of the 6,000 who enter, at least 3,000 leave the land before they reach their early twenties and it means that only 3,000 or, at most, 3,500 remain behind to provide the farmers of the future.  This has not started last year or the year before.  It has been continuous every since the end of the war, 1945, when emigration resumed with full force.</P>
    <P>A permanent intake of 3,000 or 3,500&mdash;what does that mean?  You may estimate the average working life of the young boy entering at 15, allowing for deaths, somewhere under 50 years.  If they all survived to 55 from 15 there would be a span of 50 years but it is something less than that due to deaths, probably somewhere in <Col N="1439" /> the order of 43 to 45 years.  If you find the total then, 3,000 to 3,500, for a working life of 43 to 45 years, you come out with the alarming figure of 150,000.  That is the figure we have been aiming at ever since the war as an equilibrium figure, or whatever you wish, but it is there we are aiming at.</P>
    <P>I should dearly like to see figures provided by one of the social surveys to give us some idea of the number of young men in the 30 to 35 age group and in the 25 to 30 age group that are on the land today.  I am satisfied, from my figures and my study, that you will find there are not more than 3,000 to 3,500 in each of these groups. That is the alarming prospect that is ahead of us unless we take some steps to alter the drift and to get greater numbers of young boys to go on the land and at the same time provide means of keeping those young men on the land.</P>
    <P>When I speak on this subject, I speak very much from practical experience, as one who has experience of farming conditions in the Golden Vale and in the Macroom area of County Cork.  I have talked with farmers in many other areas.  I know the picture is as I am giving it here. We do not need figures to prove it. We know that of the young lads who stay at home for a year or two or who go out to work with farmers for a couple of years until they are ready to go to England, it is conservative to say that 50 per cent. leave the land before they reach the age of 25.</P>
    <P>I had a case in point recently on a farm with which I was well acquainted. A young lad of 18, after spending four years on it and at a time when he was earning the equivalent of £7 a week, last August, simply got attracted by the nice dress and the free money that some of the parish boys who came home from London on holidays had to show, hoisted his sails and left.  That is the general position.  There is where we are drifting.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the drift is that by European standards we have far too few people on the land.  Figures show that we have on the average <Col N="1440" /> 35 workers per 1,000 acres, on the land.  The next to us is France, where there are 50 per 1,000.  Denmark has 70 per 1,000 acres and Western Germany has 120 per 1,000 acres. Seeing that we have too few people to get from the land of Ireland the wealth that we know is in that land, it means that, far from intensifying our agriculture in the future, we will be forced by the very scarcity of numbers to become more and more intensive, in other words to degenerate into the beef ranch of Europe.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are facing the Common Market.  We know a little about some of the problems that are there in agriculture.  We know the position that the Common Market would like us to occupy in the Europe of the future; they would like us to be the beef ranch of Europe, for two reasons.  First, beef is a commodity that will be in increasingly short supply in Europe.  It is something they need. But you need extensive acres to produce it at present prices.  Secondly, they do not look with favour on Ireland coming in and using her present acres devoted to dairying efficiently, thereby almost doubling the production or, as many of us as would hope, increasing further the amount of our land devoted to dairying.  They do not want that because it will cut across their overall plan for Europe, their plan for trying to provide for the small producers in Europe and keep the markets for them.</P>
    <P>Remember, the Common Market is committed to maintaining the family farm, to trying to provide for those on the land a standard of living comparable to that in the cities.  To do that in Europe it is recognised that they will, first, have to reduce considerably the numbers employed in agriculture in Europe and, secondly, they will have to intensify their production and keep the intensive lands as the means of raising the income of the small farmers.  We cut across both of those and, in four or five years' time, if we are in the position we are in now, with our numbers continuing to go down and down, having taken no steps, or having been unsuccessful in improving our intake both in quality and in <Col N="1441" /> numbers of young men to man agriculture for the future, we will have no option but to accept the position of being the beef ranch of Europe.</P>
    <P>At first look that position may not appear to be too bad because it is to be expected that beef prices will rise considerably and present total output from agriculture might be maintained even though a considerable portion of land shifted from dairying to beef.  Our problem is, however, that there is a very painful transition ahead into the Common Market.  I think that is recognised by everyone.  We hope that the benefits will outweigh the disadvantages, but the transition will be painful, painful especially for our industry that has been so protected. Consequently, in the change over, the country will be more and more dependent on the agricultural arm to survive the shock.  Consequently, we will be looking for more from that arm.  The picture I am painting suggests that that arm will not be able to give the necessary assistance unless something is done to help it.</P>
    <P>In this setting of Europe we have got to look and think of ourselves in relation to Europe.  By European standards we are a nation of ranchers. Our average acreage is 43 to 44 acres. The average acreage in Western Germany is 12.  The average in Belgium is 17.  The average in Holland is 25.  In Denmark it is 38. In Western Europe England alone surpasses us with an acreage of 70.  Not alone that but the problem of fragmentation in Europe is far worse than our problem.  A man may have 20 acres in Europe.  It may be divided up into six or eight lots widely separated from one another.  They have a considerable problem there in regard to consolidation.  It all adds up to the fact that Europe, in their plan for Europe, would like us to get away as far as possible from dairying and get into beef production.  That is what is being forced on us by scarcity of numbers to-day.  I speak, knowing many dairy farmers in Limerick, and elsewhere, who just cannot get the skilled help necessary to enable them to carry on their work.</P>
    <P>The choice facing us then must be <Col N="1442" /> that, despite their advancing years, many of these farmers in their fifties and early sixties will have to struggle on with a seven day a week job, milking the cow, or they will have to take the easy way out and produce beef, produce it scientifically admittedly and, under Common Market conditions, get a reasonable living from it.  That is, provided they are able to do that.  What alternative will they have?  The alternative that faces them at the moment is not an alternative. It is impossible to cope with dairying unless adequate skilled help is provided.  When we do get into the Common Market, and when there is that upsurge in prices and so on, that upsurge will mean that a farmer, even though he may change through lack of labour, or because of advancing years, from dairying to beef, will find himself with the same total income. One cannot blame such a man if he takes that way out.  If there is not sufficient skilled help available to share the responsibility with him we cannot expect him to take any other course. If skilled labour is available that skilled help will have to be very highly paid.  Our only worry about the future is will the differential between dairying and beef be sufficient to pay that skilled help and leave sufficient incentive to induce the farmer to go in for the more intensive and more demanding task?</P>
    <P>That is the position as I see it.  At the moment we might say that 30 per cent. of our land is devoted to dairying, some 3,500,500 to 4,000,000 acres.  If half that shifted to beef production under Common Market conditions one might expect a differential of £20 to £25 per acre gross between the two, dairying and beef.  That would involve, in other words, a loss to the nation annually of £40,000,000 to £50,000,000 in output.  That is a type of output that requires little or no imports.  It is one with a very high labour content. It is something we would dearly love to have in the days ahead.  That means that we are faced with the task of increasing considerably the number who enter agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have shown that 6,000 a year is not sufficient even if they all stay, <Col N="1443" /> because 6,000, on an average life span, would still amount to only 275,000, 100,000 below our present figure. What would be the cost to the Government and the country of finding alternative employment for 100,000 people.  If we reduce the present figure of 380,000 by a further 100,000, that is the figure we have to keep in mind at all stages.  It means getting more on the land.  What is available?  We have roughly 30,000 young boys in the 14 years age group each year and of those about 12,000 are from the country.  They are either farmers' sons or they live in the country, and a very high proportion might be expected to be attracted to work on the land if sufficient opportunities are provided.</P>
    <P>It would be a bit optimistic to hope that two-thirds of them, 8,000, would be attracted and I think we should try and aim at attracting some from the city as well.  In modern agriculture there is no reason why city youngsters should not find it as rewarding and as interesting as country youngsters find it.  We need at least an input of 10,000 per annum to allow for a wastage of 20 per cent. which would be considerably lower than the present wastage.  That would mean an input of about 8,000 to maintain the present numbers or slightly less.  We must aim at some figure like that.</P>
    <P>The real crisis is that it is not much use planning to achieve that in ten years' time.  We need to achieve it before we get into the Common Market, or at least before that Market becomes finalised.  It would be one of the strongest possible bargaining points available to us as to why we should get our fair share of the dairy produce market and not be pushed back, as the agricultural planners of the Common Market would like to see us, and going more and more into beef production.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to attract young men to the land.  We have to plan to keep them there.  It can be said that at present up to the age of 20 or 21 years a young boy can earn as much on the land&mdash;in fact he can earn more &mdash;as he can earn in any of the usual <Col N="1444" /> run of industrial employment where he has to serve an apprenticeship of some three or four years and build up from there.</P>
    <P>At present it is quite common for young boys at the age of 17 or 18 years to have the equivalent of £7 a week on the land, or £4 10 and their keep.  There are very few industries here in which a young boy of 18 can command £7 a week.  The unfortunate thing about agriculture is that a boy can earn almost as much at 18 years as he can earn at 28 years.  That is where the frustration sets in, so we have to provide some incentive for the future.  We have to provide him with a ladder that will give him hope, and the only ladder that will appeal to a young lad is the possibility of one day becoming an owner himself. There must be an opportunity of ownership and that is where the whole idea of farm apprenticeship comes in as a means of creating a ladder to ownership.</P>
    <P>We must be almost unique in the world to-day in the difficulties that are in the way of a young man without capital trying to get some acres of land to farm for himself.  In other countries like Denmark, Holland and America, a young man who has proved himself a good prospect as a future farmer, and has the ability to farm, can get hold of the necessary finances to put him on the land, or he can succeed in renting land.  We did so thorough a job in getting rid of the landlords that we have lost what they have in England and other countries as an avenue to ownership for a young man without very much capital or for renting a farm from a landlord or some agency.</P>
    <P>The landlord will be primarily interested in whether the young man is a good prospect for getting the most out of the land.  If a landlord wants to &lsquo;maximise&rsquo; his own profits from the land he can do that only by having the most efficient man he can get to work his land and operate it on a rented basis.  No one would suggest that we should return to landlordism here but we must fill the gap that has been left.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten or 12 years a great deal has been done by farming <Col N="1445" /> organisations and other groups.  In 1950, the Muintir na Tíre Congress in Sligo devoted a good bit of time to this topic.  I had the pleasure of being there and I read one of the papers on the subject.  We continued to work at it until 1955.  In the meantime Macra na Feirme had set up a committee to work on it.  We had got quite a distance and we felt that we had reached the position where we could get a major push forward.  <i>Tuairim</i> offered us their good offices and a most refreshing week-end was held in Killiney in 1956.  Everyone was enthusiastic about the job and the Minister for Lands, Deputy Childers, was perhaps the most enthusiastic man present.</P>
    <P>We all felt that, at least, a breakthrough had been made and that shortly we would have a worthwhile farm apprenticeship scheme on the way, but the years have passed and Deputy Childers' enthusiasm has not availed him in convincing his Cabinet colleagues about the necessity for this scheme.  I know many of the members of those associations and I know the intense frustration they felt at the way their efforts were being side-tracked and pigeon-holed.  Now the whole scheme has gone.  The Government have refused to provide any land for landless men on the plea&mdash;perhaps reasonable in many respects&mdash;that the congested districts are the first charge on any land available.  Still, it is so urgent that a certain amount should be made available.  After all, we are making available many thousands of acres each year for sale to foreigners which, if made available for a farm apprenticeship scheme would go some way towards giving the scheme the push forward it needs.</P>
    <P>Apparently at the moment the only Government help that can be got for this scheme is that there is some prospect of offering 20 scholarships a year valued at £500 each, a total of £10,000 per annum, to young men who have served an apprenticeship of four years on selected farms, and have other high educational attainments, including a year at an agricultural college and other qualifications.  Although that has not been given yet it would be <Col N="1446" /> very inadequate and would be regarded as only trifling with the subject.  If the picture is as I have painted it, this scheme would make the difference between the country degenerating into a beef ranch for Europe or keeping the present amount of land under the dairy industry or extending it.  Then I think a hundred times £10,000, £1,000,000, would still be inadequate for the task ahead.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to treat these figures seriously.  There is nobody here who wants to see the farming community reduced to 150,000 people. We may refer to equilibrium and shrug our shoulders at the present yearly decline and take comfort in the fact that this is happening all over the world but the fact remains we are aiming at a target of 150,000 people on the land of Ireland and I submit that if we reach that day there will be very few of the Irish race left.</P>
    <P>In regard to apprenticeship, I have asked the Seanad to consider that a dynamic farm apprenticeship scheme is urgently required.  I think I have given sufficient evidence of the urgency of this but we want to see what is meant by this scheme that is required, this farm apprenticeship system.  It would have many component parts. First, you must get the young lad on the land at 14, 15, or whatever age at which they enter it.  Then you would have to provide educational training for them between that age and their early twenties, preferably through a system of night classes.  Seeing that we have already in a Bill increased considerably the amount of money available to vocational education it should not be impossible to get vocational education to carry its fair share of the burden of providing this additional agricultural education for our young men.</P>
    <P>The task here is an educational and a social one because while it should be possible to design a full-time course that perhaps in two years would give sufficient training to a young lad of 16, our aim should be to spread that over the formative period right up to about 21.  That would create a sense of comradeship and a sense of purpose in the young boys as they mature in that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> As well as that there is the question of apprenticeship on the farms.  By and large if the apprenticeship scheme is to be of sufficient scope to meet the problem involved it will be impossible to enforce any real standards of apprenticeship; in other words we shall have to take it that all farmers who want help are suitable in the first instance.  The mind boggles at the thought of an inspection system and a grading system that would sort out the farmers into grade A, grade B and grade C masters for the training of apprentices.  As well as that, we must make sure that the very idea of apprenticeship is not seized on by farmers as an excuse for reducing the wages of these young lads, because while the farmer will undoubtedly be giving something of value to those boys in the training he gives them, they in turn will be giving the full physical labour output that a young lad of that age is giving today.  Consequently the farmer should be proud to assist in the training of a young man rather than seek in that way to profit by reducing the wages paid to the apprentice.</P>
    <P>The young lad goes to a technical school and has acquired some sort of training.  He may have attended some short courses at an agricultural school. Then the sifting process begins, not in a very severe way, but it will sift to a certain extent.  As well as that we have to think of the future.  A number of these young men for whom we are planning should be able to farm in their own right.  Consequently, they will need money.  The farm apprenticeship scheme should be interwoven with a national credit scheme that will attract the savings of these young boys who could save an agreed minimum amount.  In that way we achieve a double purpose.  There is the national purpose of making more savings available.  Nobody will deny that a young boy of 16 or 17 who has £4 or £5 in his pocket besides his keep can save £1 or maybe £2 a week from that. He can do it especially if his nights are provided for in rather inexpensive ways like a couple of nights at the technical school.  At the age of 21 a <Col N="1448" /> type of natural selection should be achieved so that 50 per cent., 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of those who entered the scheme would eventually have a training and a sense of responsibility that is very rare today.  It certainly is marked by its absence in the circles of labour that is available on the land.  When these lads would come to the age of 21 the amount they could earn on the land would be quite high and in fact it would be found that their rates of pay would be more than comparable with rates in industrial occupations especially if they are the means by which a man can intensify and also share in the general increase in prosperity due to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We would have this and finally when you got to the age of 28 or 30, the stage at which farms would be necessary, they would have graduated to being chief helpers on large farms for which they would get a very considerable salary.  Then comes the question of land and that could be left largely to the private enterprise of the local credit union.  The amount to be advanced to any young man who had passed all the obstacles on the way would depend on the amount he had saved and then perhaps there might be some Government help after that to enable him to buy a place.</P>
    <P>The size of the place he should buy is totally immaterial.  If at the age of 28, having a certain amount saved and being able to call on a certain amount of credit, a young man finds that he can buy 30 or 40 acres and he is not satisfied to work that&mdash;all right, he is a free agent.  He can go back and continue working&mdash;at that stage I presume that he is the equivalent of a farm manager&mdash;for another five years until he has accumulated more capital and more credit to buy a larger place. If he goes on until he is 60, he will be able to buy a couple of hundred acres.  In other words we must give maximum flexibility to any such scheme.  I am glad in a sense that some of the earlier schemes advocated by Macra were not accepted in their entirety.</P>

      <P>They envisaged a measure of Government buying and allotment almost impossible to administer and very bad for the general morale of the people concerned.</P>
      <P>We have reached the crossroads now.  Let us not worry about where the land will come from.  The point is that we have not the young men at present that need land.  Even if an increase on the basis I have suggested were initiated in the morning it would be 15 years before we would feel the first pressure for land due to that. The pressure would of course increase in subsequent years but the structure of our farming population at the moment where one-third are over 65 years of age shows that it is not a question of finding farms in 15 years' time but a question of finding men for the farms.  With the present structure we cannot hope to man the present number of acres unless there is very great putting together of holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the Seanad very long on this.  I have put the essential facts before you and I would feel very happy if anybody could convince me that the situation is not as grave as I think it is.  Its gravity to my mind is very much accentuated by the nearness of the Common Market. We might say that our young people are our nation's greatest asset.  Rural youth and the rural community has stability and can give a contribution to the national life.  It is a national asset that is prized everywhere and rightly prized in the Common Market itself.  It has been prized by sociologists and social teachers down through the ages and I think we have reached a stage where we cannot afford any further reduction.  Above all we should combat loose talk and the idea of being a nation of small farmers.  We are not a nation of small farmers in the group which we are joining.  We should combat any thought of taking refuge in general statistics as an excuse for doing nothing. To say &ldquo;it is happening everywhere&rdquo; is no excuse, or to say &ldquo;we cannot go against the tide&rdquo;.  If we do not go against the tide we know the fate which awaits us in the Common <Col N="1450" /> Market&mdash;becoming the beef ranch of Europe, which is something none of us wants.</P>
    <P>I could quote statements on the necessity for spirit by some of our great leaders down through the years like Sir Horace Plunkett, Canon Hayes, the late Father Coyne and others.  At all times they have stressed the fact that the contribution of the rural community cannot be weighed up in mere economic terms alone just as a scheme like a farm apprenticeship scheme cannot be approached on economic lines alone.  It has to be from the start fearlessly idealistic.  It cannot be just a second rate scheme for those who cannot get land &mdash; in other words, something that introduces an element of class distinction right from the beginning, because we cannot afford class distinction.  Whatever system of training is available should be a system which appeals to the young man staying at home who is sure of a place inherited from his father or to a second son who feels that his father may be able to do something for him or to the son of a rural worker who wants to work on the land.  That means that all must share in the common aim of training themselves to become the future farmers of Ireland and they must do it in harmony together.  Also any savings&mdash;and we know that credit is the life blood of any scheme&mdash;must be contributed by all on the land, by the farmer's son at home and by the second son.  At least the incentive must be there to get the contribution from them so that when their turn comes to inherit the farm they have saved a certain amount on which they can draw or they have earned credit for themselves in a general credit movement.</P>
    <P>I can quote one of the greatest Irishmen of all time, Canon Hayes, who did so much to uplift the rural community, in his broadcast of July 5th, 1945.  This was a time when he was ploughing a lonely furrow with one of the few organisations available in rural Ireland.  Even then it was in its infancy for it was just seven years after the first rural week Canon Hayes said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> We realised that the land problem (flight from the land, lack of production, etc.) was not merely economic; the merely economic solves no problem.  It is more than economic.  It was the whole life of the people that needed stimulus.  This should come from the people themselves with a true appreciation of their vocation... The parish is the next step from the home in a Christian order.  We want it to be as Christian as the home.  This is the real work.</P>
    <P>Again we find that Sir Horace Plunkett stressed the same note in his book <i>Ireland in the New Century</i> written over 50 years ago in 1905:</P>
    <P>It is undeniable that the pride in country justly felt by Englishmen, a pride developed by education and a knowledge of their history, has had much to do with the industrial preeminence of England; for the pioneers of its commerce have been often actuated as much by patriotic motives as by the desire for gain. The education of the Irish people has ignored the need for any such historical basis for pride or love of country and, for my part, I feel sure that the Gaelic League is acting wisely in seeking to arouse such a sentiment and found it mainly upon the ages of Ireland's story, when Ireland was most Irish.</P>
    <P>We have advanced somewhat since 1905 and we have made up some of the difficiencies but after that time we still have a long road to go.  The late Father E.J. Coyne, S.J., speaking to a Rural Week in 1941, said:</P>
    <P>We are not in this for what we can gain or get out of it, but for what we can give and grant to others and to the parish as a whole. Each member, if he is guided by the principle and moved by the spirit of Muintir na Tire, is concerned with the welfare of the whole parish and as much concerned with the welfare of his fellow-parishioner as with his own.</P>
    <P>These were some of the words of our leaders of the past, men who contributed so much to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> Perhaps, in conclusion, I might quote the words of the late Holy Father, Pope Pius XII, in his address to the Italian Farmers' Federation, on the occasion of their National Congress in Rome, on 5th November, 1956:</P>
    <P>Accordingly every care should be taken to preserve for the nation the essential elements of what may be termed genuine rural civilisation. These are: love of work, simplicity and uprightness of life, respect for authority especially of parents, love of country and fidelity to traditions that have proved fruitful for good down the centuries; readiness to give mutual help not only to members of the same family but also on the part of neighbouring families and homes...</P>
    <P>I put down the motion just to get the facts before the Seanad and before the Minister in the hope that they may think on these matters and that perhaps it might be possible to get a voluntary Seanad committee to work on this problem because, as I said, none of us wants to contribute to reducing the population of the land from 380,000 to 150,000 and, no matter how enthusiastic we may be about the Common Market and about the glorious future that exists for Western Europe within the framework of the European Economic Community, none of us is prepared to accept the price that this country should be degenerated into the beef ranch of Europe.</P>

      <P>In seconding the motion, that Seanad Éireann considers that a dynamic farm apprenticeship system is urgently required, I should like first to congratulate Senator Professor Quinlan on the way in which he has presented his proposals to the House.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I wish to say that the need for a farm apprenticeship system is obvious from any analysis of the rural problem.  It may not dissipate the atmosphere of frustration and discontent which is a potent cause of rural migration but it will help at least to some extent to reverse that outward flow should this bold and determined system as outlined by Senator Professor Quinlan be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1453" /> The aim of a farm apprenticeship scheme is to give practical and theoretical training in farming to young men with the object of enabling them to put this training into practice either by farming in their own right or in allied agricultural pursuits.  Such a system as proposed and outlined by Senator Professor Quinlan, if adopted, should, in my view, provide facilities for young farmers' sons who can produce a degree or certificate of efficiency from approved farmers who participate in such an apprenticeship course.  I believe these young men should have farms leased to them by the Irish Land Commission and thus be enabled to earn their living at home in the profession they were born into and in the profession they were reared up in, and not be forced to emigrate in order to earn a living.</P>
    <P>Provision should also be made for the younger sons of farmers having a degree or a diploma or certificate of efficiency from approved farmers. Younger sons who have sufficient capital, by way of their share of the home-place, to stock and work farms but who have not got the necessary capital to purchase farms should get priority from the Irish Land Commission when they come to allocate farms or, at least, they should have an opportunity of leasing farms with an option, if their tenure should prove satisfactory, of purchasing those farms at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor Quinlan has dealt in great detail and at great length with this entire question.  It is long overdue that the Government should give more than serious consideration to it.  The fact that rural Ireland is being depopulated, that farms are being robbed of their manpower, should appal us; it is an alarming situation.  Great publicity is given to the fact that the Irish Sugar Company are now endeavouring to get the tillage farmers to embark on a system of horticultural husbandry.  As the House is aware, that would require a tremendous amount of manpower. If that industry is to survive and to thrive and if it is to play the part it is hoped it will play in the coming years, it is now more important <Col N="1454" /> than ever that we should have a sufficient labour force on the land.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the system so carefully and painstakingly devised and outlined by Senator Professor Quinlan is accorded the consideration that it deserves.  I formally second the motion.</P>

      <P>This resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann considers that a dynamic farm apprenticeship system is urgently required.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the resolution is not sufficient.  By the speeches of the proposer and seconder, it is indicated now that they require the Government to do this.  I would suggest that the resolution should have read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>...and that we, the members of Seanad Éireann, consider that the National Farmers' Association should immediately investigate a scheme of initiating such a system.</P>
      <P>Let me say immediately that I am not against the National Farmers' Association.  I think they are a magnificent organisation, if they did not constantly criticise the Government and constantly want the Government to do something for them.  A National Farmers' Organisation is a tremendous organisation in any country and especially in this country.  It is, I understand, a tremendous organisation in Cork but I do not agree with Senator Quinlan coming in here and putting down this motion, criticising us because we did not give time for its discussion, and finally making a long speech in the course of which he evaded the issue entirely.  I congratulate the Senator on the immense research work he did.  He told us thousands of people are leaving the land, and so on.</P>
      <P>He dealt with farm apprenticeship. He started in 1950 proceeded to 1955, went on to 1956, praised Deputy Childers for being enthusiastic, and then referred to the Government pigeon-holing the recommendations. Subsequently he said he was glad the Government had not accepted the recommendations of Macra na Feirme.</P>

The Government, the National Farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme, and Muintir na Tíre, all of us, must try as far as in us lies to make the people on the land happy. I do not accept Senator Quinlan's argument that a system of farm apprenticeship is ultimately required, but he does not want the National Farmers' Association to indicate the (a) (b) and (c) of the system.  I think it is the duty of that Association to formulate the basis of such a scheme.  The Senator cannot ask the Government to direct that such-and-such a person must be apprenticed on such-and-such a farm because it is grade A and another to some other farm because it is only grade B.  I suggest that it is the National Farmers' Association that should do that in co-operation with the other and ancillary organisations.</P>

      <P>How can the Government provide the money and take no responsibility?  We would have the Senator in here in no time criticising the Government for doing such a thing.  A system of apprenticeship would be a grand system if it were organised by the National Farmers' Association in co-operation with the other interested bodies.  I do not agree that the Government should draw up a system and present it to the National Farmers' Association.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Senator and the seconder of the motion introduced a side issue, the question of the Land Commission providing a special farm for a special candidate.  There would be endless trouble immediately.  I believe a scheme of apprenticeship properly organised and not dependent on State moneys would produce results.  I believe such a scheme would be of great benefit, particularly from the point of view of rehabilitating the land.  There are others on the land who want rehabilitation and there might not be room for many of them. I think the presentation of the motion here tonight deserves criticism.</P>

The three people who have spoken, the proposer, the seconder and Senator Ó Donnabháin, all seem to be in agreement that the resolution is a good one, but they seem to differ on the manner of implementing it.</P>
      <P>I did not understand Senator Quinlan to suggest that the Government should take over the scheme and operate it.  I understood him to say that the Government should give a lead.  Senator Ó Donnabháin seems to think the National Farmers' Association should take it over completely and run it.  At any rate, the fact that this motion appeared on the Order Paper and has been discussed will ventilate it and perhaps something good will come of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Farmers' Association <Col N="1458" /> have been extremely busy for the past couple of years and perhaps they will now get an opportunity of doing something about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan gave a lot of statistics to prove that there is a flight from the land.  I am not an authority on statistics but I think it is apparent to anyone, even if he has not got a book on statistics, that there is a flight from the land.  The House will know that when a job is advertised for the position of lorry driver for a county council or porter in a hospital, several farmers' sons apply for it.  Some will be the only remaining sons left on the land but they are prepared to abandon the land and take a job as a porter in a hospital or a lorry driver, instead of working on their farms on which they were reared.  I think that is an unhealthy sign.</P>
    <P>The real reason I rise is to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for more technical instruction for farmers.  After all this farm apprenticeship scheme is a form of technical instruction.  Most of us attended the picture on the Common Market this morning in the Savoy Cinema.</P>

      <P>At any rate, it was a short picture and the one sentence that stuck in my mind was a sentence in the commentary which stated that the people in the various countries in the Common Market are specialising in the subjects about which they know most.  That suggested to me that we will either stand or fall as a member of the Common Market as an agricultural nation.  If we are a success agriculturally we will be a success in the Common Market, and we will hold our own against our competitors.  If <Col N="1459" /> we are not, we will be washed out.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that these last two years should be availed of to step up instruction for the agricultural community in the art of farming.</P>
      <P>There are vocational schools, secondary schools, technical schools, studded all over the country&mdash;and that is very good; the more we have the better&mdash;but it is a sad reflection on our approach to agriculture that our agricultural schools can be counted on the fingers of one hand&mdash;or certainly on the fingers of two hands.  It may be said that the committees of agriculture are discharging the duties of instructing the farming community, but with all due respect to those bodies I do not think they are, and I do not think they have been a success.</P>
      <P>I understand that away back in the years gone by agriculture and technical education were both under the same Department.  They parted, and the vocational education section under the Department of Education has gone from success to success.  I am afraid the agricultural instruction division under the Department of Agriculture has remained static.  Now is the opportunity to improve that position and the country will be agreeable to spend money in view of our impending entry into the Common Market as an agricultural nation.  The taxpayers and the ratepayers will agree to spend money to prepare the country for entry to the Common Market as an agricultural nation.</P>

      <P>I do not know if members of the Seanad&mdash;I was going to say if they could tell me when this motion was put down on the Order Paper by Senator Quinlan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is apparently aware that since that motion was placed on the Order Paper agreement has been reached as between the organisations interested&mdash;the organisations which concerned themselves back <Col N="1460" /> as far as 1957 with the provision of a farm apprenticeship scheme&mdash;and that since some time in July when the Press announcement was made by the National Farmers' Association that agreement had been reached on a farm apprenticeship scheme it rests with those bodies to implement it.</P>
      <P>I should like to cover a lot of the ground that was covered by Senator Quinlan.  In the knowledge of this approved scheme on the part of those concerned he still persisted in moving this motion.  As well as that he covered a very interesting field that had very little to do with the motion itself or its purpose: the flight from the land; the depopulation of the countryside; the desirability of encouraging some 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000 young boys each year to remain on the land; the desirability of milk production as against beef production.  I cannot remember all the flights the Senator took, any one of which would take a considerable time to analyse. I have explained that a scheme has been approved.  Of course each and every one of such schemes must be experimental.  They will be found to contain weaknesses in operation and if they are reasonably successful these objections can be dealt with at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nobody denying the importance of agricultural education but I would not dream of admitting that any apprenticeship scheme that is designed could possibly be as useful to the numbers of people who are concerned in this matter as, say, the agricultural night classes conducted in the different counties, the classes that have been promoted by the county committees of agriculture and the vocational education committees.  Then there are as well the agricultural colleges.  I should like to remind Senator Fitzpatrick that while we all agree as to the importance of education for these boys who are intended by their parents to remain to work on the land, he will find in his own county of Monaghan that where an agricultural school had been established some years ago and scholarships were offered for boys who would be interested in remaining on the land, they were not <Col N="1461" /> taken up.  It is also a disappointing thing that many of those young men would go into agricultural schools and colleges not for the purpose of working on the farm but to secure employment elsewhere as a result of the knowledge they obtain there.</P>
    <P>I should like briefly to refer to some of the remarks the mover of this motion has made about the depopulation of the country and the contribution that has been made by the different organisations, some of which he has mentioned, to the cause of helping rural Ireland.  There is one thing I notice and I have noticed it for years, as do thousands of farmers, that the keenest advocates of keeping people on the land are those who themselves are not on it and those who make sure that their children do not remain on it if they are on it themselves.</P>
    <P>I remember one time I went to a rural week in Virginia under the auspices of Muintir na Tíre.  I think it was about the first rural week that was held and a very good friend of mine went there just to vet the show. He was intelligent, a good worker and a good farmer and he listened to the speakers with great interest.  I met him outside and he said: &ldquo;Yes, I agree with most of what has been said there but the one thing that is not convincing about that platform is that I could not see one person on it who was himself in conflict with the problems of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we talk about depopulation and express our regrets about depopulation and when we hear speakers like the mover of the motion castigate us for making a comparison with what is taking place in other countries in this matter, you would think that those of us who are living on the land and mean to remain on it enjoy this development.  Some of those who speak so fluently on this subject are not half as devoted to this cause as those of us who look around not for the purpose of making excuses for ourselves but to derive some benefit from seeing what is happening in the world outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <P>It is not a sign of defeatism to see something happening around us and to regret it, to look outside and to see are we the only people who are showing this tendency or are the people in other lands doing likewise.  To follow up that line of approach and reasoning, I know a fair share about this country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We have to be realists in this matter.  It is the people who are realists who have some chance or some hope of getting to grips with this problem.  If it is incapable of complete solution, it is the realists who will be likely to achieve the greatest success towards the partial solution of the problem.  I am a realist when I say this to the Members of the Seanad: I look at West Cork.  I look at Kerry as I know it.  I look at my own county especially the north west end of it. I look at much of North Monaghan from which Senator Fitzpatrick comes. I see the small farms of eight, ten and 12 acres of poor, hungry land.  I see the backward location of some of these farms, the tremendous hardship in even getting to them.  I see and appreciate the cost of erecting a reasonably modern house and farm buildings on one of these little holdings.</P>
      <P>I see all these things in different parts of the country and I understand that land with its roughness, its crudeness and its lack of response.  I should like to invite those who do not live on the land but who look at it and talk as theorists and idealists&mdash;I would say much of it pretence&mdash;to give a personal demonstration of what they could do in these parts of the country, and unfortunately there is a great area in the country where the conditions are as I describe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a long speech which <Col N="1463" /> had no reference at all to this motion I was delighted to hear the mover of the motion say he was glad some of the earlier recommendations that had been made by this committee of Macra na Feirme and the N.F.A. were not accepted.  It was a very belated admission indeed.  The Senator apparently was not even sufficiently well informed to know that the State was providing 30 scholarships and not 20.</P>
    <P>We were then invited to deal with agricultural education and its ineffectiveness or otherwise.  I understand that some time ago a creamery committee&mdash;I think it is in Boherbue&mdash;in agreement with the Department of Agriculture decided to appoint an agricultural instructor to advise and encourage some 350 farmers in the district.  I heard&mdash;I do not know to what extent I am sufficiently informed &mdash;that Cork University were very much interested in that experiment, very much interested in seeing what these 350 farms and farmers were like before it started and that they made some arrangement that they would keep an eye on the scheme.  I believe that is now ten years in operation and &mdash;I may be misinformed&mdash;I believe that nobody has since heard of the outcome of that investigation on the part of the university.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Cork University have no connection with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If we want to be helpful to agriculture, to rural Ireland, if we want to give practical aid and if we take on an assignment like that which is a small matter indeed and which if it were successful could be pointed to as something which could be repeated in many other places, I would say myself that if those responsible in the university took off their coats and kept up to date they would be making a far more useful contribution; they would be doing more to help the people on the land by showing those who were not part of that investigation what could be done if it were gone about properly than by merely giving lip service to what was taking place and blaming somebody because they were making comparisons <Col N="1464" /> and giving as an excuse that these things were happening in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is typical of the approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We could have had a discussion on farm apprenticeship schemes, on the terms that have been approved, on the different proposals made prior to agreement being reached on the scheme that will be tried experimentally.  We could have examined all the proposals on the provision of farms for young men after they had served an apprenticeship.  I do not agree with that at all.  I believe that we have not the land that would enable us to do that to any extent&mdash; apart altogether from the fact that the Land Commission's activities and their legal powers are designed to enable them to enlarge existing holdings.</P>
      <P>If you were to look at the areas I have mentioned you would say that by far the most important work in which the Land Commission could become engaged for the next ten years is to follow up the announcements made following the report on the small farms of the West and elsewhere by acquiring neglected land and deserted land and by trying to reach agreement with a number of other landowners who are still in possession but who are unable because of many circumstances to operate their holdings successfully so as to secure land from them&mdash;by agreement of course&mdash;for distribution among their neighbours with smaller farms.  I see far more prospects in that sort of activity for the brightening up of the countryside and improving its appearance and apart from improvement of appearance of ensuring that it will fall into the hands of those&mdash; and we have many of them&mdash;who work their land intelligently and well.  It will fall into the hands of these people and they will, we hope, make a better job of it than those who held it before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this to be said about land: you can have an unsuccessful business man, an unsuccessful barber, an unsuccessful doctor, an unsuccessful lawyer or an unsuccessful teacher and <Col N="1465" /> nobody really feels it or notices it because there are still enough left to fill the gaps in most cases, but when you have an unsuccessful farmer everybody ultimately feels the effects of that man's inactivity.  But it is hard to see how a system can be devised where farmers, people who own the land, will all be successful.  I know there are young boys reared on farms who are excellent farmers and yet they never spent one single solitary day in an agricultural school.  Even if a boy gets the advantage &mdash; undoubtedly the tremendous advantage&mdash;of a year in an agricultural school, unless he is fundamentally designed to be a farmer all the training and teaching in the world will not make him one.  That has been my experience and I have watched them.  To those destined to be farmers it is a tremendous advantage. To those who have not the urge to work on the land and secure land for themselves it is a disadvantage.  I would have to knock down any apprenticeship scheme that provided, as the seconder of the motion said, for leasing a farm.  You would lease a farm to a boy who if he was any good would want to have a farm of his own and if he was not any good you would want to be sure of the kind of lease you would give him.  You would want a lease which would ensure that you could remove him if he failed to work it properly, if he failed to pay the rent or if he failed to pay the interest accruing on the cost of providing the holding.  If you did not have all these stipulations you could have a number of bad farmers on your hands even after all your efforts.  You do not want to listen to me any more.</P>

I was very pleased to have an opportunity of saying some of the things I have said because I have personally noticed this: mind you, farmers who attend functions and public debates may not be very vocal or talkative but they go home having made up their minds about those who have been glib and if they do not put the questions I have addressed to Senators tonight at those gatherings they feel them and in the main they are right.</P>

I think the libel made on UCC is something I will have to investigate carefully before the next day.  But this I know speaking in my capacity as a member of the governing body: it was an outright libel.  UCC had no connection with the Boherbue costings.  A couple of members of UCC in their spare time which is very little were given the usual leave by the university to contribute if they wanted.</P>
