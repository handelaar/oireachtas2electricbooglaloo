      <P>The Finance Bill this year is shorter and less complex than those of recent <Col N="536" /> years.  Most of its provisions are concerned with giving legislative effect to the Budget proposals.  The Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated with the text of the Bill explained the various sections in it as introduced in Dáil Éireann.  Three new sections concerning stamp duty were inserted during the passage of the Bill through Dáil Éireann and two sections were amended as a result of the further increase in tobacco duty.  I shall refer to these specifically later.</P>
      <P>Part I of the Bill, as is customary, is concerned with income tax.  This year there are only two sections in it. One of these imposes income tax and sur-tax for the current year at the same rates as were in force last year.  The purpose of the other section is to enable interest to be paid without deduction of income tax on any security issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>Part II deals with customs and excise duties.  Sections 3 and 4 cover the Budget increases in the duties on beer and spirits.  Section 5 confirms the Budget increase in the duty on tobacco for the period from 11th April to 9th August and it provides also that, as from 10th August, duty shall be charged at the sum of the rates imposed by the Budget Resolution and the Imposition of Duties (No. 123) (Tobacco) Order, 1962.  This Order imposes an additional duty equal to a penny on 20 cigarettes in respect of the period from 14th June to 9th August. Provision is made for its confirmation in Section 10 of the Bill and also for confirmation of another order reducing the rate of duty on used omnibuses. Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 implement the Budget proposals for certain tax reliefs, namely, in respect of entertainments duty, small customs duty charges and road tax on farmers' tractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four sections in Part III of the Bill.  Two of these&mdash;Sections 11 and 13&mdash;arise from recommendations made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  Section 11 doubles the existing rates of initial allowance in respect of capital expenditure on machinery or plant and on industrial buildings.  Section 13 is concerned with providing tax relief in respect of payments <Col N="537" /> incurred by companies in making good trading losses of a joint enterprise.  Both sections follow on recommendations made by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.</P>
    <P>As to the two remaining sections in this part of the Bill, Section 12 exempts from tax interest on any securities, in the nature of tax reserve certificates, which are issued for use in payment of income tax, sur-tax or corporation profits tax.  It is hoped to have the securities available within the current year.  Section 14 provides for the charging of interest on tax paid in arrear.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with stamp duties.  Three of the sections in this Part were inserted in the Bill on the Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann.  Two of these sections relate to the stamp duty payable in respect of conveyances, transfers or leases of land to non-nationals. Under existing law, if the relevant instrument contains a certificate that the property involved is being acquired for private residential purposes and does not include land exceeding 5 acres in extent, stamp duty is chargeable at a maximum of £3 per cent. instead of £25 per cent. Cases have come under notice in which a transaction comprising more than 5 acres has been split into two deeds of transfer, one of which transferred 5 acres and the other transferred the remainder of the property being acquired.  By the incorporation of a certificate in the first deed that the property was being acquired for private residential purposes and did not include land exceeding 5 acres, that deed attracted duty at the rate of only £3 per cent. on the consideration of that transaction.  Sections 15 and 16 of the Bill are designed to deal with this situation.  They provide for the continuance of relief from the £25 per cent. duty on acquisitions for private residential purposes of property which does not include land exceeding 5 acres but henceforward the relief will be given on the recommendation of the Land Commission and not on the strength of a certificate in the instrument of conveyance or transfer or lease.  The Land Commission, where they consider it appropriate, may withhold <Col N="538" /> their recommendation and, in this way, prevent the avoidance of duty at the £25 per cent. rate.</P>
    <P>Section 17 repeals the stamp duties payable by members of the Bar on admission as students of King's Inns and on admission as barristers-at-law and it also repeals the duty on articles of solicitors' apprentices.  Solicitors have not, since 1954, been charged with duty either on admissions as solicitors or on annual practising certificates. On the other hand, solicitors' apprentices pay duty of £14 on their articles which is paid over to the Society of King's Inns by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that it is anomalous to repeal duties payable by one branch of a profession, namely solicitors, and to continue to levy them on the other&mdash;barristers.  It is also understood that the Society of King's Inns is now agreeable to waive its right to the £14 duty on the articles of solicitors' apprentices.  The section, therefore, proposes the repeal of the two duties payable by barristers and that payable by solicitors' apprentices as from a date to be appointed by order.</P>
    <P>The remaining section in this Part of the Bill, Section 18, increases from four to eight months the operative period for the stamp duty concession granted in last year's Finance Act in respect of certain dealings in Irish stocks.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters.  Section 19 is the usual provision relating to the Capital Services Redemption Account.  Section 20 makes legislative arrangements in connection with the termination of the Local Taxation Account.  Section 21 extends for another three years the corporation profits tax exemption in favour of public utility concerns, building societies and the Agricultural Credit Corporation which expired on the 31st December, 1961.  Section 22 is intended to permit of the introduction of a tariff based on the Brussels Nomenclature and to remedy certain technical defects in the Imposition of Duties Act 1957.  Section 23 deals with two repeals; one of these is consequent <Col N="539" /> on the termination of the Local Taxation Account while the other does away with the prohibition on the sale at the same premises of both duty paid and rebated heavy hydrocarbon oil.  The two remaining sections of the Bill do not call for explanation.</P>
    <P>Those briefly are the purposes of the Finance Bill this year.  The Bill is, of course, a Committee Stage Bill and I shall be glad to explain any points of detail on that Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is pleasant to be able to begin by agreeing with the Minister that this is a shorter and less complex Finance Bill than usual.  It could be described, I think, as a rather unexciting Bill and I take it that it will have an unexciting passage.  I know that the Bill gives scope for a general discussion on our financial and economic position and on the general imposition of taxes.  I do not intend to avail myself of that opportunity today.  I merely want to raise with the House and with the Minister two suggested amendments and because I do not see any section in the Bill to which I could attach myself on the Committee Stage, I hope I shall have the permission of the Chair to ask the Minister how the matter may be dealt with later on.</P>
      <P>The Bill increases duties on beer and tobacco.  I know that these two matters raise general questions and general principles.  If I were to speak personally and selfishly I could boast that the increased duties on beer and tobacco will cost me exactly nothing.</P>
      <P>I raised two points last year on this Bill on 19th July.  I should like to raise them again and to ask the Minister whether in view of the sympathy which he expressed on the last occasion he can do anything about them now.  The first is with regard to death duties and the way in which they affect a widow with young dependent children.  I use the words &ldquo;dependent children&rdquo; in the income tax sense, that is, children under 16 or who, being over 16, are undergoing full-time educational or apprenticeship courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No provision whatever is made in <Col N="540" /> the death duties code for that kind of case.  As I pointed out to the Minister before, our general taxation provisions do make allowance specifically for wives and for children.  That is the case with regard to income tax.  They recognise the wife and family with regard to income tax and surtax but no such recognition is granted when it comes to death duties.  There is a very strong case to be made in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am taking the case of a young man, say, between 30 and 40 or 30 and 50, who is the sole breadwinner of the family and who dies, leaving a widow with, perhaps, a house and an insurance policy and something else which will bring her over the limit at which death duties are payable.  It is easy to get within that limit in modern times with, say, a house and an insurance policy.  If the limit is reached, if the estate is liable to duty, then the duty begins at the very beginning, from the first £.  I think that position is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable difference between the case of a man in that age group dying and leaving an estate after him of £8,000 or even £10,000 and the case of a man of, say, 70 whose family have been reared, who are settled in careers or in employment of one kind or another and who leaves money after him.  It is not unreasonable that that estate should be taxed but the taxation on the other kind of estate should be on a different basis.  I suggest that there should be an amendment by which, following the analogy of the ordinary income tax provisions, there would be an allowance of, say, £3,000 for the widow and £2,000 for each child under 16 and who is dependent in the sense of the income tax code. Duty could be paid on any amount over that.</P>
    <P>The Minister on the last occasion said he had considerable sympathy with the point raised, which he had not heard raised before, and that he would look into it.  Can he do anything to remedy that situation on the Committee Stage by making such allowance as I mentioned or such other allowance as he himself might suggest?  It would cause me a great deal of labour, much more than the Minister's officials would have to undergo, to frame a suitable <Col N="541" /> recommendation for this House.  I am aware, too, that, even if he were accepting the principle, the Minister would not accept my wording in any recommendation to be put into a Finance Bill.  Even if he accepted the principle of my amendment, he would put words of his own into the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In the case of a young widow, it is possible for her to have inherited an estate of £8,000 or £10,000 but at the same time to have practically no ready cash available for herself and her children. If she has to go out to work, she must employ somebody to mind the children and there is no income tax allowance for such an expense.  I hope the Minister will agree with me on this point.</P>
    <P>The second point I raised was this: a child may have an income of up to £80 without being liable for tax and without the parent losing the £120 tax free allowance.  The figure in England is higher&mdash;it is, I think, £100&mdash;and I understand that in England, if the income exceeds £100, the tax free allowance is reduced in proportion. Here, on the other hand, if the figure exceeds £80, the whole £120 is lost. If that is so, it is a very hampering provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister last year at column 138 of the Seanad Debates of 19th July, dealt with that point when he said:</P>
    <P>That particular point which Senator Hayes has put about the sliding scale&mdash;I am not saying whether it should be £80 or £100&mdash; has never been put to me, I must say, and therefore I never gave it my consideration, but I would believe that all these things should be roughly the same as they are in Britain.</P>
    <P>If I am correctly informed, therefore, the Minister should bring our procedure into line with the procedure in Britain.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to frame recommendations to meet either of these points.  All I can do is put the case to the Minister and to hope that as he was sympathetic last year he will be <Col N="542" /> a little more sympathetic on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is one of the few occasions upon which general financial policy can be discussed in the Seanad.  It is concerned with the raising, as apart from the spending, of money which will be debated on the Appropriation Bill. The Budget nowadays is more than a statement of public accounts: it is a regulator of the economy.  If the economy is growing too rapidly, a surplus Budget acts as a brake, whereas if it is not growing rapidly enough, a deficit Budget acts as an accelerator.</P>
      <P>The Budget must be studies against the background of the world and of our own country.  These interact on each other as Ireland has such an open economy.  The volume of external trade is so large that Irish conditions are very sensitive to outside influences. Irish prices, especially the prices of labour and capital, are greatly influenced by those in the outside world. This sensitivity to outside influences is growing and as has been stated in the Report of the Central Bank: &ldquo;External factors are of increasing importance to the Irish economy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In studying the world background, the central feature is the recent American stock exchange crisis.  It is an important question whether a business recession is imminent in the United States.  The prices on the stock exchange and business act and interact on each other.  A fall in share prices reflects the expectation of business losses while it reduces purchasing power especially for consumer durables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble in the United States, as in every other country, is that any effort to stimulate growth may cause an outflow of gold.  This is typical of the conflict between internal and external policies.  Internal policies of expansion may have to be damped down because of balance of payments considerations.  Every country in the world is trying to increase its exports while not increasing its imports.  This is, of course, impossible and leads to recurrent foreign exchange crises. Government policy has to look to the <Col N="543" /> short period and be defensive, with bad effects on business confidence and investment.  The ultimate cure for this state of affairs is an increase in the international reserves.  If central banks had increased liquidity Governments would have more elbow room and would be able to expand more without incurring balance of payments crises.  This could be obtained by fluctuating exchange rates but orthodox financial opinion is completely set against that today.  Therefore, it need not be discussed any further as it is practically out of the question.</P>
    <P>Another thing that could be done is something in the nature of a world clearance system.  That is referred to with approval on page 23 of the Report on the Irish Central Bank, that more and more international collaboration is taking place for the safeguarding of currencies.  The trouble there is that the complete system will take time to evolve and require a great deal of international agreement.  Possibly the most satisfactory and most immediate solution would be an increase in the price of gold but that, of course, brings us far away from Irish problems into American politics.  Gold at the moment is still the basis of the world's monetary system.  The price of gold has not risen in the past 28 years whereas the price of everything else has.  The amount of gold production is not increasing at the same rate as world trade.  Therefore, a great many people believe that the only immediate solution of the general shortage of reserves in the world is by the United States increasing the dollar price of gold.  But, as I say, that takes me far away from the subject of this debate to which I now propose to return.</P>
    <P>In spite of what I said about the world tendency towards deflation, the immediate outlook in the majority of countries in the world does not appear to be too bad at the moment.  Take the United States of America.  I notice in to-day's <i>Times</i> a dispatch from their New York correspondent which states that:</P>
    <P>Mr. Per Jacobsson, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last night that the <Col N="544" /> United States economy had shown &ldquo;a quite remarkable improvement&rdquo; in the last year and he did not believe it was heading towards a recession.  The stock market decline, he said, could be attributed to the end of post-war inflation, which might in itself be a sign of strength rather than weakness.  He did not think the decline was likely to affect the United States economy in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The same opinion is expressed in the Report of the Irish Central Bank.  As regards the United Kingdom, which is the country to which we export most, general opinion is that nothing in the nature of recession is imminent and that a condition of stability has been reached.  The official view seems to be that a period of expansion is about to take place.  Last Thursday in the House of Commons the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said that the Budget was based on the view that an element of expansion was still appearing and exports were climbing.  Public expenditure was certainly rising at least as strongly as forecast in April. Consumer spending also showed signs of increasing.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Continent, trade and production are expanding and, therefore, in the main parts of the world with which Ireland trades the immediate outlook is that trade seems to be fairly satisfactory and not of a kind to give rise to alarm regarding the future potential of Irish exports.</P>
    <P>To come nearer home, as I said, the Budget must be framed in relation to the world background and the Irish background.  As regards the Irish background, we are lucky this year to have a considerable amount of very well-informed comment.  There has been a report by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development on Ireland which discusses the long period view.  Perhaps, I should say that in respect to this background we have to consider the long period view&mdash;is the economy growing?&mdash;and the short period view&mdash;is it stable from year to year?  One of the great problems in the world today, in the United States and elsewhere, is an apparent conflict between growth and stability. <Col N="545" /> An effort to grow too fast leads to instability.  As regards the rate of growth, the Irish position is quite satisfactory.  The Central Bank Report shortly summarises the findings of the survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&mdash;</P>
    <P>The general position may be briefly stated.  In 1961, for the third year in succession, total national output expanded at a rate substantially higher than that postulated in the White Paper on Economic Expansion issued in November, 1958. Over the three year period, the average annual rate of growth exceeded 4½ per cent.  The major contribution to the increase in 1961 was again made by the industrial sector. Current external results and payments showed a small surplus. Capital inflow combined with this surplus to produce a substantial increase in external reserves.</P>
    <P>I shall not quote fully.  I shall simply quote the final sentence which said:</P>
    <P>The picture emerging from the foregoing very brief summary is an encouraging one.</P>
    <P>That is the verdict of this international body.  There is one feature to which attention is drawn of a less satisfactory kind and that is the need for further investment.  Although the Irish economy is growing, the rate of capital investment is lower than that in most European countries.  On that subject I should like to quote from the June number of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> where it states that:</P>
    <P>Even during this period of expansion the level of capital formation has been unduly low.  In 1960, for example, the percentage of national production devoted to fixed capital assets was 13 as compared with 21 within the countries of the EEC.</P>
    <P>This insufficiency of investment is particularly regrettable at a time when great changes will be called for in production to meet the changing conditions in Europe.  Technical <Col N="546" /> innovations and increases in productivity call for considerable investment.</P>
    <P>The whole uncertainty regarding the Irish position in the Common Market has led to a specific inquiry into how Irish industry should adapt itself to the difficult position which may lie ahead and, as the Seanad is aware, a Committee on Industrial Organisation was appointed to investigate these problems. The first report of the Committee directly bears upon the Finance Bill which we are discussing because the Bill incorporates some of the Committee's recommendations.  The Committee made specific recommendations which are summarised on page 21 of the Report of the Central Bank.  The principal recommendations which are now coming near the Budget are:</P>
    <P>First, that the legislation dealing with industrial grants should be amended to enable An Foras Tionscal to make a grant in respect of an industrial project which involves a switch from one field of activity to another ...; secondly, that the size of coverage of technical assistance grants payable by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the marketing grants payable by Córas Tráchtála should be reviewed; thirdly&mdash; and this directly affects us&mdash;that the initial allowance on industrial plant and equipment should be raised from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. and on industrial buildings from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The fourth is that loans, with waiver of interest payments and deferment of capital repayments over a period, normally, of five years, should be provided by the Industrial Credit Company Limited towards financing re-equipment by industrial undertakings within their existing spheres of activity; and the fifth, that the Revenue Commissioners should examine the practicability of a scheme enabling losses incurred by a newly-established joint industrial enterprise to be charged for tax purposes against the profits of the parent enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Report states:</P>
    <P>In the course of his Budget speech, the Minister for Finance stated that <Col N="547" /> the Government had decided to proceed on the basis of the Committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Having made these preliminary remarks regarding the economic background, I shall now come nearer to the actual Budget.  I think everyone will agree that the first object of this Budget, as of every Budget, should be to encourage growth, to stimulate growth in the economy.  Everything must be done to make investment attractive both for Irish citizens and for foreigners but, at the same time, as I have already said, this growth must always be within limits which are consistent with the stability of the economic system.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, in other countries today, including even the United States, attempts at growth seem to give rise to balance of payments crises.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance must have regard not only to the long period aim of growth but to the short period aim of preserving the value of the Irish currency, preventing our balance of payments getting out of equilibrium and the loss of our external reserves.</P>
    <P>In order to understand the short period problem apart from the long period problem, I should like to refer the Seanad to a document issued on the eve of the Budget which gives a picture of the immediate background of the Budget apart from the longer background referred to in the Report of the OECD.  The outstanding features of these economic statistics are shortly summarised in &ldquo;Economic Statistics Issued Prior to the Budget of 1962.&rdquo;  In 1961 there was a surplus in the balance of payments.  The external assets of the Irish banking system increased.  The national income increased by eight per cent.  Fixed capital formation rose by 15 per cent. from £87,000,000 in 1960 to £102,000,000 in 1961.  Total savings increased by about £9,000,000 to £68,000,000, the highest figure yet recorded.  The index of average weekly industrial earnings increased by 7.8 per cent. and hourly earnings by 11 per cent.  The report states that <Col N="548" /> the analysis of the events of last year is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, in framing this Finance Bill was concerned with the outlook for the present year rather than the events of recent years.  When we come to the outlook for 1962, on the face of it it would appear that a deficit in the balance of payments is a possibility.  That view is taken in the Central Bank report.  It was also taken in the debate in the Dáil by the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach took the view that, despite the possibility of a deficit in the balance of payments, a deflationary policy should not be pursued because, as he said, everything points to a capital inflow and, if there is an inflow of capital, a deficit in the balance of payments can be sustained without loss to the external reserves.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to quote at length from the Taoiseach's speech but he said that the Budget was aimed not at a reduction of purchasing power but a transfer of purchasing power within the community, a balancing operation in the interests of equity and social justice.  If this analysis of the immediate past and the prospects for the future is correct, there is no need for the Budget to be framed in order to obtain either a surplus or a deficit. There is no sign of such an acceleration of the economy as to call for a surplus to put on the brake and there is no such sign of a recession in the country as to call for a deficit to give acceleration.  Therefore, from the point of view of regulating the pace of the economy the Budget should be neutral.</P>
    <P>To come to the narrower sphere of public finance, of course the Budget must be balanced in the sense that expenditure must be covered by current revenue, and as far as possible new capital expenditure should be covered by new savings.  Otherwise inflation might occur.  A deficit or capital expenditure incurred by borrowing from the banks might lead to inflation which the country simply cannot afford at the moment.  That is a matter to which I shall return in view of the uncertainty regarding the Common Market situation.</P>
    <P>The outturn of last year's Budget <Col N="549" /> was very satisfactory and in spite of increases in expenditure revenue was buoyant and the year's out-turn was a deficit of £708,000, a very satisfactory result.  When we come to regard this Finance Bill we have to allow for the fact that public expenditure will inevitably rise.  That is part of the trend of the times in every country in the world, and this country is no exception.</P>
    <P>This matter is referred to with some alarm in the Report of the Central Bank.  At page 14 the Report says:</P>
    <P>There are already indications of official proposals for expenditure beyond the provision made in the Budget.  It would be optimistic to expect a faster rate of economic growth in 1962 than in 1961.  State expenditure, borrowing and annual debt service charges are thus increasing much more rapidly than national output.</P>
    <P>Assuming that this increase in expenditure is almost inevitable, new taxation becomes necessary.  It would be too much to hope that existing taxes would be so buoyant as to bring in the revenue necessary in this great additional expenditure.  The Minister in his Budget speech faced up to this situation.  He stated what he considered would be the new expenditure necessary in the coming year.  The deficit on the Budget, assuming no change in rates of expenditure or taxation, would be £745,000.  To that had to be added the increased initial allowance recommended by the Committee on Industrial Organisation&mdash;£100,000; an increase of pay recently awarded to teachers&mdash;£460,000; certain increased pensions amounting to £1,075,000; additional agricultural grants amounting to £2½ million.  All these together come to a deficit of £5,330,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to abolish entertainments tax.  The resulting loss of revenue would increase the deficit to £5,780,000.  The Minister quite properly allows for errors of estimation a sum of £2 million, leaving a gap of £3,780,000 to be raised.  In order to bridge this <Col N="550" /> gap, the Minister had to propose additional taxes.  The additional taxes are an increase in duty on beer, spirits and tobacco.  As Senators are aware, the duty on tobacco has further been increased in the past couple of weeks as a result of unforeseen additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>Before making any comment on these additional taxes, I should just like to refer to the capital budget. The outturn on the capital account last year showed that the State had spent £57 million as compared with an estimated £55 million.  The estimate for this year is £66 million, most of which is of a productive kind.  The Minister emphasised in the Budget debate in the Dáil that this expenditure would all be productive in the long run.  That is no doubt true but, to repeat a point which I have made every year in the Seanad, outlay that may be productive in the long run may cause deadweight debt in the short run.  It may be productive without being self-liquidating.  Therefore, although it may be perfectly justified from the point of view of the future of the national income, it may create in a short period difficulties regarding additional debt and the service of that additional debt and sinking fund.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the Seanad for harping on this theme but I think it is one which should be repeated.  The fact that expenditure may be productive in the long run does not mean the debt is self-liquidating and, therefore, from the purely budgetary point of view, which is what we are considering in this debate, the short period effect of borrowing may, perhaps, be more important.</P>
    <P>No investment is more productive than education.  But it may take a generation to mature and, while it is maturing, the public debt in relation to it may impose very heavy burdens on the Budget.  That is my first criticism of the Budget&mdash;that a certain amount of the debt incurred in relation to the capital budget will impose a burden on the taxpayer in the short run.  This view is corroborated by the Report of the Central Bank, page 17, which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> The financially non-remunerative character of a great part of the expenditure treated as capital suggests that a proportion of that expenditure should be financed out of ordinary revenue.  The available information for other countries indicates that a more conservative policy in this regard would be in line with practice elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My next point on the Finance Bill is one which was made in the Dáil and one which I personally do not agree with and that is that more social benefits should have been provided for certain sections of the population.  We should all like to see higher pensions, higher social benefits: everybody is agreed about that.  But the Minister has to exercise restraint in this matter. The resources available are not unlimited. I have no doubt that he would have liked to give more to needy sections of the population, but the public finances of the country at the moment simply would not stand generosity of that kind.</P>
    <P>When we come to consider the new taxes, speaking for myself, I entirely approve of what the Minister has done. If there has to be new taxation, far better to have it indirect than direct. It has less adverse effect on investment and on production.  I do not think it could be sufficiently emphasised that the expansion of the national income depends on increased productivity and that increased productivity depends mainly on increased investment.  I should like to refer, on this, to a striking passage in the Report of the Central Bank, page 16:</P>
    <P>In the first place, it should be better appreciated that, inasmuch as increases in labour productivity simply mean a faster rise in output than in manpower engaged, these increases are mainly due to a fuller or better utilisation of capital or an increase in capital in relation to labour employed.  This is not to say that important contributions to productivity could not also be made by better organisation and more efficient use of manpower or by additional effort on the part of <Col N="552" /> employees.  But to the large extent that increased output per man-hour depends on investment and on the efficient utilisation of capital, excessive increases in real wages in relation to output can only be at the expense of the very technological change which produced the higher output per man in the first instance. Shifts in income which unduly restrict the profits available for further investment are in the long run contrary to the interests of the employees themselves, as well as of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>That is a passage which I would like to see engraved on the portals of every business house and of every trade union branch.</P>
    <P>Therefore, from the point of view of stimulating growth the new taxes must be approved.  The doubling of the initial allowances encourages investment and most of the public investment will be productive in the long run.  I should like to say that I agree with the plea of Senator Hayes that the death duties might be amended.  Senator Hayes' criticism of the code is based on the hardship caused to certain weaker members of the community. Mine is based on the fact that death duties have an adverse effect on saving. If death duties could be abolished or materially reduced, domestic saving and foreign capital would both be stimulated.  The income tax concessions have attracted foreign capital into the country but death duty concessions would attract not only capital but capitalists.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to press this point because the whole question of direct taxation is under review but I do ask the Minister to keep it in mind. Nothing acts as a greater disincentive to saving than rises of prices which make money a wasting asset.  This brings me to the second aim of the Budget, the preservation of stability. From this point of view the Budget must also be approved inasmuch as it does nothing to encourage inflation. At the present time when a lowering of tariffs is so much in the air, it is most important for every country to keep its price and cost levels competitive, otherwise countries suffer <Col N="553" /> from exchange crises and losses of reserves.  The Report of the Central Bank calls attention to the efforts which are being made by other countries in this respect:</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that in a number of countries inflationary trends have become the subject of special anxiety.  In March, 1961 the group of experts commissioned in 1959 by the Council of the OEC reported on price increases in the member countries of that organisation. According to their report it is necessary for Governments to consider price stability.</P>
    <P>While we can do nothing to avoid an imported inflation from the outside world, we can refrain from adding fuel to the fire.  The Report of the Central Bank refers in strong terms to the necessity for Ireland avoiding inflation at all costs:</P>
    <P>What all this means for Ireland is that unless the strong efforts to control cost increases in other countries are matched by similar efforts here the encouraging growth of recent years may not reach the stage we wish, or could even be reversed.</P>
    <P>The Budget must, therefore, be applauded on the grounds that it is anti-inflationary.  Current expenditure is covered by current revenue and new State investment will be covered by new savings.  The new taxes reduce to some extent the purchasing power of consumers.  Therefore, the addition to the social services does not make any net addition to demand.</P>
    <P>All the benefits of the Budget could be eliminated if either a cost inflation or a demand inflation developed.  A cost inflation means a rise in costs, principally wages, which makes Irish exports uncompetitive and thus leads to balance of payments difficulties.  A demand inflation results from too large a flow of consumer demand which increases imports and equally causes trouble in the balance of payments. Both these types of inflation, it should be said, can be partly caused by the Government itself&mdash;cost inflation by unduly high wages in the public services and a demand inflation by <Col N="554" /> too much public expenditure not matched by taxation.  Therefore, it is not right or fair for the Government to issue warnings or exhortations to private employers when they themselves in many fields are setting the bad example.  That matter has been referred to on page 12 of the Report of the Central Bank where it says:</P>
    <P>The opportunity which Ireland had in 1961 of achieving a relative reduction in production costs and gain in competitiveness was missed.  It may be remarked, incidentally, that with this result a substantial share of the responsibility rests on the public sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>One might say in conclusion that the Budget is neutral and properly so.  It could be described as a standstill Budget.  A great many departments of public finance are the subject of enquiry at the moment; the relation between national and local taxation is being investigated and fundamental changes in our whole tax system may be necessary if we enter the Common Market and, therefore, it is not a time for dramatic changes in the Irish taxation system.  The present Budget is neutral and standstill, neither a brake nor accelerator should, therefore, be applied.  The only danger is a deterioration in the situation abroad or at home.  There is no sign of such a deterioration.  I have already quoted authoritative sources in relation to the United States and the United Kingdom and current forecasts in relation to this country are quite optimistic. If a deterioration did occur it could be dealt with when it arose. It is better for the Minister to err, if he does err, on the side of optimism than pessimism.  It is better to have an encouraging than a discouraging Budget.  A deflationary restrictive budget could have a bad effect on confidence and investment and I think we can acquit the Minister of bringing in a Budget of that kind in the present year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a small point with the Minister. I would like him to look into the Schedule A tax on owner-occupier houses.  This is probably one of the <Col N="555" /> most unpopular taxes and it could be described as an unjust tax.  I read what the Minister said in the Dáil on the matter.  It is true that grants were given in most cases for the building of these houses but the occupier is not the only person who benefited from these grants.  Most people with any knowledge of the building trade know that quite a share of the grants go in profits to the builders. The Minister also mentioned that the owner-occupiers have the benefit of rates remissions but there is often a case where these remissions cease particularly at a time when the children are coming to the age where school fees are a big consideration, and the full impact of the rates is a grave hardship.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, as well the income tax allowance on the mortgage interest but this merely means that the Minister's one hand is giving and the other is taking back.  This Schedule A tax should be abolished and the Minister should not continue to defend the idea of placing a penalty on a citizen merely because he has been prudent or provident enough to invest his savings in a house for himself and his family. This tax hits hard at the ordinary working man.  It may not bother the big man or the industrialist who can, perhaps, pass it on one way or another. That this happens was shown in a recent debate in the House of Commons on the subject of Schedule A tax. One of those opposing the abolition of the tax, a Conservative M.P., Mr. Gerard Nabarro, said he had never paid a penny of income tax under Schedule A in his life since he owned his own house because he was clever enough to arrange his financial affairs in such a way as not to attract any Schedule A liability.  He said that he employed a qualified accountant to do it for him and the fees that he charged him were in due course charged against his maintenance relief claim. That is stated in a publication entitled <i>This Week</i> of the 5th of July, 1962.</P>

      <P>I am afraid there are many conservative types such as that in this country who can act in that manner but the small man cannot dodge.  I would like the Minister to have another look at this tax and see if he can remove it.  It is a grave hardship on people who have decided to help themselves in providing houses rather than waiting for the local authority to do it for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there were two questions raised by Senator Hayes which, indeed, last year I promised to give attention to before we reached the Finance Bill this year.  Well, I have, I must say, a very considerable number of what I consider very desirable concessions that might be made in income tax, estate duties and so on and whenever there is some money we look at it to see what we can do. It was not worthwhile looking at it this year because there was no money to spare and, therefore, nothing could be done this year, whatever way our sympathy might lie.  I should like to say, however, that there is some benefit to the widow and children as compared to an estate left to say nephews or first cousins and they have relief of that kind, that is, in legacy or succession duty when the property is left to a widow and children.  To take an example, I just asked what estate duty would be paid on an estate of £8,000, which I admit in present circumstances is not an awful lot for a widow and family to live on for the rest of their lives as the income would not be considerable. On an estate of £8,000 the total duty paid would be about £240 which is not very great.  Of course, if you go higher the duty goes higher. I should like to say that so far no Minister for Finance, no Government and no Parliament, have proposed or inserted any allowance such as we have on the income tax side in the case of estate duty.  It is a straight out duty and whatever the circumstances the duty is paid with the exception I have mentioned already, when we come to the legacy or succession duty, the nearer the relative the less there is to be paid.  In this case there is none at all to be paid.  As Senators are aware, the three duties are the death <Col N="557" /> duty, the legacy duty and the succession duty.  There is only one duty to be paid in this case.</P>
      <P>In the other case mentioned by the Senator, so far as I can find out I think he is not right in stating that conditions are more favourable in Great Britain than here in regard to what is allowed on the income of a child in his own right.  The limit here is £80 and it was raised to £100 in Great Britain last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was raised to £80 here last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the difference in the amount allowed, conditions are the same.  As I say, it is £80 here and £100 there and then it comes in fully against the person.  Other income tax matters were raised by Senator Miss Davidson.  I should like to say in that connection that the final report has been received from the Commission on Income Taxation.  It has not yet been published, It is with the printers, and I think Senators will have it in their hands in a very short time.</P>
      <P>I told the Dáil that I hoped to get the Government to approve of a white paper of all the recommendations of the Commission before the Budget next year.  A number of matters have been dealt with in that report. Children's allowances are one of them. They have already dealt with Schedule A tax.  The Government have deferred but not rejected their recommendation in that regard and said that in present circumstances they did not think it advisable to adopt it.  There was also a proposal which dealt with Schedule B which went with it.  The Government have decided that in the present circumstances they would not adopt it but that does not prevent any Government from going back to consider it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say that at the end of the final report that has been sent in by the Commission on Income Taxation and which is now in the hands of the printers there is a summary of all the recommendations from the very beginning to the end.  Therefore, it will be necessary for the Government <Col N="558" /> to look at the whole thing again before next year's Budget.  I have taken rather a strong line against the recommendation of the Commission on Income Taxation on this item of Schedule A tax.  I have never seen any great point of hardship or any reason for considering it on the grounds of hardship.</P>
    <P>Senators will realise that there are income grades which do not pay.  In other words, a married man would have to be earning something like&mdash; so far as I remember&mdash;£11 a week or thereabouts, before he would be liable for income tax.  Therefore, the Schedule A tax would not apply to him.  Senator Miss Davidson talked about the working man.  We would want to know who she has in mind when she talks about the working man. We are all, I suppose, working men to a certain extent.  I suppose Senator Miss Davidson has in mind the working man who is working for a rather low or moderate wage but this tax hardly bears on such people at all.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made a very valuable contribution to the debate.  I do not think I could deal with all the points raised by him, and I certainly could not improve on the points he raised, but I should like to give my own comments on some of them.  He quoted reports from various organisations and he said that generally the outlook was not gloomy at any rate. The general opinion of the economists appears to be that we need not be afraid of a recession in the future and that trade expansion is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>Coming to Ireland, as was pointed out by the publications, the rate of economic growth has been favourable and in 1961 it was very good.  The only black spot, as it were, in the economic reports was the small proportion of our income that goes into capital investment in this country.  It is lower here than in other countries. That is rather strange, and a hard thing to understand, because I do not think our people are more thriftless than the people of other countries, but we have not got into the habit of putting money aside for investment.  The <Col N="559" /> position is improving a bit and perhaps it will improve as we go on.</P>
    <P>Talking of the rate of economic growth being satisfactory in 1961, there is a warning from some economists that it may not be as good in 1962.  Even Senators who have not taken an interest in the various publications will realise that we are not likely to get the sort of acceleration that was there in 1961.  It is more likely to settle down to a pattern now, at the 1961 rate, or, perhaps, a little less.  Still we do expect an increase in our economic growth during 1962.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Senator O'Brien that there is a possibility of a deficit in our balance of payments in 1962.  In fact, I would say it is almost a certainty but we are not sure, of course, how our external assets may stand.  So long as they remain as they are, or a little higher, we need not be frightened about some slight, or comparatively slight, deficit in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Senator O'Brien that in our domestic finances it is most important to balance the Budget.  In my presentation of the Budget first to the Government, and afterwards to the Dáil, it was my aim to have a Budget presented that would be balanced for the year.  As the Senator pointed out, last year we ended with a deficit, but last year was a most exceptional year in many ways.  First of all, we had very much more revenue than we expected but we had more expenditure. There were two very substantial items in the increased expenditure. One was the increased dairy produce which we did not forecast.  We do not express any regret for that of course; we were glad to see the increased production, but we just did not forecast it and, therefore, the subsidy necessary to finance the surplus dairy produce was not covered by the Budget.</P>
    <P>The second item was what is now known as the eighth round.  Salary increases to civil servants and other public employees of various kinds came into operation mostly on 1st November&mdash;some later but mostly on 1st November&mdash;and that was about <Col N="560" /> five months of the financial year.  I do not know exactly how much it came to in that particular financial year but I know that in this present financial year the total will be over £5,000,000 so that there was at least £2,000,000 unexpected expenditure under that head in 1961-62.  We ended with a small deficit and we got off fairly well, in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised by Senator O'Brien&mdash;with which I agree, again&mdash; is his statement that capital raised by way of loan for a project&mdash;maybe the expression was used by myself; I do not know&mdash;in the long run may prove to be remunerative but may be a heavy burden in the short run.  That is quite true.  He cites education.  We are very anxious to spend as much as we can possibly afford on education. Perhaps, we do not look at it from the point of view of what we can afford but from the point of view of what can be organised or done by way of expanding educational facilities.  The expenditure is coming up very substantially each year.  That certainly can be looked upon as a very desirable form of expenditure in the long run. The young people who are getting the education now will certainly be very much better equipped to pay off these debts that have accumulated by way of national debt when they come to get work later on.</P>
    <P>Another item on which a great deal of money is spent is housing, which is looked upon as a national asset not a budgetary asset.  I suppose, again, we can accept that the coming generation, who will be better housed, will be in a better position also to deal with national debts as they are accumulated.</P>
    <P>A point made by Senator O'Brien was that, if there is a danger of inflation, taxation may have a beneficial effect on the economy by taking a certain amount of money away.  I am afraid that that is not what I had in mind in this particular Budget.  I had in mind, rather, the redistribution of income and expenditure&mdash;a redistribution so as to give a certain amount to those who had derived little or no benefit from the increase in national income, like the pensioners who are <Col N="561" /> on fixed pensions; the social welfare beneficiaries who also are on fixed incomes and also the agricultural population which had, I believe, benefited to some extent by national production but not by any means as fully as others.  The money was taken for their benefit from those who, we thought, could afford to pay.  I do not know that in that case there was very much that could be said for the argument that we had attacked inflation to a certain extent, because the money was spent by somebody.  We could say that the money was spent on necessaries rather than on luxuries and that that could be a benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>The whole system of taxation, but in particular income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax, will have to be considered before the next Budget when the final report of the Income Taxation Commission is presented. They have not, I think, dealt with estate duty: that can be considered also.  Furthermore, as Senator O'Brien mentioned, there is a commission sitting on local taxation.  We felt that local taxation was increasing very rapidly and, if it had not already reached the stage, was likely to reach the stage at which it would, perhaps, be beyond the capacity of certain people to pay.  The matter is being considered by expert people in this case to see if any suggestion can be made that would be helpful in solving this problem.</P>
    <P>I think that is as far as I have notes on any points that were raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to revise the salaries of members of the judiciary, so as to bring those salaries up to date in the light of increases which have <Col N="562" /> taken place in recent years in the salaries of the more highly paid sectors of those remunerated from public funds.  The new rates proposed are set out in Section 1 of the Bill, and represent increases of about 15 per cent. for Justices of the District Court and for ordinary Judges of the Circuit Court, and increases of approximately 12½ per cent. for High Court and Supreme Court Judges.  In its examination of judicial remuneration the Government considered that in all the circumstances increases based on these percentages would form a suitable guide as to what the new salaries should be; Senators will, no doubt, observe that the new salaries which would be arrived at by an accurate percentage addition have been rounded, upwards in some cases and downwards in others.</P>
      <P>The question of what would be proper remuneration for the various branches of the judiciary is one on which widely differing views are sometimes expressed.  This Bill does not, however, involve any departure from the relative positions in our society in which the various branches of the judiciary have been placed.  What we are seeking to do in this Bill is to ensure that the Judges and Justices will retain the relationship in which they were placed, as compared to other sectors of the community, by the Dáil Select Committee which examined judicial salaries, expense allowances and pensions in 1953.  The unanimous findings of that Committee were approved by the Government and the new salaries recommended were brought into being by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>Following the 1953 report, judicial salaries were again reviewed by the Government in 1958 and 1959, with the result that the Courts of Justice Act, 1959, raised the 1953 rates by a flat 10 per cent.  That increase was justified at the time to enable members of the judiciary to preserve a rough parity with other salaried persons with whom they had been equated in the matter of salary in 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the Government is now satisfied that movements in salary rates since the terms of the 1959 increases <Col N="563" /> were decided upon now justify a further upward adjustment resulting in the new salary rates set out in the Bill now before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Due largely to the absence of any information as to movements in income in the professions or in commerce, the salaries of members of the judiciary have traditionally fallen to be related in a general way to those of the higher Civil Servants.  In 1960 many of the grades in the higher Civil Service secured a modest increase based on increases granted some years earlier to the lower grades in the Civil Service.  In addition all members of the higher Civil Service have got the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; increase of 12½ per cent. with effect from 1st November, 1961.  Against this background I am satisfied that the increases proposed for the judiciary in the present Bill are fully justified.  The annual cost of the present measure is £21,000.  To put the matter in perspective, I may mention that in his speech on the Vote on Account in March last, the Minister for Finance estimated that the cost of the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; increases in the public services as a whole is about £5¼ million.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that in the case of the higher Civil Service the 1st November, 1961 was adopted as the effective date for the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; increase.  For that reason, the 1st November is the effective date proposed in the present Bill.  Considerations of fair play indicate that this date is reasonable.  I do not think that the members of the judiciary should be placed at a disadvantage in this matter solely because of the system under which a separate Bill, with its inherent delays, has to be prepared and enacted on each occasion when it is proposed to increase judicial remuneration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>Every reasonable person will agree that wage and salary earners are entitled to receive a good and proper recompense for their services. It would be a very bad thing, indeed, if the Government of any country took legislative measures to tie that recompense to what would result <Col N="564" /> in a low standard of living.  We would have discontented workers and, as a result, production would decline and our economy suffer.</P>
      <P>Within the category of workers we have all sorts of people ranging from our judges to our agricultural workers. There are not so many of the former and there are many, but not enough, of the latter.  All, however, are entitled to fair treatment in the matter of remuneration. I am afraid, however, they all do not get such treatment.</P>
      <P>Whenever a worker feels he is slipping back into a position where he cannot meet his reasonable obligations because of rising costs or other circumstances, he becomes uneasy and contacts his trade union which in turn contacts the employer and, perhaps, the case eventually reaches the Labour Court where the employer explains the state of his coffers and the workers' representatives are examined to the point of exhibiting the kitchen cupboards. There is much talk of increased production if increases are to be given.  There is then bargaining for increases of pence and sometimes shillings per hour or per week.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court, however, somewhat equalises the situation between employer and employee but under the Bill we are now asked to pass, there is no indication that the members of the judiciary have been compelled, through the smallness of their stipends, to apply to their trade union to put their case before any court in order to show their difficulties in maintaining a reasonable standard of living.  Yet in the Bill before us we are presenting some of these privileged workers with colossal increases in their salaries without their having to submit to the indignity of having their affairs examined in public and reported and commented on in the daily papers. What is overlooked too often is the fact that a very great number of ordinary workers will have no pensions from their work.  Some may qualify for the £2 contributory OAP&mdash;but our judges will, in due course, have substantial pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to those to whom this Bill applies, the increases are not <Col N="565" /> pence nor shillings but represent in some cases more than many of our hard working national-revenue producing citizens can hope to earn in any year of hard endeavour.  There is also the fact that very generous expenses are payable to the judges.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, through the Chair, have these lawmen submitted to him a case which leads him to the belief that there is a definite need for the increases mentioned in the Bill before us and if so, how acute has he found the distress of their situation?</P>
    <P>If I take the post of Chief Justice, whoever may occupy it, could the holder be living in straitened circumstances on a salary of £5,335 which he has at the moment or, indeed, could he have really been in a really precarious position if his salary had remained at what it was in 1953, namely £4,850 per year?  Perhaps, this post carries an abnormal amount of responsibility but, as has already been asked, does it carry more than, or, indeed, as much responsibility as the post of An Taoiseach who, in the light of some of the salaries mentioned in the Bill, is a sweated worker and should consider joining whatever trade union would be appropriate to his exalted office?</P>
    <P>I have heard and read statements to the effect that there is a difficulty in getting skilled law personnel to accept these posts even with the overhigh salaries and expenses, because of the fact that their earnings in the courts as barristers, counsel, <i>et cetera</i>, are so high that even at the enormous salary figures offered, they climb to the Bench only at a considerable loss of earnings.  Is it not obvious, if this is so, that law costs are too high and should be reviewed?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when he comes to renovate our Courts of law, will give very careful attention to this aspect of the cost of the machinery of the law.  It is, of course, well known that many ordinary citizens put up with grave injustices and live in hardship simply because they fear to seek justice for no other reason than that <Col N="566" /> the cost of obtaining justice is too high.  How true is the Chinese proverb &mdash;&ldquo;He who goes to law gives away his cow for a cat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have also heard on occasion the spurious argument that the judiciary must be well paid in order to preserve their integrity and to remove them from the temptation of bribery or other unseemly practices.  I think if this point is even considered in fixing their salaries it is an affront to the judiciary.  If a man is not honest and trustworthy in himself, no salary, however high, will make him so.  Most workers hold confidential information in their occupations, clerks, book-keepers, nurses, doctors, accountants, even the humblest domestic worker and I never heard any trade union put forward the case that such workers must be paid high salaries lest they divulge things learned in the course of their employment or act in a manner detrimental to the interest of their employers for monetary or other reward.</P>
    <P>It is also said that the work of judges and their colleagues is trying and difficult and that they have to deal with the lives and liberties of persons charged with serious offences. That is true, but ordinary citizens are called upon to act in the same manner when they are summoned as jurors and are faced with the problem of making decisions which are distressing and distasteful in the extreme.  Unlike those trained for the law, they have no special training to prepare them for such work&mdash;which they do without fee or reward, indeed, often at considerable loss.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what unbalance has struck the Government in this matter of the payment of the judiciary where sums like £6,000 and £4,500 per year are considered necessary to maintain life with Christian dignity and are handed out to a selected favoured few, together with a bonus of accumulated arrears and an assured, generous pension on retirement, while our aged citizens are precluded from receiving anything in the way of non-contributory pensions if their incomes exceed the preposterously low figure of <Col N="567" /> £104 15s. per year, which sum falls far short of the weekly sum this Bill proposes to donate in at least one case.</P>
    <P>It is my view that we are seriously reducing the value of our judiciary by paying them salaries so much in excess of the average salaries paid in this country, not to the ordinary worker, but to highly educated, highly trained skilled persons with high academic qualifications.  We are removing our higher judges from an ability to appreciate the realities of life.  How can one human being appreciate the temptations and difficulties that might face a fellow human being struggling to bring up a family on a wage representing 1/- or less for each £1 paid to his judge?</P>
    <P>The whole atmosphere of this Bill is one of building up a new aristocracy in a country where we were glad enough to be rid of such ornaments. How can there be peace in industry and to quote various Ministers and employers &ldquo;restraint in seeking wage increases&rdquo; when the money is handed out in such a manner to a favoured few?  At this point I would like to make it clear that the policy of paying good salaries is a good one and in the case of some of the judges the demands are not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The courts which have to work hardest are the district courts and while the salaries of district court justices are not low when compared with those of many other essential workers I would be prepared to agree to the scale in the Bill so far as it applies to the grade of President of the district court down to the ordinary justices.  In the other cases, however, I can see no justification whatever for setting up this new aristocracy.  I wonder just how many of them would have reached the salary and pension standard now proposed for them by grace and favour if they had remained in business on their own account?</P>
    <P>I cannot but remember that the Minister for Finance speaking in this House on the Central Fund Bill said at column 330, of Volume 55, of the Official Report that he had remembered the social welfare group in four out of the five Budgets he had brought in, adding&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> The amounts to the Senator's mind were small each time but I think it is better to do that, to give what we can afford each time rather than wait until next year or two years' time when we might be able to give them more.</P>
    <P>I felt sure, listening to the Minister for Finance, that he had the greatest difficulty finding the small increase for this group and when the Budget came I felt that was the reason they had to wait until August to get their few pennies.  But the judges, I note, will have their big accumulations to lift retrospectively from the 1st November, 1961.  Where did the Minister for Finance locate the money the Minister for Justice has now available to distribute to this non-needy section? Senator McGuire at column 182, Volume 55 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    <P>I am all for giving a man higher wages for doing more work and giving bigger and better wages for more efficient working but, in the present state of our economy, when we are about to face competition in the open market of the EEC, our workers and many of our people generally want to work less and get more money.  It really is beyond my comprehension how any sensible thinking person can justify that proposition.</P>
    <P>Statements such as that can be read in regard to workers at a time when wages were 10/- a week and the hours were from dawn until dark, but still the economy has not collapsed and our workers are no different from those of other countries.  All are striving for a better standard of living.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that we should aim at reducing the work, and if possible the number, of our judges.  It is well known that much of their work arises from crimes that should never happen, or at least happen much less frequently, if all workers were paid sufficient wages and had shorter hours of work to enable them to bring up their families in decent homes where, as parents, they would be able to supervise their children's work and play and have ample means to educate <Col N="569" /> and guide them to appreciate the dignity and joy of a cultured, useful life.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister of the dangers of paying over-generous sums to a privileged section of the community when so many have so little.  In this regard I can do no better than refer to the fact that our late Holy Father, Pope Pius XII, spoke of &ldquo;provocative luxury which insults the sufferings of the poor.&rdquo;  I do not know why the Minister is so anxious to pay such high increases to the judges and I would be curious to know if there have been cases of real distress among them.</P>
    <P>Being an advocate for the payment of good wages to all workers&mdash;not just higher wages for the highest paid&mdash;I would say that this Bill reminds me of the farmer who prayed for rain and was rewarded with weeks of torrential downpour.  After waiting patiently for an easing of the deluge, he at last fell on his knees and again prayed fervently in these words: &ldquo;Please, Lord, do not be ridiculous.&rdquo;  At this stage, unfortunately, very little can be done in the matter of these proposed payments but I would ask the Minister to look at the wages structure and content of our community and, more or less in the words of the farmer, say to him, with great respect: &ldquo;Please, Mr. Minister, do not be ridiculous.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the exhortations that I can envisage being addressed to either the Minister for Justice or any other person who can increase salaries I cannot for one moment envisage either the judiciary or any other section of the community exhorting somebody to stop the payment of increased salaries on the basis of it being ridiculous. This is a distasteful measure in many ways.  In my view it is an unnecessary measure at this time having regard to the fact that quite recently a similar measure was before the Dáil and Seanad and was passed into law.  I am not really concerned about the amounts that are being paid.  I do not subscribe to the view which has been <Col N="570" /> expressed elsewhere&mdash;but, in fairness, has not been expressed by the Minister in this House&mdash;that it is necessary to put a price on integrity, to put a ceiling level.  I am speaking from a considerable number of years' experience of our judiciary at all levels from the district court to the Supreme Court and I am satisfied that the appointees to the Bench, under whatever dispensation so appointed, do not regulate the exercise of their integrity by the amount of remuneration which they receive.</P>
      <P>I find two aspects of this measure disturbing.  One I suppose is something about which some action will have to be taken at some future date and the sooner the better.  That is to take the whole question of the remuneration of the judiciary out of the maelstrom of what could very well be muddy politics and judges' remuneration and, indeed, appointments, could be regulated in some other way.  The second aspect of the Bill which I find rather difficult to understand is that the Courts (Establishment) Act, which this measure purports to amend, became law on the 16th August, 1961, and in Section 46, which this Bill proposes to amend, there were then written in the salaries of all members of the judiciary, from the Chief Justice, to the rural district justices. That was on the 16th August, 1962, and now looking at the Bill before the Seanad I see it was ordered by Dáil Éireann to be printed on 22nd February, 1962.  It was reasonable to think that this amendment was given consideration, first at departmental level, and secondly at Government level for what I dare suggest was some considerable time prior to its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why, therefore, was this not done at the time of the principal Act which became law on 16th August, 1961?  Of course, the retrospective proposals in this Bill make the matter more suspicious still, because it is made retrospective to 1st November, 1961. What happened at economic levels, at cost of living levels, or at any other level, that might be considered in relation <Col N="571" /> to judicial salaries between 16th August, or a short time before when the principal Act became law, and the 1st November, of the same year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to warrant these substantial changes?  I should like something more specific than the reason the Minister gave on Second Reading for the substantial change in an equally unsubstantial length of time from August, 1961, to November, 1961.  If it is necessary to make them retrospective to November of last year that certainly should have been in the minds of our legislators in July or August of the same year.</P>
      <P>Allegations have been made that this has been done for the purpose of giving to the select few the advantage of the new salaries.  I do not know whether or not that is true but I would be much happier to hear the Minister categorically deny it rather than that the country should go on believing that legislation is brought about in this way for the benefit of the few.  I have my own personal view on the matter and I would be prepared to accept a categorical denial from the Minister straightaway on that point, to ease the public mind.</P>
      <P>Opposition Parties in Dáil Éireann, and I suppose here, will be accused of casting aspersions on the judiciary and bringing their persons and their offices into disrepute by prolonged and searching discussion or examination of the proposal we are now considering.  In my own personal view, if I were not satisfied as to the integrity of our judiciary and if I felt I would be visited with some sort of punishment at some time, I do not think that being as human as the rest, I would dare come in here and criticise this measure at all.  My criticism such as it is&mdash;and it is not very strong from the point of view of the amount of money involved &mdash;emanated primarily from the fact that I have absolute and unbounded faith in the integrity of the judiciary, without giving them this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government who, by bringing before the legislature so often&mdash;in 1959, again mentioned in the Courts <Col N="572" /> (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1961, and amended again in 1962&mdash;are subjecting the judges to any likely attack. Curiously enough, the only attack I can see in reading the debates in the Dáil has come from a member of the Government Party, where a particular judge was criticised because of an alleged tendency to accept the views submitted to him by a certain member of the Irish Bar.  I know both of the people referred to by the Deputy in question, and I would hasten to deny that there is any scintilla of truth in such an allegation.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot feel happy about this measure.  Indeed, I suspect that they have good reason to believe that the wind of popular opinion is blowing rather chilly against them because when such a doughty warrior as the Tánaiste is sent to the country to defend the judiciary or anyone else it means that it is necessary to defend someone.  When he repairs to Templemore in particular to achieve the miracle of stemming the tide of popular adverse opinion against the Government.  I hasten to affirm that achieving a miracle in that town is as big a fake as was ever attempted.</P>
    <P>The judiciary of this country under any dispensation do not require an apologia from the Tánaiste or anyone else.  They do their work and do it well.  At times they may be constrained to act somewhat differently when circumstances, shall we say, are embarrassing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those are the kind of things that tend to bring our laws and administration of them into disrepute, not the giving of extra money.  I do not think for one minute that these increases <Col N="573" /> are necessary for the reasons given by the Minister or by anyone supporting them.  If they were necessary, and are necessary now, surely it was obvious that they were necessary as late as August of last year, in view of the retrospective nature of the demands now made upon the legislature by this Bill?</P>
      <P>The whole matter is suspect.  I deprecate the frequency with which Bills of this kind are brought before the Dáil and Seanad.  I deprecate the system whereby the judiciary can be subjected to attacks and be compared with other people in other walks of life.  I am sorry I have to disagree with Senator Miss Davidson's analogy with the Labour Court.  I know she means it by way of comparison, but you cannot have people in the position of judges going before a body, even a body like the Labour Court to plead their case in relation to a rising cost of living.  They are men of power, men of prestige, men of integrity, and vitally men of necessary independence, and that is the position in which they should be maintained.</P>
      <P>I do not see why this distasteful measure should not be taken away from the forum of public criticism or even private criticism.  That should be done, and done soon.  I believe our judges should be adequately paid and, indeed, I would go so far as to say that the figures mentioned in this Bill are not far out of the way.  But there is a time and a place for everything. What I object to is the manner in which it is being done and the frightfully distasteful results that you can have from organised discussion of these matters in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a suggestion that the district justices work harder than the others and that possibly the increases to them might well be justified, I may say I do not accept that view. There is a common belief, indeed it has been suggested by people who ought to know better, that their work begins at 11 a.m. and finishes at 4 p.m. with an hour's break for lunch.  I can assure the House&mdash;I do not think it requires any great assurance because there are people on both sides of this <Col N="574" /> House with the same experience as I have had&mdash;that a judge's work might run into 12 or 14 hours a day when it comes to dealing with important heavy cases where there is a considerable amount of reading and research to be done and an examination of arguments put forward on behalf of both sides.  The actual appearance of a judge on the Bench and the fact that he presides there from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. is but a very small part of the work that is done.  I do not think that any distinction can be made with regard to work.</P>
    <P>District justices may sit longer but the work is lighter.  It consists of ordinary, everyday occurrences with the exception, possibly, of the taking of depositions which, fortunately, is not frequent in this country and not in great demand owing to the relatively small amount of crime we have.  The circuit court judge has somewhat heavier work to do.  In the High Court the work is considerable, as well as in the Supreme Court.  I do not think there is reason for any distinction by way of work or the strain that work causes.  I think that the whole objection to this Bill is based upon the fact that it has been brought in at a peculiar time having regard to the principal Act; that it introduces the opportunity of bringing the judiciary not into disrepute but into ill-informed controversy, which is as bad.  For these reasons, I would be opposed to this Bill.</P>

      <P>If Senator Lindsay is to be taken to mean that he is opposed to Parliament&mdash;the Dáil and the Seanad&mdash;being responsible for fixing the salaries of the judiciary, then I am certainly very much against him. It is reserved to the Oireachtas to deal with the salaries of the judiciary. It is part of our constitutional structure that the Executive, the legislature, and the judiciary should be each independent of the other and, in particular, that the judiciary should be independent of the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the power to ensure that the judiciary are properly paid.  It is a power which we should have.  It is <Col N="575" /> a power which we should be very jealous of.  I certainly would not approve of any measure or any alteration in the present procedure which would deprive us of that privilege. Because we have the power to deal with this situation, we should treat it in a responsible manner and not give in to the temptation&mdash;as I am afraid some members of the Dáil have done and possibly some members of the Seanad might be in danger of doing&mdash;to make political capital out of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be emphasised again, even though it has already been stated on a number of occasions, that this Bill does not propose to change the pattern of judicial salaries. The pattern, the proportion of these salaries, their relevance to other salaries, those of higher civil servants, and so on, have been fixed for many years past.  It is not proposed to change these in any way.  It is proposed merely to bring these salaries into balance with the increases which have been given, all along the line, to every member of the public service and also to wage-earners of every kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason why judges should be singled out for unfavourable treatment in this regard. If it was right for them to be paid the salaries they were paid five years' ago, ten years' ago, 15 years' ago, then there is no reason to argue that they are not entitled to the salaries which are proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to contrast the increases which are proposed in this Bill with the payments which are made to old age pensioners and generally with social welfare payments.  It is easy to make these comparisons although the comparison has no <Col N="576" /> validity whatever.  It must be remembered that the social welfare payments run into many millions of pounds. They are based on the very maximum that the country can afford.  They cost so much that even the smallest increase means an increase of millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>To say that the Government made the excuse recently that they are not able to pay any more in social welfare benefits but on the other hand are able to pay these increased salaries to judges does not make any sense whatever. As the House is aware, the amount which it is proposed to give to the judges would not go one-tenth part of the way to giving a farthing increase to the old age pensioners. That is not taking into account the fact that probably something approaching half of what will be paid to the judiciary will come back in income tax.  It will not even be paid to them.  It will be deducted in income tax.  Therefore, the comparison is not valid between increases of this kind and payment of social welfare benefits of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with salaries in this case.  The salaries of many other sections of the community&mdash;public servants, the Army, the police, civil servants, and so on, all compare very favourably with social welfare payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear any member of the Oireachtas, when increases in salaries were recently given, objecting to these increases on the basis that the salary exceeded the benefits received by the old age pensioners and so on.  There was no reason to make that comparison and there is equally no reason to make that comparison when we are dealing with the members of the judiciary.  We have in this country a judiciary of which we can well be proud.  When I say that, I do not say that they are all men of genius&mdash;not by any means. Many of them have not got the qualities which would entitle them to go down in history as outstanding <Col N="577" /> lawyers or outstanding judges.  All of them have human failings and some of them leave a lot to be desired in, for instance, their treatment of members of the public and even members of the legal profession, but in my experience they are all men of integrity, who do their duty without fear or favour in accordance with the oath which they have taken to the Constitution and administer justice to the best of their ability.</P>
      <P>The former President Truman of America, when he was asked one time what quality he admired most in a man, answered that he should do his damnedest, whether that was good, bad or indifferent.  The judges in this country, whatever their failings may be, live up to that standard set by President Truman.</P>
      <P>I think we take it for granted that the judiciary should be people of integrity.  I think, perhaps, we take it too much for granted because there are many other countries in which the very opposite is the case, where, far from taking the integrity of the judge for granted, it is taken for granted that his integrity is very much in doubt and that he is probably a corrupt person who will be amenable to fear or favour.</P>

      <P>Even though it has not been called in question in this House, it is something we should think about and it is something we should take into consideration in dealing with this question.  In my view, no price is too high to pay for the contribution which we get from the judiciary, in the sense that they do hold the balance between the Executive and the man in the street and between one citizen and another.  They do hold the whole public <Col N="578" /> morality in their hands.  It is something for which, as I say, no price is too high to pay.  Consequently, although the salaries proposed may be high&mdash;the increases in this Bill may give high salaries and undoubtedly they are high salaries&mdash;I believe that the country certainly gets good value for the money which it pays in this way.</P>

      <P>I am not dealing with 1959.  Some Senators conveyed that that is important&mdash;no price is too high to pay.  What does that convey&mdash; that no price is too high?  There is some reason for that.  I am submitting that it is unfair even to suspect that the judges would not perform their duties impartially and fairly.  I have the greatest regard for the way they have performed their duties and the trouble they have gone to to try to be fair in interpreting the law as they <Col N="579" /> found it.  That is why I made my comments.  I want to assure the Minister that I did not mean anything else.</P>
      <P>We must give the Chief Justice an increase of £665 and bring him from £5,335 to £6,000 and so on down along the line.  The figure of £350 is the figure for the judges.  It has been contended by the Party which I represent here that in so far as the district justices are concerned, a good case can be made for an increase to them because of the salaries they have which do not appear to be high and for examining their case on that basis.</P>
      <P>Let me quote what the Minister said on 30th May in the Dáil.  As reported at column 1778, of the Dáil Official Reports of this year, he said:</P>
      <P>The Government of which I am a member do their best within their resources to look after the social welfare classes but that is a completely separate issue which should be discussed on its merits at the appropriate time.  In this House, individual Deputies can discuss and decide whether or not the provision which has been made for the social welfare classes is adequate, having regard to all the circumstances.  That is a separate matter and we are dealing here with an entirely different situation.</P>
      <P>But how can we separate the social welfare classes from any other class when dealing with the finances of the State?  We are expected to be impartial in our judgment and in our decisions. How do we cater for the social welfare classes, who recently got an increase of 2/6d., and some of whom live on 30/- or £2, or, in the case of a widow, on 32/6d.?  Can we really separate them when we are granting increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out that if you divided what is being given to the judges, the old age pensioners would get a farthing, but that is not the point. It is probably true, in so far as the numbers involved are concerned, but it is not a fair way to deal with it. Because of that we are entitled to be critical.  I agree that we should have a <Col N="580" /> different type of machinery to deal with the case of judges, or any other citizen for that matter, rather than have the Oireachtas deal with them because here they have no voice.  It could be contended that if somebody's income is being discussed he should have a voice in the matter.  The case could be made for the judges or any other citizen that they should have a say when their remuneration is being discussed.</P>
    <P>That is not so in this case and it is something with which we cannot deal at the moment.  I do not know if the Minister has ever thought about this. The Minister might have a look at the rates of pay and compare the difference between the £6,000 at the top and the £2,250 paid to district justices. There is an enormous difference but they are both administering the law as they find it.  The same people administer the law to the same type of citizens, whether they find themselves before the Supreme Court, the High Court or the district court, and the same responsibility rests on the judge or district justice deciding the issue. Because of the difference the Minister should re-examine the matter.</P>

      <P>I find myself wholeheartedly in favour of this Bill because I feel that thereby I express the views of persons in the community who are least able to defend themselves&mdash;the poor men, the individual who may find himself in trouble with his trade union, or if he belongs to a professional body in trouble with his professional body, because of an endeavour to use the big stick on him, the individual who finds himself in trouble with the Government or the State.  It is to our judiciary that we look for the protection of our rights as human citizens and for the maintenance of our dignity as human beings.  They are one of the three governing bodies of the State. You have the Executive, the legislature and the judiciary.  The judiciary in themselves perform some of the functions of all three.  By judge-made law they have to feel the pulse of the nation; they have to adjust the judge-made law to meet the ever-changing society and social circumstances. Statutory law in itself is only one <Col N="581" /> branch of the law which governs a community.  Decided cases over the centuries make new law.  Decided cases every day of the week in the Supreme Court make new law.  The amount which they are to be paid, or which they should be paid, depends upon a number of factors.  First of all when the Government come to advise the President on who to appoint if there is a vacancy on the Bench, the remuneration must be such that the Government can pick and choose and select the man best qualified to undertake such a serious appointment.</P>

The selection of a judge, whose appointment is to be recommended to the President, is made at a Cabinet meeting.  Nobody knows what takes place at that meeting except the members of the Cabinet who are present.  It was said in the Dáil that judges are invariably appointed for political purposes.  I express no view one way or the other, but I do say that if that has been the method of selection of judges, if such a gross breach of ethics has taken place in the past, there is no reason why for the future that state of affairs should be allowed continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before these various interruptions by Senator L'Estrange, the basis upon which you will remunerate a person depends first, as I said, on the fact that the Minister should be in a position to select those people who are best fitted to fill such high appointments.  That does not necessarily mean they should be the best advocates.  It includes <Col N="583" /> very much more than that.  They must be men skilled in jurisprudence and the science of the law, as well as the science of advocacy, men who are inherently courteous, patient and painstaking, men who have a thorough knowledge of the various legal cases decided over the past 50 or 80 years. They must be men unselfish in their outlook and prepared, when their day's work is finished in court, to study their cases carefully and painstakingly.</P>
      <P>Those are the first factors that must be borne in mind.  The next factor that must be taken into account when you are remunerating persons holding such high office is the regard in which you yourself personally hold that office.  In all walks of life, whether business or otherwise&mdash;as they say in business you pay for the job, not the man&mdash;you must decide on the importance of the position to be filled. You, therefore, decide on what is equitable and reasonable to pay for that position and then you try to get a suitable man to fill it.</P>
      <P>If I may refer to the speech made by Senator Lindsay, he referred to the fact that it is most unfortunate that a matter of this nature has to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I should like, however, to point out that under Article 36&mdash;speaking from memory I think that is correct&mdash;of the Constitution there is no other way in which it can be done.  Whether it is desirable or undesirable that it must come before the Oireachtas instead of before any other body, that has been the decision of the people of Ireland as set out in the Constitution.  It must be fixed according to law.</P>
      <P>Senator Miss Davidson apparently contends that no man should have his salary increased unless there is occasion to look into his kitchen cupboard. I do not think that type of argument should be introduced in a discussion of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is correct.  Senator Miss Davidson did not say that.  What she said was that those who go before the Labour Court have their cupboard looked into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>If I misinterpreted the <Col N="584" /> Senator I apologise.  Our Constitution which, after all, protects the independence of every citizen in the State, makes certain safeguards so far as the judiciary are concerned.  We in the Houses of the Oireachtas have, so to speak, merely a limited jurisdiction. Our jurisdiction is limited by the Constitution decided upon by the people of Ireland, beginning with the words: &ldquo;We, the people of Ireland&rdquo;, stating the wishes of the Irish nation and passed by popular vote.</P>
      <P>The Constitution provides that the salary of the judiciary shall not be reduced during their period of office, but there is a substantial difference between a real salary and a nominal salary.  The real salary of a person may be a certain amount, and the nominal salary of a person may be considerably more.  It depends on whether or not the value of money depreciates.  I respectfully submit it is the duty of the Oireachtas to endeavour to carry out the wishes of the people as set out in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The salaries of all other sections of the community and of other persons in the employment of the State have been very considerably increased so as to bring their nominal salaries and real salaries to some extent into line. In actual fact the real salaries of the judiciary have been substantially reduced.  I personally know a number of the members of the judiciary.  I know at least three brilliant men on the district court bench who were first appointed in the year 1924 and their salaries were then fixed at £1,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Since then the real value of money has depreciated by one-third.  Those men at the moment receive £1,900 per annum, so their real salaries have been reduced by something over 33-?rd per cent.  Even if this increase were granted to them and they got an increase to £2,250, their real salaries would still be reduced by about 25 per cent.  It may be said that we are a deliberative assembly and we will keep to the letter of the Constitution and avoid its spirit, but I do not think that is a very good example to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our judiciary consists altogether of <Col N="585" /> five supreme court judges, seven high court judges, ten members of the circuit court and 41 members of the district court.  The total amount included in this increase is £21,000.  It is proposed to increase the salary of a district justice from £1,900 to £2,250, that is, an increase of £350 each.  The first thing you have to consider is, do you in your heart of hearts really believe that £2,250 is an excessive figure for a district justice.</P>
    <P>Compare it with anything you like. Compare it with the salaries of, say, State solicitors, county registrars, county secretaries, county managers, county surveyors.  The salary of £2,250 is considerably less, proportionately, than should really be paid to a man in that position.  Compare it with your own salaries for a part-time occupation. Consider the amount of time since this House sat last November up to the present.  Consider the number of hours we or any one of us gave to our duties as Senators.  Can we seriously say, in conscience, that a district justice, who has been working from last November up to now, working five days a week, should not be paid at least three times the salary which any of us receives as a member of this House?  Take forty-one district justices or, in round figures, forty, at this increase of £350 each.  It makes a total of £14,000, out of this sum of £21,000 that is in question.  That leaves a balance of £7,000.</P>
    <P>Now you come to your circuit court judges.  I may say that our circuit court judges here are paid very much less than men with similar responsibility even in other parts of this country. Their salaries compare very unfavourably with those of the county court judges in Northern Ireland, having regard to their increased jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In the year 1924, judges' salaries were fixed, when the State was first formed, following the meeting of a select committee.  A committee was formed of all sections of the House. They considered the type of man they required for each section of the judiciary. When it came to circuit court judges they considered that the type of man who would be required as a <Col N="586" /> circuit court judge in this country would be a man who, in intelligence and in earning capacity, would about correspond with the top grade or top rank in the civil service.  At that time, the top rank in the Civil Service was paid £1,700, which consisted of £1,500 salary and £200 cost-of-living bonus. The Dáil and the Legislature at the time unanimously agreed that that was a fair basis for the salary of a circuit court judge and that it would be fair and reasonable remuneration for him.</P>
    <P>There was discussion at the time as to whether the circuit court judges' salaries should be fixed at the £1,500 plus £200 level or whether they would take £1,700 flat.  But, as the salary of a circuit court judge cannot be reduced during his term of office, and as the figure of £200 might vary with the cost of living&mdash;it might go down: there is no reason to believe that the cost of living will always go up&mdash;the figure of £1,700 was agreed to.</P>
    <P>A select committee again sat in 1953.  They had twelve meetings. They considered the same problems. They envisaged those problems, having regard to the common good. The select committee, again in 1953, came to the same conclusion.  They approximated, in 1953, the salaries of the circuit court judges to the salaries of the men in the top rank of the civil service and it was on that level that the increases were based.</P>
    <P>Since 1959, three increases have been given, based again on the cost of living to the top ranks in the civil service.  I do not say the top ranks in the civil service are overpaid.  I want to be clear on that.  If anything, I should say they are underpaid, having regard to their responsibilities. When the Minister brings in this Bill, he is merely endeavouring, in so far as he can, to enable the salaries, say, of circuit court judges to follow the same principles as were set out in 1924 and, again, in 1953.  I feel that the Minister would be playing false to the people of the country, who have set out their views in the Constitution, and I believe he would be playing false to the judiciary if a Bill such as this were not introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> We now come to the salaries of the High Court judges.  Again, if anything, even with this increase that is now being granted to them, our High Court judges are underpaid.  It is all very well to say in a cynical kind of way that £4,000 a year is too high a salary to pay to anybody.  Most people whom I have ever heard saying that any particular salary is too high for anybody to earn said it only when they had given up all hope of ever making it themselves.  Away back in 1924, the salaries of our High Court judges were fixed at a figure of £2,500 a year, if my memory is correct.  Now they get £4,000 a year, despite the depreciation in the value of money.</P>
    <P>This is one of the few countries in Western Europe&mdash;in fact, this is one of the few civilised countries in the world&mdash;where the judges of the High Court must provide even their own secretarial assistance out of their own pockets.  First of all, they must provide their own law library.  Those of us who keep even a modest law library know what that costs.  To keep the law library up to date they must not only have their own sets of reports and decisions but they must have the sets of reports and decisions of all similar legal jurisprudence.  That will cost at the very minimum I should say £150 to £200 a year.  In addition, they must also provide their own secretarial assistance.  They are not provided with a typist or a secretary of any kind.  I should imagine that it must take 15 to 20 per cent. of their salaries to meet those particular expenses.  Yet, we are told that £3,500 a year is enough for them and that an increase to £4,000 for a High Court judge is excessive.</P>
    <P>In all seriousness, Senators know as well as I know that there is not a single small town in this country with a population of 2,000 or 3,000 people where there is not at least one person, if not two persons, making that amount. Still, do we say in all seriousness that that is too high a salary to pay a judge of our High Court, a man upon whom we depend, a man upon whom the poor citizen depends who has no influence of any kind for protection against all sections of the community, <Col N="588" /> protection against the Government, protection against the Houses of the Legislature, protection against all organisations?  We say it is too high? On what basis do we say it is too high? We say it is too high because the old age pensioners have got an increase of only 2/6 a week.  Now, surely the House will agree in all seriousness that that is dragging a red herring across the entire argument?</P>
    <P>There are 160,000 old age pensioners in this country.  An increase of 2/6 a week, which they have got, seems to me to work out in simple arithmetic at £20,000 a week, that is, £1,000,000 per annum.  Assuming you agree about the district justices and the circuit court judges&mdash;I do not know whether or not you do&mdash;it seems to me that there is no other alternative if we approach the matter objectively.  The whole amount in dispute in this case would not give a farthing increase to the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>There is one man in this country who is a very well-known figure and for whose special philosophy I have a very great respect.  He is Mr. Fintan Kennedy, the Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been saying, when business was suspended, that there was one man for whose social philosophy I have a very great admiration: Mr. Fintan Kennedy, secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  For that reason I invariably not only read but reread and study his speeches and I notice that in one speech recently he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We possess all the qualifications, requirements and means except one essential for progress and prosperity. The exception is, of course, the lack of co-operation not only between management and labour, but between every possible combination of interests relating to the economic, industrial, social and political structure of our society.  Much of this lack of co-operation springs from fear, intimidation, apathy and selfishness, but most of it is based on <Col N="589" /> sheer ignorance and failure to appreciate Christian principles.  The failure to work together and live together in harmony is typical of our people in every phase of activity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any member of this House who would disagree with that philosophy and for that reason I deprecate the contrast which has been made in the discussion of this Bill between what the old age pensioner gets and what is paid to the judiciary.</P>
    <P>No person who has a proper outlook on life can be indifferent to the fate and circumstance of those who have least of this world's goods and who, perhaps, are old and ill.  It is undoubtedly the bounden duty of the State to do all that is possible for them. If it were a matter of being able to give an increase to the old age pensioners, to the poor or to the needy, out of the increases which might be given to those thought to have more than an adequate amount, then by all means it would be the duty of this House to refuse to pass this Bill, but the amount involved in this Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with whether old age pensioners get increases or with whether the poor and the needy get increases.  It follows the principle enunciated and carried out by the Oireachtas in the recent past that all public servants should get certain increases based on a certain percentage. That increase was given to every section of the public service, the Army, guards, teachers and the civil service from top to bottom.  Is there any reason why the judiciary should be the ones left out?  Is there any logical reason why they and they alone should be left out of these increases?</P>
    <P>Even in the course of this discussion we have heard many praises of the judiciary.  Do we express our appreciation and gratitude by saying: &ldquo;You and you alone will not get increases although the Oireachtas has spent five and a quarter million pounds on increasing the salaries of other people?&rdquo;  It must be admitted, too, that all those other people are not on the border line of poverty.  Surely that would be showing very little gratitude; surely it would be knowing the cost <Col N="590" /> of everything and the value of nothing; Surely it would be very poor appreciation on our part of the efforts of our judges who, as I think it will be admitted, since the formation of our State, did everything possible to approximate the human idea of law to the Divine principle of justice?  I would submit that salaries of £4,000 to our High Court judges are not unreasonable when their salaries in 1924, when money was worth three times what it is to-day, was £2,500. That was thought reasonable at that time.  That was decided upon then as being in accordance with our idea as a young nation of the value we put on justice, of personal independence, of the right of every man to live his life in accordance with human dignity protected against opposition from any section in the State or any individual in the State.  Particularly when one considers that out of that amount a judge has to pay for the maintenance of his own library and secretariat,  fancy that if anything the amount is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Throughout the existence of this State since 1924 a certain balance has been kept between judges of the High Court, judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice.  From the outset the salaries of judges of the Supreme Court were fixed 20 per cent. more than the salaries of judges of the High Court.  When High Court judges' salaries were originally fixed at £2,500, judges of the Supreme Court were paid £3,000.  That discrimination was not unreasonable because there was no doubt whatsoever that the responsibilities are, and probably the capacity and the abilities should be, much higher in the case of judges of the Supreme Court than of judges of the High Court because once a decision is made in the Supreme Court, be it right or wrong, that is the law of the country for the future.  If it has to be altered that can be done only by an Act of Parliament passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the Supreme Court make the mistake, say, in deciding whether an Act of Parliament is in accordance with the Constitution or against it, that decision is final and conclusive.  The only way it can be altered is by an alteration of the Constitution <Col N="591" /> by referendum to the people. A man does not become a Supreme Court judge overnight so it is not unreasonable that there should be a certain balance and discrimination between the salaries of judges of the High Court and judges of the Supreme Court and a certain discrimination has been kept to date.  A High Court judge gets £4,000 and a Supreme Court judge £4,500.  The balance is not being kept at 20 per cent. but at least there is something of it.  To show our appreciation of the law and those who administer it in this country, I think it is only right and proper that we should express that appreciation in some way and this £500 is probably the minimum which the Government could give.  Otherwise they would be increasing the salary of High Court judges and giving no increase to Supreme Court judges but leaving their salary at £4,000.  Is there any reason why a Supreme Court judge should be insulted in that manner and why that discrimination should not be kept?</P>
    <P>Now we come to the last remaining member of the judiciary, the main occasion of most of the criticism in the Dáil, whose salary was referred to many times here this afternoon: the Chief Justice.  In the history of this State we have had three men who occupied the position of Chief Justice, Judge Kennedy, Judge Maguire and our present Chief Justice, Judge Ó Dálaigh.</P>

The State could carry on reasonably well if the Dáil did not sit for 12 months, if the Seanad did not sit for 12 months and even if the Cabinet did not sit for a long time.  The individual citizen would not be oppressed.  Judges could by their judgments, apply what would be equitable and proper in their construction of the laws of the <Col N="592" /> Country.  When you fix the salary of the Chief Justice it is not a question of pay.  Next to the President of this State, the Chief Justice is the most important man in the State.</P>

      <P>The Chief Justice next to the President is the most important man in the State.  When you fix his salary it is not by way of payment but by way of showing your appreciation of the titular head of the judiciary in this country, the second most important man in this country who is not only important as Chief Justice, and a lawyer of outstanding ability but also is a man who is capable of representing our country at various functions&mdash;a man who is typical of our national life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must be a man who is an ornament to our social life, who spends evening after evening at one thing or another.  I have known even since my earliest days as a student the demands made on the Chief Justice.  If we wanted a subscription or anything, the Chief Justice was always the first man we would approach and we found he was always the most generous.  He has been more at the beck and call of everybody than anybody in a comparable position.  He has to study law in the evening and he has to do all that out of his own pocket.  He could do it out of a lesser salary than £6,000 a year, but when the salaries were fixed, they were fixed approximately one-third higher than the salaries of the Supreme Court judges and a reasonable balance had to be kept with the salaries of the Supreme Court. Supreme Court judges get £4,500; the Chief Justice gets £6,000 and is there any practical reason for departing from that?  It is not the amount of money because three-fifths of it at <Col N="593" /> least goes in tax and surtax back to the Government.  I do not think it is reasonable or proper to criticise the payment on appointment of a salary of £6,000 to the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country who are earning £6,000 and over per annum, many people who have formed their family business into private companies and are paying less than surtax on it and whose income is well over £6,000 a year.  Surely it is no more than we owe them and not so much him as the office he holds? If anything, the salaries we give the judiciary are on the low side compared with other countries.  They are low even when compared with the little section of our own country cut off in Northern Ireland.  They are low compared with smaller countries.  I do think, therefore, it is a very great pity that we should fail to show our respect for democracy and our determination that every man in the poorer sectors of this country will always be protected. I think it is a very great pity we are not unanimous on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Nash but with, perhaps, not quite such enthusiasm, I am very much in favour of this Bill.  I think all sides of the House are agreed on the integrity of the judges and it is a pity in many ways that the integrity of the judges was ever mentioned because there should not be any question about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the judges should be paid the salaries set out here.  I think they are fair, and in all the circumstances, reasonable.  I do not agree, I am afraid, with Senator Miss Davidson who compared the judges with the jurors. The jurors may be in their own way experts, but they are not experts in the law.  I entirely agree with Senator Nash when he points out the immense responsibility our judges have to bear, and the fact that they have to know the law, and knowing the law is not an easy thing.  They do not work just sitting on the Bench.  They must know the law, and as much of our law is made up of case law, our judges must know their cases.  We are not paying them just for doing a job of work on the Bench. We are paying them for their responsibility, <Col N="594" /> for the knowledge they have accumulated over many years and for hard work.  We are not paying them for integrity.  We are paying them for the job they are doing.  I think we are paying them properly, particularly bearing in mind the high rate of tax they pay and that they have to provide for their own secretarial expenses and buy their own law books and periodicals.</P>
    <P>These salaries are quite fair and I support them but there is one point about this Bill on which I am afraid I am not completely satisfied and on which I have heard nothing here today to satisfy me.  Why does this Bill provide that these salaries be paid retrospectively from 1st November?  I am in entire agreement with the argument put forward that there can be no comparison between what is paid to the old age pensioners and the judges' salaries. The amount involved in giving these increases to the judges is in total infinitesimal in comparison with the amount involved in making increased payments to the pensioners.  They are certainly not to be compared from a monetary point of view.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government, who have here a Bill which is fair and reasonable, have made the operative date retrospective and I would ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider making the effectiveness of this Bill run from the same date as the date on which the old age pensioners were to be paid their increased pensions&mdash;not as a matter of money, but as a matter of principle, because I think that when you have a good Bill, it is a pity to destroy it by laying yourselves open to the jibe that there is one law for the rich&mdash;the judges&mdash;and another for the poor&mdash;the pensioners.</P>
    <P>Senator Lindsay said he would like to take the salaries of the judges out of the maelstrom of muddy politics, and I agree with him.  It is pity that this should ever have been made a political matter, and I am sorry to have listened in part to a political debate.  My own feeling is that the salaries of judges are not the only matters that should be taken out of Party politics.  I should like to see something else taken out of Party politics also, and that is the appointment of judges.</P>

      <P>The House earlier debated the Finance Bill which deals with the collection of money for the coming year.  It is in the light of that that I want to underline why I and other Senators who think like me are opposed to the Bill.  It is always difficult for trade union people whose vocation it is to plead and argue and advocate adjustments in salaries and wages to oppose a measure which provides for an increase, but we are doing so in the context of a Government who are providing increases for judges ranging from 10½ per cent. to 17½ per cent. per annum with retrospective effect to the 1st November last, and a Government which at the same time are providing an increase of 2s. 6d. a week on 30s. or 8? per cent. for the old age pensioners, with effect from the 1st August next.  Senators like myself in the Labour Party cannot vote against an increase of 2s. 6d. a week for old age pensioners, neither can we propose an amendment which would increase that 2s. 6d. because such an amendment would be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we are opposing this measure is to underline our dissatisfaction with a Government who treat old age pensioners and other badly-off sections of the community this way while at the same time they are treating judges in this other way. I am not going to enter into an argument about whether the increase for the judges is sufficient or not, or whether it is too much, but I am underlining our dissatisfaction with a Government which can do this and at the same time provide an increase of 8? per cent. for old age pensioners with effect from the 1st August next. I know that our attitude will be misrepresented but if it stirs the conscience of some individual, or perhaps, a few <Col N="596" /> individuals, it will be worth the misrepresentation.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, I noticed that the Minister made a statement in the Dáil that he had not heard one sound argument against the proposals to increase the judges' salaries.  I do not know what has happened since, whether he has heard any good reasons why he should not increase these salaries, but I should like to bring him on a trip down the country and if he wants to get good reasons the people who will give them to him are some of the people employed by the State or who have given good service to the State.  I would not include people in receipt of home assistance, disability allowance, the blind pension or anything else like that.  If the Minister asks these people if they were satisfied that he should give increases of from 12 per cent. to 17 per cent. to the judiciary I believe they would all say: &ldquo;You should not do it until you do something more for us&rdquo;.  It is our duty to keep the people I have mentioned, people who might be regarded as a load on the community, in reasonable comfort but let me speak about the people who are working in the country, the farm labourers who get a miserable increase of six shillings a week, or people working for the State, who have not even got the right to go to the Labour Court, people working for the Board of Works or the Land Commission, or for the Forestry Division.  None of these has received a single penny of the eighth round increase.  They have not got arbitration but are dependent on the goodwill of the Minister for Finance. My regret is that Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Justice, is not Minister for Finance because if he was, we would all be in Heaven.</P>

The Minister for Justice also mentioned that in 1924 the Chief Justice had £4,000 a year and that this increase up to £6,000 meant a paltry increase of 50 per cent.  Against that, he said, all <Col N="597" /> other grades of workers had received an increase of 200 per cent.  I am one of these people but I was not out in 1924.  I was out in 1934 and I had £12 a month.  That is what all male teachers had then, but in 1932 I had £11 a month, Mr. Haughey.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party have made a decision with which I am not in complete agreement, that they would give increases to certain categories of the judiciary.  I was a little bit doubtful about that.  The Labour Party should either have said they opposed the increases completely or that they would give an increase and see that the differential was kept. Something should be done about the differential and a person who has the greatest responsibility should have that differential over the person who has less responsibility.  Senator Nash told us that the Chief Justice is the second most important person in the country but the person who is the most important has got as much as the Chief Justice <Col N="598" /> and that argument did not seem to carry water.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross referred to the retrospection.  I think he hit a very good note when he asked why the old age pensioner should have to wait until next August, but that the judges' increase would be paid retrospectively from November.  There is an under-current here.  We are told quietly along the corridors that it is being done to bring in a certain man and give him the full benefit of the Bill.  It is a pity that that under-current is there.  There must be something in it or people would not be whispering about the place.  The whispers do not come from this side of the House.  I am told I should not refer to sides of the House here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> I believe that every section of the community should get as fair a deal as the judges and the district justices got all the time.  In 1924, the Chief Justice had £4,000.  It was 29 years before it was thought worth while to change that, and he was moved up to £5,335.  Now we find that after nine years it is necessary to add on another 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the arguments that we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other, that it is prestige value or that it is for status reasons we are giving it, that we do not want the Chief Justice to have less money than anybody else.  The Minister gave the number of people in the State earning over £6,000 and seemed to think it would be a terrible disgrace if the Chief Justice earned less money than anybody else.  That seems to me to be the Minister's argument for this increase.  That is what I read into it whether I am right or wrong. We have decided to support the increases for the district justices who do a lot of work, but we cannot support the increases for the higher judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with those who said that the judiciary perform an extremely important function in this country, or, indeed, in any country, that it is of the utmost importance that they should be accepted as men of integrity, as they are, and that it is of the utmost importance that they should be respected by all sections of the community as I think they have always been.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the judiciary should be hauled before Parliament at frequent intervals, and there discussed and criticised as is inevitable when they are brought before Parliament, notwithstanding the Minister's hope that the debate would be conducted with decorum.  I do not think he made that request here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave it at that.  It follows from what I have said that I believe the judiciary should be adequately remunerated, that they should be well remunerated.  That has always been my view and the view of my Party, but I do not think the judges should be extravagantly remunerated, or that they should be remunerated on a basis that would suggest that there is full and plenty for all sections of the community, or on a basis that would suggest that everyone who is dependent on the State, whether as a servant or as a recipient of social welfare, has been fairly and adequately treated and catered for.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the most futile argument that could be advanced in favour of the Bill is the argument that it costs a mere £21,000.  What I want to know is how far you can push that argument?  Where is it to end?  If you push that argument to a logical conclusion you would over-remunerate the small groups, and you would neglect the large groups or the people it would take a lot of money to pay. That, in my opinion, is the meaning of that argument.</P>
      <P>It is just as futile as the argument that we are giving to the judges with one hand and taking away on the other hand in the form of income tax. That argument is unworthy of the Minister.  It is unworthy of any member of the Government.  Surely everyone pays his income tax.  Everyone who is liable pays his income tax and no thanks to him.</P>

I think they are fair, adequate and reasonable and do not require to be increased at this stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash made a very considered and very forceful speech in favour of this Bill.  He spoke with the utmost confidence and I am sure he impressed.  However, I would warn the House not to accept everything that Senator Nash says as factual.  He did tell the House that the present Chief Justice is our third Chief Justice.  He did say that we had only Chief Justice Hugh Kennedy, Chief Justice Maguire and the present Chief Justice.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, he left out completely Chief Justice Timothy Sullivan who adorned the Chief Justice's seat for a considerable number of years.  Perhaps Senator Nash was in a terrific hurry to get from Chief Justice Kennedy to Chief Justice Maguire and in that way forgot Chief Justice Sullivan.  I am only saying that in order to keep the record correct and to warn the unfettered people here that they just cannot accept everything that Senator Nash says as infallible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to remunerate the judges on the income of the highest-earning bracket group at the Bar.  I do not think that is necessary at all.  First of all, I should like to say that all this talk about members of the Senior Bar earning £7,000, £8,000 and £10,000 a <Col N="602" /> year is simply in the realm of fantasy. There may be a very small group that could be named&mdash;they are known all over the place&mdash;who may be earning that sort of money, perhaps.</P>
      <P>The number of men at the Senior Bar, I venture to suggest, who are earning, one year with another&mdash;and that is the important thing&mdash;the salary paid to a High Court or Supreme Court Judge at the present time are few.  I would say that to trot out here that there are people at the Senior Bar earning £10,000 a year, when everybody knows that there might be one, two or three such people in the country, is not facing this Bill in a fair manner, is not facing this Bill in a realistic fashion.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, the position of a judge, and the life of a judge, and the life of a member of the Bar, are two totally different propositions.  There are men who would prefer to toil on and work hard at the Bar, first of all, because they like it and they like the life and, secondly, because they like to earn large incomes.  I make no apology for saying that, perhaps, those men might not necessarily make the best judges.  Those men might not have the best all-round grasp of law. They may be specialising in a particular sphere of the law in this country which is remunerative at the present time but which is only one very small part of the law.</P>
      <P>There are the other men who would prefer to accept the security of the Bench and the more leisurely life of the Bench than the competitive life at the Bar.  It is all right to say that men at the Bar in their thirties or forties are earning good money.  Those men are living from year to year in the sure and certain knowledge that each year that goes past will bring more competition, that each year that goes past will bring more fashionable Seniors in the younger age group who are well known and well respected by the younger age group of solicitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a man goes on the Bench, he is sure and certain that for the rest of his life he has a good salary, a salary at least as much as he could hope to earn at the Bar, taking one year with another, and that, at the end of fifteen <Col N="603" /> years, he is assured of a good and substantial pension.  If he is the Chief Justice, under the Bill, he would have a pension of £4,000.  That is the reason I say it is not necessary to take the earnings of the busiest and best paid man at the Bar or even the second, third, fourth or fifth best paid man at the Bar and remunerate judges accordingly.</P>
    <P>We do not remunerate the County Medical Officer of Health on the earnings of the busiest doctor in the county. For the same reason, we do not remunerate the County Engineer on the basis of the earnings of the busiest and best paid engineer in private practice. We certainly do not remunerate the County Solicitor&mdash;who has a very leisurely, free and easy life, free from worry, free from the task of having to meet the public every day, free from the task of having to meet difficult clients and to try to please them&mdash;on the basis of the money earned by the solicitor who sits up until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and earns, perhaps, a lot of money.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I say that no case can be made for remunerating the members of the judiciary, who have security, who have an easy life, who have pension rights, on the basis of men who work and toil at the Bar and who for a few years may make big money and then may meet unexpected competition and find themselves going back down the ladder.</P>
    <P>The history of the judiciary in this country to date also proves that it is unnecessary to pay extravagant salaries in order to get the best men.  One could very easily get personal in a small country where everybody knows everybody else, but we do know that at least one member of the Bar, who might have been in the higher income group that we hear so much talk about, did leave the Bar and take a seat on the Bench because, weighing one thing with another, weighing one life with another, at that age of his life he preferred the Bench even at the expense of accepting a lower income. But that is not the end of it.  I might be told that that man had got on in years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> There have been&mdash;and I will use the plural being afraid that I might identify anybody&mdash;men in the past who at a very early age adorned the bar library, men who were assured a brilliant future at the bar, men who without a doubt, if they had stuck to private practice, would have risen to the highest income group at the bar, but those men, in the full knowledge that if they accepted a seat on the Bench would immediately be accepting a lower income, accepted a seat on the Bench.  That, in my opinion, conclusively proves my case that there is no comparison between the life of a busy barrister and the life of a judge.</P>
    <P>I really think that this thing about status is so much nonsense.  It would be very much different if the judges had some people working for them who are better paid than they are but they have nobody working for them. This higher income group at the bar who practise before them are men who like that sort of life while judges like the life they have and the question of cash income or earnings does not enter into it.  Surely the secretary of a Department does not look down his nose at an efficient Minister of State simply and solely because the secretary is earning considerably more than the Minister of State, be that right or wrong?  Therefore, I say that the judges whom I have mentioned are at present adequately remunerated.</P>
    <P>This Bill is made retrospective and the proposed increases are made retrospective to the 1st November last.  As far as I know, and I am sure the Minister will at once correct me if I am wrong, this is the first time that increases in judges' salaries have been made retrospective.  I am apparently wrong.</P>

Senator Nash said: &ldquo;Are we to say to the judges: &lsquo;you and you alone shall not have the advantages of the increases that have been given&rsquo;? &rdquo;.  I did not intend to discuss old age pensioners had Senator Nash not introduced them.  Are we to say to the old age pensioners: &ldquo;You and you alone are the only group who are getting an increase and who will have to wait for six months or more after it was passed before it becomes effective? &rdquo; That is what we are saying but now questions are being asked all over the country about why this Bill is made retrospective.  It is maybe a coincidence that by making it retrospective to the 1st November last it gives a substantial increase in the pension of a chief justice who retired some few weeks after the 1st November last. I think that is a dangerous precedent to set by Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>It may be a coincidence but there it is.  In the case of a man of such importance, as Senator Nash mentioned, people are saying that this is the reason why the Bill was introduced and this is the reason why it was made retrospective. It is really reducing members of the judiciary into the realm of criticism, a realm they should not be brought to whether they are retired or active.</P>
      <P>Like some of the other Senators who have spoken I have no objection at all to the increases to the district justices. A good case can be made for them. At present district justices in rural Ireland are being paid less than county solicitors on full time salaries, less than county engineers, less than county medical officers of health.  That is the position at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with that shortly.  When the Minister was increasing the salaries of the district justices he did not give the ordinary district justices in the city of Dublin the same salary as the ordinary <Col N="607" /> district justices in rural Ireland.  I do not know if it is on the basis of the amount of work done.  I venture to suggest&mdash;and I am certainly convinced of it myself&mdash;that a district justice in the country has more work to do than a district justice in the town.  A district justice in the country is entirely responsible for the administration in his own district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was it was wrong.  People make mistakes.  If mistakes have been made, they should be rectified.  The district justice in the country has complete charge of the administration of his own district. The district justice in the city of Dublin operates on the criminal side of the court; tries road traffic cases all day and deals with the children's court and the civil side but he resides convenient to his court.  The country district justice has to be an expert in criminal and civil law.  He must know the Road Traffic Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks for the compliment, Mr. Minister.  I accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>And every Minister. The district justice in the country is responsible for all branches of the civil law and all branches of the criminal law.  The district justice in the city, as well as the district justice in the country, must have a great knowledge of people, but the country district justice must have a great knowledge of rural life and he must be a man of understanding who is able to give a decision on an intricate question there and then.  The city district justice has the assistance, if necessary, of members of the Bar. They are there and can appear before him at comparatively small expense. The country district justice has to <Col N="608" /> depend on the general practitioner who is a solicitor and who is not an expert in all or, indeed, any branch of the law.  The district justice in the country has to bear a higher cost of living&mdash;at least I believe he has.  He very often has to send his children away to secondary schools and certainly has to send them away and pay for their keep in one of the cities when they reach the university stage. The district justice in the city lives convenient to a variety of schools and universities.  The provincial district justice has to forgo the more varied amenities of the city.  I know a case can be made for paying a rural or provincial district justice a lesser sum than the ordinary district justice in Dublin, but I think, if real justice were to be done, the country district justice should be paid a higher salary than his colleague in Dublin.  In Dublin the district justice is paid exactly the same amount as his colleague in Kerry or Cavan.  Why pick on the district justice to differentiate between the city man and his country colleague unless it is that as you come down the ladder and come to the weaker sections you want to be harder with them and not be generous with them?</P>
      <P>This thing of remunerating provincial district justices on a lower level than city ones is part of a very unhealthy and a very undesirable policy which is developing in this country&mdash; the policy of believing that everything that goes on in Dublin is more important, that anything is good enough for the country, that the country does not matter, that the activities of the people in rural Ireland are less important to the nation than the activities of the cities.  I do not subscribe to that for one moment nor does any person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be interrupting the Senator but the country justices got an increase of 17 per cent. while the Dublin district justices only got an increase of 16 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Bill proposes that the country district justice should get £150 less than his colleague in the city of Dublin or Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="609" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>This is fundamentally wrong.  It is unsound.  It is an undesirable practice to give district justices in rural Ireland £150 less than their colleagues in the city of Dublin who have less responsibility, less work and no trouble.  The same distinction is not drawn between the circuit court judges.  There is this undesirable tendency to regard the people of rural Ireland as less important.  There is just one other point I should like to make.  The Minister stressed that there was a certain ratio between the various income groups when the judges were first remunerated here and that there is some merit in continuing that ratio.  The tendency here and all over the world has been to increase the salaries of the people who at the beginning of this century were grossly underpaid and give them something of a living wage.  There is no reason at all why this very wide differentiation should be maintained all along the line.  Therefore, I say with the greatest respect that it is a pity this Bill was introduced at the present time.  I repeat that the higher paid judges are adequately remunerated.  I think the proposal to increase the lower paid district justices is desirable but the provincial district justices should be paid the same salaries as the ordinary Metropolitan district justices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ross, Senator McAuliffe and Senator Fitzpatrick, I cannot understand why these salaries should be retrospective from November last.  It is hard to accept that provision when we consider that other sections are getting increases only from the 14th August next and when we consider that in order to maintain the price of a gallon of milk, in order to restore a penny per gallon taken off at the time of the Budget, the Government found it necessary to invoke the Imposition of Duties Bill. It is difficult for the people to understand these facts and I hope the Minister will reconsider that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I am glad to see the respect certain people on the far side of the <Col N="610" /> House seem to have at present for our judges and our judiciary.  It is a pity they had not the same respect 30 or 40 years ago, but, perhaps, it is better late than never.  I am opposed to this Bill.  I believe the time is not opportune for it.  These gentlemen got an increase from the 1st January, 1960. According to the terms of this Bill, it is proposed to give them an additional increase retrospective to November, 1961.  In other words, after getting what many people thought was a very generous, perhaps an over generous, increase in 1959, less than 20 months afterwards we are proposing to give them a further increase.</P>
      <P>The Bill comes at a time when, as we all know, we have a falling population, high emigration and when, in my opinion, we need a period of relative stability.  The granting of these increases will spur every other section of the community to demand increases immediately.  We cannot blame, say, the agricultural labourers, who are trying to live on £5 per week, or other lower paid sections, if they go to their unions and say: &ldquo;Well, if the Government can give increases of £10 per week to people who already have £100 per week, surely we are also entitled to another increase? &rdquo;  If we are prepared to grant these increases of £10 a week, or £600 a year, which I think we are giving to the Chief Justice, and make them retrospective to last November, how can we close our ears to the demands of the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and the other needy sections of our community?  If we look at statistics we will find that roughly 60 per cent. of our people work for less than £10 per week and that we have 40 per cent., mainly producers and small farmers, people who are helping to keep this country on its feet, working in many cases for £4 or £5 a week.  They have to try and rear families on that amount.  In other words, in Leitrim, Sligo and parts of my own county you would have 30 families trying to exist on the salary we are giving to the President of the High Court.  The Proclamation was quoted here to-day and I should also like to quote from it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Republic guarantees equal rights and equal opportunities to all <Col N="611" /> its citizens and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts cherishing all the children of the nation equally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not believe we are cherishing all the people of our nation equally.  If we grant these increases I believe we will have one law for the rich and another for the poor, because the cost of living affects all sections and it affects the poorer sections more than any other section because they use tea, bread and butter, perhaps, four times a day.  If the Government believe that 2/6 per week is sufficient to cover the increased cost of living for the old age pensioner, or the 10/-, 20/- or 25/- they have agreed to give certain workers in the 8th round wage increase, is sufficient to cover those sections, how can they justify £10 per week to a man who already has £100 per week?  Surely they cannot claim they are living up to our Republican Proclamation about which they often speak and that they are cherishing all the children equally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at the time I was not born.  In 1953 a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann, composed of members of the Government and the Opposition, considered a memorandum submitted by the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court.  I think the district justices also made submissions on their claim for an increase in salaries.  As a result of the Committee's recommendations at that time, the Government increased substantially the salaries of all members of the judiciary.  They received increases varying from £250 to £450 per annum. That was in 1953.  I should like to point out to the House that in that memorandum submitted by the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court they stated&mdash;and I give this quotation because Senator Nash asked if there was any reason why the judiciary should be the black sheep, or if there was any reason why they should be left out&mdash;and I quote from <Col N="612" /> their own memorandum submitted at that time:</P>
      <P>We wish to make it plain that we do not claim any right to have our salaries increased from time to time on account of any temporary increase in the cost of living, whether reckoned by reference to the index figure or otherwise.</P>
      <P>That statement was made in the memorandum submitted by those learned and responsible gentlemen in 1953.  They made a statement like that in 1953 and then waited six years for the increase which they got in 1959, and with which they seemed to be satisfied.  It was paid from 1st January, 1960, and why should it be necessary now to make these increases retrospective to 1961?</P>

      <P>No, I said they got an increase.  I said they got a substantial increase and I quoted the increase varying from £250 to £450. They were satisfied that they could wait six years and then get this other increase.</P>
      <P>In 1959 when this increase was going through, the Taoiseach said that it was not the intention of the Government to give an increase every time the cost of living increased.  As I said, in their memorandum they said that they did not claim any right to have their salaries increased from time to time because of any temporary increase in the cost of living, whether reckoned by reference to the index figure or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> This is being made retrospective to November, 1961.  The increase to the old age pensioners was not made retrospective.  As a matter of fact, they have to wait from last April to next August.  Many of the old age pensioners who heard the good news over the radio last August after the Budget, have passed away to their eternal reward now and will not get the miserable increase of 2/6 a week.</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, we are assuring that the increases to the high court, district court, and circuit court judges will be paid retrospectively to the 1st November, 1961.  Senator Lindsay and Senator McAuliffe said that a rumour is going around the country that the increase is being paid retrospectively for a particular purpose. Senator Lindsay said he would like the Minister to deny that categorically when he is replying to-night, because the rumour is spreading throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Some Senators have said&mdash;and Senator Nash in particular &mdash;that the district justices and the judges have nothing to live on but <Col N="614" /> their salaries.  I was looking at a paper and I saw that in 1958-59 one judge got £1,113 and 15 others got over £400 in travelling expenses and subsistence allowances.  It might be no harm to inform Senator Nash that those gentlemen have more than the salaries we are speaking about here to-night.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash and Senator Ross said it was a pity that the integrity of the judges was mentioned.  I should like to ask who mentioned this question first in this debate?  It was mentioned by the Tánaiste in Templemore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>He may not have been, but members of his Party are here.  I daresay that when the Tánaiste takes himself to Templemore he goes there to speak on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  At least, he mentioned the integrity of the judiciary.  There might be no harm in stating also what the Taoiseach said in Dáil Éireann in October, 1959.  At Column 560, Volume 177 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>I am sure all members of the House accept that the independence of the Judiciary is something which we should try to preserve.  It is certainly something that all democratic Governments strive to uphold, and they try to express that aim in the levels of the remuneration fixed for judges.</P>
      <P>He also said:</P>
      <P>It means putting them into a position in which they will be, as far as possible, immune from improper influence of any kind, and it is no exaggeration to say, in my view, that an adequate and, indeed, a generous basis of remuneration for judges is the basis of their independence.  It has always been so regarded here.  It is, indeed, so regarded everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know who mentioned the integrity of the justices there. Surely it was not the people on this side of the House?  It was the Taoiseach who said: &ldquo;... and, indeed, a generous basis of remuneration for judges is the basis of their independence.&rdquo; I want to know is this increase <Col N="615" /> being given for the reasons stated by the Minister, for the reasons stated by the Tánaiste, or for the reasons stated by the Taoiseach, to make them &ldquo;as far as possible, immune from improper influence of any kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that those are outrageous statements and, in my opinion, they exhibit a mentality, child-like in its innocence and in its ignorance of human nature.  I believe you cannot purchase integrity.  A man is honest or dishonest.  Giving a man extra money will not make him honest.  I am surprised that the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach made those statements. People who accept bribes do so because they are men of light character. Generally, they are rich, well-off people, because it is to the rich who have the power and the influence bribes might be addressed.  Bribes are seldom addressed to the ordinary poor people, or to the ordinary working person, because they have not got the power, and the people would not get value for their money.</P>
    <P>In this country we expect, and we get, integrity from the ordinary people, from the vast majority of Irishmen and Irishwomen.  We get it from the chambermaid, the road worker, and the bank manager.  We do not say that we have to pay the bank manager so that he will not become corrupt or embezzle the funds entrusted to him. Indeed, it is a pity those statements were ever made.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went further and said it was a small price to pay for the preservation of independence and the status of the judiciary.  This Bill deals with only a small, you might say a relatively privileged, section of the community.  It leaves the problem that the weaker and more helpless sections, economically and financially, are untouched.  I am not in favour of the Bill and I definitely am opposed to the provision to make it retrospective to 1st November last.</P>

      <P>The debate in this House I think has, in the main, followed the lines which to some extent it took in the other House.  I suppose that was inevitable but I think that <Col N="616" /> the Seanad, as I usually find it does, has approached this measure in a much more constructive fashion, by and large.  I admired particularly the contributions made by Senator O. Ryan and Senator Nash.</P>

      <P>Contributions of this sort to my mind enhance the reputation of the Seanad and justify the high place it holds in the esteem and affection of the community.</P>
      <P>Senator Miss Davidson, who opened the debate, mentioned a couple of points with which I should like to deal. First of all, she touched on something which interests me very much and that is the high cost of litigation generally in this country.  I want merely to point out that in regard to that matter the Government have taken positive and concrete action.  We have set up what might be called a high-powered committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court, to go fully into the costs and procedures of our courts and to see whether we could in the first instance reduce costs and, secondly, make the dispatch of justice more expeditious.  I am optimistic that valuable and useful results will flow from the work of that committee.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Miss Davidson's arguments generally&mdash;and this I think applies to the arguments put forward by many other Senators&mdash; I think the logical reply on my part is to insist that the Seanad in this regard should compare like with like.  It is no good, I suggest, comparing the salary of a judge of the Supreme Court with the salary of an agricultural labourer or the amount paid to an old age pensioner with the salary of a Senator.</P>

      <P>I think I can agree fully with Senator Miss Davidson there.  If they are not well paid, I am sorry they are not.  I should very much like to see them well paid but that should not prevent us from paying the judiciary well.</P>
      <P>I was not quite clear where exactly Senator Lindsay stood with regard to this whole matter.  It seemed to me that, generally speaking, he expressed himself in favour of the increased salaries but he felt that there was something deplorable in the manner in which it was being done.  There is a simple answer to that.  There is only one way in which judicial salaries can be dealt with and that is by legislation of the two Houses of the Oireachtas. This is provided by the Constitution and, as Senator O. Ryan pointed out, I think it is a very valuable and desirable situation.</P>
      <P>The argument put forward, as far as I could see, by Senator Lindsay was that it is undesirable to bring this matter into the realm of political controversy and political debate.  I am afraid that, in certain circumstances, that is unavoidable.  In 1953 the Dáil set up a select committee to deal with this matter.  Even the setting-up of that select committee and its submission of a unanimous recommendation to Dáil Éireann did not prevent a subsequent debate along political lines on those recommendations in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator Lindsay that it would be desirable that this matter should be dealt with on a basis of dignity and decorum.  I do not think it is my fault that it has not.  I can do no more than come before the Oireachtas with my proposals, give the reasons for them as clearly as I can and then hope that the Oireachtas would accept them as reasonable.  I should like to see both Houses accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government in this matter.  After all, no Government will deliberately set out to do something unpopular or something which is not good politics.  Why should the Government bring in a measure of this sort unless they were convinced that it was the right and proper thing to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> Senator Lindsay made the point that the judicial salaries were fixed with the two Courts Bills which we had in 1961.  Of course, they were fixed on those two Bills only in so far as they were confirmed.  Those two Bills set out to do a very major job, that is, to establish and regulate our courts.  It was necessary in that regard that the judicial salaries which existed at that time should be confirmed in those Bills.  It is wrong to create the impression that judicial salaries were actually fixed at the time of the passing of those Bills.  They were not. The salaries were merely confirmed.</P>
    <P>I am asked to give certain assurances with regard to the timing of these salaries.  I have no hesitation in giving the Seanad the most categorical assurance that 1st November, 1961, was fixed upon by me and the Government because that was the date from which the eighth round increases to the higher level of the civil service became operative&mdash;no other reason.  I feel sure that if some Senators are concerned with rumours which are percolating to any other intent, they will accept that assurance from me.  The eighth round of salary increases worked itself out and came to an end in so far as the higher level of the civil service is concerned in mid-December, 1961.  It is because of that eighth round that this Bill is now introduced.  So these proposals could not be brought into operation at the time of the Courts Bills earlier in 1961.</P>
    <P>When eighth round increases were awarded to the higher levels of the civil service they were fixed to come into operation as and from the 1st of November, 1961, and that is the simple straightforward reason why the 1st of November, 1961, is proposed in this Bill.  Would it not be manifestly unfair, if we agreed that the judiciary were entitled to certain increases in January, 1962, and because of the fact that the Constitution stipulates that we must have legislation to deal with these matters and legislation takes a certain time, that the judiciary would not get these increases until now or next month?  I do not think that would be reasonable or fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The tradition has now been established that Budget increases for social welfare classes become operative in the following August.  As I said in the Dáil, that is a separate matter.  In this regard I am asking Senators&mdash;and I know that most reasonable Senators will agree with me in this matter&mdash;to compare like with like.  The increases proposed for the judiciary are based on and related to the increases proposed for the higher levels of the Civil Service and the date is related to the dates on which those increases became operative for civil servants of the higher level.  That is my simple answer to Senator Ross and I hope he will accept that.  In this matter I am doing no more than trying to preserve the traditional relationship that has existed between the higher levels of the Civil Service and the judiciary.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators&mdash;Senator Desmond was one of them and Senator Miss Davidson, I think, said the same &mdash;said they agreed with the increases proposed for district justices.  I want to suggest to Senators that if they do agree with that they must logically go the rest of the way with me because the Select Committee of the Dáil set up in 1953 considered the whole fundamental basis of judicial salaries and, taking everything into account, all the duties and obligations of the judiciary and so on, they fixed a certain rate of salaries and established these differentials again.  The differentials were first laid down in 1924 and were re-examined and re-established by the 1953 Select Committee.  If Senators accept the increases I now propose for district justices as reasonable and if they accept that the Select Committee of 1953 made proper proposals in fixing the relation of one branch of the judiciary with another, then, because I am doing no more than retaining these differentials, they must agree with all the other salaries right up along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention a point made by Senator Fitzpatrick.  He suggested that in dealing with this matter the lower <Col N="620" /> down the scale we go the harsher the person concerned is treated.  That is simply not so and the table of percentage increases in this Bill disproves that. Provincial justices get 17 per cent. and metropolitan justices only 16 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister but the point I was making was not the differential between city and county circuit court judges but between provincial and metropolitan district justices.  That is the point I was making when I made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear on the surface that there is some validity in that, but that is not so.  The differentials were established in 1924. They were begun by the people at that time in their wisdom and stood the test of time until 1953 when the Oireachtas decided to re-examine the whole basis of salaries.  The Committee came to the Dáil with a unanimous recommendation which confirmed the differentials.  They indicated, having taken everything into consideration, that provincial justices should be paid a certain amount, that Dublin city justices should be paid a certain amount, Circuit Court and High Court and Supreme Court judges a certain amount, and in this Bill I am not interfering with the differentials, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but here is the answer: the Committee in 1953 took that re-organisation into account when fixing salaries.  That re-organisation of district court areas that took place was adhered to and given account to by the Select Committee in 1953 in fixing these salaries.  I am basing my Bill on the results of the fundamental re-appraisal carried out by the Committee in 1953.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick has said that it is a futile and unworthy argument to say that only £21,000 is involved and that anyway half of that will go back to the Exchequer in the form of increased income tax and surtax. I do not know whether it is a futile sort of argument but it is a fact and it is as well to put it on record and establish exactly what we are talking about.  One of the functions of Parliament is to protect the public purse and scrutinise jealously money voted for any particular purpose.  If on this occasion we were raiding the Exchequer to extravagantly enrich some particular section of the community, the Dáil and Seanad should be very much on their guard to deal with the situation but it is as well to establish here, so that we can clear our minds on what real issues are involved, that only £21,000 is involved and that half of that will go back to the Exchequer in the form of taxes and so on.  No matter what way we look at it there are no Exchequer reasons for opposing this measure so any opposition to the measure must be firmly based on the fact that we just do not want the judges to get what they are entitled to in relation to other sections of the community, and let us face that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think as Senator Nash has said&mdash; and very well I thought&mdash;the judiciary are probably&mdash;I do not say the most important&mdash;but one of the most important institutions we have in the State.  I want to say simply and honestly to the Seanad that I have a solemn duty in regard to that institution. The welfare of our community and the happiness of our citizens depend in very large measure and in a very real way on the independence, integrity and quality of our judiciary. I would be very negligent and culpable <Col N="622" /> if I did not do everything I can and should do to protect that institution and maintain its position and dignity in the community.  I would be blameworthy if I shirked what I should do because political difficulties are involved and there are political difficulties involved.  I knew that the measure would be attacked in the way it has been attacked for political motives.  Nevertheless, I felt it to be my duty to do this.  The Government agreed with me and we are coming to the Oireachtas on that basis and in that way.</P>
    <P>I think, whatever the criticisms levelled against us may be, that, by and large, responsible people in the community realise what we are doing and why we are doing it.  It would be an easy way out, as I say, to shirk my responsibilities in this regard and let the judiciary fall behind the rest of the community in regard to remuneration.</P>
    <P>This question of integrity has been mentioned on numerous occasions and what has been said about it has been misinterpreted.  I have never said&mdash;and nobody else has said from our side of the House&mdash;that you must pay the judiciary to keep them honest. I do not think any Senator would suggest that.  I certainly do not suggest it but this is what I do say.  If we want over the years a good judiciary and make sure that the best people are attracted on to the Bench, then we must preserve the salary level of the Bench in relation to the rest of the community.  Is it not obvious that if over a period of years we let the income level of the judiciary fall behind other sections of the community, then over a period you will not get the best people to take appointments on the Bench?  You will get them in a short term but, over a period of years, if you denigrate the position of the judiciary income-wise <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rest of the community, then you cannot expect that you will get the sort of people you need and require.  That is all that is involved. We say that if you want a good judiciary you must pay them and that is a simple straightforward proposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> I recommend this measure to the Seanad.  As I say, it is just put forward by the Executive on the basis of fair play.  We think that the judiciary are entitled to fair play the same as any other section of the community and when we came to examine what should be done for them we simply looked at what is being done for that section of the community to <Col N="624" /> which they are traditionally related in this matter, namely, the higher level of the public service.  We propose to give them increases commensurate and no more than commensurate with what has been granted to that section of the community.  That is the basis upon which I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
