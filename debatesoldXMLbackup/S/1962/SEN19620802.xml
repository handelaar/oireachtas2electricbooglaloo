      <P>This Bill has two main objects.  The first is the furtherance of the piped water and sewerage programme announced by the Government in 1959.  The second aim is to enable me to deal with the problem of air pollution, which has assumed a growing significance in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first objective, Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for the framing of a new scheme of State and local authority grants towards the cost of private water supplies and sewerage facilities.  The importance of private initiative in the solution of the rural water supplies problem hardly needs elaboration.  Senators will be well aware of the many areas in the country where holdings are so scattered that water supplies on a regional or sub-regional basis would be excessively costly in relation to the servable population. In such areas there is no alternative to the private installation.  But there are also areas where the activities of private individuals and co-operative groups could be most usefully employed in harness with local authority schemes, by arranging extensions of such schemes on a private group basis, or by taking individual connections.  Thus the three types of effort on which we rely for the implementing of the programme, namely, local authority schemes, private co-operative group schemes and individual <Col N="1254" /> installations, can be integrated into a single front.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the public and private sectors, which I regard as the most valuable means of overcoming the difficulties inherent in our rural water supplies position, will be assisted by the provisions of this Bill.  The details of the grants scheme under Sections 2 and 3 will be worked out and embodied in regulations.  The new scheme will be designed to stimulate private enterprise, facilitate co-operative group development, and open the way for a closer link between local authority schemes and private initiative. Local authorities are being urged to bear in mind, in planning their programmes, the possible advantages to be derived from co-operation with private groups in the laying of water supply distribution systems.  Local authorities are equipped for the development of large resources, the construction of reservoirs, and laying down trunk mains.  Private groups with the assistance of State and local grants, and technical advice, can in many cases speedily and economically fill in the distribution network.  The advantages of private initiative may in such cases be brought to bear on the larger type of scheme, and the resources of rural organisations in enthusiasm, voluntary work and local leadership availed of to the common benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will also provide the necessary machinery for a unification of schemes of private water supply grants.  There are three such State schemes, operated by the Departments of Local Government, Agriculture and the Gaeltacht.  There is some degree of overlapping between the two first-mentioned schemes, and the Government's intention to combine them into a single scheme has already been announced.  The new scheme would relate to water installations in dwellings only.  Private water supplies for farms and farm buildings would remain the concern of the Department of Agriculture.  The special scheme of water supply and sewerage grants administered by Roinn na Gaeltachta would also remain unaffected.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, on lines similar to those of the Housing Acts, for a stay of <Col N="1255" /> seven years on any valuation increase attributable to the installation of water or sewerage with the aid of grants&mdash;not that it has been the practice of local authorities so far as I am aware, to regard the installation of piped water or sewerage facilities as a reason for revising valuations, and the Bill is not intended to alter that position.  Its intention is to encourage people to instal those services in their homes.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill will empower sanitary authorities to make or guarantee loans to persons installing piped water or sewerage in private dwellings.  In including these sections I have had in mind the need for credit facilities for co-operative groups and I am confident that these provisions will, in combination with the direct grants to be made available under the earlier sections of the Bill, act as a strong incentive to private persons and groups to engage in the installation of water and sewerage services.  The provisions in the Bill relating to loan terms and security are very flexible, and I would visualise, for the limited, short-term accommodation which these groups would require, that formal security would be seldom required.  The widest latitude is therefore being afforded to sanitary authorities for informal arrangements.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will empower sanitary authorities to acquire water or sewerage undertakings by agreement, or, if necessary, by compulsory purchase procedure.  The Bill will enable the initiative to be taken by a majority or by all of the owners in requiring the sanitary authority to exercise their powers of acquisition.  Sanitary authorities will be expected to use these powers in the light of their general responsibilities for environmental sanitation, and to take over, for integration into their own services, where they exist, such water supply and sewerage undertakings as may be offered to them.  In some cases it may be necessary for the sanitary authority in discharge of their responsibilities, to acquire an undertaking compulsorily. The procedure envisaged is that applicable to the acquisition of land for housing purposes, as embodied in the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, <Col N="1256" /> but certain additional safeguards are proposed.  The Minister must be satisfied that acquisition is necessary for the purpose of safeguarding public health or for the improvement of water and sewerage services.  In the case of a water supply, provision is made for the abatement of the normal water charges over a period up to twenty years, so as to take account of the owners' initiative in providing their own supply.</P>
    <P>Section 7 proposes to substitute a new type of water charge for the water rates and water rents which can now be levied on consumers under Section 66 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  The existing law on this subject is both difficult and obscure, and a number of recent court decisions have underlined its inadequacies as a working basis for making and recovering charges for water.  The new procedure will be more straightforward, and will have no connection, as had the old, with rating procedure.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 are intended to assist sanitary authorities in securing the maximum number of connections with water supply and sewerage schemes.  Grants are now available in certain circumstances to persons wishing to connect their premises with public services, and it is proposed to make these grants more freely available. Section 9 will authorise local authorities to make connections themselves if necessary, or to contribute towards the cost.  Between grants and local authority assistance, there should in future be no case of inability to take a connection on grounds of expense.  There may however be cases where an owner refuses to make a connection for other reasons.  In such cases sanitary authorities will be empowered to serve a notice on the owner requiring him to lay a connection not exceeding 100 feet in length.  Provision is included enabling the owner to appeal to the district court against such a notice.  If his appeal is not upheld by the court, the notice will become effective, and he must, subject to penalties, carry out the work.  The power to compel connections has been exercisable by sanitary authorities since 1878.  What the Bill proposes is <Col N="1257" /> to substitute a new procedure for one introduced by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, which proved cumbersome and slow in practice.</P>
    <P>The second main object of the Bill is the control of atmospheric pollution. There has in recent years been a growing awareness of the need for a clean air policy.  The existing law is inadequate and out of date, and the time has arrived for more comprehensive and flexible provisions.  It is therefore proposed to take a power to make regulations controlling sources of air pollution such as smoke, dust, grit or gas; regulating the establishment and operation of trades, chemical and other works, and processes which are potential sources of air pollution; and specifying maximum concentrations of specified pollutants in the atmosphere. Regulations may also be made to cover such matters as investigation and measurement of air pollution, and the licensing of persons and premises with a view to controlling the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere from works or processes.</P>
    <P>I have already initiated the measurement of air pollution in a number of centres.  The results indicate the existence of pollution in varying degrees and measurement will be continued until a reliable picture of the extent and nature of the problem emerges.  While it may not prove to be serious at present we must take account of industrial development which may throw up new problems. A flexible procedure enabling controls to be instituted where and when required is, in these circumstances, the best approach and the Bill provides this by enabling regulations to be made to meet a wide variety of special air pollution problems according as they may arise.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are of a routine character.  The Bill as a whole is designed to bring those parts of sanitary services law which most urgently need modernisation into line with present-day conditions and needs.  Work on the consolidation of a far larger body of statute law dealing with the powers <Col N="1258" /> and duties of sanitary authorities is at present in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The last sentence of the Minister's speech is one of the most welcome, that is, that he contemplates in the reasonably near future a consolidation of the law in relation to sanitary services.  Pending such consolidation the House, in considering a Bill such as this, is considering a further addition to intricate and complex legislation having its foundations in the middle of the last century when conditions were very different from what they are to-day. We are legislating by the amendment of legislation over a century old for modern purposes which are markedly different from those of one hundred years ago.  We should all welcome the consolidation of the sanitary services code into a single piece of legislation.  Meanwhile, we must consider the proposals the Minister has put before us to-day.</P>
      <P>The first thing which has to be said is that the question of the need for better services, both water and drainage, in rural areas is not in any sense a matter of Party contention.  It is a matter on which there will be general agreement, and has been general agreement, amongst all Parties. We have seen in recent times a further move towards general agreement that the best approach to the provision of water in rural areas is an approach which does not depend on a single solution to the problem.  There should be an approach that seeks to use regional schemes where they are appropriate, but only where they are appropriate; to use group schemes where they are appropriate, but only where they are appropriate; and to use individual schemes where these are the most appropriate solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach has been advocated in many quarters in recent years.  It is a good thing we have now an unequivocal statement from the Minister that he is in agreement with this approach.  The most dangerous thing that has happened in regard to this problem of rural water supplies is that many people who have talked on the <Col N="1259" /> subject&mdash;some of them inside the Houses of the Oireachtas but many more throughout the country&mdash;have spoken as if one single approach could solve the problem.  Indeed, we have had an even worse situation where some people spoke as if one particular approach they disliked could not anywhere or under any circumstances be the appropriate solution to the problem of the provision of rural water supplies.  It is good therefore that there should be general agreement that what is needed is to seek a proper combination of these three approaches &mdash;regional schemes, co-operative group schemes and individual schemes&mdash;in order to get the best overall solution.</P>
    <P>There are a few provisions in this Bill which will enable this work to be done more expeditiously.  For example, it is a good thing that under this Bill we can, as it were, use the enthusiasm of the co-operative group for the purpose of initiating a private scheme, either water or drainage.  But, when that scheme is built and running, it can then be acquired under this Bill for operation and maintenance by the local authority.  The local authority would not have the same initiative in providing a scheme in the locality but they are far better suited for the maintenance and operation of the scheme once it has been installed.</P>
    <P>As to the provision which the Minister makes in regard to rural water supplies and drainage schemes, there is not very much need for prolonged discussion.  But there are a few points I should like to raise at this stage.  The Minister has indicated that on the question of loans or guarantees to co-operative groups it is his intention that a simple loan procedure would be carried out and that there would be no question of full mortgages in the loan procedures to co-operative groups.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider if there would not be a still simpler procedure for dealing with some of these problems, particularly in regard to connections.  That is where the local authority would do some of the actual work.  They would have the power to do so under Section 9 of the Bill.  The simplest procedure by which the local <Col N="1260" /> authority could recover their money might be if they were empowered to make an annual or other recurring charge in respect of the work which had been done.  In my reading of the Bill I do not see any section under which that could be done and I do not know if it could be done under any other Bill in the sanitary services code.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister's advisers, who know their way about this code, could tell us whether it would be possible in regard to connections and in regard to the construction of schemes under certain circumstances for the local authority to do the work and to make an annual charge rather than going through a loan procedure.  From the point of view of the administration of the local authority the procedure of an annual charge would be much simpler than going through a loan procedure, however simple.</P>
    <P>Another point which arises on this Bill refers to the acquisition of private schemes.  This is under Section 6 of the Bill.  Here we have another instance of something which will be done under compulsory purchase order procedure.  We know that procedure is a troublesome and often complicated one.  Before this House would add in any way to the domain of compulsory purchase they should scrutinise extremely carefully the way in which this will be done.  Under this section the local authority can acquire a private scheme by means of compulsory purchase.  In subsection (2) of the section the Minister has provided for a statutory objection which must be considered against compulsory purchase. It is a statutory defence if the work is not necessary for the purpose of safeguarding public health or improving sewerage facilities or water supplies.</P>
    <P>I see a slight ambiguity in this as drafted.  We have here, on the one hand, a sanitary authority which acts throughout a given area and, on the other hand, we have a group scheme which operates in an extremely small area in contrast to that of the local authority.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the public health and the sewerage facilities and water supplies mentioned in this statutory objection <Col N="1261" /> apply to the area of the group scheme in respect of which the Order is being sought or whether they apply to the whole area of the sanitary authority.  There is a difference between the two.  There is a very great difference in seeking a compulsory purchase order to take over a group scheme in order to provide better water facilities within the area served by that group scheme.</P>
    <P>If it can be shown there is any deficiency or that improved facilities can be provided within that limited area, it is reasonable that this can be given as a reason for compulsory acquisition of the scheme.  But is it so reasonable that the sanitary authority could acquire a private undertaking for the purpose of improving its water supply facilities or drainage facilities elsewhere?  Is it so reasonable that a sanitary authority should be allowed, merely for economics or convenience in the operation of its water supply throughout its whole sanitary area, to acquire something which has been initiated, something which has been constructed, something which has been paid for by a group co-operative effort?  I think here the case is nothing like as compelling and I should like to ask the Minister then what exactly is his intention in this section and, having told us his intention, would he satisfy us that the legal force of the section, as drafted, corresponds with that particular intention?</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to this question of compulsory purchase which I should like to raise.  It is a technical point.  As we know, these proceedings can be awkward.  They can turn on minor details.  Section 6, subsection (1) (c) refers to the various things which may be construed as part of a sewerage undertaking and which can be acquired under the C.P.O. procedure.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this point to the Minister: under this section, part of the things which can be acquired are tanks and other things, for the purpose of drainage or sewage disposal. The position is that there are today in sanitary engineering three <Col N="1262" /> divisions in regard to the treatment of sewage.  There is drainage; there is sewage treatment; there is sewage disposal. Now, if I were ever to give evidence as an expert witness in that particular field, I would have to say that there are many tanks, and many things, which, from the point of view of the sanitary engineer, are part of a sewage undertaking but which are not for the purpose of sewage disposal but, rather, for the purpose of sewage treatment.</P>
    <P>The question then arises whether sewage disposal as defined in this section does, in fact, include sewage treatment.  In order to find a definition, I think we shall have to go back to Section 30 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878.  If we go back to that section, we find a recital of what constitutes sewage disposal but, of course, the methods of sewage treatment and sewage disposal in 1878 bear very little relation to the methods of sewage treatment and sewage disposal at the present day.  I raise this point because I think it is a point on which possibly a C.P.O. procedure, which everybody, both the private group and the local authority wish to go through, might fail either before the Minister's inspector or possibly, on appeal, to the circuit court judge.</P>
    <P>Again, I think it is important that we should scrutinise the whole of this section remembering that we are adding to the compulsory purchase order code.  Under subsection (5), if there is any default in interest, or on the loan or the guarantee by the local authority, the statutory objective based on the condition of the undertaking or the needs of public health in the area cannot be made.  There is nothing in this Bill, as it stands, which indicates the manner in which loans are to be made, or guarantees given, in respect of these private co-operative group schemes.</P>
    <P>The position could arise under the Bill, when it becomes law, that these schemes would not be based on joint and several liability and that actual independent loans might be given&mdash;or, indeed, more probably independent loans might be guaranteed by the local authority&mdash;and I ask the Minister is it then equitable that, if one person who is being guaranteed a loan under <Col N="1263" /> a group scheme defaults on his interest, all the others, except this one, who came together in order to form this group scheme, should be robbed of their right to make the statutory objection before the inspector at the public inquiry?  It might be that, under the regulations made under this Bill, the Minister would ensure this would not happen.  I should be glad if he would deal with this point.</P>
    <P>Another innovation in the Bill is the streamlining of the procedure in regard to compulsory connections. This procedure is now simplified.  I think this simplification is justified. There is absolutely no question that, in regard to compulsory connection to drainage schemes, the procedure should be as simple as possible.  I do not think the case is quite so compelling in regard to water supplies, and I do not think that it is quite so necessary in the case where persons have a non-piped water supply, which they consider necessary, that the local authority should be able, by a streamlining procedure, to force them to connect to a public supply.  However, this is a minor point.  I do not wish to make anything of it except to say that I think the argument in favour of compulsory connection by means of a streamlined procedure is a far more compelling one in regard to drainage rather than in regard to water supply.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives power to close the gap between the public water supply and the private connection.  That is something that does remedy a deficiency in previous legislation and it will be very welcome.  Indeed, I know it was a problem in the neighbourhood of my own home in Cork.  In Bishopstown, the problem was a very real one.  I am glad that this, and similar problems, will be remedied by this provision.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill, the Minister mentioned that he had two main objectives, and I should like now to deal with the section in relation to air pollution which is the second objective of the Bill.  I should like to say straight away that I think it is a pity that the Minister in a single section in a Bill dealing with sanitary services saw fit to introduce this new legislation <Col N="1264" /> in regard to air pollution.  It is a very great pity that the Minister did not introduce a separate Bill in regard to air pollution.  The problem is an extremely important one and I would ask the Seanad to bear with me while I indicate the reasons why I think the problem is so important that it should be tackled in a separate measure, that the whole problem, indeed, should be tackled in a different manner from that in which the Minister has tackled it in this single section of this Sanitary Services Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that air pollution is a serious problem.  The first thing we have got to get into our minds is that it is a problem here and now in Ireland.  It is not a question that it would become a problem after further industrialisation.  Air pollution is already a problem in Ireland.  The preliminary isolated samples that have been taken indicate that Dublin and Cork can be compared with the industrial cities of England, Scotland and Wales in regard to air pollution. Dublin and Cork show a degree of air pollution which can be compared with that in Coventry, Glasgow and Cardiff. We have got to realise then that we already have this problem of air pollution in our larger cities.  We have got to realise that we have air pollution. We have got to realise the kind of atmosphere in which we are living. We have got to realise that the emission of smoke, grit, dust and noxious gases is something which has first, a permanent effect on health and, secondly, can have an epidemic effect on health.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the industrial revolution in England during the last century was the fact that in the industrial towns many health problems arose.  The disease of rickets, which is directly linked with air pollution, was known during the 19th century as &ldquo;the English disease&rdquo;.  We have in urban concentrated areas permanently higher rates of illness and incapacity from respiratory diseases.  As we all know from reading of them from time to time, we can have epidemics, due to the question of air pollution, which are every bit as serious as epidemics from other causes.  They have occurred all during this century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> In Glasgow, in 1909, there were 60 deaths; in Liege, in 1931, there were 64 deaths; in Donora, Pennsylvania, in 1948, in a population of 12,000&mdash;think of any town you know with a population of 12,000&mdash;there were 18 deaths within a couple of weeks, all directly attributable to air pollution.  In 1952, in the London smog, there were 4,000 deaths directly attributable to air pollution.  We can see in regard to this London outbreak that no worse epidemic has occurred in London since the early years of the last century than this outbreak attributable to smog other than the cholera epidemic in 1854 and the influenza epidemic of 1918 and 1919.</P>
    <P>We need not think we are exempted here.  Recently, in reading some American literature on this subject, I was rather shocked to find, among the list of cities where there was a direct connection between fog, smog and respiratory diseases, that Dublin was mentioned as one of the cities in which the link had been definitely established.</P>
    <P>Not only has this an effect on human beings but it has also an effect in the smaller towns on animals and also on plants.  Indeed the respiratory disease due to the London smog of 1952 was first diagnosed in prize cattle which were in London for the Smithfield Show.</P>
    <P>The position is that there is a permanent effect.  Indeed, even the deconcentration of factories may not avoid this problem completely.  It is a problem that affects not only health but many other factors.  Indeed, a commission in England has reckoned that air pollution in Britain in 1954 cost the nation £250,000,000.  That was the calculated sum of the direct costs which could be directly attributed to air pollution.</P>
    <P>The first point then is that this is a severe problem and that it is a problem that exists in this country.  The second point to be remembered is that air pollution can be controlled.  Dark smoke can be avoided.  Indeed, dark smoke can be avoided by the proper use of fuel.  Every time the emission of dark smoke is reduced, it means that fuel is being more efficiently <Col N="1266" /> burned.  Indeed, the saving in fuel consumption, it has been found, more than repays any work done in order to prevent this dark smoke emission.</P>
    <P>With regard to diesel smoke from which we all suffer, we have all had the experience of travelling behind a diesel lorry belching out black smoke mile after mile, very often making us anxious to take an undue risk in trying to pass out the lorry and get away from the diesel smoke.  Diesel engines, if properly maintained, properly serviced and properly driven, need not emit smoke except, possibly, when starting off.</P>
    <P>Grit and dust can be removed but only at considerable expense.  That brings me to the approach which the Minister has made in the Bill.  The Minister has in this section of the Bill indicated that he intends to move in regard to the control of industrial pollution.  I would ask the Minister to remember that, while air pollution costs the nation money, the cost of controlling air pollution, which is apparently going to fall completely on individual industries, is itself tremendous.  To reduce the emission of grit and dust, to get proper removal, involves an expenditure which may amount to 10 per cent. of the total cost of the whole industrial plant.</P>
    <P>This is a tremendous burden for any industry to bear.  It is a tremendous burden to ask any industry in times of increasing competition to add ten per cent. on to the cost of new buildings in order to ensure that there will be proper control of air pollution.  The higher standards are fixed for air pollution, the higher this cost will be.</P>
    <P>If, for example, a certain plant could remove 75 per cent. of the grit and dust and the Minister requires that to be increased to 85 per cent., to go from 75 per cent. to 85 per cent. removal will cost three times the amount of money.  The plant required to go from 85 per cent. to 90 per cent. removal will cost five times as much as the plant that would give 75 per cent. removal.  This would be and will be a tremendous burden upon industry.</P>
    <P>Now I come to this point: the Minister <Col N="1267" /> should realise that industry is not the only offender and the preponderating offender in regard to air pollution. It is already on record in regard to such investigations as have been made of air pollution in this country that 50 per cent. of air pollution in Ireland comes from domestic chimneys. These chimneys do not emit dark smoke as villainous-looking as the smoke from industrial chimneys but they do emit it at a lower level and it can be equally dangerous.  The Minister should realise that this is a problem of which the industrial part is only half.</P>
    <P>In tackling the problem, not only must the Minister recognise this but he must also recognise that the problem is one which may be a great burden on industry.  For that reason, the Minister, in regard to air pollution should take every care to have full consultation with industry.  That is why I regret very much that the new legislation on air pollution, welcome as it is, should have been introduced in the way it has been introduced; that it should have been a section in a Sanitary Services Bill; that it should have been one section of a Bill with something like fifteen sections in it and that it should have been introduced by the Minister when it takes up only two paragraphs in the introductory speech he made on this Sanitary Services Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have been better advised if, before introducing any legislation, he had sought not only advice but, what is much more important than that, the active co-operation of industry.  If the Minister had issued a White Paper describing the problem, what was known in regard to it in this country and then invited industry and others interested and then following this, if he had come with a separate Bill, that, I think, would have been a better start to this problem.  It is only by co-operation that anything can be done in this regard.  Only a public authority can enforce the law in regard to air pollution but it is only a private industry or a private householder who can abate air pollution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> Here we have the old problem as regards somebody who wants to enforce a standard and somebody else who has to pay for that standard to be enforced. I would urge the Minister, before he makes any attempt to make regulations under this Bill, to have the fullest possible consultation with industry on these points.  If this co-operation is not secured, the legislation which the Minister is seeking now and the regulations which he will issue under it will be merely punitive legislation against industry.</P>
    <P>There are some minor points in regard to the way in which the section is drafted but it is more proper to leave that for discussion on the section during the Committee Stage. The vital point is that this must be a co-operative effort, that the Minister must move not on his own but that the Minister and industry must move together.  It is not enough to say the Minister will consult the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Having the goodwill of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not enough.  There must be goodwill, understanding and complete co-operation from industry which will have to pay for what is provided in this section.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I regret that the new legislation on air pollution which is so terribly necessary and so very welcome has come in this manner.  I feel the Minister has taken a slightly false step here in the beginning and I hope he will be very quick to redress that and to have the fullest possible consultation.  A great tribute should be paid to those industries in Ireland who at considerable expense have already installed plant in order to reduce air pollution in the absence of any legislation that could compel them.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for what it does in furthering the provision of water supplies and sewerage in rural areas and for the fact that it makes a start in regard to modern legislation on air pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on bringing in this very good Bill.  Since he became Minister for Local Government, he <Col N="1269" /> has exerted great pressure to get water supplies and sewerage into every house in the country.  Naturally he came up against some difficulties in regard to legislation and in Section 2 of this Bill he has done a very good job by removing the restrictions which existed up to now that if a person wanted to instal water and sewerage, he had to go to the trouble of getting a certificate from the local authorities giving permission to do so.  If there were any possibility of piped water or sewerage coming into that area, he could not get permission to instal private water and sewerage.  Many people who tried to instal water and sewerage in those areas which were not convenient to the town were always being promised that the local authority would extend water and sewerage there but years and years have gone by and it has not been done.</P>
      <P>I would say the Minister was disappointed with the progress made under the group schemes.  There have been too many difficulties about getting group schemes going, which is a pity.  Some of the group schemes failed because the advice given by engineers from the local authority and from the Department was that a large number of houses should be taken in. My idea about the group schemes was that if three or four houses cooperated, they could form a group scheme, that they could be supplied with water from the same well and with the same pump and make an arrangement about the charge.  Apparently it did not work well.  A great deal of local co-operation and organisation would be needed to get these group schemes going.  There was always someone who would not go into the group scheme and that destroyed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in Section 3 that the sanitary authority may give supplementary grants.  I would suggest that instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; it should be &ldquo;must.&rdquo;  Several sanitary authorities throughout the country did not give any supplementary grants for years and that held up progress in the reconstruction of houses and the installation of water and sewerage.  For four years, the Westmeath County Council refused to <Col N="1270" /> give supplementary grants.  The fact that local authorities did not give supplementary grants during that period put us back years.  Even today, they would not be giving them but for the fact that the Minister made a very strong appeal to all local authorities last year to give these supplementary grants.  It should be compulsory on all local authorities to give such grants.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (11) defines a domestic water supply and according to that section water may not be used for washing a car or watering the garden. I do not know how the Minister will enforce that section.  At the present time, a hose or plastic tubing is very easily obtained and if a person connects that to the tap in the kitchen or in the scullery and puts it out through the window to wash a car, I am quite certain he would not be caught in the act.  I never like to see anything in a Bill which cannot be enforced and I am afraid that section of the Bill will never be enforced.</P>
    <P>Section 8 gives compulsory powers to make people connect with the public water or sewerage.  If it is necessary to go through some other person's land to do so, the local authority may do it and compensate the owners for the land.  I should like to know who will pay for that.  Is it the local authority, the Department or the owner of the house that is connected?</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with air pollution which Senator Dooge has gone into very fully.  There is a provision I should like to see in the Bill, that is, a provision dealing with pollution of streams which is very common where bad septic tanks have been installed. People who have not looked for grants have put in sewerage equipment which is really a danger to health.  Some action should be taken against people who instal such bad septic tanks and thus pollute streams.  There are several cases of it in my area and I suggest there should be some provision in a Bill of this kind to stop it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The contribution made by Senator Dooge was a very welcome one in that its constructive character may be of help to us as we are at the moment working on further consolidation of our sanitary services legislation. <Col N="1271" /> That contribution can be of considerable benefit to us in the Department of Local Government during the months ahead.  I should like to say that this consolidation, as is probably well understood, represents a considerably wide problem and while we have been working on it for a fairly lengthy period quite an amount of work has yet to be done.  While our object is that a consolidating Bill may emerge in the not too distant future, I am reluctant to predict the exact date but I do assure the House it will be introduced with all possible expedition.</P>
      <P>There has been a reference to my supposed conversion to the idea of regional group schemes and private schemes.  I should like to say I never had to be converted in this matter. In fact, I have been pushing the approach on these fronts from the very outset.  I had always been in favour of such a solution even before there was a means of attaining it.  The explanation of this misunderstanding, as Senator Dooge has said, from the attitude of some who were opposing the idea of water and sewerage for all of our people, is that in the flurry of excitement many things become confused, including the alleged attitude of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I have never had any other idea than that of solving this problem, even if the solution of it required the absolute and utmost effort of the private individual, group initiative and the fullest co-operation of the local authorities in conjunction with my Department. If my reiteration of that fact helps to clarify the views of the Department of Local Government, I am very glad the matter should have been raised in order that I should have the opportunity of confirming that this has been, and will continue to be, the only sane approach to the provision of water for rural Ireland which is the aim of all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of loans to groups and the consequences of default on the part of members of a group has been raised.  I am afraid we may be looking at two different aspects of this matter. As I see it from what little experience <Col N="1272" /> I have had, the need for this guarantee loan has arisen to a large degree in respect of groups who propose to carry out schemes costing perhaps £5,000, and during the course of the construction of the scheme a sizeable amount of money is involved which is recoverable to a large degree by grants from the Department and the local authority.  That type of accommodation will be only of very short duration and will be very secure in that the allocation of a grant is very often accepted by the local bank manager and the local builders' providers as adequate security for materials delivered on site.</P>
    <P>If one person enters into a commitment to repay a loan in respect of his portion of the cost of a group scheme and that person defaults, it has been said the other members of that group are penalised if, as a result of the defalcation, the local authority go to compulsorily acquire the entire scheme.  It is not our belief that individuals should enter into individual contracts where a group scheme is in progress.  The system should be that one or two persons become the spokesmen or, shall we say, the trustees of the group and facilities for loans and advances may be made if within the group they have their own internal apportionment of the amount of loan that is made available for the group and it is not for the local authorities to differentiate between one or other members of that group.</P>
    <P>The default will be in respect of the group even though the contract may have been initiated by one person.  The group acts as a unit and if there is a default ultimately it must be regarded as the default of the group rather than any small part of it.  It is better that it should be like that because otherwise local authorities just could not operate this guarantee loan scheme at all because it would be too cumbersome with small amounts of money creating a lot of bother, and they would just throw the whole thing overboard because it would become a nuisance.  The Senator who mentioned the matter and the other members of the House will, I hope, appreciate it is not at all an unfair position in which to place the group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> The question was also raised of the definition of sewage disposal and as to whether the Bill as now introduced covers both the treatment and disposal of sewage.  As far as I am advised, Section 6 covers the matter in full. Under that section both the treatment and the disposal of sewage are adequately covered so that there are no grounds for the fears expressed by the Senator who raised this matter.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding suggestions Senator McAuliffe made is one which naturally appeals to me as a Minister for Local Government trying to push a scheme such as we have at the moment in regard to water supplies for rural Ireland.  He thought it would be a good idea to have it made compulsory for local authorities to give supplementary grants.  That would appeal to me as Minister but, personally, it would not appeal to me.  It would just have the very opposite effect to that intended, to my mind, speaking as a former member of a local authority.  If we are to get what we require from local authorities&mdash; their co-operation&mdash;by trying to make compulsory any outpayment of supplementary grants, while we would get the grants in many cases, we would lose their very valuable co-operation on the whole front.  Any gain would be counterbalanced by the loss of the goodwill which I think we now have from our local authorities.  For that reason, and for general reasons, I do not like imposing compulsory burdens on local authorities and we have not even now contemplated making payment of supplementary grants compulsory.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I should acknowledge with very deep appreciation the effort made by our local authorities in the last year or two&mdash; particularly last year&mdash;in the matter of supplementary grants where heretofore they did not pay them.  For many years, many local authorities did not pay housing or water and sewerage grants but I am glad that at present our local authorities have changed their attitude and how very few of the local authorities&mdash;speaking more of county councils than urban councils&mdash; are not paying supplementary grants <Col N="1274" /> for housing, reconstruction and repair and water and sewerage, particularly the latter?  They have really improved the position very greatly and my thanks are due to them because without that new, willing approach on their part, our progress under the heading which we are now discussing would be very much slowed up.</P>
    <P>The meaning of &ldquo;domestic water&rdquo; has been somewhat confused.  This was so to a very great extent in the Dáil discussion.  It was found necessary to define domestic water in this Bill because as the House is aware, urban district residents enjoy something which others do not enjoy&mdash;up to the present they are entitled to a free supply of water for domestic purposes.  Outside the urban district, that is not so.  We propose in the Bill to continue that advantage to the urban districts and that makes it necessary to define what they may not be charged for rather than putting a premium on what they may be charged for.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that to connect a hose through the window to a tap in the kitchen and use it for some purpose outside may not be done in future but the fact is that at present it is actually illegal&mdash;an offence in law &mdash;without the consent of the sanitary authority so to connect a hose to a tap in the kitchen and use it for any purpose outside.  What we now say in this Bill is that if you are using a hose in that way, the local authority may charge you for it.  That applies to urban districts because of the advantage they have enjoyed over the years and which we propose to continue, of getting domestic water without special, extra charge.  We are defining what they are entitled to get for nothing.</P>
    <P>Some urban authorities at the moment charge a special rate for the use of the hose; the nearest one I can recall is An Uaimh, County Meath. Nobody has really suggested that any great disadvantage has resulted.  In other places, where probably there is an adequate water supply, the use of a hose has not been subject to a charge.  If a local authority propose to continue that practice, there is nothing in the Bill to compel them to <Col N="1275" /> do otherwise, but if they wish to make a charge, they have the power to do so.  The Bill does not remove the illegality there was in the use of a hose under the old Act, but if you use it, the local authority may now make a special charge for it.</P>
    <P>Possibly quite a lot could be said for the approach of Senator Dooge in regard to air pollution, that the subject is so important that it should have been a separate Bill rather than a small part of the Sanitary Services Bill.  I agree on the question of its importance, but as regards its being a separate Bill, obviously I have not agreed as it is part of this Bill.  It should be pointed out, however, that this is just a start in attempting to grapple with what has been and will become a problem in future, air pollution, and all the consequences that follow.  Our experience, gained from the powers we are taking in this Bill, will be a guide in the future and if experience shows a different approach to be necessary&mdash;a more elaborate statute perhaps&mdash;the knowledge we have gained from the operation of the sections in this Bill will help us more authoritatively to approach the matter in future.</P>
    <P>As the Senator said, industry could carry quite a considerable burden if air pollution laws were to be enforced for the abatement of smoke, gases, grit and other substances.  The requirement in the Bill to consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not merely an empty formula.  It is placed there designedly so that not only shall my Department have the goodwill of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but that he will, through his officers and experts and his contact with industry, be able to advise us on the consequences that might follow something which would seem good to us but which could, in fact, be ruinous for some industry or industries.</P>
    <P>In addition to those safeguards, I mentioned in the Dáil that we think there is very good reason for setting up consultative bodies and advisory bodies and committees to consider the various aspects of the matter.  That is <Col N="1276" /> something to which I am giving consideration, and if it holds out a hope of improving what we have in mind, and providing safeguards where safeguards are needed, we may set up a number of advisory bodies of specialists in their own field to deal with the particular approach to the problem affecting a particular group in the community.</P>
    <P>While I mentioned industries specifically, it is not true to say that we are not unaware of, have forgotten, or are ignoring the fact that 50 per cent. of the pollution is caused not by industrial use or abuse but rather by domestic use, by fires and flues and so on.  If we can pinpoint the problem in our growing industrial atmosphere, and if we can get steps taken to avoid pollution when an industry is being established, that would be the most economic way of having the job done, as well as being the least irritating to the industrialist.  A great deal could be done in the building and equipping of factories and we could, as it were, forestall the pollution that might be caused.  In that way we could cut down the cost of abating the nuisance.</P>
    <P>We are fully alive in the Department to the idea of full consultation with the various industries.  All will agree that it would defeat our ends if we were to take some precipitate step on the question of the abatement of air pollution which would have the effect of souring the people whose goodwill we must have.  I can assure the Senator who raised the matter, and the House, and the industrialists concerned, that the Department wish for the fullest co-operation and understanding of the problem.  We wish to approach the matter together rather than from the opposite direction.  If we do it in that way, we will find that we will be able to make a dent in this difficult problem and, indeed, go a long way towards wiping it out altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that at present if a person wishes to instal water for domestic use, for toilet facilities, <i>et cetera,</i> if he is not more than 100 feet from the water main he will not qualify for the grant.  If such is the case, a person who is anxious to instal those facilities&mdash;and there may be a number of people together: the main may be passing by a group of houses or a single house&mdash;and if he is not over 100 feet from the main, he will not qualify for the grant.</P>
      <P>I submit to the Minister that here is an opportunity of putting that matter right.  I know one man in County Cork who has made an application for a grant.  He is not sure but he thinks he is on the 100 feet mark.  He thinks he is just inside it.  He is anxious to have those facilities but if he is inside it, he is out under the present regulations.  He is just an example. We now have an opportunity to put such shortcomings right.  I would ask the Minister to give us his views on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is, and has been for the past couple of years, that under the law we were practically debarred from paying the grant if the distance from the premises in question to the nearest sewer or water main were less than 100 feet.  I might add that, up to 1960, no grants were paid by anyone for connection to the public water main or sewer, but, in 1960, we brought in this because we felt that its reasonable use in the application of these grants could further the extension of the all-over plan and, indeed, add to <Col N="1278" /> its economics, and that a greater number would be served, whatever the expenditure already incurred had been. As I say, the limitation in the law remains, and up to the moment we are practically debarred from paying any grant for anything within 100 feet of a water main.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, that debarment, as it were, is disappearing, which means that the Minister of the day may, under whatever administrative regulations it may be necessary to draw up, pay where the distance is under 100 feet.  That is not to say that he will pay, but he is not debarred from paying. The Minister will have a freer hand to utilise the grants to the best advantage.  If it seems to us in the Department that it is to our advantage generally, and to a furtherance of our policy, to pay grants when the distance is shorter than 100 feet, we will do so.  The great likelihood is that whether or not the grant is paid we will relate it rather to the cost of the job than the distance from the main.  That probably would have greater appeal than the present situation.</P>
      <P>Costs can be very high within 100 feet of the main and, on the other hand, they can be very low.  They vary widely, depending on subsoil and other difficulties encountered in sinking and laying pipes.  We have power in future to pay within these limits whereas heretofore we were debarred. We are changing the law in that way with a view to paying, if we see fit, within that limit.  Furthermore, to relate it to costs rather than to distance would be a very much better idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielHoganJnr" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain the position to me.  In my county we have eight or ten rural villages.  Over the past 20 years the local authority provided houses in each of those villages.  There are 50 or 60 houses in some of them and up to 200 houses in others.  Water and sewerage services are available in most of these villages now but the people living in the local authority houses are not able, of their own resources, to connect to the main <Col N="1279" /> water supply which has been provided for their advantage.</P>
      <P>Some few years ago, the County Engineer made a survey of the number of those people who availed of the water supply scheme.  We found that only about 5 per cent. of the total number of people in those houses have done so.  When the Minister talks about grants for the installation of water, would he agree to give a grant to help the people whom I have in mind?  Most of them are working men.  Many of them are agricultural labourers who cannot, from their own resources, connect to the water supply.</P>
      <P>Will the provisions of this Bill give these people any financial assistance or encouragement to avail of the supply?  In my opinion, it is a great loss that, after providing the water scheme, the people most in need of the facilities are not able to avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) refers to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;&mdash;moneys provided by the Oireachtas to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.  I notice the White Paper circulated with the Bill says that Section 2 empowers the Minister to make grants to persons either singly or in groups. The section of the Bill itself makes no reference to groups.  I take it that the use of the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; covers what the Minister intends.</P>
      <P>My second point concerns installation in dwellinghouses.  I have in mind the problem of temporary structures at the seaside.  With the five-day week and the greater value that is attached to leisure, there will be an increasing tendency for people to acquire or to build temporary structures at the sea-side or in the country, as is the case in Continental countries, I believe.  Are the provisions of this Bill intended to cover such dwellings?  They would not be what we would normally consider as dwelling houses.  They would be temporary dwellinghouses or structures.  It is very desirable that water and sewerage facilities should be connected to such structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third point concerns what are termed labourers' cottages: I hate that <Col N="1280" /> term myself but it is the term used. In future, when local authorities build such dwellings they should avoid scattering them around the countryside. It makes the cost of installing water and sewerage facilities exorbitant. In addition, the people living in those dwellings are far away from the church, schools, shops and social centres.  That is bad policy.  I hope the Minister will use his influence with local authorities in future in regard to building of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 empowers the Minister to pay grants for the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that the amount of the grant is sufficient?  There is no incentive in the Bill in relation to the installation of a hot water supply.  The provision of a hot water supply in the home is much more expensive than the provision of a cold water supply.</P>
      <P>Under the old Housing Acts, grants were available in respect of the reconstruction of houses without a new roof and people waited for a minimum number of years to apply for a further reconstruction grant.  I always thought there was a certain amount of wastage of public money in that regard.  I am inclined to think that the day will come when pressure will be put on the Department of Local Government and on local authorities to increase the grants because a hot water supply is important.</P>
      <P>The section makes provision for the lowest common denominator of service. Quite a lot of people, when attempting to do work, develop a certain amount of enthusiasm out of their own&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not interrupt the Senator.  He should control his mirth a wee bit.  It is rather early in the morning to feel so merry.  I trust the Minister will keep my point in mind. In any local authority area where no supplementary grant is paid in respect of water and sewerage facilities the grant by the Department of Local Government will not go very far towards helping people who are pretty hard pressed.  They would find it very difficult to complete the work without a supplementary grant from the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have a look at this matter.  If there is an increase in the volume of grants, I trust some incentive will be given to people in rural areas to instal a hot water system.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to mention is the individual water supply.  I believe that people should be led.  The Minister has done a great job in leading private people in rural areas to instal their own water and sewerage facilities. I do not believe that the local authority should do this, that and the other. There is nothing to beat self-reliance. If we expect too much from local authorities we shall create problems for them and expect them to carry out duties which they will not be fit to discharge.</P>
      <P>If there are scattered houses in a rural area, lying about a mile apart, it would be practically impossible for the local authority to provide piped water and sewerage facilities.  It is far better to leave the people to do these things themselves.  Even if the construction work could be done at great cost, the maintenance of such work would be so great that the game would not be worth the candle.  I could envisage a situation arising such as we had last winter when, due to weather conditions, it was virtually impossible to prevent bursts.  If the local authority were to have responsibility for maintaining these facilities over scattered areas, they would require to have at least two local authority workers in each house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attitude in leading people to provide these works themselves is highly commendable.  They will have a better interest in them and <Col N="1282" /> they will be their own private property. If we were to go too far, particularly in rural areas, in providing these facilities, we would tend to destroy that self-reliance which is inherent in our people.  I often wonder if the value of rain water in rural areas has been brought home sufficiently to our people.</P>

      <P>Rain water is the same water as we had since the world first began.  Because of this purification process of evaporation and condensation and falling to the earth again, we ultimately get spring water, but it has never been fully realised that it is the same water.  I agree that it does not arise under this Bill but the value of catching rain water in rural areas has never been brought properly home to our people.  It has many advantages in so far as it is not contaminated with, say, alkaline which has the effect of furring up pipes.  Rain water, when properly stored, is a valuable and desirable commodity.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome this Bill because I believe the provision of water and sewerage facilities in this modern age is long overdue.  While we are dealing with Section 2, I have a point which may or may not be appropriate to it but I feel that at some stage I should mention it.  Everybody realises the importance of water and sewerage and while I congratulate the Minister on the <Col N="1284" /> efforts he is making to provide these facilities, I should like to refer to the houses at present being erected by the Irish Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are excellent houses but they are not provided with water and sewerage facilities.  Recently, we had a study group in Gormanston with people from many Continental countries.  They were taken around by the Land Commission to see these houses.  I felt it was a great pity that such excellent houses, designed for people whose future would be farming, had no water or sewerage provided. The Department of Lands should keep in step with the Department of Local Government in providing water and sewerage facilities for their houses.</P>

      <P>One question which has been asked is whether the grants being paid are sufficient.  It is not stated in the Bill what the amount of the grants will be in the future.  I have already indicated that it is not proposed to change the amount of the grants payable at present.  In answer to the question whether they are sufficient or not, we have some broad figures, which I think show that the grants at present provide an incentive. In regard to individual private applications, we have an average total cost of £100 each, of which we pay up to £50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority can pay up to two-thirds of the remainder, with the remaining one-third falling on the beneficiary.  In the case of group schemes, the average is about £150. We pay £50 in this case and the local authority in practically every case pays £50 also.  The amount falling to be paid by the beneficiary is in the region of £50.  That is not always in cash, however, because the applicant's labour counts for probably as much as, if not more than the £50.  We have to take into consideration that the labour contribution in these water schemes can become a large part of the total cost.  In general, the rate of applications <Col N="1285" /> and allocations at the moment shows that the present grants are attracting a large number of applications.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are not stating what the amount of grant will be in the future.  But if circumstances in the future warrant an increase in the amount of the grant, it will not be necessary to bring in an amendment to this Bill.  It will be possible to do it by providing the money in the Vote for the Department of Local Government and making a regulation increasing the amounts.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about our attitude to temporary dwellings and whether the word &ldquo;dwellings&rdquo; makes our intentions sufficiently clear.  The word &ldquo;dwellings&rdquo; is used in this section in order to allow the widest possible scope in the application of these grants by enabling the Minister, by regulation, to say what kind of dwelling qualifies.  That does not mean, of course, that temporary moveable structures such as caravans and so on will be included.  We just could not contemplate giving grants for moveable dwellings of a temporary nature. But that is not to say we do not encourage the provision of services for such temporary dwellings, wherever they are available.  The by-laws will take care of that, however, and it is not a matter for discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Houses in seaside resorts, which are permanent structures but which may not be occupied throughout the year, will not be excluded.  They are permanent structures in sea-side resorts where you may have large populations for a long period of the year.  It is, therefore, desirable that they be encouraged to have these services wherever possible, even though they may not be occupied throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Grants may be paid in respect of vested and unvested cottages.  There is provision in the section that the grant, where necessary, can be paid direct to the local authority, who would, in fact, have done the work, and local authorities are empowered, in addition, to make supplementary grant payments.  Therefore, the difficulty <Col N="1286" /> cannot arise of persons in council houses not being able to do the work, with the result that it remains undone.  If a charge is to be made, it is to be made by the local authority, who will be able to recoup themselves to some extent for what they have paid out.  On the other hand, the local authority are empowered not to make any charge if they feel the applicant is not able to pay.  That is a facility which, I am sure, our local authorities will use with the utmost discretion in order to encourage as many as possible to avail of these services.</P>
    <P>The other question posed here was whether a private water supply to a house, presumably connected to a scheme made available with the assistance of grants, could be availed of for farmyard and farm uses.  There would be no reason, other than that of the availability of supply, why such scheme could not be used in the farmyard or, if necessary, in the fields.  In fact, such extensions of water supplies are encouraged by the Department of Agriculture through their special farmyard and farm grants.  That does not mean, of course, that these additional uses will be available free of charge.  The local authorities in the rural areas outside the urban boundaries will be entitled to make any charge they see fit for the use of water supplies from a public source.  It is an entirely different matter if the water is from a private source.  In such cases, the persons concerned would be entitled to do as they wished, so long as a supply was available.</P>
    <P>The matter of unserviced houses erected by the Land Commission does not arise on this Bill.  I can assure Senator Fitzgerald, however, that it is a matter I have had quite a lot to say about.  I shall continue until what I say bears fruit and we have in the future serviced houses built by all concerned in accordance with our housing policy.  Those were, I think, the general matters raised.</P>

I think it is a bad thing that any particular council should be allowed to stay out and not meet their obligations in this matter.

      <P>I was very glad to have the Minister's assurance that the operation of loans and guarantees <Col N="1288" /> to groups would not be such that one person's default would tend to penalise the whole group.  I am happy that the point I raised is fully met if the schemes are carried out in this particular way.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that the Minister has been advised that sewage disposal covers the question of treatment as well.  I would suggest, however, that on the consolidation of sanitary services legislation the matter should be put beyond all doubt by referring, in the appropriate place, to the question of &ldquo;drainage, or sewage treatment, or sewage disposal.&rdquo;  Then there could be no possible doubt about coverage.</P>
      <P>There was a third point on this particular section in regard to the area which could be considered as governing the statutory defence in relation to the question of public health or the provision of adequate services from the point of view of water or drainage. Is the Minister in a position now to say what the intention is, whether the area is the area of the group scheme or the whole area of the sanitary authority?  Has the Minister been specifically advised that the section does read in accordance with his intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is as to whether a compulsory purchase order or procedure applies only to the area served by the system that is proposed to be acquired or whether it embraces a wider area.  Most emphatically, it embraces a wider area, if and where that is necessary, on the grounds already stated.  An instance that could arise, and this is something I have been most insistent we should cover, is a group scheme taking in, for instance, a valley or a glen; I would know something more about this than many of the speakers here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You could have a group scheme covering all those reasonably convenient at the mouth of a valley or glen and you could have one, two, or three people relatively isolated at the other end of the valley or glen who, for their own economic reasons, would have not come in in the group scheme initially because it was not attractive <Col N="1289" /> to them from a financial point of view. Later, a public line might come through in fairly close proximity to the mouth of the valley or glen.  The only way in which water could be brought to those isolated further up the glen would be by way of an extension of the existing network of the private scheme tied in to a branchline of the public scheme to boost the pressure.  It is that type of case we are concerned about and it is, no doubt, a case which will arise.  It is bound to arise.</P>
    <P>It is from that point of view that we must have regard to covering an area greater than the immediate area of supply.  It will arise only where it is in the interests of people who have not enjoyed the benefits of a scheme heretofore because they could not, by their own efforts, avail of any private scheme.  This is the only way then in which water could be given to all the people in a particular locality.  It is in that general context we need to operate and to give ourselves room so to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Minister that these cases should be covered.  The only worry I had was that the section, as drafted, might allow the sanitary authority to seek acquisition for the purpose of minor economy or minor convenience of operation.  Is the Minister perfectly satisfied that the term &ldquo;purpose of improved sewage facilities or water supplies&rdquo; would exclude mere matters of economy and convenience of operation and that, in fact, the term is restricted in that it will apply only where there was either a difficulty in regard to a particular area in getting a supply, or of having a highly uneconomic supply, or having a supply connected with an existing private scheme?</P>

I found in a few cases where people were trying to get a group scheme going in the past, the people who had the main water supply, when asked to co-operate, were not satisfied to do so and neither were they satisfied to allow the remainder of the group to take the water.  It is absolutely essential to have the water supply in regard to the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Minister straight away that I have no intention of washing my car or watering my roses.  In regard to this section, I should like to raise this point. In endeavouring to get the definition here of a domestic water supply, the Minister has drawn the definition tight. I wonder if he has not drawn it just a bit too tightly?  We have in subsection (II): &ldquo;ordinary household purposes (for example, drinking, washing and sanitation).&rdquo; The first point I should like to raise is the rather unusual use of the phrase &ldquo;for example&rdquo; and I should like to ask the Minister what is the intention.  This appears to be an attempt to draw the knot tighter than it would be if the more usual construction were used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I should like to raise in regard to the definition.  If <Col N="1291" /> you look at paragraph (d) which refers to central heating, I think you will find that a supply for central heating is excluded &ldquo;other than central heating for a dwelling-house&rdquo;.  I take it that by being excluded from the exclusion &ldquo;central heating of a dwelling-house&rdquo; is domestic, is an ordinary household purpose.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>If you had not added paragraph (d) and merely had the original line 31 &ldquo;ordinary household purposes (for example, drinking, washing and sanitation)&rdquo;, I wonder, if that stood without paragraph (d), whether the central heating of a dwelling-house would have been part of the domestic use of water so defined?  One could argue that it would be a household purpose.  One could argue that it would be a household purpose not excluded by the phrase: &ldquo;for example, drinking, washing and sanitation&rdquo; but can one in Ireland in 1962 talk of water for central heating as an ordinary household purpose?  I think it is an exceptional household purpose.  It is something that is not done in the ordinary house.  It is something that is not done in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I just raise the point because from my reading of the section it would appear on first sight that the very tight construction or drafting of &ldquo;ordinary household purposes (for example, drinking, washing and sanitation)&rdquo; would ordinarily have excluded such a use as water for central heating purposes.  I am worried, even though the water for central heating is saved by its exclusion from the exclusion, that, perhaps, there are other <i>bona fide</i> household purposes which would be excluded by the way in which this particular subsection is drafted.</P>

I am advised that the use of the phrase &ldquo;for example&rdquo; in this section, though unusual, is, in fact, less restrictive than would be the word suggested.  That is what I am advised.  Probably some of my legal friends will disagree but then they would not be in the legal profession if they all agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator McAuliffe, all of us have seen sprinklers on some of the lawns in the city.  They are needlessly left on.  It would not surprise me if they were left on when people go on holidays so that the lawns will be fresh and green when they came back.  There are those kind of abuses.  Connecting a hose and taking it to the garden is a very different thing altogether from the number of buckets of water you are going to carry out and use in the garden.  The use of a hose without consent up to and including the <Col N="1293" /> present is illegal.  When this Bill is passed, if a hose is to be used in the future within the confines of an urban boundary it may be charged for.  There is no compulsion on any local authority to charge.  They will use their own discretion and wisdom. Senator McAuliffe's observation in regard to the inspectors is far removed from what the practical approach will be.  The new law will probably be less weighty and less restrictive on the public in urban areas than it is at present.</P>

I <Col N="1295" /> do not want to take in any way from what Senator Dooge said about what we ordinarily know about pollution when I talk about the question of smells.  In certain areas in the southern part of this city, it is impossible at times for people to work because the smells are so bad that people actually become sick.  This section refers to &ldquo;injury to amenity from atmospheric pollutants&rdquo;.  It seems to me that that obviously is an injury to the amenity of wholesome fresh air.  I should like to have some assurance from the Minister that under this section he envisages making regulations which will deal not alone with pollution by smoke but the danger to amenity of fresh air by sickening smells from certain establishments.</P>

      <P>I think we could nearly do without Section 10 in this Bill and accept Senator Dooge's suggestion to have a separate Bill dealing with air pollution.  This section gives the Minister power to make various regulations and I think that that is something we should avoid.  We have too much legislation by regulation at the moment.  The procedure in regard to air pollution is not laid down properly in the Bill and the section as it stands is no addition to it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said on the Second Stage, that it is the intention to co-operate as much as possible with industry in the further steps he intends to take in regard to air pollution.  I should like to make a few comments on this section.  In effect, subsections (3) to (9) allow for the mechanics, and the regulations are dealt with in subsection (1) and subsection (2).  Subsection (1) allows the Minister to make regulations on any subject in regard to air pollution and in subsection (2) without prejudice to this generality, he proceeds to indicate certain directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the harmful things about this section is that the Minister has done this.  Subsection (2) does nothing but reflects, what I am sure it reflects nintentionally, an anti-industrial ias.  It has no reference to vehicles <Col N="1296" /> in it; it has no reference to ships; it has no reference to domestic pollution. If we look at the subsection, we will find also that it becomes so restricted that the Minister would, were he bringing in regulations, always bring them in under subsection (1).  Paragraph (c) of subsection (2) refers to &ldquo;specifying maximum concentrations of specified pollutants in the atmosphere&rdquo;.  It does not refer to the measurement of specified pollutants on the ground and in fact we do not in ordinary practice measure pollution in the atmosphere itself.</P>
    <P>The most important measurement we can make is of deposits on the ground.  In subsection (2), there is mention only of the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere, with no reference whatsoever to the emission of flue gases from within the chimney stack. Subsection (2) is, to my mind, an undue restriction in many ways and I would urge the Minister, in his further dealings with this problem, to forget subsection (2) as it at present endeavours to deal with the matter.  Were it not for the circumstances of time in which we are debating this Bill, I would try to impress on the Minister the necessity to remove this subsection. It adds nothing and it could create a most unfortunate impression.</P>
    <P>It is a bad impression if we look at what happened in Britain.  The old tendency there at the time of the public health Acts was to control industry and to provide no control of domestic pollution.  We have now a complete reversal of the attitude and as a result of the provisions of the Clean Air Act, statutory defences have been written in for industry whereby industry for example can have a postponement of five years for adaptation.  The smoke control areas which are a main means in Britain of controlling pollution of the atmosphere provide for the control of domestic chimney pollution and the Clean Air Act is now more strict on domestic users than on industrial concerns.</P>
    <P>The whole of subsection (2) here is running counter to what has been the experience of legislation in Britain and to what is desirable from the point of <Col N="1297" /> view of making regulations under this Bill.  I think also the Minister should consider leaving this subsection alone when he is making regulations, and bring in regulations under subsection (1).  The position then would be that these matters could be debated fully in the House as if it were a Bill to solve this problem of polluted air.  I submit that would be the best procedure. I would ask the Minister to forget the headings he has written for himself in subsection (2) to make a completely fresh start in any new legislation on this matter he may put before the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Dooge that subsection (2) does include, in paragraph (a), domestic smoke&mdash;the emission of any smoke, dust or grit.  Later on in the same section, &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is stated to include a ship or vessel.  The Road Traffic Act has got power for the control of smoke emission from vehicles and it is under that law vehicles will be dealt with.  We have here included domestic smoke and also ships and vessels.  Therefore, I do not agree that subsection (2) of this section is entirely directed to industry.  There is no bias against industry in this section.  I can assure the House we do understand the problems of industry in this matter and that we have given every consideration to that aspect.  Therefore, there is no reason to fear that any bias against industry will be operated.</P>

      <P>The matter of wastage and misuse of water is very fully covered in the waterworks clauses of Acts which go back, in some cases, I think, almost a century.  As regards the purity of the water supply, very stringent steps are taken by local authorities in regard to public supplies. Private installations, up to the present, have not been subject to the same stringent tests for purity, but in this Bill there is power whereby the Minister for Local Government may require persons applying for grants to have the supply submitted for such tests.  This is a matter which we are considering but I think the House will appreciate that up to the very recent past, it was felt that the fewer obstacles we placed in the way of this very necessary development, the better. Possibly the time has now arrived when we can deal with quality as well as quantity.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Loans and Grants) Bill, 1962&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as its long Title indicates, makes further and better provision in relation to grants and loans for private housing and it also consolidates the existing provisions of the Housing Acts on this subject.  It is a first step in the simplification and modernisation of the general housing code.</P>
      <P>Housing legislation at present comprises the separate codes of the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1958, the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1960, the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1960, and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, 1899 to 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> It is proposed in this Bill to consolidate and amend the various provisions in the latter two codes dealing with grants and loans for private housing.</P>
    <P>The statutory provisions relating to the general powers of housing authorities in the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1958, and the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1958, are also being reviewed for consolidation and amendment in new legislation which will be introduced as soon as possible. Future housing law will then be comprised in only two codes, the Loans and Grants Bill now before the House, and the remainder of the law as proposed to be consolidated in relation to local housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions relating to State grants for new and reconstructed houses expired on the 31st March, 1962.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the continuance at existing levels of the grants available for the provision of new houses.  No terminal date for the completion of grant houses is specified and continuing and extending legislation will therefore be unnecessary in future so far as the payment of grants is concerned.  While the housing law is thus being made permanent, this is, of course, without prejudice to the introduction of any amending legislation which may be found necessary from time to time.</P>
    <P>The present rates of grants for new houses are being retained, subject to the qualification that a grant will in future be made for unserviced houses only in cases in which the provision of a piped water supply and sewerage facilities is not reasonably practicable. This amendment is in accord with the policy of securing the provision of sanitary services in dwellings wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with reconstruction grants and proposes to continue these grants at the existing rates.  Hitherto grants under separate sections and subject to different conditions were paid for (a) the reconstruction of houses in the occupation of farmers, the total rateable valuation of whose holdings did not exceed £50 and to agricultural labourers reconstructing houses for their own occupation in a <Col N="1301" /> rural area; and (b) the repair and improvement of houses by other persons. Section 3 deals with both these classes of grants on uniform conditions, subject to retention of the basis on which the grants are at present determined, namely, two-thirds of the cost of the work in the case of category (a) and one-third for category (b), but subject also in both cases to the maximum limit as set out in the section. The expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; is not being retained in this context: the classes for whom grants of two-thirds of the cost are to be made are referred to as persons who derive their livelihood solely or mainly from the pursuit of agriculture.  Thus, farmers and agricultural labourers are brought within the same qualification.  The proposed amalgamation of the two existing sections is designed to secure a desirable uniformity and simplification in administration.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the payment of second or subsequent grants in respect of a house which had previously received a new house or reconstruction grant.  The 1932 Housing Act contained no positive provisions allowing second grants and this situation was, in the earlier years of the housing programme, regarded as justified for the purpose of securing that durable and good quality work would be carried out when the house was being built or being reconstructed for the first time.  The possibility of financial exploitation of a system of unrestricted successive grants had also to be guarded against.  With the passing of time, however, and the ageing of housing stock either built or reconstructed originally with these grants, some relaxations were considered necessary to keep houses in repair, and improve them, to prevent deterioration, to allow for family expansion and to enable the question of storm damage to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Various amendments made in 1950, 1952 and 1954 helped the objective of securing durable and good standard work initially, while allowing subsequent grants for necessary reconstruction after the passing of a reasonable time or the emergence of circumstances outside the applicant's control. <Col N="1302" /> Under this section, the general bar to payment of further reconstruction grants, within a 15-year period of the first grant, is retained as is the reduced period of ten years where re-roofing is necessary.</P>
    <P>However, as rigid application of a limiting period gave rise to hardship in certain cases where particular works became urgently necessary before the expiration of the period, it was decided in 1960, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to pay limited grants for some of the more urgent works likely to arise under Section 12 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1954, which did not include a prohibition on the payment of further grants.  Specific statutory authority for the continuance of the payment of these special grants is now being taken.</P>
    <P>The existing legislative power to make a grant for works necessitated by storm damage is being re-enacted with the reservation that a grant for works of this nature will not carry with it a disqualification of the subsequent payment at any time of a grant for normal reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>The maximum grants under the section will be as follows:&mdash; (a) For extra rooms to relieve overcrowding, involving an addition to floor area&mdash; £50 per room: (b) For provision of a bathroom, involving an addition to floor area&mdash;£50; (c) For storm damage, two-thirds of the cost in the case of persons deriving their livelihood solely or mainly from agriculture, including farmers with holdings not exceeding £50 and one-third in other cases, subject to the maximum of £100, £120 or £140, as appropriate.  For works urgently necessary to conserve a house, one-third of cost subject to a maximum of £100, £120 or £140, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The aggregate of grants made at any one time under the section must not exceed the appropriate statutory maximum of £100, £120 or £140, which obtain at present.  Payment of the grants will be made subject to regulations.</P>
    <P>Provisions governing the payment of grants for the installation of private water and sewerage facilities are not <Col N="1303" /> being retained in housing legislation but will be dealt with in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Bill.</P>
    <P>As supplementary grants are closely connected with State grants, I shall now deal with the new provisions in this respect in advance of the order shown in the text of the Bill.  Section 12 of the Bill discontinues the graded system of supplementary grants by local authorities for new houses, leaving housing authorities free to decide the type of supplementary grant scheme most suited to local circumstances within specified maximum limits of income and valuation for eligibility.  The existing annual income limit is £624 for county boroughs and contiguous areas and £520 elsewhere but no limit applies to tenants of local authority dwellings or persons eligible for such tenancies.  A uniform limit of £832 per annum is now proposed.  An increase to £50 in the maximum valuation limit of £35 is proposed for farmers.</P>
    <P>The proposals confer on local authorities a power to exclude categories of applicants to whom, although they come within the statutory income or valuation limits, the payment of a supplementary grant by the housing authority is not considered to be warranted. Similarly, a housing authority will be free to limit their scheme to houses of particular types.  As regards supplementary grants for reconstruction, repair and improvement, there are no existing statutory maxima for income and valuation.  Section 8 preserves this position.</P>
    <P>Section 5 introduces a new type of grant to assist minimum essential preservation work in rural areas.  This proposal is part of a planned approach to deal with the remaining unfit housing problem in these areas.  The evidence available so far, from the survey of unfit housing, shows a manifest need for flexibility of treatment of this branch of the housing problem. There are many persons living in unfit conditions who are not and are never likely to be in a position to rehouse themselves and whose needs cannot or are not being met by housing authorities. Owing to such factors as the <Col N="1304" /> location of the houses and the age and circumstances of the occupants, local authorities cannot be expected to give a high priority to providing new houses for these classes.  Private grants and loans procedure has up to now been generally ineffective in these cases.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section is to enable the occupant to carry out only the minimum essential works such as roof repairs, repairs of doors or windows and wall plastering.  The work will be carried out on an economic and temporary basis so that the house may be reasonably fit for a limited period and so that its subsequent abandonment or demolition will not involve any substantial abortive expenditure. The proposal will not in any way relieve the rural housing authority of its obligation to secure the demolition or closure of unfit rented houses which, normally, are a feature of urban, rather than of rural, areas.</P>
    <P>The State grant proposed under this section will not exceed £80, or two-thirds of the cost of the work, whichever is less.  The housing authority may, in addition, make a grant sufficient to defray the balance of the cost or may contribute within this limit building materials or labour or other assistance in kind.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities are also being authorised under this section to carry out the necessary works of repair with the consent of the occupiers and, in such circumstances, the State grants will be payable to the housing authority.</P>
    <P>Section 6 introduces a new scheme of grants to philanthropic and charitable organisations for the provision of housing for elderly persons. It is hoped that the increased rate of grant (£300 per dwelling unit) will provide the necessary impetus to encourage the provision of this type of housing.  Aspects of a social character which are normally outside the scope of housing policy attend the problem of housing old people.  For that reason, it is desirable that philanthropic or charitable organisations should be encouraged as far as possible <Col N="1305" /> to provide the necessary dwelling accommodation.  Generous public financial aid is justified for this purpose since the funds likely to be available to such organisations are normally limited.</P>
    <P>The section provides for the payment of supplementary grants by housing authorities of amounts not exceeding the grants paid by the State, and provision is also made entitling housing authorities to prescribe such conditions in relation to the payment of supplementary grants as they think fit.</P>
    <P>Section 7 introduces a new type of grant designed to encourage experimentation by architects, builders, co-operative groups and local authorities in the production of low cost housing suitable for persons in low income groups.  The grant for the erection of the approved prototype will not exceed 50 per cent. of the approved estimated cost.  Subsequent reproductions of a successful prototype will be eligible for normal new house grants and supplementary grants in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>It has been represented by architects that, given more freedom of design, house costs could be reduced. Local authorities also have occasionally sought sanction to experimentation in design and specification related to local needs and circumstances.  No adequate machinery exists at present which would encourage development of these suggestions.  Where departures from prescribed standards occur or are proposed in private grant cases, it is usual to reduce the amount of grant normally available in order to preserve the principle that fixed standards should be observed as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>If co-operative or self-help housing, to which I will refer later, can be developed into a formal movement in any area, the erection of a specially designed experimental or &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; house would provide useful experience to the co-operative group and encouragement to the spread of such activity.</P>
    <P>The section proposes that, if a house-type were evolved through the <Col N="1306" /> experimentation envisaged which necessitated such a departure from the present fixed standards as would normally warrant a reduction or loss of grant, the new house-type, perhaps with modification, will be brought especially within eligibility for normal rates of grant for the purpose of reproduction. This will preserve the existing principle of fixed standards to be applied to grant-houses in general and will also enable local authorities to pay supplementary grants in the normal course.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 12 of the Bill authorise housing authorities to pay supplementary grants for the reconstruction and provision of houses under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts. Section 10 re-enacts and extends section 13 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1958, so as to enable a housing authority to make loans for the repair of (a) vested cottages; and (b) houses which have been or will be sold by housing authorities to tenant purchasers in urban areas, where the fee simple or fine is or will be mortgaged as security.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the making of loans by housing authorities for the acquisition or construction of houses. The section is intended to replace the existing provisions of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and will be brought into operation on an appointed day by Order made by the Minister.  The section authorises the making of regulations to deal <i>inter alia</i> with the details of procedure relating to the making of loans, the classes eligible for loans, repayments, transfers, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a re-enactment and extension of Section 10 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1956, under which housing authorities are empowered to guarantee advances to private persons for the provision of houses.  This guarantee procedure has, however, been almost wholly ineffective.  The amended section enables guarantees to be given in respect of loans for reconstruction work as well as for new houses and extends the type of bodies to which guarantees may be given.  The new section may in this way be utilised to a greater extent than its predecessor. <Col N="1307" /> Section 17 is a new provision which authorises the Minister to withhold or reduce a grant where the conditions subject to which the grant was paid have not been complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill enables the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to vary from time to time the amounts of the maximum advances to be made to borrowers under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  I propose, on the passing of this Bill, to fix a uniform maximum of £2,000 which will govern advances by all housing authorities and which will replace the existing statutory limits of £1,600 and £1,800.</P>
    <P>Section 21 and Section 26, subsection (2) make the necessary transitional provision for the payment of grants outstanding at 31st March, 1962, and authorised within the period 1st April, 1962, up to the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections are necessary re-enactments of existing provisions of the Housing Acts dealing with private housing grants.  I have now outlined the contents and the aims of this Bill, which is designed to encourage the elimination of unfit housing so far as positive legislation can deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I might mention that a survey of unfit houses has been in progress for some time, with special reference to the extent of the problem in rural areas.  In the last 30 years, the housing programme, particularly that portion of it undertaken by local authorities, has been more effective in urban than in rural areas, where the current survey figures up to the present indicate that some 30,000 houses need to be repaired and 20,000 more require to be replaced.  The full completion of the survey will not materially alter the overall picture of the problem presented by these figures.  The problem is a big one and obviously more difficult to solve than that section of the housing programme that has already been successfully implemented.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, the unfit housing problem does not lend itself to the treatment possible in urban areas where blocks of unfit property, often <Col N="1308" /> in single ownership, can be dealt with by large-scale clearance operations.  The outstanding feature of the rural problem is that of isolated and owner-occupied houses situated on holdings of varying economic categories.  These categories range from those willing and able to meet the cost of new houses or reconstruction of their old houses with the aid of grants down to those who, for financial or other reasons, are either unable or unwilling to face the implications of even a very modest degree of repair.  As Senators familiar with rural conditions are aware, many elderly single persons or elderly couples with little or no resources or a short expectation of life without assured succession for occupation of their dwellings are the classes least inclined or able to do anything for themselves.  As I have already said, it is part of the problem that local authorities are not universally disposed to regard this problem as part of their housing functions or, where they do accept some responsibility, they can give only a low priority to the rehousing of these classes, as compared with others seeking new housing.</P>
    <P>So far as legislative proposals can go, this Bill contains provisions specially designed to deal with the needs of the rural position.  For rural as well as for urban areas, the removal of housing grants from the need for renewable legislation gives an assurance to all concerned that they may continue to plan and build without fear of the non-renewal of the legislation on which the grants depend.  The recurrence of unfitness in housing, even in the best circumstances, is a perennial problem and not one that can be assumed to be finally eradicable in the sense that even the best houses decay in time. The proposed provisions in regard to loans and eligibility for supplementary grants made the way easier for the erection of new houses and the reconstruction of old ones.  The introduction of the minimum essential repair grants provided in Section 5 for county health areas represents an important new principle of housing policy which, I hope, will do much at reasonable cost to restore the habitability <Col N="1309" /> of some of the worst houses in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Housing activities in recent years have shown a marked trend in the direction of private enterprise.  This welcome trend, which appears likely to continue, deserves to be nurtured not only by improved legislation but also by positive encouragement of both individual effort and co-operative action.  The success which has attended the active help and advice given by my Department to persons desiring to organise private group water supply schemes convinces me that a planned approach on these lines to the rural housing problem may yield results which more official lines of action could not achieve.  The approach by way of self-help will, I am certain, be considerably assisted by the general provisions of the Bill and particularly by the provisions of Section 7 which will encourage experimentation towards the production of low-cost housing.</P>
    <P>The general pattern of this Bill fits therefore into the first part of the attack on the unfit housing problem which is of particular urgency in rural areas.  There is still a wide and important field in which local authorities can continue to make, by the direct provision of houses, further valuable contributions to meeting housing needs.  I propose to deal with this aspect of the matter in conjunction with my proposals for an up-to-date consolidated code for local housing authorities, which will, I hope, contain special provisions in relation to the rural situation.  As I have already intimated, I hope to bring this legislation before the House without any great delay.  When these two measures are enacted, we shall have in up-to-date form all the powers required for the effective prosecution of the housing activities of private and public enterprise.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this Housing Bill can be divided into two main groups.  First, we have the provisions which amend the housing code.  These provisions are all welcome. They are welcome for what they do themselves and they are also <Col N="1310" /> welcome because they are an indication of what might be described as the maturity of our housing code; they are an indication that in tackling this problem, successive Governments, and the Department which has served them all, have now reached the stage where, crises having been overcome, activity can be diversified.  Therefore we welcome these new provisions and congratulate the Minister for introducing them into our housing code. The second group of provisions is the re-enactment now on a permanent basis of the provisions in regard to grants and loans for new houses.  Here again we have something which is a continuing process.  The decision that these should be placed on a permanent basis, while it may give rise to some minor problems, is something we are glad to see.</P>
      <P>Of these new provisions which are part of the Bill, all of them are matters on which there will not be any division of opinion here.  We have new grants for re-roofing now being available after ten years instead of 15, and grants being made available for storm damage.  These are things we have all looked to see and we are glad to see them now in housing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5, which deals with minimum essential repairs, again is something which the housing code has lacked and which fills a gap that existed previously.  As the Bill stands, this is being confined absolutely to rural areas.  While there is a great deal to be said for the argument that there would be a danger in applying this provision, or a parallel provision, to urban areas, I do not think it would be very wise to exclude completely the idea of some provision in the future for minimum essential repairs in urban areas.  There are urban areas which are not highly concentrated; there are urban areas in which the population is quite dispersed. If you take the town of Dundalk, it is probably something of the same extent as the county borough of Cork; yet the populations are very different.  On the periphery of some of these towns which have not got a high concentration of population, it might well be that some <Col N="1311" /> provision similar to the present provision in regard to rural areas ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provision whereby grants can be made for the housing of elderly persons, the most interesting thing that arises is the Minister's assurance that this could be done by local authorities&mdash;that the local authorities could form themselves, as it were, into a philanthropic body for the purpose of providing housing for elderly persons.  Any Senator who has been a member of an urban authority will agree that here again there was a gap.  There was a section of the community for whom very little could be done under the main housing code. Many of the urban authorities under this provision will be able not only to build new houses for elderly persons but will have scope for the conversion of housing, not suitable for the housing of families, for the use of elderly persons.</P>
    <P>In the urban district I know best, the borough of Dún Laoghaire, there are many such housing schemes which, by virtue of the small amount of accommodation available, are an embarrassment to the local authority to endeavour to fit them into their scheme of the rehousing of families.  It is difficult to house people in them and to create tenancies of any length in them.  If you put a newly-married couple or a couple with a small number of children into such accommodation, later there will have to be a transfer of tenancy.  The transfer will be from this small house with a low rent to a new scheme where they will have to pay a higher rent. We all know the difficulties of the reallocation of tenancies in these cases. These houses might fit well into a general scheme for the housing of elderly persons.</P>
    <P>During the discussion in the Dáil, there appeared to be some criticism that this provision and its operation by local authorities might lead to the use of communal kitchens.  We would all be agreed that in the housing of elderly persons, there should be individual cooking facilities in all the housing units.  But I do not think <Col N="1312" /> in any scheme that would be drawn up there should be necessarily any exclusion of some provision for communal dining, perhaps in respect of the principal meal of the day.  This is a feature of many of the schemes in other countries for the housing of elderly persons, whereby these persons can provide their own morning meal and their own supper in the evening, but the preparation of the main meal, which might be a burden to these elderly people, is provided on a communal basis by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in this connection whether the local authority are enabled under existing legislation to provide such facilities in regard to the conversion of or provision of a scheme for elderly persons. I would also like to ask him whether a local authority have the power&mdash;this is not strictly within his province&mdash;to appoint a person who would be in the nature of a welfare officer in regard to such a scheme of housing units for elderly persons.  The Minister is obviously receptive to experimentation. Here is an obvious direction in which the local authority could experiment with different approaches to this problem of the housing of elderly persons.  There are pitfalls in doing too much for these elderly persons within the scheme, but there are similar dangers in doing too little for them and leaving them too isolated.</P>
    <P>The Minister has in this Bill introduced a special grant for prototype houses with a view to the promotion of low-cost construction.  That is very desirable.  We need standardisation to a certain extent but we also need a variety of standards because needs are not absolutely uniform. Any attempt to impose uniformity under all conditions would be a sterile policy.  We need a variety of standards and there is a continual need to revise standards.  We may well have a movement in that direction as a result of this particular grant.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second group of provisions in this Bill, we come to the question of new houses.  Here, the Minister, as I mentioned, has put the <Col N="1313" /> legislation on a permanent basis rather than leaving it as a matter to be re-enacted every two years.  There has been some discussion on the question of the level of the grants, the question as to whether people are entitled to express disappointment that the grants have not been increased.  While I do not wish in any way to introduce any undue note of controversy on this point, I would ask the Minister to realise that conditions in 1962 in regard to the provision of new houses for the salaried classes are very different from the conditions in 1960 when these grants were originally fixed.</P>
    <P>There has been in this Bill some adjustment of the position but, if we examine the circumstances of a person who is purchasing a house&mdash;I refer now to a person purchasing a house in an urban area or an area contiguous to it&mdash;the financing of this house and the burden of its purchase on this salaried person depends really upon four factors, and three of these are within the Minister's control.  First, it depends on the grant which is available from the Minister, with the possibility in certain cases of a supplementary grant.  The second factor is the maximum loan which is available. The third factor is the income limit which is set by regulation under the Small Dwellings Act, and whatever may succeed it under this Bill.  The fourth factor is the rate of interest at which the money is lent.  The first three factors in themselves constitute the determining factors as to the load which housing charges will place on a salaried person in a new house under the Small Dwellings Act.</P>
    <P>In this Bill and, as the Minister has told us, in the regulations which will be made under it, the Minister has adjusted the maximum size of the loan.  He has indicated that he does not intend to change the income limit of £1,040 a year and that he does not intend to change the grant of £275.  I think that, when he has altered one factor here without altering the other two, he has introduced a disequilibrium into the position.  I should just like to indicate what the position is.  I will take the position, as I know it, of <Col N="1314" /> a person purchasing a house in the City of Cork or in the area contiguous to it.</P>
    <P>If this person has to borrow £2,000 &mdash;the sum the Minister proposes to allow him as the maximum under this Bill&mdash;then his direct repayment housing charges will be £150 a year.  His rates plus his ground rent will amount to about another £60 a year.  Without any regard then to repairs or without any regard to maintenance, he will have housing charges of about £210 a year, or £4 a week.  These are, as I say, the direct housing charges without reference to repairs.</P>
    <P>In the operation of the Small Dwellings Acts schemes the Minister has told us he intends to maintain the income ceiling of £1,040 a year in regard to such loans.  That is £20 a week.  The position would be then that, operating under this particular section, we would have housing charges, excluding upkeep and repairs, of £4 a week on an income of £20 a week.  In other words, we have a fifth of the total income going in direct housing charges without regard to repairs.  I think that is a very high proportion.  It is certainly a higher proportion than existed when a corresponding house was built two years ago, with building prices as they were two years ago.  It is certainly a higher proportion of income going to housing than would be approved in any differential or graded rents scheme in relation to the housing of the working classes.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, having increased the size of the loan to £2,000, it is only equitable, in order to keep things in balance, that he should at the same time put the maximum income limit for a loan up to about £1,200 per annum in order to retain the same relationship.  This is completely independent of the question of the £275 grant.  There is the question that, having allowed the loans to reach a new maximum, he should also allow the incomes which determine whether or not people should get these loans to reach a new level.  There are important cases in which people could be caught by the Minister's limit, people who have <Col N="1315" /> received increases in salary, and, as the Minister knows, there is nothing like a salary increase to make people think that now is the time to set up house.</P>
    <P>As things stand, people will be excluded under this.  I should like to give an instance.  I think it is a serious instance.  Let us take the case of a principal teacher.  He earns about £1,100 a year.  He is excluded under the regulations the Minister proposes to make from the operations of the Small Dwelling Act loans, or whatever new name we will call them by in future.  It is easy to say that this man has £1,100 a year and he can go to a bank or an insurance company and get the money.  The principal teacher, outside of the large city or town, cannot do so because an insurance company will not lend money on a house outside a city or a large town.  By maintaining his income limit of £1,040, rather than allowing it to go up, the Minister may well force a person, such as a principal teacher, to live within a large city and drive to and from his school rather than live in the immediate neighbourhood in which he is employed as a teacher.</P>
    <P>These limitations are real.  It is sometimes said that these limitations by the banks and insurance companies do not exist but, when it comes down to hard facts, there are cases in which they do operate.  In order to deal with these, and similar cases, I think this income limit should be raised.  I think also that the Minister could &mdash; I think it is reasonable to hope that he should &mdash;have made some small adjustment in the Departmental grant.  A house, the gross cost of which in 1960, when these grants were fixed, was £2,000 would today cost £2,250.  We need not argue about the precise figure but this is the general nature of the increases in housing costs over the past two years.  If there is to be any relationship between the grant and the money which has to be paid, the gross amount or the net amount, it does not matter which way we reckon it, then I think we must admit costs have increased and, in cases where gross <Col N="1316" /> costs have been held, they have been held at the expense of reduced standards.</P>
    <P>There is a case here for an adjustment to be made and it is very difficult to avoid concluding that either the Minister is not being as generous now as he might be or else the Minister was too generous in the past two years. I do not think those who received housing loans in the past two years will accuse anybody of generosity in that regard.  This is a serious matter because, not only is the Minister saying that he is satisfied that these grants are generous enough now, but he is coming in here not with a two year measure but with a permanent measure, with the £275 written into the Schedule of the Bill.  He has said he is bringing in this Bill now to avoid bringing in a Bill every two years.  He is saying, in effect, that not only does he feel that these grants are adequate now, but they will be adequate for, say, three years ahead.  I think there is a case for reconsideration here and I hope the Minister will consider, in regard to this problem of the housing of the salaried classes, that, if he is to bring these people into the same position as people were in two years ago, some adjustment needs to be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, during the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, that he was instructing his housing inspectors to ensure that higher standards would be maintained and that he had some degree of worry about the housing standards in some private housing.  One of the best ways to ensure that these standards are maintained and also to ensure that there is no decline in standards within the next few years is to maintain the existing equilibrium in regard to grants and the income limit.  Accordingly, I should like to say that I welcome the new provisions of the Housing Bill but I feel that the Minister or whoever made the effective decision in this regard was less generous now compared with two years ago in dealing with housing of the salaried classes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on having <Col N="1317" /> introduced such a comprehensive measure of housing legislation.  I am particularly glad that the Minister has changed the original definition of agricultural labourer and those engaged in agriculture.  Both titles are brought into a desirable uniformity in the Bill.  The word &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; should, as far as possible, be deleted from any phraseology in regard to housing legislation.  The time has come when people formerly in that category shall be described as they are in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated upon taking what I regard as a very necessary and bold step to ensure that no grants will be passed for new houses except they are serviced.  I sincerely hope the Minister will adopt a very conservative attitude in that connection.  The time has arrived when houses should be serviced.  In this modern age and because of the very many developments which are likely to take place in the economic structure of this country in the very near future, it is most desirable that dwelling houses should be serviced and thereby establish a standard long wanted in this country.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction of houses was mentioned by the Minister.  He indicated that local authorities are being generally exhorted to introduce a scheme of supplementary grants of a rather wide variety for that purpose as well as for the construction of new houses.  The Minister indicates that he is prescribing no particular scale of grants for the local authorities in determining the amount of supplementary grants which they might introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might have been more satisfactory if some general scale were laid down. Present experience in that regard is that some local authorities have a very generous scheme of supplementary grants, whereas in other local authorities the scheme is not so satisfactory. Indeed, in quite a number of local authorities there is no scheme of supplementary grants for reconstruction purposes.  However, I take it that the Minister has some particular reason for leaving that aspect of the <Col N="1318" /> matter an open question with the local authorities.  Perhaps, he might indicate if there is any general recommendation or pressure he can put on local authorities to have uniformity in the matter of those grants.  It will be a very embarrassing situation in those local authority areas where a low scheme of grants prevails in comparison with the position in adjoining areas where larger grants are available.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that the Minister has taken a very practical step in regard to the provision of houses for aged couples.  This has been a problem with housing authorities for many years and they have not been able to do very much about it.  The difficulty, as the Minister explained, is that the type of persons who require such accommodation cannot get a very high priority from the housing authorities.  The result is that housing authorities have not been able to do anything practicable or worthwhile to relieve the appalling situation that exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that philanthropic and charitable organisations will in future be eligible for a composite grant for the purposes of housing that type of persons.  I take it also that the local housing authority are not precluded from participating in that development.  It might be difficult in many rural areas to get philanthropic or charitable organisations to engage in this very praiseworthy work.  In that case the local authorities could come into the picture.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local housing authority.  We have been endeavouring for years to deal with this problem without much success&mdash;indeed with hardly any success at all.  Now, because of its being in the scheme of grants, we could make some worthwhile progress.  Naturally, if charitable organisations would be prepared to step into the breach we would be very happy to leave the job to them but if they are not prepared to do so, I take it the housing authority will be regarded as a competent organisation to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>In the case of new houses and particularly in regard to the obligations which the Minister is imposing on <Col N="1319" /> applicants to have them serviced, I would bring one point to his notice. Nowadays an applicant for a grant for a new house has to get a variety of clearances.  First, he has to get town planning approval; secondly, he has to get a certificate of valuation and, thirdly, he has to get a sanitary certificate if the house is being serviced.</P>
    <P>The securing of a valuation certificate does not present much difficulty but to get town planning approval and sanitary service approval does create difficulty to some extent.  Local authorities come into the picture very prominently in that connection and I am sorry to say that they do not seem to have set up any satisfactory type of office organisation to deal with the matter.  In a number of local authorities the office may be situated not in the main town but in one of the other towns.  That means that an applicant has to write to three offices to get three certificates.  I would earnestly request the Minister to ensure that one clearing office, if I may call it such, would be established in each local authority organisation to provide those certificates.</P>
    <P>Also, a considerable delay takes place in obtaining the town and regional planning certificate and the sanitary service certificate.  That is something that could be speeded up by the local authorities if they were prepared to be co-operative.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the loans that will in future be available for the repair of vested and unvested cottages. I am not quite clear as to whether the scheme of loans will enable eligible people to purchase vested cottages on the mortgage available on such a property. The problem of the housing authorities would be relieved to some appreciable extent if it were possible for some of the applicants, who have been lined up for rehousing, to purchase vested cottages which become available in the locality in which they wish to live.  The difficulty was that they did not have the money and that type of prospective purchaser would not, in the ordinary course of events, be able to get a loan from a bank. <Col N="1320" /> The result was that these vested cottages were purchased by people who were in a position to get money to acquire them.  I see no objection to the local authority being able to finance the purchase of a vested cottage for a person who is eligible to buy through the loans system, any more than to financing the purchase of a private house if it were available in the district.  I trust the scheme of loans will cover these cases.</P>
    <P>In connection with reconstruction grants in rural areas, there has been a tradition that when the roofing was being replaced it was replaced either with corrugated asbestos or corrugated iron which was a satisfactory type of roofing.  The main reason why it was used was that with this type of roofing the valuation of the house would not be adversely affected.  When this roofing job was being done the thatch or straw, as the case may be, was left intact and for some years the Department accepted that.  However, in recent years grants are being refused unless the inside covering or straw is removed. I take it the reason is that the engineers do not regard it as a good job otherwise.  That may be and without in the least finding fault with the engineering views in that regard, I think a certain amount of commonsense must be used.  This method of roofing, with the inside material I refer to being left intact, has proved over the years to be a good job.  It creates a certain amount of warmth in the house.  It might tend to create some hazard from the point of view of fire but otherwise it is satisfactory. I would seriously suggest to the Minister that he might reconsider allowing that type of roofing to be done in future.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has sanctioned this scheme of grants for experimentation on a cheaper type of house.  We have all been talking for many years about the cost of housing and saying there should be a cheaper type of housing, but there has been no serious approach made to the problem. This scheme of grants will enable local authorities to deal with this problem with a view eventually to producing a type of house which will come on the <Col N="1321" /> market at a reasonable price and, of course, a reasonable rent.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants contained in this Bill in connection with the provision of extra rooms to eliminate overcrowding is also a generous one. There are many houses throughout the country which lend themselves to that type of improvement and even though it is being done in a piecemeal fashion it is a step in the right direction.</P>

Senator Dooge has covered all the points in this Bill very fully and anything that could be said subsequent to Senator Dooge's remarks would be repetition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Housing Bill is assured of a welcome because in spite of all that has been done, there is still quite a lot to be done in order to provide adequate and suitable housing for our people.  All of us would like to have had more time to examine this Bill and it is a pity that we are dealing with it in this very rushed way. Some of us would have liked to put down amendments but, as in the case of the other two Bills with which we have been dealing recently, we find that at this stage that is impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that strikes me in connection with this Bill is that there is no increase in the grants.  This is one thing to which most people looked forward in the Bill.  It is a long-promised Bill and many of us felt there would be an increase in the amount of the grant because building costs have gone up considerably and continue to rise.  This one aspect might be a deterrent to young people who might want to avail of the opportunity of building their own houses. They will hesitate to take on the payment burden when there is no increase in the grant.  As a result they will be more inclined to stay on in their present, maybe unsuitable, surroundings, eventually as their families come <Col N="1322" /> along and get bigger they will become a liability on the local authority. They will be living either in condemned houses or overcrowded conditions and as a result the local authority will be faced with the necessity of providing accommodation for that type of family.</P>
    <P>The stipulation in the Bill in regard to unserviced houses is one which I particularly welcome.  It should be welcomed by all who wish to see the end of houses without water or sanitary services.  The extension of the provisions of the Bill to include loans to persons in vested labourers' cottages who wish to repair and, if necessary, to extend their houses is welcome.  However, it would have been better if the Bill had fixed the repayment period over, say, 50 years or given an option to the person concerned to pay over that period.  It is something which we in the Labour Party feel should have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Bill dealing with a new scheme for housing elderly people.  This also is very welcome.  The newly-weds and people about to be married could have been dealt with in this way and specified accommodation could have been arranged for them in the same way as for the elderly people.</P>
    <P>We all know the difficulties facing newly-weds who have either to live with in-laws or in unsuitable accommodation. When young people want to get married, the last thing they give consideration to is accommodation. Eventually when they do get married, they go to live with the boy's relatives or perhaps with the girl's.  We all realise by now the clamour there is for houses for this type of family in all local authority areas.  Sometimes one gets the impression it is the fault of members of a council that such people are living in overcrowded conditions with in-laws.  This is something we who are members of local authorities want to impress on the Minister.  We hope that in future when it is well known that young couples are about to get married every possible means will be used to enable them to live in decent conditions so <Col N="1323" /> that they may be able to start married life in the proper way.</P>

      <P>I am rather disappointed that there is not in this Bill anything more for any section of the community.  I had expected a general increase in grants, having regard to the rise in the cost of living in the past few years.  Of course I do appreciate the value of Section 6 and I am glad the Minister introduced it.  I hope the local authorities will avail of it to the full.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister to allow grants of two-thirds of the estimated cost of the work in cases where persons reconstruct or improve houses, in cases where the occupants derive their livelihood from the pursuit of agriculture and whose valuations do not exceed £40</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (2) of Section 4 and in subsection (1) of Section 12, dealing with supplementary grants, we find that a farmer with a small valuation on land and a rather high valuation on buildings is victimised.  I submit a combined valuation of £50 on a farm does not nearly equal the £832 limit <Col N="1324" /> allowed on salary.  From that point of view I do not think the farmer gets a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>Five or six years ago the National Farm Survey found that an average farm comprised 52 acres of land.  In my area the valuation ranks at £1 an acre for prime arable land and taking that as a basis we will find that a farm with £50 combined valuation would have only about 35 acres of land. That cannot be regarded as an economic holding and we therefore have too many borderline farms as far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned. The Minister should amend this provision so that only the valuation of the land would be considered for qualification for grants.  The increase in the valuation is far too steep and I can see it acting as a deterrent to wider applications for grants and this merits further consideration for the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Carton that many of the criticisms could be left over for Committee Stage when the Bill will be taken section by section.  Anybody connected with the housing of the people must welcome this measure as at least an assurance that the Minister and his Department are aware of the problems. Unfortunately, too many people expect the local authorities to take complete responsibility for housing them.  It is rather unjust to expect local authorities to build houses for young couples even before they are married.  Where I come from, such a proceeding could not be visualised because there are too many pressing problems for people already living in houses that are really uninhabitable. There are many people that I know in good permanent employment and I welcome the fact that in this Bill the Minister has made it possible for them to obtain loans and facilities to become owners of houses.  The Minister and his Department should encourage that trend.  No local authority should aim at becoming the biggest landlord in the country.  If people have a stake in the country, it makes for better citizens and no stake is better or more beneficial than ownership of one's home.  For that <Col N="1325" /> reason, I welcome the provisions the Minister has made to that end.</P>
      <P>Housing of elderly people has always been a problem.  I hope the Minister's ambitions will be realised and that philanthropic and benevolent organisations will undertake this work which is a social necessity and a great charity.  Many elderly people are in mental hospitals because there is no other accommodation for them.  That is appalling in a Christian country and it is a real problem.</P>
      <P>In one section of the Bill, the Minister makes provision for storm damage.  In urban areas, there are houses which are already earmarked for clearance for future development, perhaps in ten or 15 years' time.  That is the proposal of the town planning experts and architects but nobody knows when it will happen.  In the meantime, people have suffered storm damage and the houses are not habitable. If some assistance, such as is suggested for rural areas, is not given, it means that the local authority will have to provide alternative accommodation at much greater cost.  I asked the Minister to see that, if possible, that situation is covered in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am sure we shall not be able to please all sections of the people but, generally speaking, most people will welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one general point concerning matters mentioned before in this House by my friend, Senator McGuire.  Senator Dooge this evening referred to the maturity now reached in regard to housing.  We all welcome that maturity and this Bill and the Minister's interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill deals with the building of prototype houses and it was rather interesting, and perhaps a little alarming, to hear the Minister say that the aim of this section is to cheapen production of houses.  There seems to be no question anywhere of appropriate designs for houses and housing schemes, not only with regard to surrounding houses but with regard to surrounding landscapes.  The general <Col N="1326" /> question of siting of houses has not been dealt with, apparently, or attention paid to it.  That is quite understandable because we are all aware of the legacy and burden left to Irish Governments here in 1922 and it is very comforting and satisfactory to see so many of our people now housed in clean surroundings with baths and water supplies, particularly in the cities, and whose very bad conditions have been very materially improved by successive Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>I should like to put to the Minister that our anxiety to make up the leeway made for haste and I think also for lack of plan and particularly, I think, for lack of thought about beauty or aesthetic surroundings.  In the main, we have taken a utilitarian and practical viewpoint but it is true that a good appearance, harmony of one house with another and with the surroundings, also has its use.  There seems to be no reference in Section 7 or in the Minister's mind when dealing with that section to the design of houses and the question of house design in this country has very largely been left to people who, in the nature of things&mdash;they cannot be blamed for it&mdash;have neither training nor mind nor aptitude for proper design.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in another section there is reference to reconstruction.  Reconstruction or repair and improvement very often mean that the house, an oldish one, is improved from the point of view of the people living in it but from the point of view of the landscape a reasonably good house becomes ugly and from that point of view very much disimproved.  The siting of houses should be dealt with and also, particularly in the cities, the question of open spaces.  If you look down from Dublin Mountains on our city now, housing schemes look rather like a red rash upon the landscape.</P>
    <P>I went for a walk on Tuesday evening with a foreigner who remarked that there was a curious similarity between our housing and British housing and that there was the same lack of any consideration for beauty.  That applies, for example, to the preservation of trees.  In spite of legislation that we have, apparently a builder can <Col N="1327" /> get hold of a site, knock down all the trees he likes and build houses, without any regard being had to what is happening.  Beauty of landscape is a great asset, the preservation of which would not only help the tourist trade but would also help in the education of our own children.  Children who grow up in certain surroundings are improved by the actual beauty of their surroundings.  On that point, perhaps the Minister would tell us when concluding what progress has been made in regard to derelict sites and their clearance about which we had a Bill some time ago.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and his predecessors were preoccupied with the provision of houses and the Minister's efforts in that direction are praiseworthy but the Minister is thinking of the provision of houses alone, the provision&mdash;if I may say so &mdash;of shelters rather than houses.  If more thought were given to the particular type of scheme and the appearance of each house, the whole job would be better done and there would be good results for those reared in those houses and for those people who pass by and look at the houses and also for visitors to the country. The whole character of the country may be shown in housing, the appearance of the houses, their character and condition and their place in the landscape.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour that point or put it forward by way of severe criticism of the Minister.  I do not say he is responsible any more than his predecessors but I should like to put it to him, particularly now when we have reached the point when a great deal of housing has to be done, that more attention should be given to the placing of houses, to their position in the landscape and to trees than unfortunately has hitherto been the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will be keenly disappointed with this Bill. Great things were expected of it and many people deferred operations until the terms of the Bill were announced. The coming of the Bill was so long <Col N="1328" /> delayed&mdash;until March of this year, I think&mdash;that people expected vast improvements.  They are now bitterly disappointed that the grants have not been increased.  The mountain has been in labour and has produced a mouse.  The Minister knows&mdash;and Senators have alluded to it&mdash;that due to the increases in costs of labour and materials, many people believed, and indeed were led to believe at local authority meetings&mdash;if not by the heads of Government&mdash;that the grants would be increased.</P>
      <P>All this Bill does is to continue the existing grants.  The local authorities were given permission in 1949 or 1950 to give supplementary grants.  At that time the grants were fixed at £300 or £310 if they were operated through a building society.  The amounts are now out of date and completely inadequate, because when the grant of £300 was given in 1949 or 1950, it was possible at the cost of materials and labour at that time to build a nice five-roomed house for around £1,000. A similar house today would cost at least £1,500 or £1,600 to build.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there is no extra incentive or encouragement in this Bill.  At that time a person building a house costing £1,000 could get a State grant of £300, plus a county council grant of £300, that is, £600 out of £1,000, or three-fifths of the cost.  Today if he gets £600 for a house costing at least £1,600 to build, he is getting only three-eighths of the cost, so there is no extra incentive or encouragement.</P>
      <P>House building needs a shot in the arm.  The Minister has said:</P>
      <P>Housing activities in recent years have shown a marked trend in the direction of private enterprise.  This welcome trend, which appears likely to continue ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>et cetera.</i>  I cannot see where we have that marked trend, or any welcome trend, in house building, because the statistics prove the very opposite.  On 29th May, 1962, at columns 1579 and 1580, Volume 195, No. 12 of the Official Report, the Minister told Deputy Jones that the number of houses built by the local authorities <Col N="1329" /> was: in 1954-55, 5,267; in 1955-56, 4,011; in 1956-57, 4,784; in 1957-58, 3,467; in 1958-59, 1,812; in 1959-60, 2,414; in 1960-61, 1,463; and in 1961-62, 1,238.  We find that during the three years from 1954 to 1957, 14,062 houses were built, and in the past five years a total of only 10,394 houses were built.  As a matter of fact, 4,000 more houses were built in the three years I have referred to than were built in the past five years.</P>
    <P>Let us take houses built with the aid of grants by private individuals. We find there the very same trend. In 1954-55, 5,006 houses were built; in 1955-56, 5,436; in 1956-57, 5,647; in 1957-58, 3,629; in 1958-59, 2,684; in 1959-60, 3,740; in 1960-61, 3,952; and in 1961-62, 4,049.  In the three years 1954 to 1957, a total of 16,089 houses were built by private individuals with the aid of grants, and in the past four years the figure was about 14,000.  As a matter of fact in those three years which we are often told were disastrous years, 2,000 more houses were built than were built in the four years the Minister was in office.  I do not see the welcome trend there because we are still an average of 1,000 houses below the figure for the 1954 to 1957 period.</P>
    <P>Let us take the total number of houses built with State aid by the local authorities and private enterprise.  We find the same trend.  In 1954, 11,179 houses were built; in 1955, 10,490; in 1956, 9,837; in 1957, 10,969; in 1958, 7,480; in 1959, 4,894; in 1960, 5,992; and in 1961, 5,748.  Last year the number built was only half the number built in the three years from 1954 to 1957.  The figure then was in the eleven thousands each year, and it is now only in the five thousands.  I cannot see any trend there of which anyone can be proud.</P>
    <P>The number employed on house building has decreased by over 66? per cent.  If we look at the statistics published in connection with expenditure by local authorities for each of the years ended 31st March we find that in 1955 the figure stood at £12,559,000; in 1956, it was £12,260,000; in 1957, it was £10,814,000; in 1958, it was down to <Col N="1330" /> £7,069,000; in 1959, it was £5,961,000; in 1960, it was £6,061,000; and in 1961, it was £6,389,000.  If we take the three disastrous years, we are told about a total of £35,651,000 was spent by the local authorities under the heading of &ldquo;Loan and Stock Accounts of Local Authorities&rdquo;.  That was the expenditure in those three years.</P>
    <P>Let us take, then, the following four years when we were supposed to have this welcome trend.  A sum of £25,479,000&mdash;that is, £10,000,000 less was paid out by the local authorities. That means that in the three years, &ldquo;the three disastrous years&rdquo;, according to Fianna Fáil, £10,000,000 more was paid out than was paid out in the succeeding four years.</P>
    <P>The Minister deals with housing in rural areas.  I think it is admitted that our small farmers are the worst housed section of our community.  There is no encouragement for them in this Bill. In his concluding remarks, the Minister refers to the urgency in relation to housing in rural areas and continues:</P>
    <P>I propose to deal with this aspect of the matter in conjunction with my proposals for an up-to-date consolidated code for local housing authorities, which will, I hope, contain special provisions in relation to the rural situation.</P>
    <P>The sooner the Minister introduces that, the better.  What this means now is that even if small farmers are inclined to build they will wait for a further six or eight months or a year until the Minister introduces the new Bill.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that many small farmers and their families are living in houses which are no better than hovels.  These dwellings should have been knocked down long ago and good houses erected in their place.  Unfortunately, small farmers of up to £30 valuation have not the money to erect houses for themselves.  In some families, members who had emigrated to America or to Britain sent money home and in that way some farmers of the kind I have in mind were able to build fine houses for themselves. However, the vast majority of those <Col N="1331" /> who remained at home have been unable to provide suitable housing for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority. I have had the application forms of those people before me on numerous occasions.  I have helped some of them to fill them in.  When they inquire about the loan, and so on, they are frequently afraid to go ahead because the rate of interest represents a very large sum over a period of 35 years. It is a pity that, in conjunction with the Minister for Lands, a scheme could not be introduced to build houses for those people.  Let the Land Commission build them.  Let the Land Commission get all the existing grants.  Let the cost be added to the annuity and spread over 70 or 80 years.  I do not see any other way of getting houses built for those people because the majority of them are not in a position to build.  Many people in rural areas cannot be connected to the electricity supply.  They are unable to avail of these grants and loans.  They are paying high rates, high taxes and are faced with a soaring cost of living.  They have roads which they cannot travel. There is no provision in this Bill to house them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It contains some very good innovations to meet the social requirements of modern society.  Some Senators found fault with the Minister because he does not propose to increase the grants to private individuals.  We should all like the grants to be increased. In recent years, the Minister has done fairly well.  Compare the present grant of £275 to private individuals with that of £70 less than 30 years ago.  It represents almost four times the amount.  I think I am correct in saying that in those days the terms of the grant were regarded as fairly generous.</P>

      <P>Section 3 deals with reconstruction grants.  I want to refer to the valuation limit of £50. There is a discrimination against farmers with a valuation of £50 and over.  In certain parts of the country, a valuation of £50 would represent a smallish holding.  The time has come when that particular problem should be re-examined.  Senator McDonald, who referred to this matter, seemed to be under the impression that there was no grant at all available to farmers with a valuation of over £50.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>I am talking about a State grant.  There is a certain amount of confusion in the minds of people as to whether there is any grant available to farmers with a valuation of over £50, but, as I said, Section 12 of the Act of 1960 provides for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to supplementary grants by local authorities.  This system of the payment of supplementary <Col N="1334" /> grants has been in operation for some years.  Some local authorities have adopted the scheme and others have not.  The Minister is wise to leave it to the local authorities themselves to make their own decisions in this matter. Today some Senator advocated uniformity in the amount of the supplementary grants to be paid by all local authorities.  That would not be feasible because the financial circumstances of all local authorities are not the same and the Minister is wise to leave the amount of these supplementary grants to the local authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with subsection (3) of Section 3 under the heading of reconstruction grants under which it will now be possible to get a reconstruction grant to repair a house damaged by storm.  I welcome that provision very much but the terms should be widened.  Instead of using the term &ldquo;damaged by storm&rdquo;, it would be better to use the term &ldquo;damaged by act of God&rdquo; because a house could be damaged in other ways. Lightning could strike a house and damage it just as much as if not more than a storm.  I do not know whether lightning would come under the heading of storm&mdash;I do not think it would. Of course it would be accompanied by a thunderstorm but the thunder would not cause any damage.  It would be the lightning which would damage the house.  I should like that matter to be considered some time.  Damage could also be caused by flooding which would be an act of God, so that if the term I suggest were used, it would be much more satisfactory than the term in the Bill.  That is all I have to say.  If there are any further points, we will be able to discuss them on the sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the amount of the grants has not been increased.  Quite a number of people were waiting for an increase and I held up some people from going ahead with their reconstruction work in the hope that the new Bill would bring greater relief.  I want now to deal with the difficulty people who are in vested houses or cottages have in getting loans.  The local authorities do not give loans because <Col N="1335" /> they say they are debarred from doing so by Section 21 of the 1936 Act.  I am sorry the Minister did not repeal that section.  The Minister cannot direct the councils to give the loans and if there is any flaw in the Act, the council will not give the grant.  I cannot see how they can give the loan because I cannot see how they can get the security.  Until the house is fully purchased, the council has a mortgage on it and I cannot see how they would see their way to placing a second mortgage on it.</P>
      <P>Vested houses are usually overcrowded with big families living in them and extensions to these houses involve quite an amount of money.  I know of houses which are three-quarters finished and the people have not got the money to finish them because they cannot get a loan from the council.  Originally, they were under the impression that they would get a loan.  If we look around to see what people are badly housed, we will see that they are small farmers on small valuations.  Some of those who are the worst off are those on valuations between £20 and £35.  If there is a married man with a family living in a house with a valuation under £20, the local authority may build a house for him.  In our county, we build houses for people with a valuation of less than £20 but we do not build houses for anyone with a valuation in excess of £20, no matter what the family circumstances may be.  The only people living in thatched cabins in the Midlands are the small farmers.  I cannot see that a great lot is done for them in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not think the grants for old people will be availed of because old people will not take on the liability of building a house, no matter how small it may be.  That section of the Bill will never be availed of to any great extent.  I can see abuses creeping in under the section.  If the grants are greater for old people, I can see the situation arising where a nephew, a son or somebody else will stay away until the house has been completed and then come home and take possession of it.  That provision will not mean a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to define <Col N="1336" /> what he means by an old person.  No age is specified in the Bill and I think an age should be specified.  When a man applies to become a rate collector or rent collector, if he is over 45, he is told he cannot apply.  Is the Minister thinking of a person of 60 or 70 years of age or an old age pensioner? I should like to see 60 years of age stated, because I think if you stated a particular age, you would get somewhere.</P>
    <P>Grants and loans will be given for the cheaper type of house.  I do not think that will get us anywhere.  No Department has ruined so many good plans as the Department of Local Government.  Recently, we built 14 or 15 new houses in Mullingar.  The plans were up with the Minister's Department ten times before they were eventually sanctioned.  Every time they went up, the Minister replied that the cost was too great and back they came again.  There had to be a reduction in floor area, alleyways instead of halls, a reduction in the amount of timber. Before the houses were sanctioned, there was an increase in the cost of materials and wages, with the result that we had to pay more for the bad type of house than we would have had to pay for the good one.  Our rural houses have been ruined because of the demands of the Department for reduced standards.  We had a scheme of houses which had been praised highly throughout the country, but there is nothing right about our new houses.  The halls are only three feet wide, which is not at all sufficient for a main hall.  The Minister is continually advocating water and sewerage supplies for houses, but in the new houses he is sanctioning, we can find no place to put in a bathroom.  I do not know why that is so.  The making of such provision would not mean that the local authority would have to put in the bath and the water and sewerage. We have done a good day's work by allowing people in non-vested houses to get grants for water and sewerage. These people in non-vested houses cannot get reconstruction grants and you will, therefore, have no progress as regards the installation of water and sewerage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> I want to raise another matter in connection with the income limit for SDA loans.  I understand the Minister is retaining the figure of £832.  I cannot see any reason for doing so. Last year, we sent a resolution to the Department asking that that figure be increased to £1,200.  Yet we have this Bill retaining the figure of £832.  The people who get money from local authorities pay it back plus six per cent. and plus a half per cent for costs. A question was asked in Westmeath County Council the other day as to how many bad clients we had in view of the fact that something over £1,000,000 has been paid out in SDA loans.  The answer was one.  There was only one defaulter in the whole county. That is extraordinary.  We are cutting out the better-class people, people like engineers, school teachers and white collar workers of all description.  Some of these people find it very difficult to make any arrangements to secure money from insurance companies or banks.  I should like the Minister to consider that.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree it is desirable that private building should be encouraged, but the Minister could have gone considerably further in this Bill to encourage private building, especially as the Bill is in the nature of a permanent measure. On the question of supplementary grants, the ceiling fixed by this statute for local authorities is £832 in the case of wage-earners.  That means that, if a man is earning more than £832, the local authority are not permitted to give him a supplementary grant.  As we know, these supplementary grants <Col N="1338" /> are made on a sliding scale, and by the time £831 is reached, it is probable the grant would be only one-third of the maximum.  A man earning £832 or even £1,200 needs a lot of encouragement before he embarks on providing a house for himself.  The more of this type of housing we have provided, the less will be left for the local authority and the State to do.</P>
      <P>I intended to make the very point just made by Senator McAuliffe.  I know, of course, that within the past couple of years, the ceiling has been increased from £800 to something over £1,100, but I think that is still too low.  The ceiling should be up to £1,500 or £1,600.  In that way, you will encourage the type of person likely to build his own house to get on with the job.  A married man earning £1,200 with no collateral security will find the greatest difficulty in going into a bank and raising £1,000 or £1,500 to enable him to build a house.  The bank simply will not do business, especially over a long period.  Insurance companies and building societies are very slow to advance money to private individuals to build houses outside the cities and very large towns.</P>
      <P>Before this last increase in the ceiling came, I knew a schoolteacher living beside a country school&mdash;I have a feeling the Minister might know the man who wanted to build a house.  He could not get a loan from the county council because they had not authority to give him a loan.  He applied to insurance companies and building societies and they would not accommodate him.  It was only after a great deal of pressure brought to bear on someone or other that his needs were met.  These people should be encouraged to build their own houses, and the ceiling for the granting of loans and the making of supplementary grants should be raised still higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point.  It may be peculiar to Cavan, but I am sure not peculiar solely to it.  I refer to the position of the very small farmer with ten, 12, or 15 acres of land.  He cannot house himself.  Now there is some scheme whereby the county council can take a transfer of a piece of his land and build a labourer's cottage on it for him.  He is not a labourer in <Col N="1339" /> the strict sense, though he does, on occasions, work for hire or reward.  It is essential for that small farmer that, if his house is to be any good to him, it should be built on his own farm. Within the recent past, the county council have not been permitted to provide a cottage for such a farmer on his own land unless the land adjoins the county road.  That means that such farmers now just cannot be housed. They cannot house themselves.  That is out of the question.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, I think, look into this matter and revise the regulation. The regulation is quite sensible where it applies to a labourer's cottage, properly so-called, because that cottage may have to be sold or may be needed for another labourer tenant. What I have in mind is the cottage which will be used by the occupier of the land on which it is built.  If we do not house that man up a lane&mdash;it may be one hundred yards, or so, up the lane he travels, and his people before him travelled for generations&mdash;that will be tantamount to telling him he will not be housed at all and that he had better sell and get out.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes touched on the layout and design of houses.  Something should be done to encourage private individuals to lay out the grounds of their houses properly.  I have not in mind any grandiose scheme of landscape gardening.  What I have in mind is the prevention of the building of a house in the middle of a field, with no fencing, and not even a few shrubs, an ornamental hedge, or a proper entrance.  There may be two causes for that.  There is a general belief in the country that, if a house is left like that for a few years, there will be a smaller poor law valuation.  I do not think there is anything in the point, but it is fairly generally accepted.  The other point is that they merely qualified for the grant and then left the rest.  Giving a small supplementary grant of £25, a year or two after the house has been built and the grounds properly laid out, would be one way of providing an incentive to people to improve the external surroundings. Another and less popular way might be to withhold a small part of the <Col N="1340" /> grant, say £25, until the housing engineer certifies the grounds have been laid out in a reasonable fashion.  What I want to avoid is blots on the landscape.</P>
    <P>I would, of course, have been much happier, as would everybody else, if the grants had been increased.  Seeing this is a permanent measure, a grant of £275, which was sufficient some years ago, is certainly not sufficient now to encourage more private building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>My main purpose in rising is to correct what I feel are some misapprehensions in the minds of some Senators.  With regard to the amount of the loan, the income which a man had to have in order to qualify for a loan up to the passing of this Bill was £1,040.  Secondly, under this Bill, it is up to the local authorities themselves to decide what the income should be of the person to whom they propose to give a loan.  That seems to be the construction to be put upon Section 11, subsection (2)(b)(i) &mdash;&ldquo;the class or classes of persons to whom loans may be made under this section and the minimum contribution to be made at the time of the acquisition or construction of a house&rdquo;.  In other words, the local authority decide who are the class or classes of persons to whom they propose to give loans.  They decide how much must be put up by the person who is buying the house or building the house.  That deals with the amount of the loan given; it also deals with the class or classes of persons to whom the loan will be given. That is how it appears to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be also some misapprehensions as regards the purpose or purport of this Bill.  As I construe the Bill, it does not purport to be a solution of all the evils in relation to housing.  It does not purport to be the final solution.  It purports to be what it states it is, namely, an improvement in the situation in which persons may get supplementary grants.  Now persons with an income up to £16 a week will qualify.  As well as that, farmers who did not formerly qualify because their poor law valuation exceeded £35 will now qualify under this measure.  They <Col N="1341" /> will qualify for the full supplementary grant where their PLV is up to £50.</P>
    <P>The Bill, on the whole, purports to remove the terminal date for the giving of supplementary grants.  Up to this, if a man were erecting a house and wanted a supplementary grant, he set out the date upon which his house was to be started and the date upon which it was to be completed.  Subject to correction, I think the right of local authorities to give supplementary grants terminated under existing legislation on 31st March last.  This Bill simply says that, in future, supplementary grants may be given.  They may be given in full to farmers with a poor law valuation of under £50 and to persons whose earnings or incomes are mainly derived from agriculture. They may also be given to people who have an income up to £802.  These figures may from time to time be changed.  The terminal period is removed.</P>
    <P>In deciding what the primary grant is to be, the Minister and the Legislature must, of course, have regard to the spending capacity of the country as a whole.  Reading a fairly recent copy of the <i>Financial Times,</i> I noticed that the principal fear of many countries in Europe today is the fear of inflation.  That fear is particularly strong in West Germany, Denmark and even in Japan, a most progressive country.  We all know that if a country, as in the case of a private individual or a family, overspends, it is bound to result in inflation, which, in turn, is bound to cause hardship for a very large section of the community, for those who live on fixed incomes, for widows and, perhaps, orphans living on fixed incomes and for people living on pensions.  A Government, in deciding on what can be spent or what should be spent out of the public purse, must have regard to that factor and must also have regard to the capacity of the people to pay it.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is not&mdash;and I do not think anybody claims it to be&mdash;a solution of all our ills at this stage, it is a very good step forward.  I personally feel that it is the limit to which the Minister or the Government could go by way of grants or loans, unless they <Col N="1342" /> were to run the risk of causing hardship or injustice to other substantial sections of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I should like to point out that I think I was correct in my earlier statement.  Section 11(a) provides that the regulations are not made by the county council but are to be made by the Minister for Local Government, with the approval of the Minister for Finance.  I understood the Minister stated that he proposed to retain the present ceiling in respect of a small dwelling loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the Bill.  We welcome any measure which improves the housing position of our people.  No more essential measure could be brought forward than a measure of this kind which affects the housing and the health of the people. There is no difference of opinion about that at any time.  I am glad to see the attention that has been given to the matter and the discussions that have taken place, in spite of a comment that it would not take so much time. A matter of this sort should take up time.  It took up a good deal of the time of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with grants for essential repairs.  I think the Minister is allowing grants only for county health authorities, that is, rural authorities, and that urban authorities will not benefit from that section.  That would need to be amended so as to be applicable to all sections.  A matter of that kind should be uniform because the urban authorities have as great a problem, if not a greater, as the rural authorities so far as housing is concerned, despite the fact that immense headway in housing has been made in the big industrial areas like Dublin and Cork.  As a matter of fact, that is how it should be.  Housing has a priority on the agenda of the local authorities in the big industrial areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers to accommodation for elderly people but he does not specify who elderly people are.  There should be some age guidance for local authorities there&mdash;perhaps 60 years and over.  In any event, some indication should be given because there <Col N="1343" /> might be different views by different local authorities as to how that would operate.</P>
    <P>We might also require a section in the Bill dealing with loans to contractors obliging them to finish the job completely and look after the footpaths and roadways.  I do not see how that is provided for here, unless it is already provided for in a previous Act.  Final payments should not be made to contractors until they have properly carried out all the essential finishing of the roadways and footpaths because sometimes there is some difficulty about that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have the question of grants examined because it is a fact that the cost of building a house over the past two years at least has moved upwards.  Indeed, I think it is still moving upwards.  A house costing £1,600, £1,700 or £1,800 in an industrial area has today moved towards the £2,000 or £2,200 figure.  The person who builds the house has to try to find the extra money because he still gets the same grant.  He finds that a hardship.</P>
    <P>Of course, a great number of new houses are built by newly-married couples.  Either before or after getting married, they make the arrangements. They have to find the deposit which is pretty steep.  They find that pretty difficult if the grant is still only the same.  They get a reasonably fair house which they are anxious to have when they are starting off in life.  They are entitled to any consideration they can get.  If they build their own houses, they are making it somewhat easier for the local authority which has to keep on building houses for the masses of the people, especially the working class people, but it takes some burden off the local authority if people build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>Then there is the problem of the loan.  Of course, the loan is not the end of it.  They have to start paying back the loan.  They have to meet an interest charge of 6½ or 6¼ per cent.  The result is that a house costing £1,800, by the time payment is finally made, costs about £3,000 because of the repayment of the interest and the capital. <Col N="1344" /> From now on at least, that type of house will move into the £3,000 figure before the purchaser finally completes his payments.</P>
    <P>That is something over which no Minister has control but it would be an advantage if money for loans could be secured by the Government at a lower rate of interest.  There are organisations through which this could be arranged but unfortunately there are difficulties.  There are savings banks and institutions of that kind who have a good deal of capital but who do not appear to be allowed to use it in this way.  If they could it would ease the burden on the person who needs the loan.</P>
    <P>In regard to the period of repayment there appears to be a maximum of 35 years.  A person may pay over a shorter period but generally people are not able to do so.  It has been suggested that it would ease the burden if the repayment period were 50 years. It would mean a lower bill to meet each week and there would not be the same hardship.  It is very hard for a young married couple who have a family growing up and who have undertaken a rather costly house, to find a large amount of money each week to meet rates and rent.  Sometimes they find they have to give up the house when it is a quarter, a half, or three-quarters paid for because of some domestic or health problem.  If the burden were eased they might be able to retain their house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House except to make a few brief remarks.  I should like to join with the other speakers in congratulating the Minister for Local Government on having introduced this housing measure.  I fully appreciate the great help which public bodies and private individuals have received from the Minister in the matter of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about housing and various suggestions have been made as to how we can improve the lot of the people who are still in need of houses.  Over a long number of years I have considered the question of housing from every aspect, in regard to people living in both urban <Col N="1345" /> and rural areas, and I am satisfied that there is only one section of the people who are in need of special attention in regard to housing and that is those members of the farming community between £10 and £30 valuation. The people in the lower income group, the labouring class, have ample opportunity of providing themselves with houses.  No man earning a livelihood need be without a house in any county in Ireland today.  Public bodies have all the financial resources necessary to provide houses for people in that category.  Big farmers and other people of independent means can always provide for houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>About two years ago when the Minister had introduced the previous Housing Bill I made a special appeal to him to give a little more consideration to the small farmer.  I am personally acquainted with thousands of smallholders who are afraid, even with the facilities that are available at the moment, to put themselves into debt in order to provide houses for themselves and their families.  The incomes of small farmers are not static. They can be up or down and they are afraid that if they get a loan, say, of £1,000 for a house they might not be able to meet their obligations.  There are many such cases in the midlands and they are mostly people in the rural areas who have valuations of between £10 and £30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether to start with the relevancies or the irrelevancies but I shall take the points as they came.  In the first contribution made here today, Senator Dooge brought out a number of useful points.  However, there were some misunderstandings in his mind as to what this Bill contains and I should like to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator has taken exception to the statement I made in the Dáil in regard to the fall in standards in private building and suggested that this should be remedied by increasing the grants available from the Government. What I said in the Dáil was not to be taken as suggesting a fall in the standards of private building as such by <Col N="1346" /> people building their own houses.  What I had in mind was that there is a boom in building and it is our sad experience that booms in the building trade lead to jerry building as it is commonly known.  I made this statement in the Dáil that contractors who are in speculative building in a big or a small way were not, because of the boom period, to take advantage of that boom just as some of them did not so many years ago.  In order to ensure that this would not be done my inspectors were instructed to be even more critical in the future than they have been in the past. It is not a question of giving a greater amount of grants to remedy that situation and I actually said in the Dáil at some stage or another that to increase grants following increasing prices, which in all cases are not justifiable, is merely adding to the inflationary tendencies in the building trade.</P>
    <P>We are all quite well aware that although there have been very substantial increases in labour costs there has been relatively no increase in the past four years in general building material costs.  Despite that there has been a disastrous increase in some of the tenders being produced by our contractors at the moment.  The reason for that is that they have not got the men or the organisation to cater for all the work that is available to them.  The result is that although they may tender for practically all jobs that come up they put in a price they never hope to get; they merely do it as a routine measure, but if it does happen to come off, they will put on the long finger less well paid contracts and do those for which they will get a better price.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that public money will not be put into that channel further to inflate building costs which is the only purpose it will serve.  There is no point in our chasing this inflationary tendency in the building trade brought about by a boom in the availability of building jobs and the relative unavailability of building operatives. That is the position we are facing today and it is one which we should not use public money to extend still further to our disadvantage.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, another way of <Col N="1347" /> looking at it.  I did explain it in the Dáil fairly exhaustively but I unfortunately feel constrained to do it again because of the parrot-like repetition here on exactly the same lines as occurred in the Dáil where, apparently, I might as well not have bothered to explain it.</P>
    <P>In respect to this question of increases in grants, when we have had a level of applications and allocations of grants over the past three months&mdash; April, May and June&mdash;for which I have figures showing an increase of 25 per cent. over the corresponding period last year, surely no one in his senses would suggest the grants are inadequate, that they are unattractive and that people have been discouraged and have been standing in queues from 31st March waiting for the bigger grants on a promise which nobody has heard anything about and which I certainly never hinted at as being included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In those three months, we have allocated 25 per cent. more grants than last year, which was a record year in our history since we started paying grants in the Department of Local Government.  That is the background against which I looked at this matter of using the taxpayers', and indeed the ratepayers' money for the provision of supplementary grants where they would apply, and I asked myself was there a need for further increases at this time or would it be possible that the money given in additional grants would not go to those who find it difficult to provide the deposit for a new house, that instead it would go to further inflate prices for building&mdash; even further than obtains at this moment.  Lest anybody might think this is far-fetched, Senator Ó Ciosáin did mention earlier&mdash;I do not blame the Senators who felt he did not know what he was talking about&mdash;that the cost of building materials has not gone up since 1958.</P>

The <Col N="1348" /> base figure is 100 for 1953 and I think it is no harm the public should know about them and that the House should appreciate their significance.  Taking the base year of 1953 at 100, these figures emerge: wages in January 1958, were 110.8; in January, 1959, wages were 116; in January, 1960, 123.6; in January, 1961, 126.6; and in April, 1962, the latest figure available, 144.3.  Materials, in January, 1958, were 113.3; in January 1955, 110.5; in January, 1960, 107.5 and in January 1961, 110.4.  The most recent figure, which we have got by phone, is for April 1962&mdash;115.3.  Those are the figures.</P>

      <P>Do not forget that the people about whom most of us are crying as being in the greatest need are the people who contribute the greatest proportion of labour towards their own building and if labour costs have gone up and building material costs have not, then the rate in respect to the people of rural Ireland has gone up very little.  I am not using those figures for any purpose other than to bring the minds of our people around to the fact that building material costs have not gone up at all in keeping with costs in general and wages in general.  That is the point I really want to make.  It might be to our benefit outside, if not here, fully to appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the suggestion as to why there should not have been an increase in grants, we had Senator L'Estrange talking about a house costing £1,000 in 1950 in respect of which two grants of £300 each, one from the local authority and one from the Department, could have been received.  In the first place, the total grants then available would have been £550, but of course <Col N="1349" /> the £50 is very little in a calculation of this kind.  Senator L'Estrange now comes along and says that the £600 in grants now obtainable in respect of such a house would represent only three-eighths of its cost.  I heard only the tail-end of that argument here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now told that £600 in grants would be only three-eighths of the total cost.  Allowing for a certain discrepancy, we are bound to arrive at a situation, when these figures are given in round form by the Senator, that these grants should be increased in value.  The grants were set in 1950 at £275 for a new house.  A reconstruction grant was set at £80.  Then supplementary grants, unlimited up to the total value of State grants, operated for three months and those local authorities foolish enough to adopt the scheme practically went bankrupt.  We were brought by sanity to the situation where we realised we would not pay supplementary grants from our rate-payers' money to people who could not only afford to build their own houses but who could afford to build houses for half the neighbours in the street they lived in.  They were the people who reaped the benefits of those supplementary grants, introduced, I have no doubts with the best intentions in 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government who were taking credit for what they did in 1950 <Col N="1350" /> returned to office in 1954.  Strangely enough, although nobody will suggest costs had not risen between 1950 and 1956, six years after the setting of the grants at £275 and also the mid-point between 1962 and 1950, the Senator has not told us why, after those six years, the same Government did not increase these grants.</P>

      <P>That is not the point. Between 1950 and 1956, costs increased but no increase in grants was suggested or proposed up to 1956 or the beginning of 1957.  It awaited the Housing Bill of 1958 to bring any new increase in new house grants.  But in 1952 there was a significant change in the reconstruction and repair grants. Instead of the flat rate of £80, available under the 1950 Act, the 1952 Government&mdash;a different Government, I need not add&mdash;provided that £80 would be paid in respect of a three-roomed house, £100 for a four-roomed house and £120 for a five-roomed house, with corresponding supplementary grants according to a scale.</P>

      <P>I was in a county council who very nearly ruined themselves in two years by adopting the scheme highly recommended by the 1950 Government with whom we were co-operating to the full.  The only benefit we got from that is that for the past ten years that county council have been paying and will pay for the next 25 years back money borrowed from the Local Loans Fund to pay people who were well able to build their own houses and should have been doing so but who jumped on the bandwagon while the going was good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in 1952 we did it.  Let us not depart from the argument. In 1952, we made those changes and improvements in construction and repair grants.  They remained until 1958 and then there was a change under this heading as well as in the new house grants.  In 1958, a Government were in power&mdash;and there had been a few changes between 1952 and 1958 but no changes in the grants&mdash;the same Government as did the job in 1952 and they brought in a Bill increasing the reconstruction and repair grants from the 1952 scales and for the first time gave £100 for a three-roomed house; £120 for a four-roomed house and £140 for a five-roomed house.</P>
      <P>The increase in emphasis which we are now placing very strongly on servicing houses was brought into play with a graduated scale of grant in 1958 whereby, if a house were being built serviced in a non-serviced area, an extra £25 was added to the existing grant of £275, which is the grant we are now operating.  These grants have made significant progress up to the point that today we have a level of grant applications never before attained under any Government and it is still rising.  Because of that and the inflationary tendency in the building trade at present, I feel that the Government and I had to have regard to the usage of public money to boost further the inflationary tendency in building and the fact that it was unnecessary to encourage something already booming in record proportions, the allocation of grants in the past quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking all that into consideration and also that a great deal of money is needed for many other services, some of which have been increasing pretty substantially particularly in the recent past due to wage increases&mdash;which are very necessary and helpful&mdash;and because of moneys required for other very necessary developments which we must keep in mind, I think against the general background of what I have said, our grants are pretty encouraging and attractive.  It is a fairly good start to get up to £300 or £310 into one's fist as a down-payment, as it were, on one's own house which will be <Col N="1352" /> one's home in the future.  That may also be supplemented by a like amount from the local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody could say that this Government&mdash;or any Government&mdash;have been in any way niggardly in encouraging private initiative in the building sector.  We have been doing exceedingly well, having regard to our resources generally.  We are going ahead at a good rate at the moment. If the number of new houses taken in isolation, is less than in respect of a given year that might be picked out&mdash; as has been done for the sake of argument&mdash;we should not judge on that alone.  What we should have regard to is that we are doing more jobs on houses today, putting them into proper shape, than have ever been done before.  If that is so and if we are spending less money doing it, we are getting a better return for the money spent on housing than ever before, despite the fact that labour and building costs have undoubtedly gone up.  We should judge by the number of housing units we provide each year or the provision of which we encourage by our grants.  That is what is most worthy of note.  Measuring our progress on that basis, we are doing more now than in the past for less money and if we can continue in that way, I think nobody will have reason to complain.</P>
    <P>Senator Moloney referred to the question of re-roofing with corrugated iron or asbestos on top of scraws on old roofs from which the thatch might have been removed.  The complaint is that while this was allowed in the past, it is not allowed at present.  If it happened in the past, it happened without the knowledge of the Department and should not have been allowed at all.  We do not encourage it or wish to encourage it.  It is not in the best interests of the person doing the job and if we come to know of it, we shall not pay the grant.  Anybody who may have friends who have done this had better say nothing about it and should warn those who may be about to do it, not to do it because they will not get the grant.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Ó Siochfhradha whether the section dealing <Col N="1353" /> with the housing of elderly people would apply to farmers of a type of which we have too many, the farmer who is getting on in years and has a son also getting on in years to whom he will not assign his property&mdash;perhaps he is right.  They are all living together but the son cannot marry, or his prospective wife refuses to come into the house and the question is whether this section applies in such circumstances to provide, as it were, a sort of dower house of which much could be said.  It does not apply in the sense that the son or the father can get money to provide that house on his own land for his own use but it does not exclude the local authority taking the elderly couple from the old home, after they have assigned the property to the son who would continue to reside there with his young wife, and providing them with a house of the nature which is being discussed and getting the grants outlined in the section.  That may be done, or some philanthropic body or charitable institution might be interested, although I cannot see such a body being really concerned in such a case.  The section can be applied, but it is not directly applicable to the son or the father who does the job himself.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator McDonald who said that the £50 valuation was not comparable with the £832 income level.  As I have said, the £832 replaces two figures which existed in the past. One was a £624 income limit in the county boroughs, £520 being the figure which operated in the remainder of the country.  Those figures are now being replaced by a single maximum income limit figure of £832.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the £50 valuation limit figure, which is new in the Bill, is an increase on the £35 valuation which has operated up to the present.  Taking the two figures together, it may be asked whether the £832 income limit or the £50 valuation is the more valuable.  I will not say which.  I will just say that the £15 increase on the £35 valuation is more generous than was the increase from £624 to £832 in the income limit.  I shall leave it at that and not enter into a controversy as to whether the £50 and the £832 can be equated £ <Col N="1354" /> for £.  There are very many factors to be taken into account in that argument. I think Senators will agree that increases from £35 to £50 and from £520 and £624 to £832 are not too far out of line with each other.  There is nothing unreasonable about the two figures.  Both have gone up fairly substantially.</P>
    <P>Senator Healy said he feared that the storm damage section would exclude any operation under the storm damage heading in other than rural areas.  I am glad to assure Senator Healy that there are no grounds for his fears.  The storm damage provision will apply to all areas within and without the urban areas.</P>
    <P>Another point which I think has been completely misunderstood, and possibly understandably so, was mentioned by Senator Hayes.  He suggested that the emphasis in these new prototype grants was on the provision of cheaper houses and, taking the normal sort of deduction from the phrase &ldquo;cheaper houses&rdquo;, it means worse houses and less attractive houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that, Sir.  The Minister is making the enormous deduction, not Senator Hayes.  I did not say that.  I said that the Minister had made the argument that the section would provide cheaper houses. That was what I understood&mdash;maybe I was wrong.</P>

      <P>I may be misquoting the Senator's words, but at least I am not misrepresenting his intention in the statement he made.  He decried an emphasis on my part on cheaper houses rather than better planned houses.  That is what I gathered.  I took a note at the time but I could be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is in the mind <Col N="1355" /> of anyone, I should like to disabuse him of the idea.  It is not our intention merely to get cheaper houses to the detriment of planning or layout. We are looking for as good as we have and better, if possible, at a cheaper figure than we are now asked to pay.  That is all we are hoping to get from this rather extraordinary offer of half the cost of the house to anyone who can get a new house approved, with a new design which is not merely a copy and at a fair price. It must not be conventional.  It is an experimental house, if you like, but one which in terms of the future would incorporate good planning and durable construction.  Half the total cost of such a house will be paid, provided that the over-all cost ultimately is within economic reason.  What we are emphasising in the section is that if the house ultimately proved to be uneconomic, even though it was a most exceptional type of house, well constructed and well planned, if it were repeated throughout the country, we would pay the grant if we were already committed to it, but we would not pay a grant on that type of house in any future operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe was rather worried about there not being any loans available for a cottage that was already mortgaged.  That is not the case.  We are making provision in this Bill for loans for cottages where charges already exist on their title, but those loans can be made only through the local authorities.  The Senator can be satisfied that we have remedied a situation which has been there as a stumbling block for many years.  We have got around certain of the difficulties in connection with Section 21 and Section 36 of the Labourers Act without actually repealing it.  We would have repealed it but it carries many other consequences in its train. For that reason, we had to find a way around it, rather than wipe it out. It is quite possible that it may be wiped out in time, but for the moment it serves many other purposes as well as the one we got around in this Bill. We left it over for general consideration in the housing legislation which <Col N="1356" /> we hope to bring forward in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe said that in his county the local authority build houses, and I take it they are specifically built for an applicant of the small farming class whose valuation does not exceed £20.  He went on to say that they did nothing for people over £20 valuation, regardless of the most exceptional circumstances of those people.  The fact is that if they can go to £20 valuation&mdash;and they are one of the few counties who go that far&mdash; there is nothing to stop them from going further, if there are exceptional circumstances which they feel warrant the building of a house under the specific instance procedure, which is all too little used in all too few counties.</P>
    <P>For those who say that they are not in a position to do anything for the small farming group, that is something which was available for many years and of which very little use was made in most counties.  Rather than bemoaning the situation, it would be much more fitting if members of local authorities were to try to do what they can to build specific instance houses for a great many of the small farmers who are now so badly housed.  It would be far better for all concerned if more were done and less were said in regard to this group.  Furthermore, it would be far better for the community as a whole if those thinking about building houses did not wail that there is not enough being done for them.  There is far too much talk about what is not being done for people and too little thought and publicity are given to the great amount that is done for so many people.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan rightly said it is not good to breed the idea that everything should and must be done by the local authority or by the Government, if people can do it for themselves.  By and large, that applies in many walks of life today.  Regardless of what side of the House we may be on now, we are only making trouble for ourselves in the future because we may be on the other side on another occasion.  I do not think it is good for the morale of our people that it should be <Col N="1357" /> drummed into them that they should make no effort for themselves because the Government or the local authority or some other benevolent agency is there to help them, that they are entitled to be helped and that they need do very little for themselves.</P>
    <P>We have been doing a great deal, down through the years, in regard to housing.  I admit that there is quite a problem yet to be solved.  I disagree with those who say that all that we can do within the law and the resources available to us has been done.  That is not so.  It is evident that the effort made by certain local authorities is relatively poor in comparison with that made by other local authorities to solve the problem of the small uneconomic holder who is living in bad circumstances. We hope to get a clear picture of that aspect in the near future and, having evaluated the entire situation, we should be able to get our local authorities, through the present scheme or some new scheme, to put more emphasis on the housing of the people who are most needy at the moment, namely, by and large, the small farmers in the isolated parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We hope to be able to do something in that way and I am sure we shall have further discussion on that matter in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Useful suggestions were made advocating some additional incentive to people to lay out the surroundings of their new houses which have been built at very great cost to themselves, to the local authority and to the State. It would be very nice if the Department of Local Government could say to people: &ldquo;If you lay out your garden nicely, plant so many rose trees and a few nice shrubs we shall give you so much more.&rdquo;  I should be delighted to do it if we had nothing more urgent on hands.  The idea is very good and sound.  It would help to clean up the surroundings of some very fine houses which have recently been built but which were not properly finished or laid out by their owners.  Nevertheless, I do not think we can afford to offer that sort of incentive as yet.  Let us hope we can live to the point when we can say that the housing job has been completed and that we should now start cleaning up the surroundings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> That ties in with what was said by Senator Hayes on planning generally and landscaping.  I am very much at one with him on this matter.  It is being very carefully and adequately dealt with under the new Town and Regional Planning Bill about which I am sure we shall have much discussion in this House and in the Dáil.  It is an elaborate measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not all powerful in these matters.  He can only get the ideas.  Somebody else has to put them together.  Then comes the most difficult of all tasks.  The legal people have to draft them so as to give effect in law to what a layman such as myself thought about 12 months ago.  That is not easy.  If we are late in August with these measures that sequence of events has occurred this year.  Let us hope it will not occur next year.  That Bill has been circulated. It will be down for discussion when we return.  Therefore, we shall have ample time to discuss it.  It is in that context that I should prefer to discuss landscaping, planning and general lay-out of housing schemes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond mentioned the section on limited repair and said that it should apply to urban areas.  There was a very good reason why the limited repair scheme was initiated.  There are houses in very poor condition in isolated parts of the country which are occupied by one or two elderly people who have no means of their own.  It is obvious that no house will be built nearby by a local authority because the life expectancy of the occupants of the bad house is not long and there is no obvious successor to settle in the house. In that event it would be a completely uneconomic proposition and it would be unfair of my Department to ask the local authority to provide a new house. Therefore, limited necessary repairs are carried out so that the house may be made habitable for two, three or ten years, not expecting the life of that house to be any longer and not spending any more than is absolutely necessary on it.  It would be a problem to house those people if they live in a bad house at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> This special facility does not arise in an urban area where in a similar case if the house is replaced or if the occupant is rehoused in a new or a reconstructed house either on the old site or on a new site then, even if there are no successors, the house being in an urban area, will be in demand by many prospective tenants and will not be a loss to the local authority.  That is the distinction between the two sets of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion was that the Department of Local Government, in the exercise of its jurisdiction in regard to grants, should ensure directly or through the local authority providing the loan that the contractor will do the job properly.  We could not undertake that the Department of Local Government would become the virtual clerk of works to every prospective private builder in order to protect him from the rampaging building contractor.  Our inspector visits the site before building commences to have a look at it.  Usually he inspects it for the first payment when the roof is on the house and then he makes a final inspection when the house is reported to us as completed. Those two inspections, particularly at the half way and the finished stage, while they cannot be regarded as a warranty of good value or good workmanship by our inspector, must be of considerable advantage to the owner of the house inasmuch as if things are not right and are obviously not right to the inspector, they must be put right.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate feature is that things can be radically wrong within the walls or under the floors of the house, or in some part of the roof and are not detected during the inspections, good though the inspector might be.  These faults may only emerge through wear or with the passing of time.  We cannot possibly give any guarantee that our inspections, though we would wish them to do so, would guarantee good workmanship in all aspects.  The local authorities, in the exercise of their jurisdiction in regard to the payment of loans and supplementary grants could inspect and could again inspect subsequent to our final inspection and before paying the final part <Col N="1360" /> of the loan.  That is entirely within their discretion and could with benefit be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I suppose I have missed a number of points raised by Senators.  Some may have been raised in fun and others in earnest.  Those who raised them in fun will not mind if I have not answered them and those who raised them in earnest will probably raise them again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>One point which I raised was the possibility of sanctioning the erection of labourers' cottages on small farms even though the cottages were some 100 yards perhaps from the county road.  In the past that was sanctioned but recently plots have been acquired and people were led to believe houses would be built and then they were told they were not eligible for the small dwellings loan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a note of that and I forgot to mention it.  In so far as this specific instance procedure is concerned, with regard to building on the roadside, it is only to be used with reasonable discretion.  One cannot build in the middle of a bog if there is a road running at the end of one's farm.  If there are cases, and I have reason to believe there are, which I have not been aware of, then if any member who is aware of them would let me know I should be glad because I feel we should not be too stringent in the matter especially in cases where it means the difference between building and not building.</P>

While I should like to facilitate everybody, we have to be reasonable and act in a proper manner.  At the moment we are inclined to rush measures through which perhaps do not need to be rushed.

      <P>Because of this race through the sections, I found it hard to keep up.  I wish to raise a point in connection with Section 6, which deals with grants towards the provision of houses for elderly people.  Is there any provision which states that in the case of large buildings converted into flats, the flats should include one large room, a bed room, a toilet and cooking facilities?  I know of cases where large residences were converted into flats with a small number of apartments in each flat.  There should be a clause to the effect that there would be so many apartments of a certain kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no definition of the word &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; in this section and neither is there any definition of the word &ldquo;elderly&rdquo;.  Both those omissions are by design.  It is felt that the proposals which may come from bodies throughout the country will indicate much more clearly what we need and that this is preferable to trying to define statutorily something which may later prove to be an obstacle to the attainment of the ends for which the section is designed.</P>

    <P>We have not defined the word &ldquo;elderly&rdquo; because again these cases will have to be treated on their merits. <Col N="1363" /> We believe it is better to leave it in this loose way, to be determined when the need arises, rather than have a fixed age.  It is likely that the fixing of the age by the definition of the word &ldquo;elderly&rdquo; would defeat the purposes of the section.  These two words, therefore, are not defined because we feel that by defining them we might defeat projects brought forward later by any philanthropic body or any local authority.  It is not because we want <Col N="1364" /> to allow anybody to get away with a poor standard or to exploit elderly persons.  In fact, the very reverse is the case.  We feel that the best interests of elderly persons will be served by leaving these things undefined and leaving it to the discretion of the Minister and his Department to deal with these cases as they arise.</P>
