      <P>Last night, in opening my contribution to this debate, I dealt with some rather general principles.  Today I want to go back to three or four of the most important Departments, and the most important sections of our national life, to examine them and to make suggestions as to how they should be changed to face the challenge of the Common Market. We have to investigate every Department to see what we can do to meet this tremendous challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking first things first, we must take the Estimate for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this House we are rather conscious of the part played by Seanad Éireann.  In time to come Seanad Éireann will either have to be abolished or changed drastically to make it fit the part of the Upper Chamber, so that in the years to come, it will give a positive lead, and take positive action, in the way the Second Chamber should, rather than be as it <Col N="852" /> is today, unfortunately, a very pale replica of the Dáil.  In this Estimate, we see that our salaries are voted at £750 per annum.  I do not think we are giving value for that, or that we are provided with the opportunities to give value for it.  We see on all sides Senators who are quite capable and eager to make far greater and more positive contributions than they are able to make at present.</P>
    <P>To that end, I would suggest that if we are to justify our position and justify our allowances, the recommendations of the Commission on the Seanad should be implemented without delay.  They sought to make at least an improvement in the method of election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Senator's attention to the fact that legislation may not be criticised or advocated on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably would require legislation to amend&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly would require legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very many effective committees could be constituted in the Seanad, and these would work together as committees do and they are capable of handling many facets of the problems connected with the Common Market.</P>
      <P>We have the excellent work done by the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  I believe that the Seanad should be able to handle in a very responsible manner the problems connected especially with the political side of the Common Market and with the constitutional and other aspects of it.  I think we would all welcome the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Again, we are conscious of the salaries paid in Dáil Éireann.  Here, I might say that the Deputy's allowance of £1,000 per annum has not been brought into line with modern thinking. We have made provision for other sections.  I do not think the Seanad deserves any more&mdash;in fact it is overpaid &mdash; but definitely the members of the Dáil are underpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters of legislation.  The salaries of members of the Dáil are regulated by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I might remark that the present position, the <i>status quo,</i> means effectively that professional people or people in salaried positions are, by virtue of the very lowness of the salaries offered, unable to give up their present occupation and to seek to become members of the House.  I think that is a very regrettable position.  It is one that prevents these classes from playing the part which the corresponding classes play in all the progressive Parliaments of the world today.  Certainly, if we are to join the Common Market, our representation from all sections will have to match up with the representation available in the other countries.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that less than 25 per cent. of the members of both Houses are degree-holders in any respect.  I am not claiming any undue advantage for that except to point out that, in the modern day, with the opportunities that are available to all young men, it is now within the scope of all to carry their education to the fullest possible limit of their abilities. We hope that will be possible here within a very short time.  Consequently, we should seek for a great increase in the number of graduates in both Houses of Parliament because from what investigation I have made it would seem that we have the lowest percentage of university graduates of any Parliament in Western Europe today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in dealing with Dáil Éireann, the same applies to Ministerial salaries but we are prevented from advocating that.  I can only point to the fact that Ministers today, with a salary of £2,000, are paid less than the third rung of authority in their various Departments.  When we hear so much from the Minister for Justice and others about the necessity to pay adequate salaries so as to ensure that the people concerned can live up to their position, I would just point to the contrast of a Minister presiding over a Department in which the top <Col N="854" /> three rungs of authority are paid higher salaries than he is.  That does not prevail in any Parliament in Western Europe.  It is an anachronism and should be removed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The next Vote I wish to comment on is the Vote for Agriculture.  First of all, I will take the methods used to increase production.  The introduction of the subsidy for fertilisers was a worthwhile incentive but the results are most disappointing and, indeed, are negative in so far as the effect of the subsidy should be the growing of more grass which would feed more cattle. In point of fact we had rather a heavy selling in the past two years and to-day we have something like 150,000 or 180,000 fewer stock than we had two years ago.  That in itself shows that there is something wrong.  I think what is needed are more positive and definite steps to increase the cattle population.  I would suggest that there would be a subsidy put on cattle in order to ensure that they are retained in the main for breeding rather than for slaughter, as has happened to many due to rather attractive prices for beef in the past.  Our main objective should be to increase the cattle numbers.  We have not done that over the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome increase in the number of sheep but we are still making less use of our grass relatively speaking than we were two years ago. Taking the numbers on the land, according to the recent economic statistics we find they continue to slide downwards.  The June statistics show that there are 5,000 more members of the family on the farms in June, 1961, than there were in June, 1960.  That is a figure that is hard to believe.  Of course, I realise the errors that can occur in such a census.  It does seem the trend is still continuing as it was before.  There has been a reduction of about 6,000 per annum in the numbers on the land.  The numbers have gone down from 421,000 in 1954 to 380,000 today.  The numbers of members of the family on the farms have gone down at the rate of about 4,000 per annum.  What do these figures mean?  Are they significant? <Col N="855" /> You can look at it two ways.  Perhaps, the best way is to examine the intake of young people into agriculture. We find from the census reports that roughly 6,500 young men in the age group between 14 to 16 enter agriculture each year.  Out of 6,500 young men, who go to work on the land, 3,000 or 3,500 of them leave before reaching their early 20's.  We have an input at most of 3,000 young men into agriculture each year, between 3,000 and 4,000.  That means that since the war young men have been coming into agriculture in numbers only sufficient to produce a population on the land of between 150,000 and 200,000. That is a catastrophic figure and it spells ruin for us.  You may not be disturbed about the fact that the numbers are going down some 5,000 or 6,000, and say that we would be better off with fewer on the land and with a better living for the remainder, and that we would level off at 300,000 but the input shows that that is not what we are aiming at.  We are aiming at 150,000.  When that day comes we will have become the beef ranch of Europe and that is a position none of us wishes to see.</P>
    <P>What is the remedy?  It is shown here.  We have money provided for agricultural organisations and agricultural schools and so on, but that is not enough.  The problem can be analysed simply.  I speak from the practical experience of one born and bred on a farm in Limerick and who visits that farm regularly and knows the problems that are there and one who has also spent a long time with rural organisations.  The problem is simply that the industrial revolution, or the living revolution, has reached the farm with electricity, running water, transport, communications and so on being available.  We find that up to the age of 20 or 21 work on the land is, if anything, more attractive for young men than work in corresponding occupations in the city because the young men have what they like&mdash; contact with tractors and such challenges as are presented by modern mechanisation.  It is wonderful to see how young men respond to that.  The <Col N="856" /> result is that young boys of 15 or 16 on the land are earning more than their counterparts in industry where you have apprenticeships and where wages are geared.  Fortunately, there is no such gearing down of wages in the agricultural structure.  Therefore, the young boy can earn more money on the land than if he was employed in the city.</P>
    <P>It is, however, after that that the difficulty arises, when having reached the level of commanding £5 plus his keep, or £7 in all, there is then no future available above that and so he leaves and we are the losers.  At that stage, this farm apprenticeship scheme which has been promised for so long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must draw attention to the fact that there is a motion on the Order Paper covering that matter, and, therefore, it may not be discussed on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it would facilitate order, perhaps, I could have the motion withdrawn at this stage, because I am sure that my seconder, though he is not here today, would approve of that course.  In any case, we may hope that in the next five years we will have an opportunity of discussing the farm apprenticeship scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will now return to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Bill, we have the vote for the agricultural schools which are a vital element in any country for the development of a progressive agriculture.  We find in Vote 43 the increases given due to the <Col N="857" /> eighth round are shown here for extension and development.  The increase is just 2½ per cent. to the private agricultural schools whereas the increase to the State schools is the usual one of 16 or 17 per cent.  In interpreting those figures you have to make allowance for the fact that, as given on page 199 of the Estimates for 1962-63, the sums seem to be comparable. The total is £175,000 as against £178,000, but there was a land purchase involved in the Munster Institute, which distorts the figure to the extent of £21,000.  Consequently, the State schools, as shown in these detailed estimates, got 16 per cent. increase.  I am not quarrelling with that. It is probably not even enough.  I should like to see much more given there: but the private agricultural schools, which are carrying the main burden of the education of our young men, and such wonderful establishments at Pallaskenry, Warrenstown, Gurteen and the rest, have been given an increase of 6d. in the £.  My calculations, which it is not necessary to give in detail, show that pupils in the private schools got only about one-sixth to one-seventh of the amount spent on corresponding pupils in the State schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear private enterprise attacked very often, the implication being that the State can always do better, but here is a clear case of a grave injustice to our private schools.  In this case we might take a line from a country that may be one of our companions in the future, that is Holland, which jealously keeps an even balance between public and private schools.  In the case of training a pupil in a public agricultural school in Holland the pupil's individual grant is calculated to the nearest fraction, and everything is included, including contributions that do not appear here from the public works and other perquisites from State establishments under other Votes.  All these are calculated and then exactly that amount per pupil is given to the private agricultural schools.  The total paid here to the private schools, as given on page 200, amounts only to something like £89,000.  If that were increased five-fold so that private <Col N="858" /> schools were paid exactly the same as State schools that would involve a mere £500,000, and I am sure it would create the greatest revolution in agricultural education we have seen to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would involve new legislation, which is not in order on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am advocating is simply a redistribution of the £148,373,960 provided in these Estimates, and there is no need for any fresh legislation or increased taxation. There is something in many sectors here that would be far better spent on these agricultural schools&mdash; if I were to mention one, the money paid as subsidy to CIE, £1,175,000.</P>
      <P>So much for the agricultural schools. I think it is only fitting that as one representative of the graduates of the National University of Ireland I should pay tribute to the wonderful work they are doing, and condemn the scandalous way they have been treated by the State.  I can remember the quotation from somebody who said it is like when you starve a man and then jeer at him because he is weak.  Fortunately, our private agricultural schools are not weak, however they manage it.  How they do it is certainly a mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to another facet of agriculture, namely agricultural research. Here I speak for the Dairy Science Institute in University College Cork, and the total provided here under the Vote is £41,000.  That is an extraordinarily low figure to provide for both research and the training of our young men in dairy science.  The training of creamery managers, the managers of our food processing factories, the research in new products, and so on, is all supposed to be done on that small budget.  Of course, it is utterly impossible, and the amount provided there is an insignificant fraction of what is provided in the other countries of Western Europe. They have the reward for that in the increasing expansion of their major industry, dairying, and in the ability to capture markets with new products. I commend the provision made here <Col N="859" /> for the Agricultural Institute, which has expanded in the past couple of years, and I hope that when all the great schemes unfold they will very quickly make an impact on our economy.</P>
    <P>The figure of £40,000 for dairy science is very insignificant.  In a recent debate, the Minister said the dance hall tax was not worth collecting because it amounted to only £40,000 per annum.  Another £40,000 given to the dairy science faculty would achieve wonders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These moneys have already been provided for. Increased taxation cannot be advocated on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating any increase; I am merely advocating a redistribution of the £148,000,000 provided in the Budget.</P>
      <P>We come now to the next phase. Perhaps I might make one general comment here.  Where many of our facilities for agricultural education or general education, both secondary and University, are so completely out of line with what is required in a modern and progressive State in Western Europe, and where they could be doubled or trebled, it is physically impossible to achieve that doubling or trebling overnight or in a matter of a year.  If extra money is provided, it calls for additional staff, extra facilities and so on.  That is a development which requires a number of years.</P>
      <P>What we require is not that next year's Budget should jump up to European levels, but that we should have a policy aimed at providing in a certain number of years, in those various fields, facilities as good as those available to our competitors.  I would suggest ten years.  Of course we have to take account of the fact that it is no use providing in ten years' time the facilities which are available today to our competitors.  We have to calculate where our competitors will be in ten years and we have to aim at having our facilities at that level in ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IAOS subsidy or subvention from the State has remained static at <Col N="860" /> £11,000 for the past dozen years or more Money has depreciated very considerably since then.  The problems of the co-operative movement have been increasing in complexity and it is unrealistic that no change has been made in that figure.  I suggest that far more emphasis should be placed on the co-operative movement.  After all, it was an Irishman, Sir Horace Plunkett, who developed the idea aided by Father Feely and Father Coyne.  The co-operative movement was the means by which Denmark has reached its preeminence today.  We would do well to learn from that, and to learn that the co-operative movement is worthy of our fullest support, that it is our greatest hope for the future development of our industry.</P>
    <P>The same policy is evident on the question of grants to universities, not to talk of other education.  We find that there has been a general increase of just 18 per cent. in grants to the National University of Ireland.  That 18 per cent. is calculated on the basis of the general all-round increase of 12½ per cent., and on the fact that the State subsidy accounts for two-thirds of the revenue of the University.  Other income is mainly from fees.  There was an understanding that the fees would not be increased and they have not been increased.  That increase provides solely for the eighth round of wage increases and makes no provision whatsoever for the increase that is necessary to try to bring our universities into line with modern standards.</P>
    <P>If we want to see modern standards, we do not have to go to Europe, or Japan, or anywhere else.  All we have to do is go across the Border and right there we see an example of how a university should be treated.  Details about Queen's University, Belfast, are given in the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> Briefly, the general conclusion to be drawn is that there are there 6,700 students as against our 9,600 and they get the same amount of State subsidy. They have other income as well.</P>
    <P>We have also the very frightening figures which are given in the secondary school teachers' pamphlet.  Their comments on university education <Col N="861" /> should be read by all.  Tables 7 and 8 on page 9 of the document are based on reliable international statistics. They say:</P>
    <P>Tables 7 and 8 make it evident that an attempt is being made in our universities to adequately train the minds of Irish men and women of the present generation at less than one-sixth of the cost per student that is assumed to be necessary in England and Wales, and we may take it in Scotland.</P>
    <P>The comment is quite good.  They continue:</P>
    <P>The attempt if it were not such a serious threat to our economy might be considered a great if completely unjustified tribute to superior intellectual ability of the Irish mind.</P>
    <P>Those are the figures as given by them. They show the problem which will have to be faced to develop a ten-year programme which will bring all our Irish universities into line with those elsewhere.  Where is our policy on the Border or on anything else, if we have not formulated a policy on education? Are Queen's University to sink down to our level when they join us, or are we to get up to theirs?  We have the answer to those questions.  The same problem arises in this report by the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools. They dealt with secondary education and said that the provision made in the Estimates is totally inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again, I must draw the attention of the Senator to the fact that departmental revenue cannot be increased under this Bill. We are concerned with the administration of the Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, with all due deference, we can show where revenue is inadequate, if we can in any way discuss the Estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an occasion when administration relative to the Estimates is proper for discussion. If Senators continue to disobey the rules of order, we will never get through the business of the House. There are two ways of learning the <Col N="862" /> rules of the House&mdash;one, by studying them and the other, by breaking them. The former is preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do commend this report very wholeheartedly to the members.  In view of the ruling of the Chair, I do not see how this report can be discussed unless we are advocating increases this year, but we cannot do that; that is quite obvious.  Surely, what I am trying to discuss is the general impact of the Common Market on the various sectors of our economy; how that challenge calls for various adjustments in the different factors and how these can be achieved.  If, in that, we have to point out the deficiencies in our educational system we must at least be able to say that these deficiencies are not due to the people who man these systems.</P>
      <P>From the primary teacher to the secondary teacher, to the vocational teacher, to the university teacher and the research teacher, they are, one and all, giving a return to the nation that is, I would say, on the average, quite a bit higher than returns expected in other countries and they are doing that against great odds.  I think the nation owes them a great deal for it.  But you can only carry that so far.  In the future, we are conscious of the problems we face and we ask the means of coping with those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And now to move on to the question of the Local Government Estimate, as given here.  In this, we must make the general observation that local government needs to be drastically reorganised to cope with the present growth in unit size.  Units that were workable, and so on, 50 years ago are not workable to-day, quite obviously. Therefore, there is a great deal of rethinking necessary on this level.  The facet of which we are most conscious at the moment is the position in which the employees of local authorities find themselves, especially professional employes such as engineers, and so on. Their salaries are supposed, in some way, to be coming from the local authority for which, of course, there is a very large measure of taxation contribution.  However, they are supposed to come from there and therefore <Col N="863" /> the salary increases to mark the various categories have to be sanctioned by the various county councils or corporations concerned.</P>
    <P>My contention here is that these officials are as much public officials as the members of the civil service and consequently should be treated on a national level.  It is very demeaning that they should have to interview members of local bodies and to try to make the case to them why they should get the increases that have already been given to civil servants and others.  It is especially difficult at the present time when so many of the local bodies have got large farmer representation on them.  The farmers are conscious that others have got the eighth round but that they have got little or none of it.  If forecasts for the coming year are correct, the farmers will actually suffer a reduction.  Consequently. It is wrong that professional people should be put in the position of having to go and, as it were, to ask for funds to increase their salaries in that way.</P>
    <P>Again, I think we should take the position that has been occupied, almost by default, by the County Managers' Association.  They are, in some way, becoming the central body for the regulation of the salary levels of those below them.  I know these have to be sanctioned by the Department of Local Government but it does seem altogether wrong that such a position should be occupied by the County Managers' Association or that it should be thrust on them.  Consequently I appeal to the Government to look into this anomaly.  It is not a function of the county managers that was ever envisaged in any of the Acts in relation to county managers.  It can be a cause of a great deal of friction at various levels between managers and professional people.</P>
    <P>The rules prevent me from giving details but there are anomalies under which professions, especially the engineering profession, suffer.  We have to recognise that the greatness of Western Europe has been caused by the Scientific Revolution, its development of skills, and so on. Consequently, <Col N="864" /> in this, the technical man has played a supreme role.  Here, unfortunately, in almost 40 years of self-government, the effort has been to depress the technical man at the expense of the administrator.  I submit that in the future that faces us and the many problems that face us, most of which are quantitative, the technical man will have to play an increasingly important role.  Administrators should be drawn in greater measure from those technical people.</P>
    <P>It is taken at present as though the possession of technical training were almost a barrier to developing into an efficient administrator.  Therefore, I would advocate that that is a policy that we have to change and change rapidly.  Otherwise, we shall have the position that our technical men will continue to emigrate in even greater numbers in the future.  They will not stay at home to fill inferior positions and to be debarred from one of the real top promotion positions when in other countries their talents will get full scope for development.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would just mention the question of tourism, taking the report that has come to us this morning.  We are rather disappointed at the turn-out in the present tourist season.  I would suggest that tourism is a minus as well as a plus.  What we get in here from outside is a plus but increasing more and more is the minus that goes out from here I feel that a great deal of our effort should be directed to convincing our people that they can enjoy at home holidays that are in every way as good if not better than those they can get abroad.  It could be put to them also that they should see their own country first before they travel further afield and thereby make a very marked contribution to the Irish economy.  I also feel that we must do a great deal of rethinking on this. Despite the increase shown in the Vote here, and the increased promise over the next 5 years, they have not in any way succeeded in lengthening the tourist season.</P>
    <P>I would repeat a suggestion I made about two years ago, that one of the best ways of extending the tourist season would be to encourage our <Col N="865" /> people to take holidays in June or September, especially those in industrial employment.  I made the same plea in regard to children at school and that it would be better if we could finish our schools in early June so that the children and their parents could avail of the cheap rates in June and not over-crowd our tourist facilities in July and August.  There are many other things we can do in this regard.  Larger and bigger hotels are only a minor aspect of the problem.  The fundamental thing is to lengthen the tourist season.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Vote for the Department of External Affairs, we welcome the improvement we have seen in this Department for the past six or eight months where its record in the United Nations has been much more in keeping with what we might expect from a country of our resources and our traditions.  One might comment especially on their stand on the Cashmere dispute which was greatly appreciated by Pakistan.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we are voting, and quite rightly so, sums for the United Nations but we should take cognisance of what these moneys may be used for.  I shall quote from an article by the Political Correspondent in the <i>Irish Times</i> of July 14th in regard to the recent visit of U. Thant to Dublin.  He says:</P>
    <P>The effect he left on a journalist was most favourable.  He gave well informed and direct replies to many pointed questions, even one on the possibility that the United Nations would approve of birth control as a solution for world over-population.</P>
    <P>I take it that we here would not in any way subscribe either materially or otherwise to such a policy.  In conclusion, I should like to appeal again that next year it might be possible to arrange for a splitting of this debate into at least three or four major sections with the Ministers responsible from each section present in the House so that we might discharge our duties here as Members of vocational groups <Col N="866" /> based on vocational representations. Then we might be able to discuss such thorny topics as the necessity for increasing the amount of State aid given for education.</P>

    <P>Having passed those few remarks on the Irish language, I wish to return to the general trend of the debate and, like our friend, Senator Quinlan, I hope to be very brief.  The Senator in his early remarks referred to the challenge of the Common Market.  We have been listening to that phrase for a long time and now we are about tired of it. When people refer to the Common Market one would think that it was only now that we were beginning to set up our native industries.  I venture to say that when we join the Common Market the industries we have set up will be able to hold their own in any part of the world.  Our secondary industries as well as agriculture are able to compete in the markets of the world with those of other countries. Therefore, if and when we join the Common Market we will be able to hold our own just as well as now.  I imagine joining the Common Market would make it easier for us to enter into competition with other countries of the world in selling the products of our industries here.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the Seanad and the duties of Senators.  He gave us to understand that we were too well paid for the work we are doing. Apparently, he was referring to the number of Seanad meetings that we have.  He should remember that Senators have other duties to perform besides attending meetings of the Seanad.  As far as I know, the majority of Senators have almost to do the work of T.D.s.  They have to attend to constituency work, make representations to Departments on behalf of the people amongst whom they live, and they have to attend various other meetings.  The Senator should bear <Col N="868" /> that in mind before he comes to a conclusion as to whether the members of this House are too well paid or not.</P>
    <P>Judging from the tenor of Senator Quinlan's speech he does not appear to be satisfied with any phase of our national life.  He found fault with almost every Department of State.  I just said to myself if that is the case, perhaps the right thing to do would be to abolish the Government and appoint the Senator himself a High Commissioner to look after the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to education. In fact, the greater part of the debate centred around education.  Of course, education is a very important item in the life of a country, but I would point out to those who advocate increased expenditure on education, and indeed to those who advocate increased expenditure on other things, industry, agriculture, local government, or social services, that all expenditure on these things must keep pace with the increase in productivity.  It is only when we have increased productivity that the Government would be justified in giving all these increases.  I am glad to say that the increase in the country's productivity has made it possible to give very many increases in all these directions over the past couple of years. The growth in the country's economy, or should I say the fulfilment of the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion,</i> has made it possible to effect increases and improvements in many activities of the State.  There is now about three times as much aid being given to agriculture as there was in 1956-57 and there is nearly twice as much spent on education.  Senator Hayes referred to education and Senator Quinlan made a passing reference to it also.  Senator Hayes advocated increased expenditure on secondary education.  Of course, we would all like to have increased expenditure on secondary and other branches of education but we have to have regard to the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>If anyone takes the trouble of looking up the Book of Estimates for this year and the Book of Estimates for 1956-57, he will see that almost twice <Col N="869" /> as much is being provided for secondary education this year, and the same applies to vocational education.  I am glad to say that vocational education in this country has been making very great strides over the past few years and that the amount of money being expended on it is quite justified.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here yesterday to the school leaving age.  Senator Brosnahan referred to it and advocated extension of the age.  I must say that I myself, too, was of the opinion that it would be a good thing to have the school leaving age extended, but on more mature consideration I would be doubtful about it.  In all these things we have to measure the calculated benefit with the amount of expenditure, and it is not necessary to point out to Senators that extension of the school leaving age would involve a considerable amount of extra expenditure. Additional teachers would have to be provided, as well as additional accommodation, and so on.  All that could not be done without more money, and the question is, can the country afford all that increased expenditure? Would the extension of the school leaving age be as beneficial to the country as some people try to persuade us it would be?  We have, of course, got examples of different operations in other countries.  Conditions in other countries, especially in Great Britain or Scotland, are quite different from conditions here.</P>
    <P>We all know from our experience that certain children attending primary schools would not benefit very much from a continuation of education, as we will call it.  There are certain types of children who have no literary bent, or turn, but who in after life turn out to be great business people.  They have what is called a business instinct. It would be better for those children to get away from the schoolroom, and go into the world outside to get an opportunity of putting their business instinct into operation.  If they were kept at school after the age of 14 years they would not have the same chance of doing that.</P>
    <P>In any case, we have our vocational schools and they, in a sense, are continuation <Col N="870" /> schools.  They have been described as the poor man's university and, to a certain extent, they are. If the parents deem it necessary that their children should get additional education if they can afford it they can send their children to the secondary schools.  If they cannot afford it, they have the vocational schools.  Therefore, I do not see any crying need, or necessity, for extending the school-leaving age in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>However, like many other problems in life there is a lot to be said for and a lot to be said against.  I should imagine that before anything would be done in that regard certain vital interests should be consulted.  The managers of the schools and the parents should be consulted, and should have a say before any Government would bring in legislation for the purpose of extending the school leaving age.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to tourism.  I think I can infer from Senator Miss Davidson's remark yesterday that she regards the expenditure of £1,000,000 by Bord Fáilte as not being wise expenditure.  I think those are the words she used.  She also referred to the hotels and to the amount of money being spent on what she called first-class hotels.  As regards the first point I would not be in agreement with her.  I think the £1,000,000 which is earmarked in the Book of Estimates for Bord Fáilte is money well spent.  I would go a certain distance with the Senator when she says that more attention should be paid to the second-class hotels to meet the requirements of the ordinary middle-class tourist who comes here from across the water, and who could not, perhaps, afford to stay in first-class hotels.</P>
    <P>There are also, of course, a certain number of tourists who would not stay in anything but a first-class hotel.  We must also take them into account. There is no reason why Bord Fáilte cannot operate a scheme by which the necessary assistance could be given to all those hotels.  No matter what they do&mdash;and this is a very important point&mdash;about the first-class or second-class hotels, unless there is some control over the charges made in those <Col N="871" /> hotels an amount of damage will be done to the tourist industry.  There have been many complaints recently about overcharging in hotels, and I am afraid those complaints are not without foundation.</P>
    <P>It would be advisable for the Minister responsible for the activities of Bord Fáilte to get them to take some steps towards controlling all hotel charges.  That is a matter which I consider to be of vital importance to the success of the tourist industry.  As was pointed out in one paper I read today, if this overcharging continues it will be a case of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over all the Estimates as other speakers have been trying to do or, I should say, as Senator Quinlan has been doing.  I do not think it appropriate on a debate like this to deal with all the individual Estimates.</P>

      <P>There is no use in advocating increases here and there: increased salaries, increased social benefits and increases in other directions, unless the country can bear them.  All the increases that have been given recently, to teachers, civil servants, members of the Garda Síochána, judges, and so on, could not have been given if the economy of the country were not strong enough to bear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my earlier remarks, it is because the economy has expanded and because the Government's programme for economic expansion has been fulfilled that these things have been found possible.  The Government expected when they earmarked this programme for economic <Col N="872" /> expansion that an increase of two per cent.  would be a good target.  That target has been exceeded.  It has increased to 5 per cent.  Some people say the figure is 4½ per cent.  but according to the <i>Irish Banking Review</i>, which I have here, it is 5 per cent. You see on the first page of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> that a good picture of the long period trend in the Irish economy is to be found in the survey published by the OECD this year. The survey illustrates the impression made by the economy on independent expert foreign observers.  The picture is far from discouraging.  The economy has been expanding since 1959 at a steady rate of about 5 per cent per annum which is a much more rapid rate than in any earlier period.  During these 3 years the output of industry increased by about 27 per cent.  which is quite high compared with many other European countries.  I should like if those who try to find fault with the policy of the Government would study this.  I should like Senator Quinlan, who found fault with every Department of State in the course of his speech, to read that extract from the first page of the <i>Irish Banking Review.</i>  It would bring him, I think, some healthy enlightenment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few Votes in which I am particularly interested in Part II of this Appropriation Bill and I should be glad if the Minister would clarify the positions for me.  First, I see in reference to Vote No. 9: &ldquo;For expenditure in respect of Public Buildings; for the Maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works; for the Execution and Maintenance and Drainage and other Engineering Works and for a Grant-in-Aid of the River Shannon Navigation&mdash;£6,062,000.&rdquo; Am I to take it from this that at last moneys are being made available for the relief of the Shannon flooding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many farmers in the area of the Shannon valley who suffer great hardships and loss nearly every year as a result of almost annual flooding of the River Shannon, particularly in the area immediately above the Weir at Meelick.  Many residents of the Shannon valley believe that the <Col N="873" /> Weir at Meelick contributes in no uncertain way to the flooding of the valley and also the small islands in the stretches immediately below the weir. I should be glad if the Minister would indicate whether any of this money will be allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I come now to Vote No. 15 for the Secret Service&mdash;£7,500.  Heretofore, I did not know we had a Secret Service in the country or a force of that kind. I should like if somebody would explain what this Vote actually covers. When we consider the sum of £7,500, it is difficult to visualise in what particular sphere or field they operate&mdash; that is, if we are to consider them in the same light as we understand other forces are.  For instance, we often see films and read novels about the F.B.I. and other such forces.  I could not imagine a sum of £7,500 going far to maintain them for a year.  Perhaps the Minister would tell me a little more about this particular Vote.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to know what proportion of the £6,500, under Vote No. 24, is allowed for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force. I should like to know what form this compensation takes or for what is it intended.  I understood that the Local Security Force was completely voluntary. I see a similar provision under Vote No. 48.</P>
    <P>In reference to Vote No. 47, for the Defence Forces, I should just like to say that the improvement in the conditions of the Privates and N.C.O.s during the past few years has been remarkable.  However, I should like if an even greater improvement could be made to better the lot of the man who embarks on a long service and who takes on the Army as a career.  I think there should be stricter discipline, especially among the men serving on the first three- or five-year terms.</P>
    <P>I am also surprised to see in the Estimates that there is this year a reduction in the amount allocated for uniforms and clothing for N.C.O.s and Privates.  In Army circles for the past few years I think it is true to say that they have been promised a new type of uniform with better quality material <Col N="874" /> and also, I believe, a new walking out uniform.  It is a pity that such promises are made if it is too long before they are fulfilled.  I believe it is most important that the morale of the soldier should be maintained at a very high standard.  If he is not given a uniform which looks sufficiently attractive and which can easily be kept in a tidy condition it is very difficult to keep him in high spirits the whole time.</P>
    <P>In Vote No. 46, the Minister allocates approximately £13,000,000 for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In view of the extremely large number of applicants for connection with the telephone service&mdash;I believe somewhere in the region of 10,000&mdash;I should like to know if the Minister is completely satisfied that the amount of £13,000,000 is sufficient for this purpose.  I know of persons in the Midlands who are waiting for over 2 and 3 years for connection. The telephone, as we all know, is really only coming into its own and, especially in rural Ireland, is only coming into widespread use.  I trust that sufficient resources will be made available to ensure that the programme of the Telephone Section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can be got through as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to join with Senator Quinlan in asking that this Appropriation Bill be divided into a few sections with the appropriate Ministers present.  I believe that a greater contribution could be made if it were tackled in more detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in sympathy with the remarks of the last speaker and with the corresponding remarks of Senator Quinlan.  It is a little bit unrealistic complaining here about the amounts of money spent in the various Departments in various directions when, if you go to them to argue about it, they all blame the Minister for Finance.  I suppose on that account he cannot object if we in this House pass these complaints on to him.  In my case I am interested in certain anomalies in the educational sphere relating to the training of medical students, dental students and veterinary <Col N="875" /> students, which arise out of the distribution of funds available for these activities in the universities.  Each of the two universities has got faculties and schools in these three subjects and train students for these three professions.</P>
      <P>In each of these schools the position is different from any other faculty or school of the university because in each case the school is under the continuous scrutiny of a supervisory body, such as the Medical Registration Council of Ireland, which has the authority to come to the school and look at the facilities, the equipment and the personnel available for teaching and to make criticisms if these are inadequate and to tell the university concerned, perhaps, that the students are not well enough trained to be registered in these professions.  With that sword always over us we have a very considerable problem to try and keep standards up to the required level.  We are, I suppose, more than any other sphere of the university continually pressing the responsible Ministers to provide funds because not only do we have to meet these standards but the actual mechanics of the educational processes are more expensive than those of most other parts of the universities.  Large amounts are required for laboratory equipment and for teachers, who probably have to be in a higher concentration in relation to the number of students than in other spheres.  In the hospital and clinical departments very considerable expenses are involved, so we are always at the doors of the various Ministries asking for help in these directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the only difficulty in training for these three professions because trainees go through two phases. The first one is spent in the science department of the university.  That does not present any problem other than making these departments sufficiently good to deal with the training of students.  The second is spent on the clinical side, either in a hospital or in an animal hospital, a veterinary school or a dental hospital, and in each case an entirely different problem <Col N="876" /> arises, because these institutions are not under the control of the university. There is not a university in this country that possesses a hospital, a dental hospital or a veterinary hospital of its own.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that it is a good thing for a university to have such institutions, as they have in America quite frequently, because I am not entirely convinced that a university is the best kind of body to run a hospital; but if it is not, and if these hospitals are under separate ownership as they are here, then another problem arises because you have to work out a system whereby the university can co-operate with the authorities running the hospital for the further education of the students in the later parts of their curriculum.</P>
    <P>This is difficult.  The hospital property is, as I have said, not at all the concern of the university, but with the co-operation of the authorities which own the hospital it is frequently possible to work out a scheme whereby the university can contribute to buildings, to the purchase of equipment and so on to be placed at the hospital. This is the only thing they can do.  The university, of course, must get these funds from the Minister for Education, and it is an educational expense. But the university staff and students working in the hospital contribute to the treatment of the sick people, and this is something which helps the Department of Health.  One feels sometimes that the Minister for Health should contribute because of that to the expenses involved in the educational side of the hospitals for which he is responsible, but he is very reluctant to do this.  The Minister for Finance will remember the situation when, as Minister for Health, he was frequently approached about this problem.</P>
    <P>There is something, I understand, in the Act governing the Hospitals Trust Fund that prevents the use of the moneys in this fund for educational purposes.  At this point, I should like to make what I regard as a very important representation.  The standard of practice in any of these three professions in this or any other country is intimately bound up with the standard of training, not only in relation <Col N="877" /> to the professional competence of the people practising them but also in relation to the work done in the institutions where these people are being trained.  It is well recognised in every country that the teaching hospital is likely to be of a somewhat higher standard than the hospital which has no such teaching responsibilities.  The reasons for this are numerous&mdash;the presence of students who ask awkward questions from their teachers tends to keep the teachers up to the mark, the necessity for demonstrating everything clearly so that the student can see it means that investigations are carefully and fully carried out.  Therefore, we need better facilities in those hospitals than may be required in certain hospitals that have not got teaching responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Who is to provide these facilities? The Minister for Health has a responsibility for keeping the standard of hospitals up to the highest possible level from the point of view of the management of sick people, and their treatment and investigation, but he does not have the responsibility for this in relation to the teaching of students, yet the very same processes and accommodation and equipment are used for the teaching as well as for the treatment.  This should be recognised, and either the Minister for Health should obtain the authority to spend more of the Hospitals Trust Fund for educational purposes or he should get from the Minister for Finance such a proportion of the moneys available as are required for the educational side of this hospital activity.</P>
    <P>The same applies in agriculture.  The Estimates include a sum of £160,000 for veterinary education under the heading of the Department of Agriculture. That is not a large sum considering that there are two faculties involved&mdash;one in each university&mdash; and I am sure a greater sum will be needed in the future.  But the same problem arises in relating the clinical treatment side to the teaching, because the veterinary hospital&mdash;the college at Ballsbridge&mdash;is the property of the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture or the <Col N="878" /> Minister and his officials appoint the technicians there and the universities appoint the professional staff.  The Minister pays the technician directly and he gives the universities the money to pay the professional staff.  One way or another, all the moneys spent on veterinary education come from the Department of Agriculture and, therefore, I suppose, indirectly from the Minister for Finance.  The university, of course, then has to do the best it can with what is available from the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the expenditure on personnel, but it has not authority to increase or improve the buildings or accommodation at the veterinary college.  Therefore, the same difficulty arises in educating students at an animal hospital as in a hospital for sick people.  If the Minister for Agriculture approaches tht Minister for Finance for increased funds to provide better accommodation at Ballsbridge, I hope he will have a sympathetic hearing.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators, I would commend very warmly the brochure entitled &ldquo;Investment in Education&rdquo; which has been circulated, prepared by the secondary school-masters.  We should be very pleased and proud that there is a group of masters in charge of schools in this country so interested in the job they are doing and so competent as to be able to produce a document like that.  I feel that one of the most outstanding defects in secondary education is the defect in science in the secondary schools.  In charge as I am of the admission of students to the medical school, the dental school and the veterinary school in Trinity College, we are continually faced with applications from students coming from Irish schools who took high grades in the Leaving Certificate examination in various subjects but have done little or no science&mdash;chemistry, physics or biology.  Their all-round training for entry into those schools is therefore defective, and we are constantly being forced in the examinations at the end of the first year to turn back a considerable proportion of those students, not because they have not worked hard or because our teaching is inadequate but because they have <Col N="879" /> started off at the great disadvantage of knowing no science.  In Trinity College we have recently taken the step of appointing a separate lecturer in chemistry and another in physics purely to deal with this group of students who are preparing for these professions, because otherwise they cannot cope with this first year's work.</P>
    <P>Every possible support should be given to the development of science in the schools.  I know that Messrs. Guinness recently promoted the collection of a considerable fund for the improvement of science facilities in schools, but I do not think that it turned out to be nearly enough to go around.  I know many schools which lack adequate science facilities and have not been able to get sufficient help from that fund.  The fund, also, only deals with a capital problem.  It does not deal with the recurrent problem of teachers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter of health, I have only one point I want to raise. I notice that the Minister for Health in dealing with the Estimate for his Department in the Dáil talked about the Hospitals Trust Fund.  That fund does not, in fact, come into the Estimates and I do not propose to refer to it further in any detail here, but it is the fund from which the building of new hospitals must be financed.  So far as I understand it that is the only fund which makes any substantial contribution to the building of new hospitals. The Minister was very cautions in relation to the future of the building of new hospitals.  Certain commitments have been made, he said, and they hoped to get on with them, but as to others there was not any very clear indication of how much he was prepared to do.</P>
    <P>There is one venture which I would like to commend to the Minister for Finance if it should be necessary for the Minister for Health to approach him on the matter, and that is the federation of hospitals that has taken place in the past year in Dublin.  Seven hospitals have agreed to come together, to put themselves under a common governing authority for the purpose of running this group as a single unit. This is going to increase the efficiency of this group, but it cannot greatly <Col N="880" /> improve the cost of running them. What would greatly improve this would be the provision of one or two new hospitals to replace the old, out of date, inefficient buildings in which those institutions are at present housed.  If the capital could be found to build even one or two new hospitals instead of four or five of those existing institutions the saving would more than compensate for the capital expenses involved.</P>

      <P>I want only to deal with one small aspect of the Vote on education. This debate in the House has more or less taken on the aspect of a discussion on education this year, and the greater proportion of the speeches has touched in some way on education, rightly so, because I feel that education is the growing need and there is a growing demand for it in this country. In the very near future it will be the most important Estimate, probably, that we will have to deal with.  Since my entry into public life the interest taken by parents and public bodies in education seems to grow every year. I am quite prepared to admit that the Department's Vote has also substantially increased, but there is one aspect of it I would like to mention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see a great many very nice small primary schools being built all over the country, probably one or two in each parish, and sometimes I wonder will those schools not be regarded as out of date in a very short time.  Are they going to be adequate for the type of education we are going to need? I do not think that a teacher nowadays can cope in a one-teacher school with children ranging from four years to 14 years or, as many Senators here have advocated, to 15 or 16 years.  I do not think it is possible in this way to give adequate education to the pupils, usually in the country schools.  Either the teacher must concentrate on the older ones who are taking examinations or else they are neglected and that neglect will possibly follow them all their lives.  I believe that these schools will be regarded as out of date except for very young pupils in 10 or 15 years' time, or less.  What should be aimed at is not very large schools but <Col N="881" /> at least central schools that would have adequate accommodation when the school leaving age is raised, as I have no doubt it will be sooner or later, to keep pupils there for a further year.</P>
    <P>If there were that type of accommodation in three, four or five teacher schools, the type of education would be far better.  It would also leave the way open for what I have advocated before, the teaching of agriculture in some way to those pupils who will remain on the land.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the teaching of a European language in those schools.  We cannot expect that an ordinary teacher would have the time for that now but it could be done in three or four teacher schools, or if there were an itinerant teacher who went around to two or three schools. These small schools will keep the pupils very much behind in the amount of education we would like to see them getting.  Most teachers will tell you that they cannot teach as they would like to at the moment.  Some of them give extra teaching in their own time, but most of them will admit that they cannot teach as they would like to because they have not got adequate time.</P>
    <P>I was also rather surprised to hear Senator Ó Ciosáin saying, on the point about the school leaving age, that there were a great many pupils he thought would not benefit at all from another year's schooling.  No pupil that I can think of would not benefit from another year at school, or possibly two years. Probably any headmaster would tell you that.  A little knowledge, no matter how little, is always useful to the pupil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay too long because this is the type of Bill you could get very much involved in like Senator Quinlan, and you could go on for hours.  I think he was not half finished when he sat down.  Senator Brosnahan dealt very largely with the primary schools and I agree with him in nearly everything he said.  One thing which he did not stress sufficiently was in regard to the grants <Col N="882" /> for heating and cleaning, and also proper sanitary accommodation.  It is remarkable the number of schools there still are without proper sanitary accommodation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin made some very extraordinary statements about children being better off by leaving school than staying on for an extra year.  The fact of the matter is that one thing that has done a tremendous amount of harm was the introduction of the primary certificate in its present form.  In spite of the fact that the INTO do not agree with the primary certificate in its present form, the teachers do a lot of work on it, because they do not like to see children failing in the three subjects of the examination.  We find there is great concentration on those three subjects at a vital stage in the children's school career.</P>
      <P>There is only one thing that can be done to give children a broader type of education, and that is to keep them at school for another year.  I find in my own school that when children stay on for an extra year they make tremendous progress.  The child has a completely different outlook.  He is not harassed by the fact that he has to do so many home exercises in preparation for an examination.  He gets a broader knowledge, and he wants to find out more.  If he goes on to secondary school he has a certain amount of algebra and geometry because of the fact that he stayed at school for an extra year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, the compulsory School Attendance Act was the worst Act ever passed in this country.  It was passed at a time when the Irish people were of the opinion that they would not have any compulsion, and they always looked on this Act as a bad Act.  The parents found every possible way to avoid sending their children to school under that Act. There was no trouble about it.  The parents sent a note to the teacher saying the child was ill, and that was the end.  If the day was wet that was another way out.  If they lived three miles from the school they need not come.  The parents found every possible way to beat that compulsory Act and it was only when the children <Col N="883" /> were leaving school that they began to wake up and see how foolish they had been in not going to school every day. The attendance at vocational schools is much higher than in the national schools, where there is compulsory attendance.  In the vocational schools fees have to be paid and yet there is a higher attendance.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin also referred to the technical schools as the poor man's university.  That is a hackneyed phrase and one that should never be used, in my opinion, because the technical schools are doing really wonderful work.  If the idea that they are the poor man's university is kept before the general public, the pupils will leave the technical schools.  They are the places where people get group certificates. Our aim should be to provide more technical schools and we should have a central technical institute to which the really intelligent children could be sent on scholarships and could get degrees equivalent to the university degrees.  Everyone knows the universities are crowded out and that the great majority of people cannot send their children to the university.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the introduction of the Apprenticeship Act.  That has created a terrific problem.  Every day in the week I get letters from parents saying: &ldquo;My children live 13 or 14 miles from a technical school.  What will I do about it?&rdquo;  In the allocation of money under &ldquo;Vocational Schools&rdquo; there should be a scheme whereby provision would be made for transport for the children until such time as more schools are built.  In my own county it has been agreed that we will build two more schools.  That will probably take three more years.  The Apprenticeship Act comes in next year and some children will find themselves without the certificates which are necessary to qualify.  The Minister should be asked to give that serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I move now to the Departments of Local Government and Lands.  It was mentioned to-day that the judges, teachers, doctors, and everyone else had got the eighth round of wage increases, <Col N="884" /> and that it was possible to make that provision because of an increase in the national income.  There are two groups of workers for which the Minister is responsible, in the Office of Public Works and forestry. The men working in the forestry branch have not got any consideration whatsoever in the eighth round of wage increases.  I understand the Minister was waiting for some type of headline to keep the rate more or less at the same figure as is paid by county councils.  I think the county councils have now settled that.  The Minister should not have any more delay in doing that.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion which I hope is not true is that on account of the introduction of the bonus system, whereby men got a bonus on quality and on quantity, the Minister was of the opinion that the fact that they earned this bonus was a good and sufficient reason not to increase the basic rate.  That would be a pity.  We have increases in social welfare.  I welcome very much the new Social Welfare measure but there is one thing I am not so happy about and that is that, in relation to the lower paid workers, such as those to whom I refer, the gap is being closed too much between their pay and social welfare. A person with four children would get £5-4s.-6d. a week and a man working with the Office of Public Works in the winter months would get around £6 a week.  There is very little incentive for a man to work there if he can get £5-4s.-6d. and, between dry and wet time, £6.  The same applies to Bord na Móna, to the county councils and to the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>When there is an Act to improve the lot of the poorer sections of the community the Minister should always have his eye on the incentive to work. Therefore, the difference between the wage and the social welfare sum should be fairly substantial.  It is not substantial in the case of the type of worker to whom I have referred. The rural worker finds himself in that position and the same can be said for the farm worker.</P>
    <P>I should also like to criticise the <Col N="885" /> Minister because at no time has he set up any machinery to deal with the wages of employees of the Office of Public Works, the Forestry Division and the Land Commission.  There is no machinery to deal with their wages. The sooner you give them something in the line of arbitration the better. They are as much entitled to arbitration as teachers, doctors or any other group of people.  If you set up some sort of arbitration board to deal with wages for these types of people it will be a good day's work.  It is long overdue. I hope the Minister will give the matter serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill we are discussing this afternoon gives Members of the Seanad one of the few opportunities we get in this House of discussing Government policy or even the lack of Government policy. The Minister presented us with a Bill for roughly £152,000,000.  It is the largest Bill that was ever presented to this House.  We remember, away back in 1956, with another Government in power, the criticism of Fianna Fáil which was both severe and harsh on the then Government.  If we take into consideration the fact that subsidies to the tune of £9,000,000 have been wiped out, the Government are now looking for £52,000,000 in excess of what the Government looked for in 1956.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated way back in 1955 and in 1956 that Government expenditure had reached its limit. This increase represents an increase on the taxpayers and on the people of the country by a Party who in 1955 and in 1956 preached economy and criticised extravagance and wasteful spending by the Government then in power.  It is an increase of £52,000,000 by a Minister who, in 1957, in his Budget statement and in his speeches in this House on this and other Bills, held out all sorts of hopes of a drastic reduction in expenditure, a drastic reduction in the number of our civil servants and drastic economies in Government administration.  Those were his own words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After five years in office, the best the Minister can do is to increase the <Col N="886" /> number of civil servants by 500. Instead of drastic economies in Government administration, we get this huge demand for £152,000,000.  One of the worst features of the Budget is the fact that very little relief has been given to the old age pensioners, to the widows and the orphans.  They must even wait for any relief which has been given until 1st August next whereas judges and others who got good increases received them retrospective to 1st November last.  There are many people who stated that this Budget was designed to make the rich richer and perhaps the poor poorer.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred last night to Fianna Fáil Government policy at the present time.  It has ground down the people of Ireland.  There is no denying that both the farmers and the business people are being crushed at the present time between increased rates and the heavy load placed upon them by the Central Government through soaring costs on the one hand and reduced prices on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The farmers are still getting only 1953 prices for the majority of their produce.  They have got some small relief.  In this Bill, they are getting some £2,250,000 towards the relief of rates. Senator Ó Ciosáin should remember this when he talks about increased grants for agriculture.  If our farmers are getting this sum of £2,250,000 towards the relief of rates on agricultural land I would point out that a sum of £5,000,000 which was paid last year in beef subsidy is not being paid this year.  Therefore, the relief they will receive means that they will be £2,750,000 worse off as regards Government grants.</P>
    <P>The small shopkeeper and the small businessman has got no relief, good bad or indifferent.  I suppose it can be said that the people have now become so used to crushing burdens, due to present Government policy, that they have become like punch-drunk boxers and can absorb punishment without seeming to be affected by it. The people of Ireland are seriously and dangerously affected.  Like the punch-drunk boxer, they have lost initiative.  Many people are losing <Col N="887" /> ambition and the competitive instinct. Some of them have become like punch-drunk boxers under the two-fisted pummelling by both rates and taxes.  It was never more necessary for the Government and for the people to have initiative and to be anxious to make the best use of the opportunities that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>This burden of £152,000,000 represents a little over 30 per cent of our national income.  I can remember some of the speeches made away back in 1930 and in 1931 by the people who were then in Opposition but who are now in Government.  In those early days of the State, they told us they could run the country on £2,000,000 less than it was then costing to run it. In 1930-31 the percentage taken by the Government was only 18 per cent of the national income.  The present figure represents an average of almost £50 per head on each man, woman and child in the country, or a sum of £200 or £250 for an average family.  With such a burden in a country where there is emigration and unemployment it is no wonder that an incentive is lacking and that money for investment is becoming scarce.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin referred to our policy on economic expansion.  We are all glad on this side of the House that we have an increase of 5 per cent., that the good work&mdash;this cannot be denied&mdash;started by Deputy James Dillon to improve the land is bearing fruit.  He started the good work in 1958 and it is still continuing.  The foundation was solid and cannot be interfered with.  I doubt if the people on the far side of the House can be as complacent as they seem to be.  I remember in the past we were told by the present President and leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party that this country could and should support a population of eight million people. I wonder if those who died in 1916 and those who preached that policy in the past are satisfied now with a population of two and a quarter million and an emigration rate of 250,000 in the past five years?  I doubt if that was their policy at that time.  They should remember Goldsmith's saying: <Col N="888" />&ldquo;Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey, where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo; Wealth may be accumulating at present but it is a well-known fact that the flower of our youth is emigrating to England and other countries throughout the world and they are helping to build up those countries while, perhaps, here fewer and fewer people are becoming wealthier and wealthier.  I doubt if those who died for our freedom dreamt of that.  It would be much better if we had a larger population if it would mean more work at home for our own people.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the present trend continues but the signs at present are not very encouraging and the Minister will have to take cognisance of that fact.  If we look at the figures produced recently regarding exports and imports the signs do not look too good for 1962.  There has been an increase of £1,890,000 in imports and a decrease of £3,643,000 in domestic exports. They are the main features of the external trade figures for the six months of 1962, compared with the first six months of 1961.  The adverse balance of £53,759,000 shows an increase of £5,153,000 according to the figures supplied through the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>Imports were valued at £135,145,000 in the first six months of 1962, against £133,255,000 in the first six months of 1961.  That was an increase of almost £1,890,000.  Exports totalled £78,562,000 compared with £82,206,000. Re-exports were also bad.  The figures for June, which were published recently, are still more alarming and the trend seems to be completely in the wrong direction.  For June, 1962, imports were £22,286,000 while imports for June, 1961, were £21,776,000, that is an increase of £510,000.  Let us take exports for the two months and compare them.  We find that in June, 1962, our total exports were £13,691,000 while in June, 1961, our total exports were £14,982,000.  That was a drop of £1,291,000 so I think there is no denying that the trend at present is in the wrong direction.  We hope that it will be rectified and the Minister will agree, <Col N="889" /> I think, that he would need to introduce some measures to rectify it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Department of Justice, I think many people are alarmed at the work of the &ldquo;Department of Injustice&rdquo; because recently we had the Paul Singer comedy, the Guard Travers spectacle and the Senator Quinlan farce.  I will say nothing more about that at the moment because I believe enough has been said about it throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It is alarming and, perhaps, the head of the Government should take action to see that there is no further deterioration in that Department.</P>
    <P>It is agreed by many that 1962 may be heavy with destiny for the Irish people.  Political decisions taken this year may settle the fate and character of our nation for generations to come. The Government have applied for membership of the Common Market and in the past few months set up different committees which should have been set up over the past five or six years.  In 1957 and 1958 Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon appealed to the Government that the time to busy themselves with the problems that lay ahead had come and that they should set up committees to deal with the Common Market.  During the past five years, when it seemed obvious and inevitable that we would have to apply for membership of the Common Market, the Government sat back. They failed to prepare the people for the advent of the Common Market. They just buried their heads in the sand and allowed costs and rates and government expenditure to increase. We have introduced here and allowed to develop a high price economy which may have very disastrous effects in the years ahead, especially if we are accepted as members of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Many people want to know what is the Government policy for the future on the Common Market.  They seem to be very quiet, with very little say about it up to the present.  What have the Government done to prepare the way for our advent to the Common <Col N="890" /> Market if we are accepted?  What does it mean?  It means the end of our Sinn Féin protection policy.  Tariffs will be eliminated and free trade will become the order of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the Common Market and to Government policy on it.  If we enter it there is no denying that free trade will be the order of the day.  Everybody knows that that will affect us very severely here, because industries have been built up over a long number of years with government protection and if we have free trade that will affect them.  We would all like to know what the Government policy on that is.  There is no denying that we shall cease to be as independent as we are to-day and we shall become members of a European federation in which our lives, our jobs and our security will depend to a large extent on the decisions taken by others.  No doubt whatever government we may have in power will have a voice in the deliberations, but ours will be a small one.  How it works out for us remains to be seen, but it is the duty of this Government to prepare the people for what lies ahead, because if we are accepted we are bound to be affected economically, agriculturally and politically. We will be facing a challenge to our ability to survive in the face of intense competition from other countries, and there will, no doubt, be casualties.  There is no soft trade to be got on the Continent, and we will have to prepare ourselves for those new conditions.  Many people doubt if the Government so far are doing their part through government policy to prepare the people for the new conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to speak briefly about agriculture and government policy in relation to it.  If we enter the Common Market while warning the farmers against any premature optimism as though a golden age were soon to dawn for Irish agriculture&mdash;the Taoiseach warned the farmers last <Col N="891" /> week at the Macra na Feirme dinner in Louth&mdash;if Irish farmers get a proper lead and proper encouragement from the government I see no reason why we cannot succeed.  The Irish farmers have been in the front line of trenches in many wars&mdash;national, social and economic.  When the call went out to them in the past, they always answered the rallying call and did their duty to the nation.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why they cannot and will not do it in the future, but they must get a lead from the top.  Definitely good work is being done by the farmers' organisations but I still doubt if enough is being done by the Government. If we are to make the best use of the opportunity facing us there can be no lack of enterprise, no slackness, no easy going methods, irregular supplies or anything like that.  Dynamic leadership is needed in the Government and in the farmers' organisations, and the people should be kept fully informed of their responsibilities and of the needs and wants of the people of the different countries with which we hope to be trading inside the next few years, because if we are accepted we will have access to a market of 230,000,000 people.  It will be the greatest trading bloc of all times.  If we have proper government policy in that regard the Common Market could and should improve substantially the position of the Irish people, both those engaged in industry and those in agriculture. There will be casualties among those in industry, but to take advantage of what lies ahead we must produce the best, and produce it at competitive prices.  We often thought in the past that due to the high protection some of our factories were not inclined to produce the best.  There will have to be a change in that respect in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government can lead the farmers very much in the right direction if they take advantage of the potential. The farmers must produce the highest quality stock.  The efficiency of our livestock is a matter of great importance. We will need a better cow.  The present quality of our pigs is not nearly as good as they have in Denmark.  The Irish farmer must undoubtedly have better services technically, and agriculture <Col N="892" /> must be willing to adapt itself to new methods and to change to new lines that offer the greatest scope.  Costs must be kept low, and that is most important, because Government action over a long number of years has driven costs sky high on the farmer.  Capital for agricultural expansion must be available at low interest rates.  Credit is due to the Minister for the fact that capital was somewhat easier to get from the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the past few years than it had been for a long number of years. Last but not least we must have a vigorous marketing organisation&mdash;that is very necessary&mdash;with much more aggressive salesmanship than we have had up to the present.</P>
    <P>Government policy will have to change.  I believe a shake up is needed in the Cabinet, perhaps as big a shake up as Mr. Macmillan had in England.  Many people are not satisfied with the present Minister for Agriculture or his work in his Department. All the throaty exhortations in the world will not prepare us to play our full part in the future if an inefficient Minister for Agriculture wrongly administers a wrongly conceived policy.  Valuable years have been lost due to lack of leadership in that Department and to the fact that under the present Government agriculture has become the Cinderella of our industries.</P>
    <P>With regard to education&mdash;I may be ruled out of order&mdash;I should like to know how much is voted for physical education.  In my belief enough money is not provided for it in the national, vocational or secondary schools.  It has been proved in the past that Irish sportsmen can hold their own with the sportsmen of much bigger nations but they need greater training and greater opportunities. We all saw in to-day's paper that Santry Stadium, the dream of Irish sportsmen, is in danger.  This is a bad blow to sportsmen and to athletics generally.  As one on the opposite side of the fence from the man in charge of the stadium, I feel it would be a terrible reflection on a country which prides itself on its sportmanship and on its interest in sport of all <Col N="893" /> kinds if a stadium of world-renown were destroyed for the sake of £20,000.  We cannot here advocate legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister and his colleagues to do something about this.  He has some fine sportsmen in his Cabinet like the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he knows Deputy Seán Flanagan who is another fine sportsman.  It would be good work if they could heal this split and retain the stadium which might be needed in the future.  I do not see why we should not have Olympic games here just as other countries have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On agriculture, the plain fact is that with the high cost of living farmers' costs are steadily going up.  They have a burden of taxation and their incomes have not increased over the past few years.  The Minister may tell us that it increased by £6 million or £8 million last year, but if he looks at the figures he will see that the number of cattle on the land of Ireland has decreased by almost a quarter of a million.  That is serious because at the present time we should be trying to increase the number because there is one commodity and one alone for which we are certain of having a ready market for 15,20 or even 30 years in the Common Market and that is beef.  I think it is deplorable that the number of cattle is decreasing at the present time.  I have often pointed out and members of the Fine Gael Party have pointed out on numerous occasions that this is an agricultural country of 70 million acres.  Many acres are infertile hills or hollows, but there are 12 million acres of fertile, arable land.  With a population of some two and a half million that means there are only five acres for every person in the country. The standard of living of every man, woman and child in the country, whether they are working on the land, in a town or in a city, whether they are civil servants, doctors or professional men, depends on what the farmers of Ireland and their labourers <Col N="894" /> are able to get from the land of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The farmer's profit is the difference between his cost of production and his sale price and, unfortunately, over the past seven or eight years the cost of living, the cost of artificial manures, taxation, rates and all his costs are increasing while his sale price has not altered with the result that farmers have very little profit to-day and that is the reason why they are flying from the land.  I think it will be agreed that on our success in making the best use of the land and of our national resources depends our ability to expand industrial employment and provide the educational facilities we have heard so much about in the last few days, to increase the social services, protect the health of our people, build houses, hospitals and the other institutions which are necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance reminds me of the month of March because he comes in here like a lamb and often goes out like a lion.  In his reply he always quotes all the figures I give and says they are completely wrong.  He says that time after time but all the figures I have given were taken from official statistics.  When he was replying last year, for example, on July 12th, Volume 54, No. 11, column 1170, he told the House that</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>But there are certain things in the Appropriation Bill. We can speak about exports rising from £36 million to £131 million. There is less money in the appropriation for the land project which we started.  Less is spent on the land scheme started by the Government of that day.  The farm building scheme was started and local authorities' works were started which gave valuable employment in every county in Ireland and helped to relieve the rates.  In our county we got as much as £52,000 but all that has been scrapped.  Guaranteed prices were given for grade A pigs.  Back in 1956 it was 245/- per cwt.  The cost of production since has increased.  What is Government policy at the present time?  They have reduced the price to 240/- per cwt. They are the Party who tell us they always stood for the small farmers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government at that time started the T.B. eradication scheme and we are all delighted it is progressing favourably at present.  They removed the Fianna Fáil tax on super-phosphates and during those ten years, 100,000 new houses were built.  In County Westmeath now, there are only eight cottages being built.  We have sent up plans to the Department over and over again during the past three or four years.  While it is very easy for the Minister to say the money is there to build houses, they refused to sanction them and sent back the plans time and time to dot an &ldquo;i&rdquo; or cross a &ldquo;t&rdquo;.  They even went so far on one occasion as to tell us that a labourer's cottage should not have boarded floors, that concrete was good enough. We are told they will not sanction <Col N="896" /> the building of any cottage costing more than £1,000, even though it is due to their own policy that the cost of building is sky-high.  They should certainly sanction cottages costing £1,100 or £1,200.</P>
    <P>We started with a target for afforestation of 25,000 acres per year.  We provided 1,000 additional hospital beds, and sanatorium accommodation for the people who needed it.  The Minister cannot deny that.  It will be agreed that the bogey of the farmer is that when he increases his production, he is invariably met with falling prices.  He has experienced such discouragement so often that he has been made chary of increased production. The moment he increases production, the market flops.</P>
    <P>We are entitled in this discussion to go back to the promises broken by Fianna Fáil over the past few years. In 1956, Fianna Fáil published some &ldquo;Facts for Voters.&rdquo;  They stated that the present state of emigration was the most serious problem now facing the nation and that the census of 1956 showed that the situation must be righted quickly, if disaster were to be avoided.  We all know what happened. After that statement, 250,000 people emigrated and sought work abroad. Over 100 years ago, the population of Ireland was 8,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the population of England was 20,000,000.  The ratio was two to five.  To-day the population here is 2,250,000 and in England, it is 53,000,000 or 52,000,000. The ratio is one to 12½ or 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil told us that they could, if elected, provide work for 8,000,000 people.  Are they satisfied now with a dwindling population of 2,250,000? Government policy is increasing costs and driving people out of the country. No one can deny those facts.  We all remember the famous plan the Government had a few years ago to spend £100,000,000 to provide 100,000 new jobs.  Fianna Fáil have been in control of the destinies of the State for, I <Col N="897" /> think, 21 or 22 years out of the past 27 or 28 years.  They say they have plans for the good of the country.  Maybe they have, but why do they not put them into operation?  When they were in Opposition, they had plans for this, that and the other.  Five years ago, they had a plan to provide 100,000 new jobs, but what are the facts to-day?  There are something like 131,000 fewer people employed in Ireland to-day than there were in 1956. Fianna Fáil have broken their promises to the extent that there are 131,000 fewer people employed to-day than were employed five years ago.  Can that be denied?  Can the Minister for Finance or any other Minister deny that?</P>
    <P>We were told also by Fianna Fáil speakers that the subsidies would be maintained, that there would be no increase in the cost of living.  Fianna Fáil claim that they are consistent.  I claim they have broken nearly every major promise they made to the Irish people.  Instead of keeping the subsidies and reducing the cost of living as they promised, the cost of living to-day stands at an all time record of 154 points.</P>
    <P>The price of bread has increased by something like 7d.  The price of butter has increased from 3/9 to 4/7. If we look at the statistics, we see that our imports of margarine are increasing all the time.  Our people are eating less butter.  That is completely wrong in an agricultural country.</P>

      <P>The price of flour has increased from 4/- to 8/- a stone. Is it any wonder that small farmers in different parts of the country&mdash;especially in the Senator's county&mdash;are closing the door, turning the key and emigrating to Britain?  That is plain to be seen anywhere in the West of Ireland.  Most Reverend Dr. Lucey has spoken on numerous occasions about the flight from the land.  The <Col N="898" /> attitude of the Government seems to be to crush the small farmer out of existence.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with another matter which the Minister always denies when he is replying.  He said recently in the Dáil that the cost of living increased by roughly the same figure under the inter-Party Governments and the Fianna Fáil Governments.  I have the figures and the Minister has the figures.  Mine are taken from the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i>, published quarterly.  The Minister can find the figures on page 22, because he will afterwards tell me that the figures are completely wrong and misleading.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned I was speaking about the increase in the cost of living and the fact that it stands at an all time record of 154 points and that despite previous promises the Government had abolished food subsidies.  The people can have very little confidence in any Government which makes specific promises and immediately after returning to power breaks those promises.  Any Party should live up to promises which they make.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> of 14th March, 1956, the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, said, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Food subsidies must be accepted as likely to remain a permanent feature in the Estimates unless a very steep fall in the cost of living should take place, and that is not very likely, to put it mildly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He made a specific promise that food subsidies would be maintained unless there was a steep fall in the cost of living.  Instead of a steep fall we have <Col N="901" /> an all-time high increase yet subsidies to the tune of £9,000,000 were taken away since that time.  Deputy Lemass, as he then was, did not finish his reference to food subsidies there.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I would like to express a personal view which I hold strongly that the maximum advantage can be obtained by concentrating all the money which can be voted for food subsidies on flour and bread prices alone.</P>
    <P>That was a personal view of the man who is now Taoiseach and he has full power to put his views into practice. This year he could see his way to abolishing taxes on dances and cinemas but despite what he then said he could not see his way to concentrate all the money which can be voted for food subsidies on flour and bread prices alone.  We have people making promises to the Irish people, getting into power and breaking the promises. It is plain now that they were but stepping stones to get power and when they got it they quickly forgot about those promises.</P>
    <P>We have had numerous arguments here about the increase in the cost of living under the two Governments. Even inside the last month the Minister for Finance stated that the increase in the cost of living under both Governments had been roughly the same. When I quote figures here the Minister gets up afterwards and states that I quoted figures and that, as usual, they were all wrong.  My figures are taken from the statistical bulletin published by the Central Statistics office and they can be seen on page 22.  In 1948 when the inter-Party Government came into office the cost of living index figure stood at 99 points.  They were three years in office and went out on the 30th May, 1951, when the cost of living was 109 points, an increase of 10 points under that Government.  The Fianna Fáil Party came into office and despite the fact that they promised they would retain the subsidies and reduce the cost of living, when they were leaving office in May, 1954, the figure was 124 points, an increase of 15 points.  The inter-Party Government came back in May of 1954 when <Col N="902" /> the cost of living index figure stood at 124 points and they went out of office in March, 1957, when the cost of living figure stood at 135 points.  There was an increase of 11 points during their term of office.  Fianna Fáil took office again in March, 1957 and today the cost of living figure stands at 154 points.</P>

      <P>Here is an exact copy from the official statistics.  You know them yourself, and when the different changes of Government took place, and you can check on them.</P>
      <P>As regards industry, as far as Fine Gael are concerned we stand where we have always stood since the foundation of this State&mdash;in favour of worthwhile projects.  I am all in favour of worthwhile projects, especially those based on the raw material we have, that will give employment to our own people at home and help to increase production. Many people are alarmed at the number of foreigners coming in and buying land here.  According to Government figures, the problem does not seem to be too bad, but they must be misled by someone, because I know from my own county how land has been bought up.  Travelling through different parts of the country we find large estates and farm lands purchased by foreigners throughout the length and breadth of the country.  That is wrong, but at the same time I want to say that we welcome anybody coming from abroad to start factories here, whether they be Germans or French or those who have the know how and the technique and are prepared to invest some of their own money in worthwhile projects.  We have had many of them over the past few years, and credit is due to this Government and to the last Government which gave many worthwhile concessions and encouraged the setting up of those industries here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spoken before on this Bill about our marketing system.  Many of us claim that it is completely antediluvian and out of date.  For that reason we were very glad when in 1957 the Minister announced that he had proposals to spend £250,000 towards setting up proper marketing boards. Unfortunately, very little of that money has been spent for that purpose, and <Col N="904" /> we think it would be a good idea if the Minister could see to it that the money was spent on those boards.  If we are to hold our own in the Common Market we need a proper marketing system.</P>
    <P>Many on this side of the House cannot share the optimism displayed by Senator Ó Ciosáin, for example, today.  The country needs a dynamic Government prepared to work hard and to lead the people by example to better times.  They should devote more of their time to attending to their Departments and, perhaps, less to big dinners and things like that. Everything might seem rosy at a good dinner and whatever goes along with it, but, after all, for the ordinary people of this country things are not as rosy as they are being seen through the eyes of the different Ministers. Many of the present Government members are too old and too stale.  We need more younger men at the helm. Young men won the last war and young men could save this country. The Fianna Fáil Government is like an old man sitting in the chimney corner hoping that with the help of God and the money from Aunt Maggie he will be able to turn the corner somehow. That is not the attitude they should adopt especially at the present time, because the people of Ireland have never been lacking in energy and courage but they need direction and control from the top.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that grave matters will require negotiation and attention on behalf of our people in the new economic climate and fresh men of vision, of enterprise, of initiative and of leadership are badly needed in the Government, especially in the Department of Agriculture.  Unfortunately, in our day, as somebody said, Ireland has excommunicated some of those who have served her best, and she has canonised some of those who have served her worst.  I still think that if we all pull our weight in the future and ask: &ldquo;What can I do for my country?&rdquo;  instead of asking: &ldquo;What can I get out of it by doing as little as I possibly can?&rdquo;  we could all make this little country a better one to live in.  To succeed in the future and to meet the challenge facing <Col N="905" /> all of us, I feel it is time that we asserted Pearse's definition of a true Irishman and a true Irishwoman as one who specifically recognises this Irish nation as an entity and, being part of it, owes it and gives it service.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Brosnahan's appeal for a university background for the training of our national teachers, and I hope that the Minister for Education will lose no time in tackling this problem and doing what he can to solve it.  To me at all events the solution seems to lie in the extension of the training college course to three years and the award of a Bachelor of Arts in Education degree to the successful students.  I know this would involve a link with the university, a link which is sorely needed if our education is to progress as it should.  This has been achieved in Great Britain and I see no insurmountable difficulties about achieving it here.  It may be recalled that when the Welfare State was established in Britain in 1945 it was necessary to have a new class of social worker to operate it and the universities came into line in the new departure by creating a degree in social science.  This was created largely for reasons of status and our universities here in due course followed suit.  If it was possible to do that, how much more important is it that our primary teachers should be equipped with university training and university qualifications so that our system of education from the ground up would be the best we could possibly get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a tribute is due to those dedicated teachers like Senator Seán Brosnahan who in their spare time and at their own expense got themselves university training which, of course, they need not have done but did so the better to qualify themselves for their career as teachers.  I often wonder if the younger teachers of today will follow the example of Senator Brosnahan's generation in view of the lack of prospects of securing adequate remuneration under our system for their extra qualifications and in view, too, of what in my opinion anyway are still unsatisfactory salaries in comparison with the rewards that can be <Col N="906" /> earned in other branches of the public service and in industry.  Teachers who have become highly qualified and who could take out half a dozen degrees in the university at their own expense and in their own time find that the Department of Education by its failure to recognise adequately the added qualifications they have secured seems to desire that they should not have done so.  It is almost incredible that no matter how many degrees a teacher gets his total extra reward in terms of money per annum does not exceed £48.  This compares very poorly, indeed, with the standards obtaining in Great Britain and in the Six Counties.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Education should look into this and do what he can to remedy the position because until the training colleges are either integrated completely with the universities or, alternatively, linked in such a way as I suggested there is very little inducement to a teacher to spend his own money in his spare time on obtaining these extra qualifications when he does not receive the adequate remuneration he should receive&mdash;and would receive in any other profession&mdash;from his own Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to two rumours which have been circulating and have gained currency throughout the city.  One is that evening classes in University College, Dublin, are to be abolished because of lack of space and lack of personnel to conduct them.  I hope this one anyway is only a rumour because if there were any truth in it it would mean that teachers who desired to take a degree would be unable to do so.  The second rumour which is pretty widespread is that University College, Dublin, plans to abolish the course for the higher diploma in education.  These rumours are widespread and a statement should come from some authoritative source to allay the public disquiet which has been created.</P>
    <P>I might say in relation to the university that it was a retrograde step to abolish the department of education in University College, Dublin, as it was organised and operated by that great educational authority, the late Rev. Dr. <Col N="907" /> Timothy Corcoran, S.J.  As Senator Brosnahan can testify, he gave teachers a background which no one else in Ireland has tried to give them and he gave them the opportunity of doing research work for a master of arts degree or a doctorate of philosophy.  The position now is that an evening student cannot take a master of arts degree or a doctorate in philosophy unless he has an honours B.A., and the evening classes in the National University do not permit him to become an honours B.A. because they do not cater for honours students nor, in fact, do they cater in the same circumstances and for the same reasons for the new degree in psychology.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago on Telefís Éireann I saw and heard Rev.  Professor O'Doherty of University College, Dublin, speaking on the need for a far greater amount of research into the mind of the five-year-old child.  He said that very little was known, in fact, that it was a minus quantity at the present time and that greater research and much more discovery were required in this particular subject.  Yet primary teachers who deal with those children are denied facilities by the university to take that degree in psychology.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, we have the finest corps of primary teachers in the world, the finest area of recruitment to the profession and the finest types of recruits to it, but irritants like those I have mentioned are liable to make them sour.  We do not want to get into the unfortunate position in which England finds itself at the present moment, that they cannot get teachers and that as a result&mdash;as anyone knows who read an article in a recent issue of the <i>Observer</i>&mdash;their infant schools are in dire peril of extinction.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about secondary education.  If the scope of secondary education is to be widened, and I hope personally it is to be greatly increased, the only hope I can see lies in the primary teachers who will take on the work in the secondary top of national schools but the facilities for university degrees available to them offer very little encouragement for them to seek them.  That is a point worthy of <Col N="908" /> consideration and examination by the Minister for Education and I am certain, because of his great interest in the development of a proper system of education here, he has not overlooked and will not overlook it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not see why primary teachers should not have the same status as secondary teachers seeing that they go into the training colleges with six or seven honours and an interview, mind you, while students doing a degree are not required by the university to have the same standards for entrance.  Naturally I, like Senator Brosnahan, am all for raising the school leaving age.  I am confident that the Government will do everything in their power to expedite that desirable situation and bring about the raising of the school leaving age as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson, in the course of this debate, said that the money allocated to the development of tourist traffic could be better spent, and she advocated the curtailment of that expenditure.  Like Senator Ó Ciosáin who spoke earlier today, I was greatly surprised at that attitude from a representative of Labour, when we think of all the benefits reaped by the workers in this great industry.  Senator Miss Davidson will, I am sure, gain a better appreciation of the industry from a study of the annual report of Bord Fáilte which reached us all this morning.  It is noteworthy that this report reveals that our income from tourism last year was almost £47,000,000, an increase of £4,500,000 over the previous year.  It shows that tourist traffic followed the export of merchandise as the biggest factor in closing the gap in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Our visitors numbered 1,460,000 which was an increase of six per cent. over the 1960 figure.  Of those, 843,000 came from Britain, and 85,000 from the United States of America.  Those figures are not to be despised. Altogether the report shows that 1960 was a record year for tourism.  The Director General, the board and all concerned in developing this industry deserve our thanks, and merit congratulations on the excellent results of their work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="909" /> However, the report strikes a note of warning in the following paragraph which I think should be heeded.  It says:</P>
    <P>Even in Britain, where our major effort is concentrated, the rise in incomes, the offer of cheaper and faster travel, and the growing popularity of &ldquo;all-inclusive&rdquo; continental holidays, tend to nullify Ireland's natural advantages.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that we are facing a serious challenge from the highly organised countries, and the reasonably priced holidays offered on the Continent by the big travel agencies in Britain.  Anyone who reads the newspapers can see for himself that judging by the Press advertisements for summer holidays, our prices seem to be higher than those on the Continent for holidays of a similar type.  All concerned, therefore, in this great industry should put on their thinking caps before we price ourselves completely out of the tourist market.</P>
    <P>That is not a remote possibility because every country in Europe is going after this tourist trade, hook, line and sinker, and offering inducements which to the people who come to us from Britain are, on the surface anyhow, and in the newspaper advertisements, much more attractive than the prices and inducements which we are able to offer.  We should, therefore, take heed of the danger that exists and I hope the people in the trade unions and in the hotel industry will take obvious note of it, too.</P>
    <P>I have one criticism of Bord Fáilte. It is late when they start their advertising campaign in the British Press. Britain is our greatest potential market for tourist visitors.  There is no doubt in the world that that market is very big and that it could be greatly expanded. However, there is an old tradition in Britain that the Englishman makes up his mind where he will spend his summer holiday when he is eating his Christmas turkey on Christmas Day.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, so far as I can judge, during recent years, the advertising campaign organised by Bord Fáilte in the British Press does not begin in <Col N="910" /> time.  It would be well worth consideration on the part of their publicity department to see whether it is not possible to start their series of advertisements in the popular papers in Great Britain well before Christmas, so that we will be in line with the continental resorts which advertise in the British Press and with the great travel agencies which begin their campaign of advertisements for the summer holiday of the following year around 1st December.</P>
    <P>The present season unfortunately has not been as good as the report we received today indicates last year was. That was due I think in the main to external factors which probably will not recur next year.  I am glad to see that it has not damped the enthusiasm of Bord Fáilte with regard to the continuation of their hotel development programme.  I hope it will meet with every success.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Conalláin referred to Telefís Éireann and their attitude to the Irish language.  I must confess at the start that I am an avid fan of Telefís Éireann, and I am prepared to do battle in their defence at any time, in any place and with any person.  I think Telefís Éireann have done a wonderful job since 1st January, when they came on the air.  They cannot of course accomplish miracles any more than any other human agency.  They have been up against tremendous competition and they have had to overcome tremendous handicaps.</P>
    <P>We were fortunate in that creative period in having such an outstanding Director General as Mr. Roth.  I hope when his term of office expires, the Broadcasting Authority will be able to persuade him to remain, and to give his services to our Television and Broadcasting Authority for another period.  His achievement in putting this service on the air in the way in which it has come on the air for the past eight months to me anyhow looks almost miraculous.</P>
    <P>I agree thoroughly that not enough time is given to the Irish language on Telefís Éireann but the time that is given is well used.  We must have patience.  We cannot expect miracles, as I said, but we do expect progress in <Col N="911" /> the near future.  I am one of those who believe that putting on programmes in Irish for the sake of being able to say we are putting on something in Irish no matter of how poor a standard or low quality does more harm to the language than anything else we could do.</P>
    <P>I believe that if a programme in Irish is put on Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann, it should be of a standard comparable with any programme which is put on in English.  Unless the standard is equal to the standard of the programme in English, it should not be put on the air merely for the sake of filling in a spot in a programme and saying that we are using the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that those who are responsible for the programmes on Telefís Éireann are aware of Article 17 of the Broadcasting Authority Act.  I have no doubt that as they overcome the obstacles with which they have been faced the position will improve. As I said at the start, as a stout defender of Telefís Éireann and the tremendous entertainment it is giving, I should like to say that I am with Senator Ó Conalláin in hoping that within a reasonable period we shall see a big improvement in the position in regard to the use of Irish and the use of documentaries.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the Press in the past few days that Telefís Éireann camera men and script writers are engaged on a series of documentary films.  I hope they will try to put on Telefís Éireann something similar to one of the finest programmes we have&mdash;the American programme &ldquo;You are There.&rdquo;  We have here in this country subjects of historical background eminently suitable for a programme of that nature.  The critics who say there is not enough Irish language or Irish background in the Telefís Éireann programmes will undoubtedly be fully satisfied if these documentary films of an historical nature are put on Telefís Éireann during the coming winter on the same lines or style as the American programme &ldquo;You are There&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think that the Irish which is being <Col N="912" /> used by Telefís Éireann is being used in a way which I have advocated for many years but I could find nobody to take any heed of my advocacy.  One of the things which I am convinced will do good for the Irish language is what Telefís Éireann is doing at odd moments throughout the afternoon and evening, namely, the production of pop songs in Irish.  For too long we have left the rising generation to the foreign jazz maniacs.  For too long we have ignored the fact that the young people want to dance and want to sing and that the songs they sing come from Hollywood and that the dances they dance also come from that part of the world.  For too long we have ignored the fact that gramophone store after gramophone store in this city and in every town in Ireland carries the songs which have been popularised by foreign radio stations and by films. Now, Telefís Éireann is doing something which should have been done years ago.  It is taking the popular songs sung by the young people and translating them into the Irish language.  It is giving the young people no excuse now because if they want to sing these songs they might as well sing them in Irish.  There is no reason why they cannot sing them in our own language.</P>
    <P>I do not like to take up too much of the time of the Seanad in making reference to Senator Quinlan's one-and-a-half hours' speech.  However, there are two points which I should like to mention.  He found fault with the Minister for Industry and Commerce because he said yesterday on the debate on the Import Restrictions Bill that he had adequate and expert guidance on the menace of Communism in his own Department. Senator Quinlan could not see any sense in that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan, of course, thinks that he himself and the other professors whom he mentioned are the only people in the whole world, apparently, or in this country, in particular, who have any knowledge of that menace. I think he is very full of himself in thinking any such thing.  There were others, long before Professor Quinlan began to think of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> Also, I was glad to see that the witch hunt which he has organised against the Minister for External Affairs seems to have come to an end.</P>

      <P>This is the Appropriation Bill.  Yet we have listened for, I suppose, one-third, possibly nearer half, of the debate to a debate on education and the Estimate for the Department of Education.  I support Senator Quinlan's suggestion that it might be possible in a debate of this kind for the Minister for Education to be present.  I do not know how far that is practicable.  I should like the Minister for Finance to tell us in his reply if it is practicable.  If it is not practicable, I think the only way of dealing satisfactorily with our educational policy is for a motion to be put down on the Department of Education in relation to the manner in which the money voted is spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think possibly quite a number of Senators would be prepared to support such a motion if the Minister for Education would come to the House and hear it debated.  It may be, as <Col N="914" /> Senator Quinlan has said, that we shall have to wait quite a long time before we are able to debate that motion, because there are a number of motions well ahead of it, but, at the same time, if we cannot have the appropriate Minister present when we want to refer to his Department I think the only way in which the subject can be properly discussed is by a motion.</P>
    <P>Like a great number of other Senators, I must add my word of praise to the <i>Investment in Education</i> statistics and to the report produced by the Federation of Irish Secondary Schools.  I think it is a magnificent thing that these men have been able to find the time and the energy to put this report together and to produce these statistics.  Whatever the Minister for Education may consider the true interpretation of these statistics, in detail at any rate, I think the overall picture must be admitted by every Senator as a particularly gloomy one.</P>
    <P>I must strongly support Senator Stanford in his plea that the Government should, as soon as possible, take every step to subsidise and to assist secondary education.  The picture of our standard of secondary education, as compared with the standard in Northern Ireland and the standard in Great Britain, is very grim.  We are trying in this country to arrive at a new concept of a European country taking our part in the EEC.  We are trying to do that, I think, in two ways&mdash; (1) by looking outward instead of inward in all our thought and being and (2) by our development of exports to other European countries and by spreading our trading relationship.  If we do that on a false educational basis, it seems to me we are building the whole foundation of our new concept of Ireland on sand.</P>
    <P>To look at the results produced in the tables in the <i>Investment in Education</i> is extremely depressing.  If we are to take our place in the new Europe it seems to me that our educational system must pay the very greatest possible attention to two particular subjects in which we are, apparently, from these figures, singularly lacking.  One is European languages and the other is Science.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> Take Table 13 in this report.  It gives a comparison of the academic achievements at the higher level in secondary education compared with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. If you take the ratio of total honours in the Republic in certain groups and subjects you will find that, with one exception, they are quite extraordinarily low compared with other countries in the same age group.</P>
    <P>Latin, Senator Stanford will be pleased to see, shows the greatest ratio in the Republic of Ireland as compared with England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  But against that&mdash; and I must admit that I do not regard the classics as having the same importance in modern education as Senator Stanford&mdash;we have the lowest ratio in French, German, Italian and Spanish. I am not so concerned with the last two but in French and German we have by far the lowest, compared with the equivalent ratio in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Again, in the scientific subjects we have the lowest ratio in physics, chemistry and botany. In zoology and biology we do not appear to have any satisfactory ratio at all.  As a basis for the education of technicians and of technical managers and of production managers in management personnel in a country which is going to take its place, we hope in a very short time, in the European Economic Community, it seems to me we are taking singularly few and ineffective steps.  The amount of money spent on secondary education is abyssmally small and it is directed to my mind to the wrong teaching.  We will have to adjust ourselves to education which will have to be geared to the European Common Market and our future as an industrialist and management country.</P>
    <P>I want to go on now to two other Estimates.  My first point arises on the Estimates for the Stationery Office.  I expect the Minister is aware that the bound copies of the Acts of the Oireachtas for 1959 only became available a few weeks ago.  To a practicising lawyer, or anyone who has to refer to the Acts, that is a matter which to say the least is extremely inconvenient. <Col N="916" /> I believe the reason for this is in part due to delays in printing but very largely due to the delays in translating the Acts into Irish.</P>
    <P>The Acts appear in their bound state with the Irish on one side and the English on the other.  If that is the reason for the delay in printing, or certainly of binding the copies, I would ask the Minister to consider the printing of separate editions of the Acts, so that bound copies of the Acts in English and bound copies of the Acts in Irish might be available separately particularly to practitioners in the law. It would facilitate ordinary legal practice very greatly if those were available to us considerably less than two and half years after they have been passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>My last point arises on the Estimate for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, under which a sum of £95,500 is allocated to the collectors and assessors of taxes.  The Sixth Report on the Commission on Income Tax at page 20 dealt with the collection of taxes and pointed out a great many difficulties in the way of ordinary collection.  They particularly emphasised that it was a laborious and time consuming system.  I expect the Minister has in mind a number of reforms in connection with the collection of taxes.  That report suggested that the office of collector, as distinct from the office of inspector, should be abolished and that the collector should become part of the ordinary office of inspector.  That would seem a considerable improvement because at the moment, it seems to me, there is very little liaison between the inspector's office and the collector's office.</P>
    <P>I know of numerous cases in which unearned income may have come to a person who has had to reclaim tax from the United Kingdom.  He has arranged with his inspector that as soon as the tax is received from the United Kingdom he will pay the Irish tax and the inspector in normal practice agrees with that procedure.  But what happens?  The collector who may have written to the individual, and probably has, appears to take no notice at all of any arrangement between the individual and the inspector.  The collector <Col N="917" /> sends out a normal black notice for a demand.  When the time comes, he sends out a blue notice and after that a red notice.  The red notice, as Senators are probably aware, is a notice which threatens distraint with costs if the tax is not paid within seven days.  For those who have made arrangements with the inspector this red notice does not really have much effect&mdash;in which case I suggest it should never have been sent&mdash;but to some it is an extremely frightening notice.  It seems to me that the sending out of such a notice, when it is not intended that it should be acted upon, is a waste of time and money.  As well as that, it creates the wrong public image of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department generally.</P>
    <P>I want to give the House one further example of the action of a collector only a few weeks ago because it is typical, it seems to me, of the attitude of collectors of taxes.  A person, well known to me, was concerned because he had received no demand for Schedule A tax for some two years. He rang up the inspector of taxes and said that he was concerned about this and wanted to know the reason for it. The Schedule A people were extremely polite; they looked up the reference and said there had been a slight mistake because a small portion of this person's land had been acquired by the county council and there had been some delay in assessing the proportion as between the county council of the particular county and this person. They arranged to send out a demand. This was amicably arranged between this person and the inspector.  But what happened?  In about a fortnight's time the person concerned, who had been at pains to point out that he had not paid his tax, received a demand from the collector saying that immediate payment of this tax, which was very considerably in arrears, must be made.  With that was a letter on the usual red form threatening distraint with costs.</P>
    <P>This man was naturally extremely annoyed at the attitude of the collector. He at once wrote a letter to the inspector's office complaining about the way he had been treated, and he also <Col N="918" /> sent a copy to the collector.  He stated that he was perfectly prepared to pay his tax but would pay it on a proper and civil demand being made.  That was six weeks ago.  As a result of that two things happened.  One was that the man concerned was rung up immediately on receipt of the letter by the inspector's office with a profuse apology, and the other was that the collector of taxes did absolutely nothing about it and no demand has ever been sent to that man for his tax.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that because it is to my mind quite typical of the attitude of collectors of taxes in this country.  They are doing no useful service whatsoever either to the country or to the Department in carrying on in this manner.  I would ask the Minister to let us know if he proposes to take any steps to amend this state of affairs even before he may reform the office of collector of taxes so that ordinary citizens of this country are not faced with completely unfair and very often what almost amount to abusive demands from collectors when their tax is not, in fact, due, or if it is due, is due to be paid under an arrangement between the inspector and the person concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been on a rather educational plane, and while I agree with the sentiment expressed about the higher spheres in education I have often wondered why in an agricultural country agriculture was not part of the curriculum of the national schools, particularly in rural areas.  I am glad to see from a recent report that a recommendation has been made in that regard and if I might be permitted under this Bill, not pre-judging legislation, I would express the hope that the Government may consider favourably the recommendation contained in the report that agriculture will get its place in the primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While dealing with the Department of Education, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction last year of facilities to vocational education committees for the provision of teaching traditional music in those schools.  It was as a result of representations made by the national organisation, <Col N="919" /> Comhaltas Ceolteorí na hÉireann, that the Minister acceded to the request.  I might mention in passing that there was no difficulty and that the Minister accepted the recommendation straight away.</P>
    <P>Tourism has been mentioned by a number of Senators.  I myself have some personal experience in the development of tourism and I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating Bord Fáilte on the report issued to-day.  At the same time, I feel that Bord Fáilte is not above criticism. While I may have things to say against them, I should like to congratulate them on the work they have done.  I agree with An Seanadóir Ó Maoláin with regard to the advertisement campaign. I had an experience last year of going across to England and going into an office of the Board.  I went as a representative of a local development association and was accompanied by another member of the development association.  We inquired for the person in charge and were told that he was out.  We inquired for some fishing brochures, because we came from a coarse fishing area.  One was eventually dug out from under the counter. I remarked to the lady behind the counter that I thought a more appropriate place for it was on the counter or in the window, since that was late October, when English visitors would have been contemplating holidays here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Referring to promotion, I am very glad that Bord Fáilte in their report mentioned Aer Lingus, because we went across the street to the Aer Lingus office and as soon as we entered we saw a fish, which was certainly one that did not get away, showing one of the holiday attractions of Ireland.  I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating Aer Lingus on the promotional efforts they are making for tourism in this country.  I had a tribute recently from two German visitors who inquired at the Aer Lingus office in Frankfurt with regard to holidays in the South of Ireland.  They were high in their praise of the way they were received and the facilities offered to them.  They had gone to another office, not of this country, <Col N="920" /> and on inquiry about coming to Ireland they were told there that they would not like it and that they would have difficulty in travelling to Ireland with their car.</P>
    <P>The report today is a fine report, but, unfortunately, it has been issued in a season which has not lived up to expectations, and, as has been stated by other Senators, we have apparently come to the cross-roads in regard to tourism. While it has been suggested by An Seanadóir Ó Ciosáin that overcharging is one cause I do not agree that overcharging is entirely responsible, though I do agree that it is high prices which will price us out of the tourist business. The unfortunate thing about tourism is that the people who make the most gain are the people who make the least effort.  I suggest that the people who are sabotaging the tourist effort are the people who got the most out of it. That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>We started in our area at a rate of four guineas per week for coarse anglers.  It has gone up to seven guineas.  We are dealing with the ordinary working man from Britain, our nearest neighbour, and we were hoping that he would come across and would discover Ireland with its fishing paradise, but he discovered that it was not a place for a cheap holiday and that he could get his car across to the Continent at a very cheap rate and probably with a guarantee of weather.</P>
    <P>Talking about the weather, I have always avoided mentioning that subject to tourists.  When I do mention it, I have always told them that we never have extremes of heat or cold, that they will not die from the heat, neither will they die from the cold, and that if we do get a little bit of softness, as we describe it, it helps to make the grass as green as it is and the complexions of our colleens as fine as they are.  I think the stage has been reached when we cannot count any longer on the weather and we will have to offer something more.  The only thing we can offer is a cheap holiday.</P>
    <P>We must show people our way of life.  While I go a bit of the way with An Seanadóir Ó Maoláin about modern &ldquo;pops&rdquo; I hold that we should retain <Col N="921" /> our own identity and our own native songs and dances.  People are coming to this country and leaving it and telling their friends that during their visit here they have not seen an Irish dance or heard an Irish song.  That is very unfortunate.  We have heard a lot of talk about the Common Market.  It is most essential, if we go into the Common Market, that we should retain our own way of life and bring it into the Common Market.  Let us influence the countries we will come in contact with in it, and not be influenced by them.  We have advocates of French and German, but I say that we should stand by our own language and bring it into the Common Market and get those people to realise that we have a language of our own as they have.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House on this Bill, but these were points I wished to mention.  I do not entirely agree with the policy of Bord Fáilte of bringing over travel agents to this country who are wined and dined and toured through the country at the expense of Bord Fáilte but then go back and forget all about us.  I could give an instance of one party which was entertained in a certain town and when they were leaving the town they asked where they had been.  Some literature which had been given to them was discovered left behind them in the place they had been in.  It pays them to encourage people to go to other countries.  They are not going to send them over to Ireland.</P>
    <P>This question of tourism will have to be seriously considered.  Looking over the report, I see that the number of complaints about hotels last year was considerable.  There were 548 involving 301 registered premises and there were 498 involving 216 premises in 1960. Those are premises subsidised by all of us here and by the people in general.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a plea to the Minister, if he has any influence to use it in connection with accommodation. It is time Bord Fáilte came down to the level of the lower income group and tried to provide grants for the people who keep the ordinary coarse angler, the ordinary visitor and, indeed, the ordinary native who comes back on a <Col N="922" /> holiday and has no place to stay.  He is not looking for a top-grade hotel but for a holiday at a moderate price.  This has been suggested time and time again to the Board but without result.  They say they must look after the palatial hotels.  I am not against palatial hotels because even the most modern hotels that we may build will not be able to compete with some of the hotels they have on the Continent and in America.</P>
    <P>The Board should come to the aid of a county like mine which is inland and has not the same resources as seaside resorts.  They should help people who go into the catering business in places like that.  In addition to what the State is doing, these people should get grants under a Local Government Act.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the fact that there was very little criticism of Government policy during this debate.  There was criticism of the standard of living, the cost of living, etc., and, of course, the figures quoted were over a period of five years.  I think anybody examining the Estimates must agree that there is matter for congratulation in the amounts of money provided by the Government for three things.  Two were discussed at great length during the debate, agriculture and education, but I do not think there was any reference to the third, social welfare. Senator L'Estrange referred to the cost of living but he knows as well as I do that the cost of living is beyond the control of the Government.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Appropriation Bill has really developed into a debate on the Department of Education with an occasional diversion here and there.  Primary education has been very adequately dealt with, secondary education and university education, and a strong appeal has even been made for the classics.  I suppose it is only natural that our minds should be turned to education at this time in the history of our country when we are about to enter the Common Market or when we hope to enter it and when only the <Col N="926" /> best and most educated will survive either as individuals or as a country.</P>
      <P>I rise to develop a point made by Senator Mooney when he mentioned education in the sphere of agriculture. I was rather surprised sitting here for hours during the debate to find that so little time was devoted to technical education in that sphere.  I understand that the Taoiseach stated today that it was absolutely essential that the level of productivity should be accelerated, and accelerated immediately, even if drastic or unusual methods had to be employed.  I heard that report of the Taoiseach's speech on the midday news.  I could not agree more.  In my opinion productivity can be increased only through the instrumentality of the principal industry of this country, agriculture.</P>
      <P>In my opinion education in the sphere of agriculture is grossly inadequate. It has been neglected over the past 40 years.  In practically every county we have one or more, and sometimes several, secondary schools and we have technical schools, but how many agricultural colleges have we? I suggest that we have probably five or six altogether.  There is one at Ballyhaise in County Cavan, and there is a diocesan school in County Monaghan. I suppose I could count the rest on the fingers of one hand.  I would urge the Minister to make more money available for that type of education.  It would show a good return.  Unless we do so there is no future for the country, in the Common Market or out of it.</P>
      <P>I doubt whether the instruction provided through the committees of agriculture is showing the best return.  I think the scheme that is being operated is out of date.  I do not wish to be controversial but it is a fact that when the inter-Party Government were in power a system of technical education through parish agents was introduced by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  It was an excellent system, and the only reason I can think of for its being dropped was that it was introduced by Deputy Dillon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be resident agricultural schools.  The farmers' sons who intend to make their living out of agriculture should be encouraged to go to those schools. Farmers' sons with first class national school education, or perhaps technical school education, should go to those schools for a couple of years and then return to the land.</P>
      <P>The schools at present operated are largely institutions to which boys go who intend to become inspectors, or to make their living out of agriculture but not on it, if you know what I mean.  I advocate generous scholarships to help the sons of smaller farmers to go to those schools and prepare themselves to help themselves and help the country in the years that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about technical education as operated by the vocational education committee. Technical education stands more or less out on its own.  It is unique in the sense that it is operated by voluntary committees, the vocational education committees.  Those committees are doing good work but I do not think they are getting all the co-operation that they should get from the Department of Education.  I suppose great bodies move slowly, but it certainly takes a long time to get a technical school from the Department of Education.  It is most frustrating for a person who goes on a vocational education committee with the idea of providing a school in a certain place in his own locality perhaps, to find that it takes many years to get that school although the project is approved in principle.  It has taken up to ten years to get a school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrast that with voluntary effort. In County Cavan we have had the unique national experience of providing a technical school by voluntary effort.  That technical school which is costing something in the neighbourhood of £20,000 will be open within <Col N="928" /> the next month, and it was first thought of not more than three years ago.  I understand that about April, 1960, a voluntary local committee got working on it.  The building is now an accomplished fact and it will be open within a month.  Pupils will be taught there next September when the new term opens.  I venture to suggest that if the people of Virginia had waited to get a school through the ordinary sources, the vocational education committee with the assistance of the Department, they would not have one for the next ten years.  I appeal therefore for more co-operation from the Department of Education in the line of technical education through vocational education committees and I ask that the assistance given be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that the provision of housing is relevant on the vote for the Department of Local Government.  I just wish to put the record right, and I am sorry that Senator Mooney has left.  I gathered from him that there was practically no housing problem in Leitrim whereas I read recently in large letters in the local paper of a survey which had been carried out by Leitrim County Council as a result of which it would appear that 1,000 houses are necessary in Leitrim.  I am not able, offhand, to give the population of Leitrim, but if 1,000 houses are necessary in Leitrim, a very big percentage of the population of that county must not be properly housed.</P>
    <P>On the question of tourism, I agree with the case made by Senator Miss Davidson.  She appeared to make the same case as Senator Mooney and other Senators, that we should spend more money in providing good comfortable hotels for the ordinary and middle income or even the lower income group from England who come here on holiday.  That was the case Senator Miss Davidson made, and I could not rightly understand her being chastised for doing so by Senator Ó Maoláin.  Senator Mooney made the same case and got away scot free.  Too much money is being poured into palatial hotels and I do not think that expenditure is giving the best return. I think that the more modern type of <Col N="929" /> hotel, catering for the average visitor coming over here from England, may give a better return.</P>
    <P>Another point&mdash;again under the Department of Local Government: it may be theoretical&mdash;is that I assume that the Department of Local Government give substantial grants for the improvement of trunk roads and that they have some say in the spending of that money.  I cannot understand and have not been able to understand for many years why the road leading from Navan and indeed from Cavan to Dublin has been left in the state in which it is.  The last ten miles of that road from Clonee or Mulhuddart is a public disgrace.  There is congestion on it.  If you get behind a lorry it is impossible to pass it out.  It takes as long to do the last ten miles of that road as it takes to do the first forty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a lot of notes.  I think I have notes on nearly everything that was raised but there is such a volume of stuff here that it may be difficult to cover everything.  There was a lot of talk generally on education.  We have been increasing our expenditure on education very rapidly, indeed.  In the past six years, since I became Minister, it is gone up by £7 million per year.  That is a very big increase. Taking the global figure, it looks fairly good, anyway.  That, I should say, is current expenditure, but, apart from that, there is fairly big expenditure on the capital side.  Here are a few instances where this money has been handed out over the past couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the new Belfield building for UCD costing almost £2 million; Bolton Street, £500,000; Kevin Street, £1 million; the training college at Drumcondra over £1 million.  Apart from that, the general Vote for national schools has been doubled in <Col N="930" /> the past six years.  About 40 schools were being dealt with at that time: now the number is 80.  Therefore apart from the current expenditure on education the capital side has gone up very steeply also.</P>
    <P>On this question of trying to enable pupils to go on from the primary to the secondary school and from the secondary school to the university, the Minister brought in a scholarship Bill which was before the Seanad some time ago.  That will help very materially. It will be in full operation in about three years' time.  It is starting next year.  It will, by that time, increase the number of primary scholarships to students by between 5,000 and 6,000 per year.  The number of scholarships from secondary school to university will increase by between 500 and 600. The first year&mdash;next year&mdash;the post-primary scholarships will be treble what they are now and university scholarships will be double.</P>
    <P>It will be the first time the State stepped into the scholarship world. They were all done up to this by the local authorities.  The State's stepping in to help the local authorities, and to take the greater part from this on, will make all the difference.</P>
    <P>I need not mention&mdash;this matter was raised here&mdash;that teachers' salaries have been increased more than the ordinary cost of living increases.  In other words, they got the status increase too.  I am not saying they are overpaid but they are at least comparatively better treated now than they were, say, ten or twelve years ago.  We are also, as the Seanad is aware, removing an old grievance by paying the lump sum to pre-1952 retired teachers.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of confusion. The Minister for Education has one way of looking at a certain figure and certain publications have another way of looking at it.  I asked the Minister for Education how he got his figure.  He said: &ldquo;I am taking all children between 14 and 16 years of age: I have a census of the whole lot. I can tell you that, of that age group, two-thirds are still at school.  Whether it is secondary school, technical school or in some cases perhaps an extra year in the primary school, at least two-thirds of them are at school.&rdquo;  The <Col N="931" /> good thing I see about that is that it is voluntary.  There is no compulsion.</P>
    <P>I must say that some ten years ago when I was before the Dáil and the Seanad with a Health Bill I was lectured very severely indeed about not allowing people to arrange their own way of life and to pay their own health expenses.  Now, it should be equally important that they should pay their own educational expenses, if they are able to pay them.  The fact that so many children are continuing their schooling at their own expense, to a great extent, is a sign of an improved economy, but that, however, will be helped now by these scholarships.  I think we should find that any bright pupil who is not in a position to continue at his own or at his family's expense should have an opportunity of getting a scholarship from the primary to the secondary school and again from the secondary school to the university.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes raised the question of the big number already at the universities who are not adequately provided for in the way of buildings, and so on. I am not able to dispute that matter with Senator Hayes.  I certainly think there is a case, in some of the universities or in some of the university colleges, of overcrowding.  The Government have agreed, as Senators are aware, to a very big programme of building University College, Dublin. We have also come to an agreement&mdash; or are on the point of coming to an agreement&mdash;with both University College, Cork, and University College, Galway, in relation to certain building projects which they have in mind.</P>
    <P>The secondary schools are mostly in private hands and, as Senator Hayes pointed out, the great majority of them are in religious hands.  Up to the moment, the religious bodies have provided their own buildings, and so on. As far as I know, there is no general request from the religious bodies to be relieved of that responsibility.  I am quite sure that if they come to the Minister for Education I shall hear all about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes mentioned the young <Col N="932" /> civil servants whom we have encouraged to take university courses.  We started this a year or two ago.  We gave an opportunity to those who are coming in from the secondary schools from the Leaving Certificate or as Junior Executive Officers, and so on, to compete for these particular courses at the university.  The best are taken and sent to the university.  They are paid their salary as civil servants&mdash; the salary appropriate to whatever rank they have come with&mdash;and their fees are also paid.  Senator Hayes thinks we are a bit hard by insisting that they must get honours at every examination. That is what is laid down but we are prepared to listen to the university authorities. It must be remembered, however, that the aim is to produce men equal to those we had been taking in from outside as junior administratives and they, of course, had Honours Degrees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Honours Degree is one thing.  However, I am not arguing about it.  It is only a matter of adjusting the scheme.  I quite agree it is a good scheme.</P>

      <P>Where the college would make a good report we would naturally have to consider it.  We hope in that way to get a number of the administrative officer calibre.  The numbers had been dwindling and although recently they have gone up again we would still like to have more of them.  In regard to another point raised by Senator Hayes, it will be easier to recruit into the Civil Service at a higher level as soon as our Superannuation Bill comes along.  As Senators may be aware, I have introduced a new Superannuation Bill in the Dáil.  It is not dealing with this present increase at all.  That will be an <i>ad hoc</i> Bill.  This is a general Bill on superannuation amending the present Superannuation Acts.  When that Bill is printed, Senators will see that it will make it easier for people to come into the Civil Service at different ages. It will also be possible for a man in the Civil Service to go for a few years to the university as a lecturer or demonstrator and then come back <Col N="933" /> again, or go to a State body for a few years and come back again.</P>
      <P>As the Civil Service is becoming more a commercial organisation, as it were, we hope to get better people in that way and better training for them. I think it was Senator Hayes who mentioned State bodies.  Parliament, of course, has no right to interfere with the affairs of State bodies.  Not only this Government but every Government before us have given thought to this question which is a very difficult question.  Could Parliament review State companies or even interrogate them about their affairs?  The same review went on in England but no satisfactory solution has been found. On the one side you must allow these companies to carry on with at least the same freedom as ordinary public companies would have competing against them.  At the same time, I know that the public company has to face its annual meeting of shareholders.  If we could get something corresponding to that, it might be a good thing but, so far, we have not found a solution.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Brien that we can make a great defence for every single item in the Book of Estimates. In fact, I think, with the exception of Senator Miss Davidson, the criticism was that they should have been higher. But as Senator O'Brien said the total is too high and I agree with that but what can we do?  You cannot reduce the total because the sum of the Estimates is the total and that is the great difficulty. The Senator also said that a good Minister should be an unpopular-person with the public, with his colleagues and with the Houses.  I could prove I am living up to that if I showed him some of the letters I am getting from the public, and I think I could also prove it to him as regards my colleagues if I let him look at what the Bill would have been if all my colleagues had got their way. Members of the Dáil and the Seanad, too, are generally critical that one Vote or another was not high enough. Therefore, I have eliminated myself and I am standing alone in keeping these Estimates down.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien said that the fear of inflation in many European countries, which he named, had tempted them to slow down on their production.  Perhaps, that could be justified in these countries which have had rapid growth over a long period but we are in quite a different position.  After all, we are very young in our growth.  It has been a short period and it would be a great mistake to slow down in any way.  Of course, we all realise the dangers of inflation. First of all, it creates injustice as between the various classes of people if prices are put up.  Those who can demand more by way of salaries and wages are all right but those living on fixed incomes are not all right.  Therefore, you have that injustice.  Then we would have trouble in our external relations by prices going up and it becomes difficult to export.  We import more and the result may be unemployment and, perhaps, a deficit in the balance of payments.  We should try as far as possible to build our economy even more and hope that increased incomes will follow increased productivity. If so, there will be no ill effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire said he thought there was a mis-application of some of the grants that are being made.  I have no doubt that is true.  It would be very difficult, indeed, for any Government, or any committee set up by the Government, to be so far-seeing and to exercise its judgement as never to make a mistake in applying moneys of that kind.  He mentioned the case of applying the money to the reconditioning of an old hotel which, perhaps, was a case of money being thrown away.  I do not think there is any money given in that way.  I might say that there is a general impression that much is being done by way of grants for the luxurious hotels but as far as I know the grant is the same for the big hotels as for the small ones.  They give grants for bedrooms and lounges but the grant is the same and it is no higher for the luxurious hotel than for the ordinary hotel which we have heard supported so much. There was, of course, support from another quarter for a few of the big luxurious hotels.  In one case Aer Lingus thought it would help them to have a <Col N="935" /> big hotel and they put money into it, equity capital and not a grant.</P>
    <P>They thought it would be a good investment to put some money into it but that was by no means a grant. Senator McGuire, talking about State companies, thought that after the first glamour and enthusiasm of the young people who started them, they would, after a while, settle down to be rather moribund organisations.  I suppose there is always that danger but we will have to deal with that when it comes. There was also this question of teachers returning from England and not getting recognition here.  There are two ways of looking at that.  It is not all a one-sided matter.</P>
    <P>You can imagine the young man coming out of the university with his degree and his higher diploma, fitted in every way to teach.  He knows that if he goes to England he will get no credit for the time he teaches there, but if he starts here and spends three or four years teaching he will get credit for that three or four years so he may stay here.  If it was open for him to go to England for a few years and get credit on coming back for the time he had spent there, instead of staying four or five years in England he might stay there permanently. So that this is a very difficult question to decide.  In fact, the Minister for Education has not decided.  If you like, he is taking a very opportunist view of this whole matter.  When it suits him to give credit he does so. If a person is teaching in France for four years and comes back as a French teacher he will be recognised and get credit for his years there because he has obviously made himself a better French teacher.  The same would apply to a man who spent some years in Germany and came back to teach German. The Minister takes a pragmatic point of view, an opportunist point of view.  He may change his opinions if it suits the other way.</P>
    <P>We have had that trouble, for instance, with the doctors.  For a long time here we had no great trouble in our hospitals in getting house surgeons and even a tier above that, who were called senior house men.  The names have changed, but I think <Col N="936" /> senior housemen is what they were called, and they could be got.  Now because if they go to England or America they are recognised when they come back and can get marks for experience in England and America, they are not going for public jobs here.  They find that they can get more pay abroad and we are now finding it hard to get those house surgeons for our own hospitals.  We will have to think about what we are going to do about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford talked about the classics and gave an example of the number of pupils taking Latin.  He was seriously perturbed about the teaching of Latin and talked about fifth rate translations being used by pupils.  That, I think, was a practice when I was learning Latin.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Professor Stanford will be glad to hear that I had the privilege of learning Greek, but I am no Greek scholar, and we used translations in that, too.  Still Professor Stanford is an authority on this, and I am certainly going to have a talk with the Minister for Education on his suggestions.  His first suggestion was that if he had his way he would do away with text books and have no marks for translation from a prescribed text book.  Of course, the Latin scholar would have to be a good lot better to translate anything put before him, but it could still be done, because we always got some of that, too.  His second suggestion was that if the Minister thought that that was going too far he might make the text books a little less important by giving fewer marks for that item.  I will talk to the Minister for Education about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He went on to talk about the grant for the Abbey Theatre of £18,000.  I should say that the grant is a bit higher than it would normally be because the authorities running the Abbey Theatre told me that it was more expensive for them to run a play where they are now in the Queen's than it would be in the old Abbey or the new Abbey, and so they are getting something more <Col N="937" /> than they would get if they were still in the old Abbey, and more I hope. than they will ask for in the new.  The Senator put a very big onus on me to do something about the Abbey to get them back to their old glory of the past.  I remember the Abbey for a long, long time, over forty years, and I think the acting is as good now as ever it was but they have not probably got the same plays, and I am afraid that is the position the whole world over.</P>

      <P>We go on to Senator Miss Davidson.  She mentioned the point about too much spent on luxury hotels.  I mentioned the point about the medium sized hotels which cater for people of ordinary means who would stay in an hotel on their holiday, that they get the same grants as luxury hotels.  There is no specific grant for what Senator Miss Davidson has described as spectacular fronts. As I have said, the grants are confined, I think, first, to bedrooms, secondly to bathrooms, and I am not sure about lounges but they may be included.</P>
      <P>The next point was the equipment of the Defence Forces.  Senator Miss Davidson wants to know is that money well spent.  I believe in having a Defence Force.  We should keep it as small as possible but at the same time capable of being expanded rather rapidly in case of emergency.  That is what we have aimed at for the past seven or eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think so.  As regards the Defence Forces, I am convinced of this anyway, though other Senators may not agree, that in the last war we had a Defence Force here that would probably require a couple of divisions to deal with.  We could <Col N="938" /> have been beaten by Germany or America or England or Russia if they were allowed to get at us with nobody else in the field, but both sides were fairly evenly matched and they could not spare two or three divisions to come and attack us, so we had that sort of nuisance value.  We should, therefore, keep a small Defence Force capable of being expanded rather rapidly in case of an emergency in the hope that there would be sufficient to deter any country that might invade us.</P>

      <P>Senator Brosnahan mentioned the long list of subjects that were recognised for the secondary schools.  I see no objection to that, because some schools will have French recognised as they do not teach German, Spanish, or Italian, and others may go in for modern languages and not take the classics.  It is no harm to have them all recognised.  There is nobody who would expect any secondary school to supply teachers for all those subjects.</P>
      <P>I agree, of course, that no pupil can rise above the level of his teacher, and by a rather clever move Senator Brosnahan got from that to the salaries paid to teachers.  I mentioned that already.  I do not think that a teacher will be any better if he gets a higher salary, though he may be more contented.</P>

    <P>Now we come to Senator Quinlan. He made a rather long speech.  I am not going to speak very much about law charges, but being a public man, <Col N="939" /> if I knocked anybody off a bicycle or knocked two men, in Tipperary or anywhere else, I would have a certain anxiety about going before a jury there.  I would prefer a jury in Dublin. Anyway he was acquitted and God knows what would have happened to him if he had been put before a jury in Tipperary.  So I do not think we are going to regard the Senator as a martyr.</P>
    <P>He went on to tell us of his work in the university.  I am quite sure he is doing his work quite well there.  He told us of the remuneration of university professors and so on.</P>
    <P>I am coming to his discussion of the Department of Agriculture.  It is not true to say that the committees dealing with agricultural produce are in any way different from those dealing with industrial products and industrial activities.  In the Department of Industry and Commerce, industries are grouped and some civil servants from the Department of Industry and Commerce, some from others, would be on a committee, an economist, sometimes supplied from outside, sometimes from my own Department, and representatives of the industry.  It is much the same with agricultural committees.  There are officials from the Department of Agriculture and people from the industry.</P>
    <P>In the case of farm primary products like livestock or cereals, farmers would be on these committees.  There would be an economist, sometimes supplied by the Department of Agriculture and sometimes by my own Department.  There is very little difference. Indeed the numbers of producers on agricultural committees are greater than the number of producers on industrial committees.  When you come to secondary industries like creameries or bacon factories, then of course representatives of creameries or bacon factories would be on these committees, with officials of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made a point about the number of cattle going down.  I remember saying very often about the end of 1959 or the beginning of 1960 that we had a very big carry-over of cattle at the end of 1959 and that it <Col N="940" /> was only to be expected, if there was a good sale for cattle&mdash;as there was&mdash; in 1960, that the surplus would disappear and that particular hump, if I may call it that, on the number would be destroyed.  Looking at our statistics, I am quite prepared to admit that I would like to see very many more cattle in the country, but I do not see what we can do about it.  There are suggestions, I know, about bounties on heifers and so on, but that would be a very difficult problem.  I have not given any thought to it but you could hardly, I think, give a bounty except on a good breeding heifer and a good deal of our cattle are crossbred, half-Aberdeen Angus and half-Hereford maybe, and they would not be allowed into this scheme.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan had some criticism to offer of the amount of money given to the IAOS.  I should like to know whether he can say&mdash;because I do not know&mdash;whether it is a fact that the IAOS have been pressing for money and have not got it.</P>

      <P>He said that the Department of External Affairs had shown a welcome improvement over the past six months, particularly in their attitude on Kashmir.  That was in line with the usual policy of the Department of External Affairs.  They did what they thought was the just thing and following the line of justice, they did of course inevitably incur the anger and hostility of certain powers.  That was only to be expected and I suppose it did not meet with the approval of the people in this country with an opportunist turn of mind.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin raised the question of Bord Fáilte control over hotels, whether they had any control at all over their charges and so on. They do, of course, publish their charges.  Bord Fáilte is interested at least to do that and I presume that Bord Fáilte would maybe criticise the charge, if they thought it too high. But I am afraid they have no power to step in and say: &ldquo;You must not do that.&rdquo;  They might step in and say: &ldquo;We advise you not to do it,&rdquo; but they have no control so far as I know.  They could say to an hotel: &ldquo;You are not giving value for what you are charging and therefore you are not going to be an A hotel; you will be a B hotel.&rdquo;  I do not know if they can do that but they have ways of, let us say, expressing their disapproval.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald asked me some questions about the Shannon estuary. He is concerned about damage done there recently.  This is not the big job of the Shannon river under the arterial drainage scheme.  The Shannon will be one of the last rivers to be reached, as a matter of fact, under that scheme so it will be some years before it is even surveyed.  This is to correct temporary damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald asked about the Secret Service.  About £5,000 a year is spent.  It is given out on a request made to me by any Minister.  My signature goes on it, but he does not tell me what it is for because he does not know.  It comes from his Department and if he is satisfied the money can be given to the Commissioner of the Guards or the Chief of Staff, the <Col N="942" /> money is passed over to him.  It remains about the same, £5,000.</P>
    <P>The Local Security Compensation Vote is, I think, a hangover since the Emergency.  There are small claims which have never been settled and are still awaiting settlement.</P>
    <P>He welcomes the fact that privates of the Defence Force have got better terms and asks for an assurance that the question of uniforms will be settled.  Apparently this is a very vexed question and I know that the Department have been considering the matter but I do not know how far they have got so I cannot give up-to-date information on the point.</P>
    <P>He asked about the telephone provision. There is a very big hold up in connecting telephones.  The Minister is dealing with it as fast as he can get staff together, and get the organisation going generally.  As a matter of fact, in the past three years, the amount spent has gone up from £1½ million to £3½ million.  That covers the equipment necessary, the materials necessary for putting in telephones and the payment of all the wages and salaries. It would be difficult to imagine anyone building up an organisation quicker than they would appear to be building it.  I heard the Minister in the Dáil recently saying that he hoped to have reached some sort of orderly position at the end of the year, that they would be able to deal with applications quicker than they are coming in and that afterwards they would cut down the arrears.  Senators must realise that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is regarded as a commercial department.  They pay their way.  Senators will be aware that when they had to pay out more in wages, they had to put up the price of the stamp to pay their way.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop spoke of the problem of getting co-operation and coordination between the universities and the hospital authorities.  I was Minister for Health at one time and I realise very well indeed that there is a big problem there, because the voluntary hospitals are, naturally enough, very jealous of their authority being interfered with.  At the same time, of course, they take help, if you like, <Col N="943" /> from the Government, the local authorities, and from the universities now, and they are losing their character as voluntary hospitals.  They get very little money in from sources other than public sources.  Still, they have the right, of course, to maintain their authority and that creates a difficulty in the settlement with the university authorities.</P>
    <P>The Veterinary College is in a different position because it is owned by the Department of Agriculture and they pay.  Whether the money goes through University College, Dublin, or through Trinity, it comes to the same thing.  They pay it in the end, and it is easy to make any adjustment or settlement that may arise in that case.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the federation of hospitals.  It is going on at a very slow pace.  I was Minister for Health many years ago, and I thought that was going to materialise rather quickly.  It is still going on.  I can inquire from my colleague whether or not he can push it, but in all probability, it is the hospitals themselves who are finding difficulty in coming to a final arrangement.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole asked whether the new national schools might be out of date before long.  He said that one teacher was hardly sufficient even for a small number of pupils.  I think there is a tendency to look at this problem in the way which, in fact, the Senator is looking at it.  It may be that we will have bigger schools in future but fewer, and that transport will have to be looked after somehow or other.  If there were bigger schools and more teachers, the teaching might be better and it might be a better system.  I am throwing that out only as an opinion of what may occur as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Senator McAuliffe does not approve of the primary certificate and said the INTO do not either.  I do not know why.  He does not approve of compulsory attendance and thinks it was a great mistake.  I must say I do not know what we would have done in some cases, if it were not for that Act.</P>

      <P>I accept that there is better attendance in the technical schools than in the national schools. The pupils are more responsible and more anxious to learn.  After all, when a pupil goes to the national school, naturally he has not very much sense and he does not know what it is all about, and escapes if he can.</P>
      <P>Senator McAuliffe also referred to the forestry workers and other rural workers.  Negotiations have been going on with the forestry workers and I think it is likely that they will get agreement before very long.  I do not say that the negotiations have brought them close to a figure but they have closed up and perhaps something will come of it in the near future.  It is not true that we took the view that because they had an incentive bonus, their basic pay should remain as it was.  I do not think anyone suggested that, but it was recognised at the beginning that in the eighth round, the basic pay would have to be adjusted.</P>
      <P>Senator L'Estrange said the figure had gone up by £52 million.  The Budget of 1950/51 was the Budget before I took office in 1952/53, and it went up from £109 million to £148, that is, by £39 million.</P>

      <P>The Senator may talk about £9 million but if he would let me sit down, I could do some sums too.  For instance, I could say that we put in £5 million more for social welfare, which the Coalition would not have done in a hundred years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Between agricultural grants, social welfare and health, we gave £29 million, and no Senator would say we gave too much to any of those things.  That makes £29 million <Col N="945" /> out of the £52 million and if I went through the figures again, I could find other things almost as praiseworthy.</P>
      <P>I did not take down Senator L'Estrange's figures on imports and exports but I think they are right.  We met a worst half year than we had last year, but luckily for us, we were warned about it by our economic advisers.  They told us it would happen.  They told us, at the same time, that although our balance of payments would worsen, so long as external assets remained static or improved, it was not a matter about which we should worry unduly.  We worried about it, of course, because if it got worse, we would be in trouble.</P>
      <P>Our policy in the Common Market is a big question.  I think everyone knows we have applied for membership. Applying for membership means that they will have a look at it roughly, and if it is likely that our economy will succeed in the Common Market, we will be allowed in.  We start with negotiations and when they are finished, we come back to the Dáil&mdash; and the Seanad perhaps but I am not sure about that&mdash;and tell the Dáil exactly what the proposals are.  I do not think we could do very much better than that.  We may have to argue our case and make the best case we can.  Then, maybe, having succeeded in that way, we might have to come back and put it the other way around to the Dáil and say it is very good to go in.  You can negotiate.  We cannot, therefore, put the whole case until we know the terms.  Then we can put it to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;Here are the terms.&rdquo;  When we say to the Dáil that we are recommending or rejecting them it will then be a matter for the Dáil to make up its own mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator L'Estrange that the farmers should not be encouraged to have undue optimism.  I think the farmers will have a better time and a brighter time if we go into the Common Market&mdash;especially a better time than if we did not go in but, even compared to the present, it will be a brighter future.  But it will not be an El Dorado, as somebody said.  They <Col N="946" /> will have to work as hard as ever. There is no doubt about that.  They will probably have to show a little more ingenuity in management and in looking after their crops and stock, and so on, and also in their marketing activities.  I am going to agree with Senator L'Estrange on another thing.</P>

      <P>No: that is right. Senator L'Estrange mentioned emigration. The Senator should take figures which, indeed, prove to be almost right from the census of the &ldquo;In&rdquo; and &ldquo;Out&rdquo; figures.  They are not guaranteed to be correct but at least they would be as correct for our time as for the Coalition time.  If he takes those figures, he will find that from 1st March, 1957, up to the latest date &mdash;I think May or June : I am not sure &mdash;the net emigration was between 150,000 and 160,000.  If he goes back and takes the previous figures, 1st March, 1954, to 1st March, 1957, he will find that the net emigration was 150,000.  In three years under a Coalition Government 150,000 went <Col N="948" /> out while in over five years of Fianna Fáil Government 155,000 went out. These are the true figures.</P>

      <P>Senator Ross asked about the Stationery Office.  The bound volumes of the Acts are slow in coming out.  To some extent this is due to the translation.  However, there was a hold-up, I am afraid.  A general difficulty, as everybody knows, has existed in regard to printing for some time back.  I think the position will be improved slightly as time goes on.  I hope it will.  The same question was raised in the Dáil and inquiries were made at the time.</P>
      <P>As regards the question by Senator Ross about income tax, the idea is that each taxpayer should normally be sent a single composite notice of assessment for income tax each year and then a single demand to cover the full income tax of the income tax payer.  All his income tax and surtax will be included. This proposal will be implemented as soon as the delivery of the electronic computer, which I mentioned before, takes place and that will be, I think, in September, 1963.  From that time on, I think we shall make a considerable advance in our collection of income tax.  The arrangements are being made now.  I know that many people are paying their surtax now on the PAYE system so the income tax and surtax have actually been merged.  We have reached that stage and we shall reach the other stage, I think, of a single demand, next year.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with teaching agriculture in the national schools. I agree that the Reader they had, the one which had a rural bias, should be substituted for the Reader they have, but I would not go further than that. As regards the parish plan mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick, if the Minister for Agriculture discussed this with me I do not remember but I saw my own objections to it.  They were, first of all, that those men who were working the parish plan were under the Department of Agriculture direct.  They were not on the county staff.  It could happen that they might be crossing one another in their actions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and so on.  Also, of course, I think it would be impossible to provide enough agricultural graduates to cover the country with that type of scheme.  It was better to put them into the county staff and get the work done in that way.  I certainly had no prejudice against the scheme because Deputy Dillon brought it in. Why should I if it was a better scheme?  On the whole, however, I think whatever staff we have would be better under the CAO as part of the county staff and all working together towards the one end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from the Minister that he considered that teachers' salaries had kept pace with the cost of living.  Is he not aware of the fact that for 68 per cent of the teachers, all women and single men, <Col N="952" /> their salaries are £810 which in terms of the 1938 purchasing power would be the equivalent of £270 whereas the salaries for such teachers in 1938 was £318?  It is, therefore, apparent that the salaries of the majority of teachers have not kept pace with the cost of living.  In relation to the Minister's statement that he did not consider that a teacher would be a better teacher as a result of being paid more, I would refer him to a statement of a man who could not in any way be considered a materialist, Pádraig Pearse, who in the <i>Murder Machine</i> stated that there was a vital connection between any system of education and the remuneration paid to teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind, speaking on the Senator's earlier remark, was that from the settlement made in 1945 the increase was greater than the increase in the cost of living. Probably I had in mind that they needed more, but, as the Senator will remember, I did say subsequently that I was not saying they were over-paid by any means.  Regarding the second point, what I said was an individual teacher is not a better teacher if he gets more.  He may be more content and to that extent he may be a better teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the Minister's explanation in regard to the first part, but teachers are not a race apart.  As was stated in the McNair Report, they are human beings like everybody else, and if they feel a sense of grievance at the level of their remuneration it does have a frustrating effect on them and their work.  I should like to ask one further question.  In reference to the proposed legislation concerning the inter-changeability of types of service for the purpose of pension reckoning, is it contemplated that this legislation will have a retro-active effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
