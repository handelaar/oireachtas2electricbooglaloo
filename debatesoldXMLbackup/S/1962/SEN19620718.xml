    <Title>Finance Bill, 1962    (Certified Money Bill)  &mdash;   Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets the income tax level at the same rate at which it was last year, there having been a reduction of 8d. in the £ in the previous year.  It is a great pity that in a year in which an eighth round of wage increases was thrust upon the <Col N="626" /> country, and when, in the judgment of the economists, the amount of added purchasing power created by the increase is not matched by an increase in productivity, the surplus was not taken up by an increase in the rate of income tax.  There are many very worthwhile projects that would have benefited.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) says that the several statutory and other provisions are as they were in previous years, in a period in which we are in transition and preparing, we hope, to take our place in the European Economic Community. The time is overdue to have a look at those provisions which are being continued next year.  For instance, I suggest to the Minister that under this subsection it is time the allowance for wives and families was considerably increased.  It is time that part of the burden was shifted from married people who are working hard and endeavouring to raise families and educate them to some of the unmarried section of the community, who in many ways are spending far too much on luxuries and who could afford to carry more of the burden. That can be done by increasing the allowances.</P>
      <P>Again, under this subhead, we have statutory allowances.  We have the position where many people in this country are entitled to help from the State under a number of headings. For instance, under the Health Act, help is available to those whose income is below £800 per annum and to farmers with a valuation of not more than £50.  That makes provision for free health treatment.  Those in the income brackets above that, who are excluded from the free health services and who have, in large measure, to foot the taxation bill for those services, at the very minimum, should be entitled to an income tax deduction for the amount they spend on any medical costs during the year in question.  That is the very minimum they can expect to get, unless it is paid three ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other point, of which I am acutely conscious, is that within the past few weeks we brought in another Bill which was to provide another <Col N="627" /> State aid, that is, free legal aid in various cases.  The burden of that will have to be carried by those who do not qualify for legal aid.  I feel that this legitimately is a charge that could very well be allowed at least free of income tax.  I speak from knowledge on this subject.  Without any reason given, a case of mine was transferred from the circuit court in Thurles right up to the Central Criminal Court and the costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may not discuss that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned it as an added reason.  I think legal expenses should qualify for relief of income tax.  We are moving in the direction of more scholarships, the funds again being provided by the better-off sections in the community. Admittedly, there is a tendency to provide scholarships for those outside the limit.  The Minister might give consideration to making some income tax adjustment for those who are footing the education bill, especially for their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one remark on this section in connection with taxation.  At present, the Government have a policy of subsidising new industries, with which we all agree.  I should like to direct the Minister's mind, perhaps, in another direction, that is, to the greater encouragement of the building up of capital in existing industries by making tax concessions that would allow more capital to be ploughed back into industry and commercial operations in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted by everybody that we have more capital here than we can find projects in which to invest &mdash; at least viable projects, projects that will be successful.  We should look to the industries and commercial undertakings that are already viable.  If money were allowed to be ploughed back into them, they would be able to expand.  Why not work on the successful industries we already have and help them, as well as trying to find completely new operations and places <Col N="628" /> in which to invest our money?  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to that when next he comes to deal with taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister in this Budget should have adjusted the personal allowance in relation to income tax.  By failing to do so, the Minister has, in effect, greatly increased the burden of direct taxation on wage and salary earners who pay income tax through P.A.Y.E.  This Government have, I think, declared that it is their policy to ease the burden of direct taxation and, in effect, to get more of the necessary revenue by indirect taxation.  That is a policy which sounds beautiful when expressed like that, but, when it comes to be applied to the poorer sections of the community and the wage and salary earners, it means, in effect, that their burden is increased.  They are asked to pay more out of their resources in order to contribute to the running of the State and the redistribution of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking in this context of that section of the wage and salary earners who pay direct taxation, the people who are on P.A.Y.E.  It is true, as Senator Quinlan said, that to a large extent these people have benefited by the eighth round increase.  By failing to adjust the personal allowances in line with the movement in salaries and wages, in effect the proportion of wages and salaries paid by these people through P.A.Y.E. has been greatly increased.  If I may illustrate the point I am making: take the person who, prior to the eighth round, had a salary or wage of £1,000 per annum.  If he was single, he was paying, according to my calculations, which may not be quite exact, £163 per annum through P.A.Y.E.  If he got the eighth round, and an increase, say, of 15 per cent., he would now be paying £199 per annum.  That is an increase in direct taxation, not of 15 per cent. but of 22 per cent.  If instead of being single, he were married with no children, his P.A.Y.E. burden has been increased by 30 per cent.  If he is married with one child, his P.A.Y.E. contribution has been increased by 47 per cent.  If he is married with two children, then previously, <Col N="629" /> according to my calculation, he paid no income tax but now he will have to pay £36.  I do not know what percentage increase you would call that.</P>
    <P>The point is that a wage or salary earner around that income limit has had his P.A.Y.E. burden greatly increased by the Minister's failure to adjust the personal allowances.  Nobody can say that such a person has moved, by reason of the eighth-round increase, into a much higher income group, or that he is much better off this year than he was last year, but still the amount the State is collecting currently from him under P.A.Y.E. has been substantially increased.  The Minister in his budget is unfair to that section of income tax payers who pay directly, and, if I may say so, through the nose, before they get their money at all.  The personal allowance to those people should have been adjusted.  I regret that the Minister has failed to do so.  I do not know whether it would be in order to suggest that when he comes to look at the next Budget, he should have regard to that point. Justice should be done to the people under P.A.Y.E. whose burden of income tax has been greatly increased and their personal allowances should be properly adjusted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had some interesting suggestions, some of which I would have sympathy with, if we were in a position to meet them.  Senator Quinlan thought that on account of the amount of money being paid out, we could have afforded an increase in income tax.  In answer to that, I announced in 1957, in the first Budget after I became Minister for Finance, that as far as possible we should take as little as possible from a person's earnings, and from his spendings rather than from his earnings.  It is better to have indirect taxation rather than direct taxation.  That of course may not meet with general agreement but on the whole it is a sound policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Senator made a point, and Senator Murphy supports him, that we should give a better allowance for married people.  I mentioned the previous day that I have a list of very <Col N="630" /> desirable concessions that could be made in income tax and estate duty as soon as the money is there to meet them, and I should like to say that this question of better allowances for married people, to use a bit of economic jargon, holds a high priority. When we may be able to do it, I do not know.  I do not agree with Senator Quinlan that we should try to compensate people in their income tax payments for what they have to pay on health charges, legal charges and even on education, although we do to some extent meet them on the educational side by giving children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the opinion before, if not in this House, then in the Dáil, that health difficulties should be met by means of a health scheme and as the House is aware, there is a Committee of the Dáil sitting on this matter at the moment.  I hope they will be able to produce something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire spoke about allowing industry to build up its reserves by taking less income tax from them and in that way to provide more capital for themselves.  That is one way of looking at the matter but in a country like this which is trying to build up its industries, we should really encourage them the other way. We are of course taking only 40 per cent. and the industry has 60 per cent. of its profits with which to do what it likes.  With corporation profits tax and income tax, we take 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties is that we are not getting enough savings; we are not getting enough investment in industry and in public issues generally.  The best way to encourage this is that shareholders in existing industries should get their full dividend and have the money available to put into other industries, or build up new industries, as well as supporting extra issues for any existing industries.  The system of a different rate of tax on distributed and undistributed profits has been tried in other countries and generally it has not proved to be very successful. We have not tried it here and in the circumstances I do not think that we should try it at the moment.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to Senator Murphy's point, it is true of course <Col N="631" /> that if a worker, whether a wage or a salary earner, gets more money, he will pay more, in proportion, in income tax than he was paying before. The whole system is graded in that way.  The person who gets a small salary pays a small percentage of income tax and the person who gets a large salary pays a higher percentage and it is quite right that it should be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Minister's point in regard to unearned or earned income.  Savings only come out of earned money and sometimes a very big sacrifice has to be made to build up savings which, when invested, will bring in an income. Money earned in that way is just as much income as a weekly income.  I can never see the differential.  We all want to encourage savings and investment. It seems to me that people with unearned income of that kind should pay less than people who take their money every week and never put anything away.  I do not see the force of the differential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have been mistaken.  I thought the Senator had in mind the differential between distributed and undistributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one point; the other was earned and unearned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points were raised by the Minister in his reply.  He seemed to misunderstand my purpose in speaking about compensating people through income tax for what they spent on medical or legal fees.  If a person has to pay 200 guineas to a surgeon for an operation, he will, first of all, save to pay income tax on, say, a notional sum of 300 guineas.  He will have to pay about 100 guineas in income tax and then pay the other 200 guineas to the surgeon who has to pay income tax on the 200 guineas.  Perhaps he pays 70 guineas and he has 130 guineas left. The surgeon perhaps gets into legal difficulties and calls in legal aid.  He pays that 130 guineas and the lawyer returns it and pays about 50 guineas income tax, so there are 80 guineas <Col N="632" /> left.  That is a case not of single or double taxation, but, in many cases, treble or quadruple taxation.  Already this country is moving into line with other countries with double taxation agreements, so that when you earn an income in one country, you do not pay double taxation because you pay tax in the country in which you earn it and not in your home country.  That was one point.</P>
      <P>The other point is that the Minister says that increasing the personal allowance has a high priority and is something very desirable.  I would suggest to the Minister that had he increased the standard rate of income tax from 6/4 to 6/6 or 6/7, with the extra 2d. or 3d., he could have given a very substantial boost to the personal allowance.  That would have achieved a very desirable shift in real income from the single classes to the married and family classes.  The figures which Senator Murphy gave were very compelling.  They showed a failure to adjust his allowance into line with the recent income increase which actually gave much more of an increase to the single person than to the married people with families.  I do not think that is right.  It is something that should be corrected at the first possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 2 to 4, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the duty on tobacco, the Minister has created a precedent this year which I think is unparalleled.  He is designating 1d. of the increase towards a specific purpose, that specific purpose being to provide for the levy that has been imposed on the dairy farmers for the marketing of their dairy produce.  It does not require any knowledge of economics or finance to know that that levy was absolutely inevitable.  Its inevitability was known well ahead of the Budget, and consequently I am at a loss to know why provision was not made <Col N="633" /> for it in the Budget proper.  Be that as it may, a headline has been set in that a precedent has been created for designating a certain increase for a specific purpose.</P>
      <P>Perhaps some of us who pay high taxation would feel happier if we knew that some of the increase was specifically marked for some very laudable purpose.  I think none of us would have objected to 2d. or 3d. on the standard rate of income tax this year, if it were designated as being for increasing the allowances of the old age pensioners or the other suffering sections of the community, or perhaps if it were used to make the payments to the old age pensioners go back to 1st November rather than 1st August next. However, I shall have an opportunity of raising that again at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this section, I fail to see how it can be pointed out that the total taxation now on tobacco is in two parts.  The Minister brought in what might be termed a supplementary Budget for the purpose of giving an increase of 1d. to the milk producers.  Of course the milk producers do not get any increase in the price of milk.  That needs to be corrected and the milk producers have corrected it.  A penny was taken by the Government from the milk producers to finance Bord Bainne and there was a revolt against it, and rightly so.  The Government put 1d. on tobacco and cigarettes and termed it an increase for the milk producers. Actually, what happened is that they got back 1d. and milk is still the same price to the producers.  I would not like to use the word &ldquo;juggling&rdquo; but the method adopted and the colour given to it taste of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be contended that the milk producers got an increase of 1d. per gallon but actually they are getting the same price they got last year.  Of course it could be explained that they are asked to pay 1d. levy to finance Bord Bainne.  Other bodies have been set up by the Government and financed out of general taxation.  It can be contended that various bodies were set up from time to time to deal with special problems.  This body was set up to <Col N="634" /> deal with the special problems of the dairying industry and it may be asked who other should pay for it than the section of the community who were benefiting by the setting up of the Board.</P>
    <P>That could be contended but that is not generally done.  In general, Government policy is that various sections of the community benefit from time to time through some particular organisation which is set up for them but they are not specially levied.  In this case, those who enjoy the pleasure of taking a smoke were levied again to give back the penny.  It was called an increase but I think that was a wrong interpretation.  It cannot be disputed that they are still in receipt of the same income for their milk as they had previously.  It might be said we are putting a special levy on tobacco and cigarettes in general so as to finance the new board.  That could be contended.  It would be a fair way of describing it and it would be easier to understand it as against the method adopted by the Minister &mdash; and of course, it has imposed definite hardship.</P>
    <P>The poor man is entitled to smoke if he likes.  To smoke is part of what he desires.  Whilst tobacco and cigarettes in general may be taken as a luxury &mdash; some people say it is a type of practice that should be curtailed from a medical point of view, and so on &mdash; it could equally be contended that it is part of the poor man's way of living.  It is a form of entertainment. He enjoys his smoke and he should have it.  He is certainly taxed very heavily already, and was previous to the Supplementary Budget which the Minister brought in.  His income did not change.</P>
    <P>The unemployed man is in receipt of the same social welfare benefits which means that his standard has reduced as a result of the increase in the price of cigarettes.  Reading the Government's version of it, some people may think that the milk producer did receive an increase in the price.  Some people seem to think that. Actually, the price has remained the same because he is paying one penny towards an organisation, which he did <Col N="635" /> not have to pay before.  The result is that his total income, after paying the penny still remains the same for the milk.  If it were dealt with by way of general taxation and dealt with in the first Budget, then none of this confusion would have arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this section, as amended since the Bill was first introduced, discloses a rather undesirable trend in Government policy or in lack of Government policy.  As I understand it, the Budget, implemented by the Finance Act, makes provision for general Government spending and policy during the following 12 months.  Now, when the Budget was introduced, it must have been apparent to the Minister and his advisers that the Government-sponsored board, An Bord Bainne, proposed to levy 1d. per gallon on milk supplied to the creameries.  Yet, apparently, the Minister made no provision for that levy in his Budget.  He did increase the tax on tobacco and cigarettes, for general Government expenditure. A very short time after the introduction of the Budget, An Bord Bainne came along with this levy of 1d. per gallon on milk.  There were protests all over the country but the Government stood firm for a few days at any rate.  They said they did not propose to compensate the farmer for that levy by An Bord Bainne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not do it. The Minister for Agriculture, I understand, took the firm stand that the levy would remain; that it was not any Government business, and that they did not propose to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the pressure apparently from the farming community became so strong that the Government had to yield.  Then the most extraordinary thing happened.  The Government decided to restore &mdash; not increase the price of milk, for that did not happen &mdash; the 1d. levy.  In order to do that, they increased the price of 20 cigarettes by a further 1d.  But they <Col N="636" /> did it in an extraordinary way; they did it by a Government Order.  They introduced a Supplementary Budget a very short time after the annual Budget, through the instrumentality of a Government Order, which, indeed, was never intended for that sort of thing.</P>
      <P>That Government Order, as I understand it, was provided so that the Government and the Minister could impose a tax or a customs duty at very short notice and thus prevent the dumping of goods here, or that sort of thing.  It certainly was never intended as machinery to be used to provide finance for the Government or to raise taxation.  I say that that was very undesirable.  It sets a bad precedent. It shows that the Government and the Minister, really, do not know their own minds on taxation from one week to another.  It is undesirable in another respect.  It designates the purpose for which this 1d. on 20 cigarettes is to be used.  It is calculated to make one section of the community resentful of a benefit given to another section.</P>
      <P>Within days of the price of cigarettes being raised by 1d. for 20, I heard &mdash; and I believe it &mdash; of a man who went into a shop, asked for 20 cigarettes and gave 3/6d. and 1d. and said: &ldquo;That is for the cigarettes and here is a penny for the milk.&rdquo;  I say that that is bad.  It is calculated to create resentment in the minds of the town dwellers and the masses of the people on a weekly income against the farmers who are the real producers of wealth in this country.  I certainly think that is an undesirable precedent which should not be followed by this or any Government in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to follow the line of reasoning of some of the speakers on the opposite side of the House.  They talk about the restoration of the 1d. per gallon on the price of milk.  At the same time, we have not heard from them whether they are in favour of that or not.  If they are not, then where would the money be got?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the last speaker, this restoration of 1d. in the price of the gallon of milk delivered at the creameries has been done by Government decree.  That is not the case.  It <Col N="637" /> is enshrined in the Second Schedule to the Bill and this attempt to try to persuade the people that the Government are doing something behind their backs is deplorable.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to pressure having been brought to bear on the Government to restore the penny on the price of the gallon of milk.  Is there anything wrong with the Government always being ready to listen to representations from various sections of the people, whether the farming class or other classes of the community?  Instead of the Government being condemned, as some of the people try to condemn them for this action, they should be applauded. As regards the penny on the gallon of milk, everybody knows it was envisaged in legislation which we had before us some time ago.  It was pointed out that the expenses of An Bord Bainne would have to be borne by the industry itself.  There is nothing wrong with that.  From my knowledge of the country and the operations of the agricultural community, any reasonable member of that section will admit that this Government have not done badly with the farming community, especially the dairying section of the farming community. Senator Quinlan pointed out that this earmarking of a certain amount of money for a certain purpose was unprecedented.  It certainly is not.  In other budgets Ministers for Finance have told the people what certain moneys were being devoted to. Even the Book of Estimates, which is published long before the Financial Statement is made, sets out various heads of expenditure.  Therefore, I can see nothing wrong with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One Senator said he did not want to use the word &ldquo;juggling.&rdquo; I should like to deal with the juggling that is going on here on this issue.  Two years ago there was a very general desire amongst all Parties to set up marketing boards, and in the case of milk a Committee was set up representative principally of milk producers and a few others.  They put up heads of a Bill to bring this Milk Marketing Board into operation.  The Minister brought that Bill before the Dáil and <Col N="638" /> the Seanad and every Party approved of it.  There was not one single vote against it at any Stage in either House. In that Bill it was laid down that the Milk Marketing Board would have to provide one-third of the cost of export subsidy by way of levy.  There is no doubt about that.  That was done by every Party and there was no dissentient. When it came to the point where the Milk Marketing Board imposed a levy of one penny, then at that stage certain parties just &ldquo;ratted&rdquo; and began finding fault.  The Minister for Agriculture, as a decent, honest man, stood by the Board.</P>

      <P>He stood by them all the time on the levy and he never departed from that.  Now he is being attacked by certain people for standing by the Board in doing what was their duty and what they had to do according to law.  The parties who ratted on that have not got very much to be proud of and they can juggle with words as much as they like.  I did not know that would be done in that way or for that amount.  I may have had my opinion that this Board would have to impose a levy but if I had come before the Dáil and Seanad before they had made a decision and said &ldquo;I am providing £1,000,000 to put 1d. levy on the milk,&rdquo; I know what I would have been told. I would have been told that they were merely a rubber stamp and that they had come along after I had taken a decision.  I could not say beforehand what they would do when the Budget was brought in.  Then, when they did take that decision, the argument at that time in the Dáil and Seanad was that the Board should not have done that but the Minister for Agriculture said they were in the right in doing it. As a matter of fact, they could do nothing else under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, of course, the matter arose that the Government had to consider whether it was fair to ask the dairy farmers to suffer a loss of 1d. per gallon or not.  I should like to say this: I do not know if any member of the Government ever said that the milk producer was getting 1d. more as a result of what we were doing. <Col N="639" /> I made it plain that I wanted to bring them back to where they were before the reduction was made.  I never claimed they were getting 1d. more and I do not know that anybody on my side claimed that either.  The Government thought it unfair, when most classes in the community were getting more by way of remuneration or whatever it may be, to ask the farmers to suffer a loss compared with last year and we decided to give them a subsidy of 1d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>Having decided that, I said to the Government that the Budget was tightly drawn in my opinion and that we had not provided for anything like this and that I thought that this was going to unbalance our Budget &mdash; I was not objecting to it being done &mdash; and that we would have to increase taxation to meet it.  They agreed to that. How could I come before the Dáil with extra taxation without being accused of designating certain tax for the increase in the price of milk? I do not see how I could avoid it. I did not say it was going to be designated.  I said the Budget would be unbalanced and that I would like more taxation to balance it again.</P>
    <P>As every Senator knows, if I buy a packet of cigarettes, as I did to-day, and pay an extra penny for them, that penny is not traced the whole way back to the farmer.  It goes into the Exchequer and the farmer gets the penny from the Exchequer.  There was no designation except in so far as this propaganda refers to designation. The next point is that I was told by some Senators, as I was told in the Dáil, that it was done in an irregular fashion.  Well, you could argue that.  That is of no consequence whatever.  It is a very small point.  It was done on a certain day and two days afterwards, it came to the Dáil for discussion.  It was done because, as I explained in the Dáil, it was very convenient.  Maybe that is not a sufficient defence for what we did, but I cannot see that it is a very important matter in what way the 1d. was put on, when it was brought before the Dáil within two days for <Col N="640" /> discussion, was discussed both on Second Stage and Committee Stage, and has now come for discussion here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <P>The Minister has stated that not a single vote was cast against Bord Bainne in this House and that, therefore, anyone who says anything now is in the wrong.  That is not a fact.  There was a general vote, a unanimous vote both in this House and the other, approving the principle of a dairy marketing board, but when it came down to details, we voted very strongly on amendments, pressed them through the Division Lobby and were beaten.  One of the amendments I personally proposed was for the removal of a fixed limit on the amount the board could raise by levy.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we challenged very strongly the composition of Bord Bainne.  We named many persons who should have been <i>ex officio</i> members, including members of the co-operative movement. We were again beaten.  I do not think the Minister is quite right in chiding us if we dare to voice our opinion on this.  We have not much to be proud of.  In fact, when the record of the Committee Stage of the debate on Bord Bainne is gone back on in four or five years' time, I think it will be found to be a case of seeing that the minority were right, as they very often are.</P>
      <P>We should all be imbued with a deep sense of social justice in this country and elsewhere.  Social justice surely calls for giving some of the benefits of the eighth round of wage increases to the most underpaid and hardest working section of our community, the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister failed to face up to his responsibilities in the Budget when he left the price of milk static and as it was before the eighth round of wage increases.  I do not know whether I am exceptional, but if I had £8 a week and got £9 a week, I would expect that I would have to pay some of the increase to every one I have to pay. I would not expect my dairy produce to come in at the same price as it did before.  If the Minister had made the proper adjustment in the price of milk <Col N="641" /> and milk products, there would not be any necessity whatsoever to have to deal with them at this stage.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has no control over the <i>Irish Press</i> but he may have seen the heading across the front page which said: &ldquo;Highest Milk Price Ever.&rdquo;  Perhaps when they come to deal with increases under another Bill the heading will be: &ldquo;Highest Pay Ever for Judges.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow part of the Minister's reply to the points raised.  Apparently he resents the points which have been made.  He said that certain people in the Dáil ratted on the decision to stand over Bord Bainne.  Certain people in the Dáil protested and protested loudly against the decision to reduce the price of milk supplied to the creameries by the farmers by 1d. per gallon.  Call it what you like, that is what happened. Apparently the Minister thinks that was wrong and that they should not have protested.  He calls it by the objectionable name of &ldquo;ratting.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Opposition ratted on Bord Bainne, the Government Party in the Dáil ratted on the same decision within a matter of weeks because they accepted the arguments and the protests in the Dáil and restored the 1d. a gallon.  I do not know about juggling with figures, but certainly it is juggling with words if the Minister tries to draw a distinction between the protests made by the Opposition in the Dáil when the price of milk was reduced by 1d. a gallon and the acceptance of that argument by the Government a very short time later.</P>

      <P>This section removes completely the entertainments duty on cinemas and dance halls.  To my mind, this is by far the worst provision in the Finance Bill.  It is generally admitted that, by and large, the young people today have far more spending money than ever before.  We <Col N="642" /> see dance halls all over the country from Ballyshannon to Cork with cars parked for 100 yards on both sides, employing bands which are generally assessed by the number of miles they had to come to the dance hall.  A band may be playing in Mitchelstown one night, in Dublin another night, in Ballyshannon another night, and in Skibbereen another night.  They are continually on the go.</P>
      <P>When we see such a situation, surely we must recognise that far too much money is being spent by the teenage and unmarried groups on entertainment. It is unbelievable that the Government would at this juncture remove the tax on the dance halls.  I should have thought that they could have trebled it without doing an injustice to anyone.  If the proceeds were given as an extra 2/6 to the old age pensioners or some of our other deserving classes, it would have been very much a step in the right direction.  The Government have gone in the opposite direction to the British Government who in their last Budget got an increase in taxation solely by taxing those sources.  I may say that the younger section of the community never had so much money and the young married classes never had it so tough.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I think this section is in every way a very bad section. Admittedly, there may have been some case for the cinemas, due to the advent of television, which we were assured would not cost anything, but here we are paying the first instalment by a remission of the tax on cinemas. In any case, that should have been dealt with separately.  I wish to be recorded as dissenting very strongly from this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct a few of the points made by the Senator.  The British removed the entertainment tax on cinemas a couple of years ago and we are removing it from October next.  A number of cinemas have already closed.  I received deputations not only from the people concerned but from their trade unions who told me a very pitiful story of the number of people who were losing their employment with the <Col N="643" /> cinemas.  It was a dwindling tax and it will be very difficult for the cinemas to survive.  I think we should not have to take the blame if they have to close and, as I say, some of them have closed already.  I decided that I should ask the Government to agree to take this tax off which they did.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, the British never had a dancehall tax.  They certainly have not got one now.  We forfeited £40,000 by the remission of the dancehall tax.  I know that Senators and Deputies are making the argument that we could have given another 2/6 to the old age pensioners.  If we got £1,000,000 from the dancehall tax, I would agree and I would not have taken it off.  With £40,000, we could only have given a couple of pence to the old age pensioners.  It would take £1,000,000 to give them 2/6 and £40,000 would not go very far.  It would not pay.  It would be the only entertainment tax levied now, if we took off the cinema tax.  It certainly would not pay to keep the organisation run by the Revenue Commissioners for this purpose of entertainment tax to look after dances alone.  There will be a fairly substantial saving in tax. I always thought it a very demoralising tax for officials.  They come to a dance.  They often feel they are not told the truth about the numbers there. They count the people.  I need not tell you that they are offered entertainment. To give them their due, they resist it.  But it is a very demoralising thing.  I always think it a very demoralising tax that is not worth collecting. That is the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a <Col N="644" /> few words in a general way on this section.  The provision to reduce the tax on tractors from £8 to £2 10s. is a move in the right direction and is welcomed by all concerned.  However, the regulations restricting the use of these tractors by farmers should be looked into.  I am not in a position to discuss it in detail here and my remarks will be only general.</P>
      <P>If the regulations are strictly enforced, as they stand at the moment, there are very many things which an ordinary individual would regard as agriculture for which the farmer cannot use his tractor.  For example, I do not think he can cut down a tree on his farm, cut it into logs and bring those logs into town and sell them on a £2 10s. licence.  I say, subject to correction, that, if he does that, he will be guilty of an offence and leave himself open to a prosecution and a licence tax at the rate of £31 10s. These regulations should be looked into with a view to relaxing them and bringing them into line with the requirements of a farmer so that he will now be enabled to use his tractor for the purpose for which he previously used his horse and cart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick.  As well as that, some of these restrictions are quite ridiculous.  Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned logs.  As I see it, the farmer can cut down a tree and take it to the sawmill to be cut into boards but he cannot bring home the boards.  Subsection (3) of Section 9 reads:</P>
      <P>The appropriate repayments shall be made having regard to the foregoing provisions of this section and repayment shall be made in accordance with such directions as shall be made by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say when these repayments are likely to be made or what form they will take?  The majority of farmers using an £8 tax tractor have paid their tax since January last.  They will now expect a repayment before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal with the last point first.  No repayment, of <Col N="645" /> course, could be made until the Bill is passed but then the repayment will be made on making application to the licensing authority, the county council concerned, which will be authorised to make the repayment.  There will not be any difficulty about that.</P>
      <P>The case raised by Senator Fitzpatrick is rather a borderline one, but I am inclined to agree with him that it would not be allowed.  If the person concerned felled the tree, cut it into logs and brought the logs into town to sell them there, I think that would be outside the Bill.  On the other hand, to bring back the boards from a sawmill for his own use would be all right but if they were for sale it would be a different matter.  The Minister for Local Government has more to do with this.  I do not know much about the details or what is behind them.  I shall certainly mention this to him.  He has excluded fuel from what can be done: I do not know why. Perhaps there is some idea there that the tractor might be used more by a man in business than in farming, if fuel haulage were allowed.  I do not know, but that might be the idea.  I shall mention that point to him.</P>
      <P>Quite a lot of things are allowed. As a matter of fact, it was brought in that a farmer could bring in milk for his neighbour to the creamery, even if paid.  Also, he could bring cattle to the market&mdash;within certain limits&mdash; even if paid.  Of course, he can do everything for his own farm.  I am told that our conditions are more liberal than those in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  There is no reason why they should not be more liberal still, so I shall bring the point to the Minister's attention.</P>

It is an interesting point. Very often it is said that private enterprise is not making its contribution to the State and that the State bodies are really carrying the burden. It seems to me that very often these private enterprises, Guinness, and so on, are overlooked in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to make a distinction between revenue itself and protective duties.  Revenue duties are in a special class, like intoxicating liquor, tobacco, petrol and so on. The duties there are much heavier than if put on for protective purposes. When you come to the protective duties, where you might make a better comparison between private enterprise and the State bodies, I am afraid I could not answer the Senator's question straight off except to say that, generally speaking, the State companies are not making very big profits.</P>

      <P>Section 11 increases the allowance from one-fifth to two-fifths for capital expenditure incurred in an effort to prepare for the Common Market conditions and for the investment that would be required in that.  As the Minister is thinking along those lines, and quite rightly so, perhaps I might suggest to him that there are other types of capital expenditure required, that is, expenditure by individuals in equipping themselves to play a better part in the future.  I have in mind, specifically, many cases of young men who have borrowed very substantial sums for the purpose of having themselves trained in the university or elsewhere, and then paying the capital and the interest back over a number of years after qualifying. <Col N="647" /> Would it be possible to exempt such payments in any way for income tax purposes and give some inducement to such people who are so willing and anxious to provide for themselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like this idea of charging interest on unpaid income tax because the only people who can be caught are the employers. You could say the employer had to deduct it from his employees but it does not work out that way in all cases.  It often works out differently where a firm is not doing well.  The firm might be finding it hard to pay its way and to pay its employees and they might overlook stopping income tax, or collecting it after three months to send it away.  Greater concessions should be given where tax is due.</P>
      <P>Before the introduction of P.A.Y.E., the Government could wait for millions of pounds in the year and yet not charge any interest on what was due.  As a matter of fact, all a person had to do, if he owed tax, was to take the boat to England and leave his tax bill behind him.  He could come back after a few years and perhaps not be caught at all.  An employer cannot do that and I would ask the Minister not to press for interest on tax, especially where a person would have a sufficient reason for delay in payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one part of this section which, it seems to me, could lead to a certain amount of hardship. There are a number of people living on fixed interest from investments, <Col N="648" /> some of their investments being in British securities.  Such people would find in most cases, unless their investments are in British Government stock, British tax deducted from their income at source.  The practice always had been that in those cases they pay their tax in this country when they have got back the British tax.  They return the British tax on the K.1. form.  It could be that in such cases widows living on fixed incomes, children living on trust funds, and people of that kind, would for a year be unable to claim the British tax from British investments and be liable for Irish tax.  If Irish tax were charged on the amount outstanding, it would lead to a certain hardship, particularly where there is a small income for comparatively poor people.  I should like to ask the Minister to give some undertaking to the House that in cases of that kind the interest will not in practice be charged by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Senator McAuliffe's point is concerned, I just want to explain that employees are now covered by P.A.Y.E. and they give us no trouble in regard to arrears. The arrears are deducted from the wage or salary and returned by the employer by the middle of the following month.  The employer is subject, if he does not return it, but I do not think any employer can complain about that because the money is in his hands and he has only to write a cheque.  This would only apply to Schedule D payers, those who are working for themselves, who are not employed by another person or who are receiving an income from some other source.  They, of course, could delay in paying up and it is very unfair to Schedule E payers because not only are they paying promptly but in advance from 1st of January to the end of December.  It is unfair, then, that other people should be allowed to delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, the commission is not very severe.  There is no interest charged until it is three months overdue. Also, no interest is charged so long as there are appeals or anything of that nature pending.  It is only when the matter is settled, when the <Col N="649" /> Revenue Commissioners have made the final assessment and say that a particular amount is due, then three months from that date, and from 1st of January, if there is no argument about it, it is payable.  If they do not pay, six per cent. is charged on the amount outstanding.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Ross's point, I do not think there is any great hardship there because if a certain amount of tax has been deducted from income received from British investments, if the person concerned gives verified particulars to the Revenue Commissioners they will allow that as a credit in his payment of income tax here, even though he has not got it and it takes some little time to come.  He does not suffer in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolutely correct now &mdash; that if a person such as Senator Ross mentioned has filled up the K.1 form, then once that goes to the inspector and he knows that there is a claim against the British, this section will not arise; that is to say, he cannot be mulcted in Irish tax before he gets the British refund?

      <P>This section repeals the duty on certain estates over <Col N="651" /> five acres bought by non-citizens.  This raises the question of the considerable amount of uneasiness felt throughout the country at the amount of land being bought by non-nationals.  The figures given in Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Lands in reply to Deputy Lynch of Waterford are really frightening. The statistics show that, during the nine-month period from August 1st, 1961, until May 9th, 1962, a total of 48 transactions took place involving 3,800 acres on which stamp duty of 25 per cent. was paid.  A further 43 transactions involving 531 acres were exempt from the 25 per cent. stamp duty, and a further 12 were also exempt.  There were other transactions involving 1,100 acres.  In all about 5,500 acres, of which the Minister is aware, were brought in that period.</P>
      <P>We all know of the many subterfuges, such as non-existent companies, etc., which are employed to transfer land to foreign ownership and to evade taxation under this section.  A figure of 5,500 acres in nine months represents 7,500 acres per annum.  What does that mean?  It means 200 fewer congests settled.  That is one way of looking at it.  Another way of looking at it is from the point of view of how much land comes on the market each year.  The best estimate we can make is, I think, somewhere around 50,000 acres to 75,000 acres.  At present between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. is bought by non-nationals.  That is clearly a danger signal to us especially as such purchases are gaining momentum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very distressed by the complacency with which the leader writers in some of our national newspapers accept the fact that, when the Common Market prevails, anyone can buy anything he wishes here.  Those of us who raise a query, or who try to caution against that, are held out as being so stupid that we cannot read the provisions of the Treaty of Rome. Our European colleagues, whom we hope to join, are not stupid either; it looks now as if there are sound provisions coming in which will require that, before any non-national can buy land in any region, he will have to <Col N="652" /> have worked in that region for at least two years.  I hope that provision comes.  It will alleviate and allay some of the anxiety some of us feel.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to regard this matter seriously and to take steps to ensure that the subterfuges in relation to transfers are tracked down and prevented from operating.</P>
    <P>We must realise that 25 per cent. on the cost of Irish land at present is a mere bagatelle when compared with the price prevailing in Europe.  Land there is at least double the price it is here and a 25 per cent. duty here means very little.  I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously either a complete embargo, such as prevails in Denmark and other places, or the raising of this figure to a level which will bring the price of land here, that is, the price of land plus tax, to a level which will make it comparable with the price prevailing in Europe. Otherwise we shall not have any protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Senator misunderstands this section.  It is related really to the local taxation account and not to the buying of land by foreigners.  However, that does not matter.  I am not finding fault with the Senator for raising the issue because it has given many of us food for thought.  This whole question of buying land is an extremely difficult one with which to deal.  We were working under the impression for the past few years that if we entered the Common Market there would be no restrictions at all.  If, however, the Senator is right in what he says it will be easier to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to minimise the importance of this issue at all and I should like to say that, under the Act passed last year, wherever an application is made for mitigation of the duty and the amount of land involved is over five acres, the application is sent to the Land Commission for recommendation, and it then comes to me. I do not know if I have seen a fair sample because I see only the ones where the application for mitigation applies.  If it does not apply, I have no record.  But in the cases where mitigation applied, for the most part <Col N="653" /> the land was not what one one would call good agricultural land.  It was more suitable for forestry, shooting rights and that type of thing.  I think a good part of the acreage could be classed as that type of land.  As I say, I do not want to minimise the problem.  There is a problem and we must at least keep an eye on the situation until we see what we can do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the Minister's assurance confirming the fact that there will not be absolute free sale of land within the Common Market and that the two years' residence requirement, or some other requirement, will prevail.  The Minister suggested that the cases which came before him were only cases of snipe land or bad land.  Quite obviously, this would be one of the main grounds on which the Minister would be approached for a mitigation of the tax.  I should like if the Minister could comment on the adequacy of the 25 per cent. tax as a deterrent in those cases which have not come before him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> In lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;1st day of November, 1961&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1st day of August, 1962&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This recommendation is designed to express again the view I advanced on the Second Stage.  It is an expression of disappointment with the Government's proposal to give salary increases of from 10½ to 17½ per cent. to the judges as from 1st November last and, out of the same pocket, to give an increase of 8?rd per cent. to old age pensioners as from 1st August next. The Minister, in replying to the debate on the Second Stage, argued it was traditional that the judges' salaries were adjusted by approximately the same percentage&mdash;I do not know if those were his exact words&mdash;and from the same date as the salaries of the higher paid officials of the Civil Service were adjusted.  In other words, whenever there is a salary increase in the Civil Service and it finds its way, as it does normally, up to the higher paid officials, the judges can expect a similar increase from the same date.  I do not know if that is quite correct.  It did not seem to tally with what was said earlier in the debate in regard to the infrequency of the increases in salary of the judges.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clear my mind on this matter&mdash;whether it is, in fact, traditional that judges get the same percentage increase and from the same date as civil servants.  If that is so, I certainly think it is a good argument but it will still leave the objection I have to the difference in approach to the judges and, I suppose, the civil servants, if they are to be regarded as part of it, and to the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>As I explained on the last occasion, if we in the Labour Party put down a recommendation proposing that the increase for the old age pensioners and the other social welfare classes should be improved; that it should be something different from what is proposed by the Government, such a recommendation would be out of order. Neither, obviously, can we vote against the increase proposed for the old age pensioners and the social welfare recipients.  We cannot oppose it.  There is only one way in which we can show <Col N="655" /> the measure of our disgust at the way these classes are treated.  We are not against adjustments in the salaries of Judges but we want to show our disgust at the different treatment meted out to one section of the community as against another.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to confirm, as I understood him to say when replying on the Second Reading, that it was traditional that the Judges got the same percentage salary increases and from the same date as the civil servants.  If that is so, I am still puzzled.  I should imagine that, if there were any difference in the amount, the percentage increase for the civil servants would taper off as the salary itself increased.  Here, on the other hand, I think the biggest increase is for the highest paid judge.  I think that is correct.  Without having the exact figure before me, I think the increase of 17½ per cent., covered by this Bill, is for the highest paid judge.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading, I asked the Minister why the payments under this Bill were to be back-dated. He gave me the answer that the back-dating was related to the date on which the higher civil servants were getting their increases.  I accept what the Minister said, without question.  Nevertheless, it does seem to me to be bad that we should make increased payments to one section of the community as of one date and to another section of the community as of another date.  That is the only point in this whole Bill with which I am in disagreement but, because of that, I feel I must support this recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to support what my colleague, Senator Murphy, has said in this matter and to add that I really cannot understand why the payment to the judges should be retrospective.  Surely there was no urgency in their case whereas, in the case of the old age pensioners, there is definite urgency?  To ask these people to wait until August does impose grave hardship on them.  After all, we realise that many of them are suffering from <Col N="656" /> malnutrition.  A large number of them have inadequate clothing and most of them live in very bad housing conditions. I should like the Minister to give further consideration to that aspect.  It certainly is urgent to pay the old age pensioners but there is definitely no urgency about paying this increase to the judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>Before putting down my recommendation, I must confess I found myself in considerable difficulty, not any difficulty in regard to principles but the difficulty of trying to work it out within the confines of my mind, without consulting anybody. Eventually, I reached a conclusion whereby I found myself forced to put down this recommendation.  I must say there were times during these internal deliberations, if I might so describe them, when I was tempted to consult the people directly interested in the subject matter of this amendment, that is, existing judiciary and one person who as far as I know would be affected by it.  I hope the arguments I propose to adduce in favour of the recommendation will come as a disappointment to people who might be expecting sharp political criticism from me, or criticism of any particular person or persons on political grounds.</P>
      <P>That is furthermost from my mind. I find myself, in arguing for this recommendation, in a triple capacity and I do not know from which element of capacity derives my first and primary duty.  I am speaking, first of all, as a citizen of the State; secondly, as a member of Seanad Éireann; and thirdly, as a practising lawyer in the courts presided over by the people to whom I shall be referring.  I shall be referring also to a person who presided over the Supreme Court until last November, during all the years of my practice.</P>
      <P>I found myself disturbed, as indeed were many other members of the legal profession as well as thinking people in the rest of the community who are not members of the legal profession, by the suggestion that this Bill should be back-dated to November 1st, in order to bring in the Chief Justice, Mr. Conor Maguire, who retired in December last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> One meets with the distasteful suggestion from members of the public from time to time, and since this Bill was first introduced in Dáil Éireann, that a man after so long a period divorced from the ordinary life of the nation, first, in the High Court as President and later, as Chief Justice, should still be so close to the Executive that he would merit consideration in a Bill of this kind and that back-dating is specifically for him.  Curiously enough, while the whole matter is open to suspicion, I personally do not fully accept that to be the case.  That is one of the reasons I have put down my recommendation, in order to clarify the position.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this opportunity, as a person practising, shall we say, a certain brand of politics, to say that not alone have I never heard or seen, expressly or impliedly, any member of the judiciary, irrespective of the dispensation under which he was appointed, showing any political fangs, if I may so describe them, from the Bench from the very moment he sat.  It must be said further that the ex-Chief Justice, Mr. Conor Maguire, was exemplary in that regard.  Not alone that, but he had the human capacity of making the most timid and inexperienced junior counsel feel like a Costello, a Lavery, a MacBride, or a Murnaghan, in his presence for the first time.  That was no mean achievement and it was certainly a quality that was respected and admired by the members of the Bar who practised before him.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why I think the date should be altered in this Bill from 1st November to 1st January, because it would be a pity that the name of a man honoured in practice and honoured in presiding over our principal court should be bandied about by members of the public at any level and that a reputation that stood untarnished last December should now be put into the &ldquo;handful of silver&rdquo; class.  &ldquo;Who steals my purse steals trash&rdquo;&mdash;reputations are far more important.  I am quite certain, while I have not consulted either, although gravely tempted <Col N="658" /> to do so, that the existing judiciary and the retired Chief Justice would not have any great objection to having their names removed from gossip by my recommendation being allowed to go through.  I would urge the Minister to do so in the interests of the independence of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking of the present judiciary; I am speaking of a judiciary which is an establishment and which will be there long after we have all gone.  I am speaking in favour of the independence which must be there, not as a matter of theory, or of some kind of veiled notion in the mind of the people.  It must be established in the mind of the people that our judiciary are independent, that they are beyond all bribes, that their integrity is such that irrespective of the time of their appointment, or the source from which it came, they continue to administer the law fairly for all men and that the law is the same for all persons coming before them.</P>
    <P>Our judiciary&mdash;as indeed the judiciary in any country must be&mdash;are a bulwark between the Executive and the Legislature that might bring in some legislation directed inadvertently towards an attack upon the liberty of the subject, not only in theory but established fully in the minds and hearts of our people.  Our judiciary in so short a time in this infant State, having regard to the fact that it is a State born out of revolution and, shall I say, impeded in its infant toddlings by fraternal dispute&mdash;I shall not put it any more strongly&mdash;have reached the stage of independence, which indeed obtained from the beginning, that must be the admiration of the whole world. Two months' salary or two months' pension might be regarded as a small thing, but it is a big thing if it will establish or re-establish in the minds of our people the principle that our judiciary are entirely divorced from the political scene and do not come into consideration in that regard.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is no case for linking them with the civil servants for the reason that the judges in their memorandum submitted to the Select Committee&mdash;and I am quoting from <Col N="659" /> the quotation in the Seanad Debates of 11th July, 1962, at column 612&mdash; said:</P>
    <P>We wish to make it plain that we do not claim any right to have our salaries increased from time to time on account of any temporary increase in the cost of living, whether reckoned by reference to the index figure or otherwise.</P>
    <P>There I think the case for linking it with the civil servants falls down on the claim of the judges themselves.  The Minister would do well to reconsider this matter and, if necessary, hold appropriate consultations with those directly concerned, and thereby ascertain whether or not in their view, in his view, and in the Government's view, a signal service would not be done to the independence&mdash;and to re-establishing the independence&mdash;of our judiciary by making this date 1st January, 1962.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed increases provided for in this Bill are not, we have been told, increases to meet the cost of living, nor are they increases to provide the members of the judiciary with adequate salaries to enable them to live decently or to maintain a decent standard of living. In my opinion, only if these proposed increases were what I could call cost of living increases could retrospection be justified.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is any real answer to say that the date provided in the Bill is identical with the date provided for the higher grades of civil servants. The judges are in a class of their own. The machinery provided for regulating the salaries of the judges is unique.  It is laid down that their salaries can be regulated only by an Act passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unique. Deputies and Senators are in the same boat, not to speak of Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>They are unique in this respect, or at least they are on their own in this respect, that the salaries of the judges cannot be reduced during their term of office. <Col N="660" /> That is provided in the Constitution. Therefore, I think there is no analogy between the salaries of the judges and the salaries of civil servants or any other employees of the State.</P>
      <P>We may be blamed for daring to mention the old age pensioners or the social welfare classes, but I think it is our bounden duty here to see to it that we do not do anything which will set up two classes in this country or anything that would suggest that there is one law for the rich and powerful, and another law for the poor and weak.</P>
      <P>Solely on the question of retrospection, we are proposing here to give increases which are not necessitated by the cost of living, which are not necessary to provide a decent or adequate standard of living for the recipients, but are rather something in the nature of a bonus or a gratuity and yet with that type of an increase we are prepared to make it retrospective to 1st November.  On the other hand, when we are dealing with the increase for the social welfare classes and the old age pensioners&mdash;which increase admittedly not enough to keep the bodies and souls of those people together and which the Minister who introduced it admits is insufficient, but tells us it is the best that could be done with the money available, the best that could be done at the moment &mdash;not only do we not make it retrospective, and not only do we not pay it from the time of the passing of the Bill under which it is made payable, but we deliberately delay it for a further six months to 1st August next.</P>
      <P>I say that is not fair play.  It is not the fair play of which the Minister has spoken.  It is a dangerous attitude to adopt and it is calculated to breed discontent between various sections of the community.  Again I think that if we cannot afford to give an increase which is absolutely necessary, if we cannot afford to give it retrospectively or pay it when the Bill was passed, we certainly should not make an increase, which is admittedly unnecessary, retrospective to 1st November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the point that in passing this Bill and making these increases retrospective, we are increasing by over £300 the pension of an individual, who <Col N="661" /> has been for many years in receipt of a very substantial salary of from £4,000 to over £5,000.  Whether or not that is intentional, it is remarkable that the retrospective date of the increase coincides approximately with the date of the resignation of that person.  That is bad example, to say the least of it.  It is wrong in principle. It is increasing these salaries and making them retrospective two short years after they had already been adjusted.  It is the shortest span between one adjustment in judges' salaries and another since the foundation of the State.  It is two-thirds shorter than any other span.</P>

      <P>I oppose this provision to make the increase retrospective on the grounds that it is giving bad example, that it will breed discontent, that it will reduce the prestige of the judiciary in the eyes of the ordinary people.  It will hold them up as a small but powerful group who can attain something that the masses of the people cannot attain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the recommendation for the reasons that were given here when we were discussing the matter on Wednesday last. It was pointed out then that other sections of the community who are in receipt of State payments&mdash;we have to class them, of course, as social welfare beneficiaries and the unemployed &mdash;cannot receive any increase in benefits until 1st August.  It was pointed out that one reason for that was that legislation was required.  That does not help.  If you plead that certain machinery must be employed in order to make the payments, you can easily <Col N="662" /> arrange that those payments can be made from 1st November last.</P>
      <P>The social welfare recipients&mdash;the old age pensioners, the unemployed or any other section&mdash;will not receive the payments until 1st August next while the judges will receive the payments from 1st November last.  They will receive increases ranging from £665 to £325 annually.  Those are the increases proposed in the figures we already have.  They are substantial increases.</P>
      <P>For the reasons already stated, we should be consistent.  If we are paying out from State funds, at least we should be consistent and make the payments from the same date in all cases. If we are to pay the judges from 1st November last, there is no reason why the social welfare recipients should not receive their payments from 1st November last rather than 1st August next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with motives that may be behind this idea of retrospection.  It has been stated, both here and in the Dáil, that 1st November has a very significant ring.  I must confess that the Minister made a very convincing case here, on Second Reading, on Wednesday night last, why we should make retrospective an increase of £13 a week on a salary of £102 a week.  While the Minister may make a very convincing case in the Oireachtas, his supporters throughout the country cannot be very grateful to him.  They will find it very difficult to make the same case at the chapel gate or in the market-square. They will find it difficult to explain how it is that a small country like this can, on the one hand, afford salaries of that kind and can increase them by £13 a week and make them retrospective for almost 12 months while, on the other hand, we have the position that the Agricultural Wages Board quite recently gave an increase for a very important section of the community of something like 10/- a week, which brings the wages of the agricultural labourer or of the Land Commission worker or of many other workers in State employment to exactly half of £13 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this recommendation.  If we must make <Col N="663" /> the increases&mdash;if they are to be made&mdash; let us be logical, let us be reasonable, let us make them from 1st August next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the case made by Senator Lindsay.  He has made a very strong, clear and cogent argument for the independence of the judiciary and for seeing that it is carefully guarded in all respects.  We all agree in this and we all pay tribute to the independence of the judiciary.  We know how much we owe to this institution.  We know that they may be the means that may be necessary to restrain at times the autocratic actions whether of Ministers or others with powers vested in them.  Consequently, we have to look on the judiciary and on the Garda Síochána as the main bulwarks of our liberties in this State.  For that reason, I support very strongly the recommendation proposed by Senator Lindsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Added to that, there is the fact that this case for retrospection is totally unconvincing.  As pointed out, it is the first time that the salaries in question have been linked together.  I was struck last week by the Minister's concern for this linking and the other disregard of the Government for other sections whose salaries are linked with the Civil Service.  If we take the universities, they too, require increases and yet we do not see any panic to introduce the Supplementary Estimate or to get them an increase on the grants made the previous year.  It is, too, a bad precedent to go back into the previous financial year and add to State expenditure, whether by Supplementary Estimate or otherwise.  I should prefer to see increases for higher civil servants and all others start from the beginning of the financial year.  Added to this we have the fact that most people in the middle-income group appreciate some back payment of money.  If such classes can appreciate a windfall, what about the most distressed class of all, the old age pensioners?  The granting retrospectively of 2/6 a week, even for a limited period of six months, would bring far more joy to <Col N="664" /> the old age pensioner than any retrospective payment would to anyone in the better-off classes.</P>
    <P>It would be a great example of social justice and of the social conscience of the Government and of the House.  Those in the lowest ranks should come first.  There is therefore, a very strong case for treating all alike.  Certainly if this provision for granting increases to the highest paid sections of the community from 1st November and for the lowest paid sections nine months afterwards, on 1st August, is social justice, I do not know where we are going.</P>

I have already appealed, and I felt sure my appeal in this House at least would have met with ready acceptance, for the comparing of like with like.  It is possible to get into all sorts of interesting side issues as to the relative positions of old age pensioners and social welfare classes, and civil servants and members of the judiciary. However, I submit to a sensible, adult Upper Chamber such as we have here, it is a completely irrelevant and erroneous form of argument.</P>
      <P>Let me take the argument that the social welfare classes procure their increase only as on and from 1st August, whereas we propose to make these judiciary salary increases retrospective to 1st November.  There is no comparison between these two.  As I have already outlined to the House, it has pretty well become traditional that with every Budget, the then Minister for Finance considers what element of the national resources he can make available to the social welfare classes and makes the necessary provision in his Budget accordingly.  Increases such as that come into effect on the following August 1st.  That is a well-settled pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might as well put forward this argument: the eighth round of salary and wage increases which took place in 1961 was a sharing by all classes in the increased national income which had taken place; I could say that that sharing in that increase in national <Col N="665" /> income on the part of the social welfare classes took place in the Budget of 1961 and that they got whatever their proportion was of the increased national income as from August, 1961. I could argue that if I wanted to.  As I say, this type of argument is not relevant because there is all the difference between this regular pattern which has now become practically an annual affair&mdash;the providing of increases of one sort or another to the social welfare classes in the budget &mdash; and the much longer term increases that take place in the salaries of the higher paid sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson asked me why one section of the community is treated in this way and another is not. As I say, the old age pensioners and the social welfare classes cannot be compared in any way with those we are dealing with here.  Why does not Senator Miss Davidson or Senator Ross compare the retrospective salaries granted to civil servants with the increases for old age pensioners?  Ninety per cent. of the judiciary have salaries which are less than those of the righer ranks of the Civil Service.  Why did the Senators not advert to this on the Finance Bill and why did they not give expression to their outrage that higher paid civil servants were being granted retrospective increases back to November 1st last year, while old age pensioners are getting increases only from the 1st August?  Why was that argument not made in this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But it makes me suspicious of the <i>bona fides</i> of this particular argument.  The amount of money involved in the increases to the higher ranks of the Civil Service was of such an order that if it had not been made retrospective, some part of it could have been allocated to increases in social welfare benefits, whereas this infinitesimal sum, comparatively speaking, could not make a thraneen of difference to the social welfare classes, if they were all granted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My argument is that Senators profess to be concerned that a well-off section of the community such as the judiciary get their payment made retrospective to November, whereas old age pensioners have to wait until 1st August.  I ask why was the same concern not expressed when another highly paid section of the community got their increases made retrospective to 1st November?  I am merely posing the question.

      <P>Purely for the benefit of some Senators who interrupted, I want to point out that the higher civil servants have not conciliation and arbitration machinery, so that argument does not stand up, either.  I have already indicated to the House that the judiciary have been traditionally related in these matters to the higher ranks of the Civil Service.  We all know that towards the end of last year, as I have said before, the eighth round of wage increases worked itself out more or less towards the middle of December, 1961, and the last of the many sections of the public service secured their increases.  It was at that time that we came to examine the question of the salaries of the judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not be manifestly unfair if, for instance, the higher ranks of the Civil Service, because their salary increases are granted simply by ministerial <Col N="667" /> decision, got their increases from a certain date, but their counterparts in the judiciary, simply because their salaries can be amended only by an Act of Parliament, had to wait until the appropriate Bill could be put through both Houses?  Would that not be unfair?  I also want to point out that in every case where the salaries of the judiciary have been increased &mdash;in every case in the history of the State&mdash;there has been retrospection.</P>

      <P>On 19th July, 1947, the Courts of Justice Act became law and provided for an increase in the salaries of the judiciary.  Those in-increases were made retrospective. Another increase was granted in judicial salaries in 1953.  It became law on 8th December, 1953, and it was made retrospective.  Another increase was granted in the Courts of Justice Act, 1959, which became law on 8th December, 1959, and that was made retrospective, as I pointed out to the House before, to 1st January, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Lindsay along the lines he has opened up with regard to the retired Chief Justice.  All I would say in that regard <Col N="668" /> is &mdash; and I think every Senator will agree with me when I say it&mdash;that he is a man who filled that high office with distinction, honour and integrity for many years.  He not only won the admiration and respect of the public and the members of both branches of the legal profession, but it is true to say that he was loved by them.  I regret very much that his name has been introduced into the debate in this way.</P>
    <P>I have already given the House an assurance that the date of 1st November, 1961, had no connection whatever with his retirement.  It was fixed because that was the date fixed for the higher levels of the Civil Service.  It is a completely unreal argument to try to suggest that because you more or less accidentally increase the pension of a man who has retired, you would in any way be interfering with the independence of the judiciary.  I just cannot follow that line.  Whatever about giving an increase to people in office, I completely fail to see how you could tamper in any way with the independence of the judiciary by increasing the pension of a person who has retired from office and no longer participates in these affairs.  I have given the House an assurance, and I had hoped it would be accepted, that the only reason for fixing that date was the one I have given.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick made a point about the interval between the increases in the judicial salaries.  Here again I think Senator Fitzpatrick is missing the point.  It is not the length of time that is relevant in that regard. It is the degree of movement which has taken place in salaries generally. You could have, in one short year, for instance, such a movement in incomes generally that an increase in the salaries of the judiciary would be essenial if the judges were to get fair play, whereas you could have a comparatively stable period of ten years in which there would be no movement in incomes and no increase in the salaries of the judiciary would be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is not the length of time that ensues between one rise and another; it is the degree of movement in incomes; and that is the reason why this proposal is brought forward. There was such a movement <Col N="669" /> in incomes generally in the period between 1959 and 1961 and this proposal is merely to keep the judiciary in line with that section of the community with which they are traditionally compared.  The date 1st November was settled upon on that basis and on no other basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had not introduced a little note of hostility in his reply to the arguments which have been put forward in support of my recommendation, I would willingly and wholly accept his explanation about the 1st November.  I do not think that I can accept it now; I do not think the House can accept it; and I do not think the country will accept it.  He expressed his regret that anyone's name should be brought into a matter of this kind.  Was anything I said about the previous holder of the office of Chief Justice in the course of my remarks in any way derogatory? It was all sincere praise&mdash;sincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> The Minister seems to be travelling the line of country that if an argument does not coincide with his, it is unreal, that if ideas are not exactly on a par with his, they are nonsensical, foolish, not based on fact, or do not stand up. I want to say that in putting down this recommendation specifying 1st January, I did so after much heart-searching and I resent the implication in the Minister's hostile reply that I did so for any purpose other than the highest motive of preserving the independence of the judiciary.  My argument was perfectly clear and perfectly reasonable to follow in that regard.</P>

    <P>Recommendation No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete lines 35 to 41 inclusive. My purpose in putting down this recommendation is readily understandable. It is a question of trying to achieve parity between ordinary <Col N="671" /> district justices in the Dublin metropolitan district and in Cork and those in rural Ireland.  There does not appear to me to be any case for distinguishing between the ordinary district justice in Dublin or Cork and his brother operating in any part of rural Ireland.  The differential appears to me to be unreal and it was for the purpose of having it further considered that I put down this recommendation to bring ordinary district justices in Dublin and Cork down to the level of district justices in rural Ireland in full knowledge that I could not put it the other way, in other words that I could not recommend bringing the rural justices up to the level of those in Dublin and Cork.  It is the subject in reverse and one which I would not, of course, press.  It is a paper conclusion as it were.</P>
    <P>The situation as I see it is that the country district justice works just as hard as his brother in Dublin or Cork. Some people suggest that he makes a bit by way of travelling expenses and subsistence allowances.  Maybe he might, but I do not think he would. Anybody conversant with travelling expenses and subsistence allowances knows that there is very little in it in the long run.  If you want to make a comparison, you can compare the Dublin Deputy or Senator with the man from any part of the country. The basic allowance is the same for all and the fact that the man from the country gets subsistence and travel does not mean that the allowance of the man in Dublin is reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not of course pressing that salaries be reduced in Dublin but the opposite would be a reasonable thing to do.  There is only £150 each in it.  As in the case of the previous recommendation which was defeated I am not concerned so much with money as with principle.  I could not tot it up quickly but it would be something like 40 times £150.  I do not think it would even be that much and it would not impose any great <Col N="672" /> hardship on the Exchequer to do it. There is no logical basis for the retention of the differential in regard to these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I have to make on this recommendation could much more properly be made on the section and I do intend on the section making what I consider to be an unanswerable case for making the salaries payable to rural district justices the same as salaries payable to metropolitan district justices.  I am convinced that the argument is unanswerable, but I will say no more now than that my arguments are based on a comparison of like with like.</P>

    <Col N="674" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm Orders which I made in December, 1961, and April, 1962, under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, to give effect to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission on the supply and distribution of motor spirit and motor vehicle lubricating oil.</P>
      <P>In 1958, the Fair Trade Commission received a request from the Irish Motor Traders' Association for the holding of an inquiry into the conditions operating in the supply and distribution of petrol and lubricating oil, and, having received observations and comments from interested parties, the Commission decided that it would be appropriate to hold a public inquiry. Senators have already received copies of the Commission's report, but I propose to give here a summary of its contents.</P>
      <P>Petrol is distributed in this country by six wholesale companies three of which supply over 80 per cent. of the market.  These three are subsidiaries of large outside organisations engaged in all phases of the petroleum industry. Consumption of motor spirit has been increasing steadily for many years; it rose from 60 million gallons in 1950 to 80 million gallons in 1959.  In that period the number of retail sites more than doubled, rising from 1,630 to 3,470.  Over the same period there was an increase of 73 per cent. in the number of motor vehicles and 45 per cent. in the sale of motor spirit by retailers. It is significant that the average annual &ldquo;throughput&rdquo; of spirit per site fell from 30,000 gallons in 1950 to 20,000 in 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 1950, the bulk of retail sales of motor spirit was through &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; sites, that is, sites which sold the brands of more than one petrol company. Towards the end of that year, the formal exclusive dealing arrangement, commonly referred to as the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, was introduced, and was eventually adopted by all the petrol companies.  By 1959, 98 per cent. of retail outlets were operating on the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system.  Briefly, the principal feature of this system is that the retailer, in return for a monetary payment (known as the solus rebate), and <Col N="675" /> other considerations, agrees to purchase from a particular company his full requirements of petrol for a specified period.  The rebate, of ? of a 1d. to ½d. per gallon of the retailer's total gallonage for the period covered by the agreement, is usually paid in advance.  The other considerations include loan facilities on favourable terms, aids to sales promotion, and free uniforms and training for staffs. The earlier &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreements were usually for one year, but more recently their duration has been extended to five, ten and sometimes twenty years.</P>
    <P>The six petrol companies distribute their own brands of motor vehicle lubricating oil.  In addition, there are four companies which specialise in lubricating oil.  The retail outlets are the same as for motor spirit, and the sales represent about 1 per cent. of total sales of petroleum products.  The &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreements of the petrol companies also contained provisions imposing varying restrictions on sales by the retailer of motor oil supplied by competitors, and in later years special agreements, operated in conjunction with special rebates, were made, the object of which was to encourage the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer to purchase all or most of his requirements of lubricating oil from the company which supplied him with petrol.</P>
    <P>The majority of retail sites are owned by independent dealers.  Up to 1954, the petrol companies did not own or operate any such sites, but since then some of them began to acquire their own sites&mdash;mostly service or filling stations&mdash;and by 1959, 113 such sites, which are normally leased to tenants, had been acquired.</P>
    <P>At the inquiry the Irish Motor Traders' Association, the only trade association which expressed an interest in matters affecting the retailing of motor spirit, stated that they had opposed the introduction of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system in 1951, but claimed that the manner in which the wholesale price of petrol had been manipulated had left traders with no option but to accept the system.  While not pressing for its abolition, they considered that a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer should be <Col N="676" /> free, on the expiration of his contract, to select the system of trading which he prefers; also, that the agreement should contain a &ldquo;break&rdquo; clause which would allow a dealer to terminate it on equitable terms.</P>
    <P>The association also asserted that, following the introduction of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, the strenuous competition between the petrol companies for control of retail outlets had led to an uneconomic multiplicity of sites, with the result that although the overall sales had increased substantially there had been a significant drop in the average sales per outlet.  They objected also to the situation where independent retailers would be in competition with the company-operated sites, and called for the establishment of an independent licensing authority to regulate the growth of new retail outlets on the basis of public need.</P>
    <P>At the time of the inquiry, the major petrol companies pursued a vigorous policy of inducing &ldquo;mixed site&rdquo; dealers to change to the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; arrangements, but the small number of &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; dealers who had not accepted the new system continued to be supplied on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis.  New entrants, however, would be supplied only on a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; basis, and although a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer was free, at the termination of his agreement, to change to another supplier, it could only be on a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; basis, and supplies would be withheld if he wished to revert to &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; trading.  The minor companies, while they also followed the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; policy, would generally supply, on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis, both new entrants and persons who had formerly operated on a &ldquo;solus&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>The wholesale price of petrol is uniform, with, of course, the special rebate already mentioned as allowed to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealers.  Price changes were usually initiated by one or other of the two largest companies, who notified all other companies in advance, and ascertained before announcing increases that the others would make a corresponding increase.  Price competition at retail level was discouraged, and the recommended retail prices were generally observed.  It was apparent from the evidence presented <Col N="677" /> at the inquiry that, because variations in the price and quality of the product were insignificant, the competition between the petrol companies as wholesalers was limited to advertising and methods of distribution.</P>
    <P>In the supply of motor spirit to commercial users no exclusive dealing arrangements were practised, but prices quoted in reply to tenders from large commercial users were related to a common schedule, resulting in identical quotations from all the tendering companies.</P>
    <P>There were no uniform wholesale prices for lubricating oil at the time of the inquiry, and none of the distributing companies took steps to enforce recommended prices.  Retailers' profit margins varied between the various companies and grades.  Prior to the introduction of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system for motor spirit, the trading terms of all companies distributing lubricating oil provided only for quantity discounts, with deferred rebates on an equal scale for all traders.  As I have already mentioned, the petrol companies have introduced, sometimes in conjunction with their &ldquo;solus&rdquo; petrol agreements, supplementary agreements providing for exclusive dealing arrangements in lubricating oil.  The four specialist companies continued to trade on the old basis, and three of them complained at the inquiry that the lubricating oil arrangements of the petrol companies were unfair to them and contrary to the public interest. Figures submitted to the Commission showed that those four specialist companies failed to maintain their proportion of a rising market in lubricating oil between 1951 and 1959, while the share enjoyed by the petrol companies rose from 63 per cent. to 72 per cent. in the same period.</P>
    <P>In their submissions at the inquiry, the main advantage claimed by the petrol companies for the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system was that it had achieved considerable savings in distribution costs which, in an inflationary period, enabled prices to the motorist to be kept at a lower level than would have been possible otherwise.  The major companies claimed that the retailer, too, found the system advantageous to <Col N="678" /> him.  He benefited from the free training facilities provided for his staff; the advice and assistance afforded expanded his sales and increased the efficiency of his business, and all his requirements in equipment were available to him on hire-purchase terms which were much more favourable than those charged by finance houses.</P>
    <P>In their report, the Fair Trade Commission accepted that the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system has been a satisfactory method of distribution from the standpoint of the wholesaler, and that it lends itself to greater economies in distribution than the system of &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; trading. They pointed out, however, that it stimulated entry into the retail trade to an extent not justified by the rate at which the overall consumption of motor spirit was increasing.  The commission expressed the opinion that the economic benefit of the system can be retained if its effect on entry can be damped down, and they recommended that incentives to new entrants in the form of advance payment of rebates or the giving of loans at less than commercial interest rates should be completely discontinued for the present. Further, as regards company-owned stations, they recommended that any petrol company proposing to build or acquire new outlets should be required to notify the commission in advance and furnish any information required by the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission made a number of other recommendations designed to prevent unfairness in the operation of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system.  They recommended that the small number of dealers who are at present receiving supplies on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis should unless they change to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; trading at any stage, continue to be supplied on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis by their existing wholesalers.  At the earlier stages of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, it was not made clear to dealers that they could not revert to &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; trading on the expiration of their agreements, and the commission, therefore, recommended that any &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealer who had been supplied on a &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; basis at any time in the period 1950 to 1956, and who wishes to return to that form of trading, should be enabled to do so on <Col N="679" /> the next expiration of his &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreement.</P>
    <P>The commission considered that &ldquo;solus&rdquo; agreements of prolonged duration are unnecessary and undesirable in that they tend to produce a rigid division of the market between the companies, and, accordingly, they proposed that any future agreement providing for exclusive dealing in motor spirit should not exceed a period of five years and that any loan, mortgage or hire-purchase arrangements or agreements should not be linked in any way with provisions for exclusive dealings for longer than five years.</P>
    <P>While there is no suggestion that entry to the wholesale trade in motor spirit has been limited or controlled by collective arrangements, the commission considered that a new wholesaler would find it more costly and difficult to obtain outlets under the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, and, accordingly, they recommended a prohibition on any concerted action by wholesalers to restrict entry or to eliminate unfairly a competing wholesaler.</P>
    <P>In the opinion of the commission the system of prior consultation between the petrol companies on price changes is a form of price regulation and restraint on free competition in pricing, and should be prohibited.  So far as the supply of motor spirit to large-scale commercial users is concerned, the commission took the view that tendering based on an arrangement or understanding between the petrol companies concerned frustrates the function which the system of tendering was devised to perform and should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>Apart from the rebate paid to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; dealers, the Commission considered that there should not be any price discrimination between retailers.  The Commission recommended also that the price differential between &ldquo;solus&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-solus&rdquo; retailers should be reasonable, and be justifiable having regard to the functions which the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; retailer is required to perform.  The Commission proposed that the petrol companies should lodge their terms and <Col N="680" /> conditions with them, so that this and other relevant matters can be kept under review.</P>
    <P>In 1954, the Fair Trade Commission made Fair Trading Rules relating to entry into the retail trade in motor spirit which prohibited suppliers from refusing supplies to any person who fulfilled the normal conditions required by the supplier as to payment, minimum purchases, etc.  These rules will not be necessary if effect is given to the Commission's recommendations and in that event the Commission propose to rescind them.</P>
    <P>As regards lubricating oil, the commission were of the opinion that, if the companies which specialise in this commodity are to survive, they must have access to &ldquo;solus&rdquo; sites which now represent the vast majority of retail outlets.  They considered, therefore, that the supply of lubricating oil to retailers should be the subject of a separate arrangement not related to any arrangement for the supply of petrol.  The Commission expressed the view that special incentive rebates and other arrangements tend to limit the public in its choice of lubricating oil and are contrary to the public interest. The terms of sale should not provide for exclusive purchase, display or advertising.  All terms and conditions should be applied to all traders without discrimination and should be furnished to the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission further recommended that a trader should not be refused supplies of motor spirit or lubricating oil solely because he is or is not a member of a trade association.</P>
    <P>The commission finally recommended that a trader should not be or margins for lubricating oil and collective enforcement of resale prices for motor spirit or lubricating oil should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Seanad is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the two Orders concerned in this case.  I should like to mention at this stage that the <Col N="681" /> second Order merely made a simple drafting amendment in the first Order and was designed to define in a manner more in keeping with the Commission's recommendations, the types of trading agreements or arrangements which will continue to be permitted under Article 12 (2) of the first Order.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that neither this Bill nor the Orders to which it relates set out the penalties for contravention of the provisions to which statutory effect is now to be given.  The reason for this is that the parent statute, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, deals comprehensively with the question of offences against any Order made thereunder.  Section 14 of that Act provides for the imposition of very substantial penalties by way of fine or imprisonment for such offences.</P>
    <P>In the case of Confirmation Bills, the arrangement is that the Orders which it is proposed to confirm would not be capable of being amended by the Oireachtas but would be accepted or rejected as they stand.  The matters dealt with in the Orders have been the subject of a detailed public enquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Orders are set out in the commission's Report. The Orders have on the whole been well received.  In matters of this kind it is not easy to find a satisfactory solution acceptable to all interested parties, particularly one to which legislative effect can be given.  Our paramount interest must of course be the motoring public.  The Commission considered these matters in all their aspects and I think their recommendations were very sound and reasonable, aimed as they were at the elimination of the unsatisfactory elements of the present distributive system with a minimum of interference with the trade.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, no hesitation in commending this Bill to the Seanad.  I should like to emphasise that the sincere co-operation of all the parties concerned will be required in the operation of the Orders if the greatest benefits for the trade and the motoring public are to be derived from its provisions, and I do hope that such <Col N="682" /> cooperation will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to say that we support this Bill.  We could discuss for many hours the system of the sale of petrol and lubricating oils which we have just heard the Minister speaking about and which this enquiry has been studying, but in view of the fact that this Bill, we are told, must be accepted <i>in toto</i> or rejected it would be more or less a waste of the time of this House if we spent too much time discussing these details, and if we do find fault, through specialised knowledge perhaps, with certain items in the Order it is hardly likely that we will throw out the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>The thing that interests me about the Bill is the fact that the tribunal was brought into operation on the application of the Motor Traders' Association.  For that reason particularly I support the Bill.  Because I remember when the Restrictive Trade Practices Act came into force first there was a lot of opposition in industrial and commercial circles to the whole idea of the Act.  It was felt at that time that there would be too much interference with the commercial operations of the business community, but I think it is true to say that things have changed considerably since then; first, I suppose, because of the operation of the Act itself and second because business people have adopted a more enlightened form of thinking in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Formerly business people thought there should always be something to hide and even if they had nothing to hide they felt they should be secretive about how they were running their business.  As time moved on, however, that attitude disappeared because very little is secret in business nowadays and there is nothing to hide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the thing most of these people were rather timid about was revealing how they arrived at the prices of the commodities they sold and what profits they made, but as we in this country are now no longer going to operate in an enclosed market and have to think in a world and a European sense, I have no <Col N="683" /> hesitation in saying that prices and profits in this country compare very favourably in that they are so low with prices and profits in any country in the world.  That is now recognised by business people generally and therefore they are not afraid to come to tribunals and public enquiries and make their case.</P>
    <P>The only reservation is that it is felt at times that the tribunal was summoned into activity unnecessarily and, indeed, provocatively, with the result that certain traders had to spend a lot of time, a lot of money and a lot of worry arguing their case, as they sometimes thought unnecessarily, before this tribunal which was set up under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.  In the course of time we have now come to a more rational way of handling the tribunal and I was glad to see therefore, that the Motor Traders' Association themselves were responsible for the enquiry into the sale of petrol and lubricating oils.</P>
    <P>The objects of the commission's activity can be several.  One would be to make supplies available to traders generally without unfair discrimination between one and another, also to prevent a price conspiracy and encourage competition, generally and finally the overriding objective of benefiting the consumer both in regard to the service he gets and the price he pays for whatever the commodity may be.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, it would seem that the main purpose has been to prevent harsh or restrictive conditions being imposed on retail petrol distributors. Out of that arose the question of the solus system as against the mixed system which operated up to some years ago.  I think that is where the Motor Traders' Association has come in.  As the Minister told us in his detailed introduction of this Bill, it was felt that the solus system in the beginning seemed to work all right while it was left in the hands of the ordinary existing dealers.  Apparently it was felt it was getting out of hand, for many reasons: It was trying people too much and becoming too much of a <Col N="684" /> monopoly.  It was closing out other citizens from taking part, profitably and reasonably, in the motor trade.</P>
    <P>The report of the commission and their recommendations indicate that they have gone as far as possible to remedy the faults in the system.  However, they have not been able to go very far because, as far as I can see and as the Minister stated, there is no way of dealing with the price of petrol, that is of getting away from the price arrangements already made because they are really decided outside the country.  Therefore, it would seem that there is very little, really, coming out of this for the actual consumer. I suppose the traders themselves have got what they wanted by at least drawing attention to the way petrol supplies were handled in this country.</P>
    <P>Very often, a commission like this may not be able to give very positive returns.  However, it will throw light on a position and will prevent it from deteriorating further.  I think that is what has happened in this case.  If this inquiry had not been made, we would find in a few years' time, the motor distribution trade in this country in the hands of very few people, and those people dictated to from outside the country.</P>
    <P>The Motors Traders' Association themselves started this inquiry.  I do not remember if the Minister said there had been any reaction from the Motor Traders' Association as to the usefulness of this whole exercise in connection with the motor trade.  It may not have produced very positive or very dramatic results but it may prevent things from deteriorating in the future and perhaps, from here on, a more liberal system may be worked out as between the Motor Traders' Association and the petrol companies. Therefore, I have pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I am sure, has the support of every motorist in the country.  It is fundamentally sound in principle.  There is always a danger in monopoly and of monopoly in a commodity of this kind and the Government and the Minister are taking the right steps to watch that. <Col N="685" /> There are one or two questions which I would like to ask.</P>
      <P>Recently we read about a petrol trader in England who was able to sell petrol there apparently for an extraordinarily low cost, about 6d., I think, less than the cost in Ireland at present. He has spoken of setting up petrol stations in the Republic.  Am I to understand, or may I understand, that he would be quite free now to come into this country and to set up his petrol stations in direct competition with the stations here already?  I hope that is so.  I think we all want as much competition as possible in this trade. The danger is, of course, from monopolies.</P>
      <P>At the moment, as the Minister said, those petrol companies control our supply of petrol completely and, in certain circumstances like that, I think we must all the time, both as members of this Parliament and as consumers, watch two things.  We must watch that the monopolists do not run up the price unreasonably.  We must also watch that they do not allow the quality of their petrol to deteriorate. Just this time last year I raised a question in this House about the quality of the petrol that is being supplied in the Republic.  I asked the Minister who is present this evening, through the Minister for Finance, to test the quality.  The reason why I asked for that was this: There are undoubtedly many people in this country who believe that the quality of our petrol is not as good as the quality supplied in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  I have had letters.  I have had statements in considerable number to that effect.  I am well aware, as the Minister is well aware, that it is extremely hard to test the truth of such statements.  Let me be quite specific.  The complaints are of three kinds.  Some people say that the mileage from the Irish petrol is 2 or 3 or perhaps even 5 miles a gallon less than that from Northern Ireland or British petrol.  Others say that the general standard of performance is lower.  Others say that the effect on their engines is more harmful than that of petrol supplied outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> I know it is extremely difficult to test objectively the truth of such complaints but it can be done.  I understand that in Great Britain there are machines which can quite objectively test the quality of petrol for performance, and the rest of it.  They are expensive.  I understand they cost many thousands of pounds to install, but it can be done.  Some months ago, we set up a body to test industrial standards and standards of manufacture in this country.  It is a most valuable institution.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this question of petrol is of such supreme importance that the body charged with the responsibility of maintaining our industrial standards should be asked to investigate the matter objectively.  I am prepared to concede this.  I am no chemist; I cannot speak with authority.  If it is proved that Irish petrol is as good as or better than that outside the country, nobody will be better pleased than myself.  But there is public dissatisfaction. If we could, by objective tests, settle that matter, it would be good for the country.  There is always this risk in monopoly of deterioration of quality and unreasonable increase in prices.  I should be very glad if the Minister could reassure us on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Minister generally on the satisfactory working of the Fair Trade Commission in regard to this problem.  It is true to say that the investigation which the Fair Trade Commission carried out was done, generally, at the request of the Motor Traders' Association who were then very much dissatisfied with the existing system of petrol distribution and arrangements by the petrol companies.  By and large, it was a rather technical problem to solve.  I must say that the Fair Trade Commission have done a reasonably good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Orders, by way of Confirmation Bills, and, in that regard, I have a few observations to make.  The price of petrol has been mentioned here and the suggestion made by innuendo that there is still <Col N="687" /> some sort of gentlemen's agreement operated by these major companies in regard to the fixing of petrol prices. From my experience of the competition that seems to exist between the petrol companies in other directions for the past couple of years, I am very slow to accept that.  One thing that puzzles me is how the price of petrol is fixed and what is the source at which it is fixed?  We are in the dark all the time about that, even though we may be associated with the trade.  It is generally accepted that the price fixing is done at a source outside the country and that the petrol companies seem to follow suit with one another in the matter.  The Order which the Minister introduced this evening will not make that so easy in the future. That is probably desirable.</P>
    <P>There are many factors which determine the price of petrol.  It might be as dangerous to have too much competition as to have a monopoly.  At the moment, the motor trade in the country has taken grave exception to certain developments by the petrol companies in the matter of erecting petrol company owned sites.  The Minister has explained that the number of sites increased very considerably over a period and the increase was entirely out of pace during that period with the general growth in the number of vehicles that came on the road.  There was a period of approximately eight years when the increase was 113 per cent. in the erection and operation of retail sites.  During the same period, the number of vehicles licensed was only 73 per cent.  That proves that the growth in the erection of petrol stations was entirely out of line with the requirements of the public.</P>
    <P>If those stations were being erected at the expense of the private traders, there would not be much to worry about, because the situation would take care of itself.  But it has been the policy of the companies to subsidise the erection of certain filling stations and, more recently, the petrol companies have not been satisfied with that arrangement and have now gone into the business themselves. <Col N="688" /> There are many areas throughout the country where the petrol companies have gone into that type of business and where the trade and public were satisfied with the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>In Killarney recently, two or three companies have come into the suburbs of the town and paid fabulous sums for site accommodation.  In one case, they paid at the rate of £3,000 per acre and they propose to erect stations to be operated as company-owned stations.  They will probably lease them out to the people who may or may not be in the trade.  In one case, a company proposes to operate the station itself, as far as we can understand. It is obvious that if there is an over-growth in that regard, the position will be affected in another way and the price of petrol will suffer as a result of this in the long run.</P>
    <P>While the Fair Trade Commission dealt with that aspect and while we are told by the Minister in a statement he made in the Dáil that the commission recommended that petrol companies proposing to build or acquire new outlets should be required to notify the commission in advance, I do not think that goes far enough.  In the first instance, I feel that, unless the Commission requests the company to notify them of their proposal, there is no direct liability on the petrol company to do so.  In fact, the station could be erected or nearly erected, as has been the case in Dublin, before it would be possible to bring it to the notice of the Fair Trade Commission and before the Commission could request them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no power to request until such time as the Act is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, there is no provision regarding what action the Fair Trade Commission can take.  One is entitled to feel that, while there is provision for it, the commission will be rather reluctant to take positive action, if they can avoid doing so.  It is very desirable at this stage that the Minister should give clarification to the House in regard to what action the commission could take.  Are they in a <Col N="689" /> position to say to the particular petrol company: &ldquo;We consider that the existing arrangements in the area are quite adequate to serve the public and you should not go ahead with the erection of this station&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is: how does this concern the public? It concerns them to this extent.  The companies have to get the finances to erect and operate these stations.  Most of them will be uneconomic from the point of view of operation.  That money comes from the general profit pool which will accrue from the trade and, in the long run, from the public. The trade has to collect for the petrol companies and then try to get it back from the public as far as possible.  The petrol companies should be content to carry on the wholesale distribution of petrol.  The time has arrived when the commission should be asked to take some action in this respect, with a view to preventing the appearance of company-operated stations.</P>
      <P>The petrol companies' policy in that respect seems to be that, if one company erects a station, the other, in order to preserve the prestige which it seems to think is required to operate its business, erects another station.  The three major companies are largely competing in that direction.  The motor trade, when making their submissions to the Fair Trade Commission, suggested that some licensing body should be set up to examine cases of the kind about which I am complaining, with a view to determining whether or not there was a necessity for erecting a particular station and whether that station was to be operated by a private individual or a petrol company.  The Commission did not accept those submissions, but experience within the past couple of years would, I think, justify the Minister re-examining that aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been developments by the companies within the past five or six months which prove that some action on the part of the Fair Trade Commission, some speedy action, will have to be taken to control their activities in the matter of erecting stations through their own organisations. The proof that further stations <Col N="690" /> are not required is already available. The Minister in his statement has indicated that the gallonage sale of the stations fell from 30,000 in 1950 to 20,000 in 1958, on average.  That indicates that the number of stations erected during the period from 1952 to 1958 or 1959 multiplied very considerably, and increased by over 100 per cent., by 113 per cent.  The result was that they were entirely out of pace with customer requirements.  In each station, there was a very substantial fall in gallonage output, from 30,000 gallons to 20,000 gallons, which represents one-third of the turnover.  Many of those stations are entirely dependent on the sales of petrol and lubricants, and are finding it pretty difficult to carry on.  When the companies erect stations of their own in places already adequately provided for, the position deteriorates further and gives quite a headache to a number of traders who are engaged in retail distribution.</P>
    <P>I have tried to make the points which are important in this discussion. I have given the Minister all the facts to the best of my ability.  The question of price has been dealt with.  Before I leave it, I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might consider setting up some form of licensing body to examine the merits of any applications for additional sites.  The system as it exists at the moment should be changed.  The Fair Trade Commission should have some say in the erection of new stations.  I suggest that there should be an advisory body or, better still, a licensing authority.</P>
    <P>That authority could be composed of three or four people: one person representing the Minister or alternatively the Fair Trade Commission; one person representing the Motor Traders' Association, a third person representing the petrol companies and nominated by the main petrol companies; and a fourth person representing the motorists or the public as the case may be.  A body of that kind would be very competent to examine local requirements and to deal objectively with any application which came before them for permission to erect additional stations in a particular area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> The multiplicity of sites seems to be coming to notice very much in recent months.  I have explained the situation in Killarney and I am sure there are many similar cases throughout the country.  Action will have to be taken very speedily in that connection.  To some extent, the Fair Trade Commission have power at least to check this unreasonable growth in the erection of filling stations.  It is a limited power. The order does not seem to specify what action they can take, other than getting information when a case comes to notice, but usually when a case comes to notice, the filling station is erected or well in course of erection.</P>
    <P>The question of the price and quality of petrol is rather important.  I am glad the previous speaker dealt with the question of the quality of petrol. I feel that the noticeable differential in quality and in general performance is due to the fact that we have only two grades in this country.  Generally speaking, there are only two grades here, but in the North of Ireland and in England, I understand there are three grades and in some cases four. There is a price differential, of course, between one grade and another.  The superior grade, the top grade, is some pence dearer than the lower grades. Until we get a greater variety in the matter of grades, there will be complaints, by and large, with regard to quality.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford suggested that the question of standard should be examined.  I entirely agree with him. I feel that we have some machinery available to us through the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to examine the quality of petrol and clear up certain points in regard to the ill-effects our existing petrol supply may have, and particularly in regard to excessive wear on the motor engine. From my experience, I feel that charge does not stand up to examination.  I have occasion to know that the engines of motor cars which have operated for 11 of the 12 months in England and Northern Ireland very often show as much wear as they do in the Republic. If we had a wider variety in the matter of grades, people would have a choice, <Col N="692" /> and they would not be tied to the two very fixed grades which they are obliged to use at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility of another question arising in that connection, that the general research carried out into petrol products is not as up to date as it might be, or as it is in the American countries.  It is only in recent years that we have had our own refinery, and it is probably a bit unreasonable to expect that we should have reached the stage of perfection that has been reached in other countries which have been refining for many years.  I understand that in our refinery that question is being attended to, that we may take it that everything possible is being done, and that the products we will get will compare favourably in a short time with any products that have been obtained from the European refineries, and the American refineries which are supposed to be the best in the world when it comes to petroleum products.</P>

      <P>While we can all welcome this Bill, and I think we must compliment the Fair Trade Commission for the very good work they have done, it does seem that the era of the Fair Trade Commission is about to end, and that in the framework of the Common Market, such restrictive practices cannot last because of the free right of establishment that is contained fundamentally in the principles of the Common Market.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, that will allow any outside company to come in and set up a petrol station or any other station anywhere throughout the country. We have to face that situation.  It is one of the more unpleasant facts associated with the Common Market, especially when we consider our rather abrupt transition from our rather regulated type of economy to one of free trade.  I should have thought that the petrol stations which are not competitive will just have to face up to the fact that they cannot be helped to hold on indefinitely.  This Bill is rather temporary in nature and it will, I believe, have to be drastically revised if or when we become members of the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>This measure is the result of the report of an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission into trading in motor spirit and motor lubricants.  I did not think the debate on it would be as protracted as it has been.  Some Senators have given their views.  I was interested in the view expressed by my colleague on this side of the House and I was inclined to ask myself what is fair trading.  It appears to me that the function of the Fair Trade Commission fundamentally is to protect the public rather than to protect a particular trade and to that degree I could hardly subscribe to some of the comments made by my colleague.</P>
      <P>The best protection the public can have in the long run is competition so long as it is fair competition and once there is any attempt at interference by any group, either retailers, wholesalers or at any level of the distribution of any commodity, there is not fair competition and it becomes a matter for somebody like the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford raised the question of quality.  Not being a chemist, I cannot express any opinion except that of a layman with nothing to support it, but I believe there is little or no difference between petrols and that is why so much money is spent on advertising. When there is no difference in commodities sold by firms there is cut-throat competition and colossal sums are spent on advertising.  This, I believe, is true in this country and in England and also, I am certain, on the Continent.  It may be a good thing but in my opinion it would be good if less money were spent on advertising and more ploughed back into production of the commodity either to make it better or to enable it to be sold at a cheaper rate to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the multiplicity of sites, while it may not be socially a good thing to have too many people engaged in that business, it is a fact that very few people in this country rely solely on the sale of petrol and motor lubricants. Most of them have sidelines, whether they are engaged in the motor trade as such, farm machinery or even selling <Col N="694" /> groceries.  Sometimes you see a petrol pump outside a premises where they sell anti-freeze inside, a public house, but I am not aware of any being seen outside a post office.  Unless it becomes socially undesirable to have too many sites I do not see how you can go so far as to regulate the number by licensing them.  Sites where petrol is sold in a public place are licensed by the local authority in any case and I do not see how it could be arranged that some people would get licences and others would not.</P>
    <P>It is socially desirable to control the number of public houses but whether it would be socially desirable to control the number of people selling petrol is another matter.  I think it would create a restrictive trade practice, the very thing it was intended to prevent by the Fair Trade Commission, if you allowed some people to sell petrol and did not allow others.  I am inclined to come down on the side of free competition. If people are prepared to erect a pump to sell petrol the man who is a good salesman will sell more than the man who is not.  It may be argued that it would be undesirable to have overselling where a number of people are already engaged in the trade.</P>
    <P>While I agree that it is not a good thing that petrol companies should themselves operate sites, I must admit that they give employment.  The managing director of a petrol company is not going to sell petrol himself but will employ people to do it, but though that is so I do not think it is a good tendency to have petrol companies taking over and running sites.  One thing against it is that it tends to create a monopoly so that it is much easier to avoid competition and the people will suffer.  I could suggest other objections but that is the most important.  It would be much better if distribution and sale were conducted through the medium of people in the motor trade or any other people who felt there was a shilling to be made on the sale of petrol.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission went to a lot of trouble, spent a lot of public time and, I am sure, spent a lot of <Col N="695" /> public money on this investigation.  I might ask the Minister&mdash;he may not answer as he may not have the details &mdash;the cost of that enquiry.  It might be that some cynic could suggest that the cost of the enquiry was greater than any advantages that might accrue from it.  I remember an argument on this matter when it was pretty hot and the enquiry was on and it was said that the money spent on the enquiry would far outweigh any advantages that might accrue from it.  I did not think so but I heard a cynical person in the motor trade suggest it.  Quite a lot of good has been achieved and the enquiry has gone some way to prevent a monopolistic tendency in the distribution and sale of what is really a very vital commodity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the Dáil, the measure has received general approval in this House, subject of course to what were questions rather than criticisms. Senator McGuire pointed out that under the parent Act, Orders such as this are either accepted or rejected. I do not think he intended to criticise that, but it was a wise provision in that the Fair Trade Commission, having heard the evidence before it in detail, were the best fitted to make the recommendation and it is difficult for this House to amend, in detail at any rate, the contents of the recommendations they made when they are ultimately confirmed by Order.  I think it is a good system.  Apart altogether from that, the recommendations are published well in advance of legislation being introduced and representations may be made by and received from interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any representation of note was made in respect of the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission as embodied in this Order.  The main difficulty with the creation of too many outlets was, in my opinion, that while the solus system itself tended to greater economy of distribution, as the Fair Trade Commission found and I think the Motor Traders' Association did not contest this, there was, on the other hand, the multiplicity of stations or outlets as they are called, causing a <Col N="696" /> reduction in the throughput on the average of outlets and therefore must of necessity have given rise to greater overheads and must in general have affected the price of petrol.  I felt, and still feel, that the multiplicity of these outlets must have adversely affected whatever economies were created by the solus system.  It is, therefore, desirable that some restraint should be put on the multiplicity of outlets.</P>
    <P>Senator Moloney rather questioned the effectiveness of the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission in this respect.  In the first place, it was decided by the Fair Trade Commission that they ought not to establish a licensing authority as it would tend to create vested interests in sites and perhaps give rise to another type of abuse that we are trying to avoid in another form of trade.  As well as that, this being a free enterprise economy, it is desired by all of us and by the Government to interfere as little as possible in that enterprise and to do so only when the public interest is involved or is adversely affected.</P>
    <P>It is true that the public interest may adversely be affected by the creation of too many sites as is obviously evidenced in Killarney at present where the petrol companies themselves are acquiring sites and operating them through tenants or their own employees direct.  There is possibly good reason from the petrol companies' point of view to go to Killarney.  It is one of our greatest show pieces.  The appearance of attractive petrol stations bearing the name of a particular brand in such a place must obviously be attractive to petrol companies.  However, the Order made in consequence of the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission requires that petrol companies who propose to acquire or build new outlets must notify in advance the Fair Trade Commission of their intentions in that regard.</P>
    <P>As of now, the Fair Trade Commission again say to these people: &ldquo;If you go ahead with your plans we shall order you to take down the premises.&rdquo; The immediate purpose of the recommendation is that they can keep the growth of petrol retail outlets under <Col N="697" /> review.  An abuse has arisen to a certain extent.  However, if they find an abuse arising to the extent that they ought to act then they will have power to make certain recommendations on the basis of which an Order can be made which ultimately may be given the force of law by the Dáil and the Seanad.  I think that is far enough to go at the present time.  I believe that the recommendation will have the desired effect in so far as the multiplicity of petrol stations are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford asked if this Order will have any effect.  He instanced the possibility of a person coming from England to establish a distribution chain in this country.  It will facilitate such a person coming in.  It will facilitate greater competition.  It is true to say, further, that the Fair Trade Commission found that there was no suggestion of restriction of entry into the wholesale trade.  However, the manner in which the petrol companies were buying solus sites, to take only their own brand of petrol, would be a restriction in so far as it would not be possible for a new wholesale entrant to sell his petrol to retailers who were bound up by solus agreements.</P>
    <P>These solus agreements will be capable of being rescinded after their current period of operation and a person can renew them only for a limited period.  A person who was bound under a solus agreement and who was formerly a mixed trader can, on the termination of his contract, revert to mixed trading and the petrol companies will have to supply him. Therefore, a new wholesale entrant will be able to get an outlet there with a mixed trader and with existing mixed traders even though they are limited at the present time.  As well as that, he will be able to make his plans available to the Fair Trade Commission in relation to building his own retail outlets.</P>
    <P>There is really only one restriction, if one may call it that.  When the Oil Refinery was built the Government of the day gave them an undertaking that any petroleum spirit that would be imported into this country would bear <Col N="698" /> a duty of 1d. per gallon over and above the petrol products produced at the Whitegate Refinery.  So, subject to that, and subject to the existing restrictions which it is proposed to eliminate, there is no limitation on the right of a new wholesaler to come into business no matter from where he comes.</P>
    <P>As regards the quality of petrol, people complain about the quality of goods from time to time.  I have no opportunity of comparing the quality of petrol in this country with that of petrol sold in Britain.  It must be remembered that we get our raw material, the crude oil, from the same sources as they get it in Britain.  We have one of the most modern refineries in the world.  It is operated, largely, I am happy to say, by Irishmen, Irish technicians.  I hope we can produce petrol, given the same tools, the same raw materials, as good as anybody in the world.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there are serious objections to the quality of our petrol. I do not know whether, as Senator Stanford suggests, it gives a lesser mileage per gallon or has a more adverse effect on the engines of motor cars but, if there is substance in the complaints, I am sure we have the means to carry out tests.  I am not suggesting that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have the necessary equipment to do so at the present time but I have no doubt that if there were a volume of opinion on this matter and if the case were made to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards appropriate tests could be made.  Over and above that, of course, there is the facility available to anybody who has a serious complaint in that regard to have it tested perhaps by private sources.  However, I feel that if a proper case were made to the Institute the appropriate tests could be carried out.</P>
    <P>I think these are the main points that have been made.  I just want to say one thing with regard to the fixing of prices.  As I said, and as the Commission found, the scope of competition in this country is very limited. The costs of crude oil are not fixed <Col N="699" /> and are not fixable in this country.  The costs of processing are perhaps subject to the control of the Irish companies but, nevertheless, they have their overheads and other costs to take care of.  The competition has been restricted mainly to competition for outlets. In the long run there is very little scope for competition in pricing.</P>
    <P>There is one good thing however in the Order and that is that bulk commercial users will now have the advantage of reasonable tendering and not tendering according to a schedule agreed beforehand by the petrol companies. So that, in that single respect at any rate, there ought to be greater competition and I hope a greater advantage to bulk users, mostly for industry and the heating of big institutions. I do not think there are any other points but, if there are, perhaps I might be able to answer them if they are put.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give us power to restrict imports from Iron Curtain countries. Hitherto, we in Ireland have been practically alone among western countries in operating a non-discriminatory trade regime, and private traders, industrialists and others in general are free to import their goods and raw materials from any part of the world they like.  On the other hand, the trading of Iron Curtain countries is conducted by State agencies, and they do so largely on the basis of securing corresponding facilities for export. Because of our non-discriminatory regime we find it difficult, and in many cases impossible, to export goods to <Col N="700" /> Iron Curtain countries which we know they use and import from elsewhere, even though the same Iron Curtain countries can export freely to this country.  The position is that we have no inducement to these countries to ensure that they will take exportable goods from us in return for goods we import from them.  In many cases the balance of payments is hopelessly out of proportion as far as the quantity of goods we export to these countries and the quantity we import are concerned. An example was given in the Dáil, where it was stated by one of the Deputies that almost £1 million of goods is imported from one country as against an export quantity of some £125 worth.  It is clear therefore from trade statistics such as these that this imbalance will have to be rectified and, unfortunately, it is an increasing imbalance in favour of these Iron Curtain countries.  The purpose of the Bill is to give the Government power to ensure that we will have some means whereby we can sell goods to these Iron Curtain countries that they would otherwise buy from countries which have the means of exerting some pressure on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said that we have in existing legislation, the Control of Imports Acts of 1934 to 1937, such power in relation at least to agricultural products but, unfortunately, the procedure these Acts require is not flexible enough to deal with the situation that has arisen.  It is important to have as much flexibility in legislation as possible and the Bill is drafted therefore in the form to give the Government power in general terms to restrict imports.  It is not the intention that Orders should be made restricting imports from specified countries immediately on the enactment of this legislation. It would be more desirable if we could improve the balance of trade between ourselves and these countries otherwise, and Orders would be made only where ordinary means failed and where our trading relations justified such action.  It is true that there may be some disadvantages in the use of these powers in that traders in this country may have to pay a little more by going to countries other than Iron Curtain countries for the goods they <Col N="701" /> need, but it will be in the general interest of the country that we have outlets for our exportable surpluses that would otherwise be denied to us.  It is proposed, therefore, to use these powers only where other methods fail. I want to emphasise that it is not intended in any instance to use that power against countries with whom we have existing trade agreements or trading arrangements.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that the measure we propose now will result in an undesirable trend in that we will tend to increase our commercial contacts with the Iron Curtain countries but, on balance, in the interests of the country and of the economy, it would be preferable to have to increase these contacts than that the present situation should be allowed to continue.  That situation is certainly not to our benefit but only to the benefit of those State-trading Iron Curtain countries.  Therefore, I feel the Bill will meet with the approval of the House.  I can assure the House it will be used only for the purpose as stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We must all support this Bill which is a very short one and which is a very general one, although the Minister tells us it is intended to be used in connection with our trade or lack of trade with Iron Curtain countries.  It is only sensible that in the business of the State one would expect a fair balance of trade as between any country and ourselves. That is not only sensible but accepted housekeeping in connection with every State.  As the Minister told us, the purpose of this Bill is to deal with the imbalance that is very great in our trading with the Iron Curtain countries. We have no pressure that we can exert on these countries where all buying is done by the State itself.  Consequently this Bill, if it ensures that there will be a fair balance of trade with these people, if we have to deal with them, will be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have raised, and are raising quite rightly, the whole question of dealing with communist countries at all.  My own feeling is that we should not do so unless we have to. We should trade with them only as a last resort, for our most urgent needs <Col N="702" /> which cannot be got elsewhere and which are absolutely necessary for our economy and the welfare of our own people.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer here, but he did in the Dáil, to the question of raw materials.  It could quite easily happen that the raw materials which we need for our exports, and which are essential and will be more and more essential to keep our economy viable, may have to come from some of these countries.  I do not think anyone would argue that we should not buy from the devil himself, if it were a question of life and death.  That is not an exaggeration because it could happen in the future that to have the necessary exports, we would have to import our raw materials from the cheapest possible markets.  That is one case in which I could conceive that we would have to buy from the Iron Curtain countries.  That is the time and place when this Bill will come into operation.  We would all hope that a satisfactory bargain will be struck with those people and that we will get a favourable <i>quid pro quo</i> for our goods.</P>
    <P>The only other point that emerges on this Bill is whether or not it conflicts with the advent of the Common Market and with the continuing control of imports. The Minister gave the answer to that in the Dáil which was that this machinery will be necessary, even if we enter the Common Market, for the purpose of implementing our obligations <i>vis-á-vis</i> countries outside the Common Market.  Taking all those considerations into account, I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have the right Bill, and a very much overdue Bill, but that it is presented to us very definitely for the wrong reason.  If I understand the Minister correctly, the reason for it is that we want to sell more to the Iron Curtain countries. That is, as I hope to show, absolute lunacy, and I shall go into it in detail because I think it necessary to put it on the records of this House that there is a case which proves conclusively that it is absolute lunacy. You cannot sell to the Iron Curtain countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> First of all, I shall deal with the amount at issue.  Two years ago, the gross figure of our imports from those countries was a little over £2,000,000 and we exported a couple of hundred thousand pounds worth of goods to them.  Last year, that figure was doubled and our imports from them were up to almost £4,000,000, and we exported some few hundred thousands of pounds to them.  Last year our private traders bought some £1,000,000 worth of goods from Russia and we were credited with having sold £129,000 worth of goods to Russia, but we did not.  The British Embassy bought a chandelier for their new embassy and that accounted for £125,000.</P>
    <P>We are quite soft towards Poland. We have naturally a tremendous sympathy for the Polish people and the plight in which they find themselves. Some people think that by buying goods from Poland, we are in some way helping them.  Of course we are not because the country is operated as one giant agency, and consequently it does not affect the ordinary people of Poland whether or not we buy from them.  Last year, we bought some £2,000,000 worth from them and they took some £200,000 worth in exchange.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to Czechoslovakia is much the same.  Their glassware is on sale here at ridiculously low prices, and completely undercutting the home products in many cases.  That is the position, and we hope to balance that trade.  In other words, we hope to get a mere £4,000,000 worth of additional outlets in those countries, if we can get them.  With our present total exports of £160,000,000, it might be worth while because £4,000,000 cannot be despised, but £4,000,000 worth of trade in communist countries is not worth a box of matches as I hope to show by going into the position very carefully.</P>
    <P>Their trade is not the type of trade you can develop or hold.  The normal method of trade is to send a salesman with his products to develop an area and get the people accustomed to them, and in that way build up a trade pattern.  What happens in the communist <Col N="704" /> countries?  Suppose we sold 10,000 tons of butter to Russia&mdash;and what a wonderful boon that would have been last spring, and she might have bought it from us.  The following year we would develop some of the other countries and sell perhaps 15,000 tons of butter to them, or they might take our whole butter output.  We go along with those markets and when she has us in her power, bang goes the contract, and the countries with which we used to trade and which we have forsaken for the sake of a slightly better price in the Iron Curtain countries, the countries which we have left high and dry, have been captured by others in the meantime.  That is a dangerous process and I hope that before I finish I will have convinced the Minister to use this Bill effectively to stop this trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the only disadvantage is that we may be contaminated by certain contacts with those countries, that the people going there may be contaminated.  I have no worries about that.  The personal contacts are of little value or significance compared with other contacts which I hope I can show exist. It appears that the first thing we have to establish is whether or not the trade is good.  That seems to be our philosophy.  We have to weigh up the question of trade.  What may appear to be good for the individual trader may not be good for his professional or occupational group.  It may not be good for the group as a whole.  It might have been to the short term advantage of the farmers, say, to have sold butter last spring, but it might not have been for the good of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The nation is a small fragment fitted into Western Europe and consequently there is a necessity for bringing trade under one central control.  We have to ask ourselves then; what are we trading with?  The first thing we have to recognise is that we are trading with Government agencies and that all economic and commercial transactions in those countries are governed by those agencies.  There are no private trading firms with any degree of independence such as we have in our country.  The private trading firms <Col N="705" /> going out from here in the absence of control or restraint have run up these few millions of an adverse balance. Naturally, they have bought at the cheapest price they could and taken advantage of the offer, but in the long run that sort of thing invites disaster.</P>
    <P>In those countries, no sphere of human activity is recognised as lying outside the jurisdiction of the State. That is what we mean by totalitarianism: All is for the State; all is in the State; all is by the State.  We must examine carefully the objectives of those Iron Curtain countries.  One can divide them readily into two groups: one, those that are led, directed and controlled from Moscow; the other, those that are led, directed and controlled from Peking.  There is no other subdivision.  We find that their ultimate objective, their whole reason for existence is to bring about the world revolution and the whole of communist morality means that anything that promotes that world revolution is good and anything that retards it is bad.  There is no objective truth such as we are accustomed to but just this type of dubious communist morality that changes black into white overnight.  It is all based on what they regard as the inevitability of world revolution, the historical necessity for this arising from the dialectic clash between the capitalist world and the proletariat, the property-less classes. They are committed to that.</P>
    <P>That is their philosophy and everything is geared to that, and, as I hope to show, one means of bringing that about in their way of thinking is trade: if you can trade with the West, that is the means by which you undermine the West.  All forms of violence are permissible and have been held to be permissible with one solitary exception: international war involving Russia.  That must not be allowed to happen because that would place Russia, homeland of world revolution, in jeopardy, the homeland from which world revolution must radiate into the free world and encompass it.  It is incompatible with communist thinking that capitalism can exist side by side with it.  We may be fooled by this doctrine of co-existence, <Col N="706" /> but that is not new.  It was proclaimed by Lenin in 1924. It was given a different name then but it went all along the way and finally reached the gasping outside world in 1952 under the name co-existence, and praised as if the big bad Russian leopard of Lenin's period had changed its spots and that the lion and the lamb were going to lie down together in co-existence.</P>

The risk of international war is too great and Russia since 1924 has realised that there are other methods of bringing about the downfall of the free world: the fomentation of strikes, infiltration <Col N="707" /> and propaganda and one of the most effective has been the attack on the economy of the West.</P>
      <P>Now I shall go on to examine this attack in detail.  I have given you the background.  I have not, naturally, been able to go into it in the detail in which it should be examined but I have, I think, said sufficient to show that trade is just another arm of their attack.  This attack is fourfold.  First of all there is the tremendous drive for industrial expansion in Russia, China and the satellite countries.  The second is industrial sabotage in the West by all forms of strikes which in turn raise costs and price the products of these countries out of the market.  I hasten to add here that I am not in any way criticising strike action.  I am referring to the type of communist-inspired strike which is all too frequent on the Continent and in England.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the attacks on trade which we are trying to prevent and which the Bill seeks to prevent.</P>
      <P>The third is the industrialisation of the under-developed areas of the world, in itself a very laudable objective but one into which Russia has poured considerable resources as a means of hastening the undermining of the economy of nations on which the defence of the free world rests.</P>
      <P>The fourth and the real key is selective disruption of trade relations of all countries in the rest of the world. Selective disruption is what we are actually inviting by our present idea of trading with those countries.  One of the most significant facts of the present decade is the emergence of Russia as a world trading power.  Its trade has risen from 250 million dollars in 1938 to over 500 million dollars to-day or a twofold increase.  Like the renunciation of war, the crippling of the economies of the West is an integral part of the Marx-Lenin scheme to bring about world revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the effects of trading with Russia?  The main effect is that once <Col N="708" /> it gets a grip you make your economy dependent on trade with the communist block and this can lead to very undesirable consequences.  First and foremost it can have very severe political consequences and can leave our representatives abroad open to severe political pressures from Russia itself. In Russia, we must realise, there are no trade unions as such.  What are called trade unions are merely departments of the State whose function is to ensure that the orders of the Government are carried out by the workers.</P>

      <P>With due deference, it is.  I am explaining that it puts Russia in a position to charge anything she likes for any produce she wishes to sell.  It does not affect her as a whole, as I shall show, and, consequently, your economy is left wide open when you are buying from her.  She can give one price today; next year it may be up&mdash;she can do anything she wishes. The key to it is the fact that labour has no standing there, so the cost of the product has a purely artificial price assigned to it by the committee itself.</P>
      <P>Certainly, if you take our position today, if we were in such a position, God forbid, where the price assigned to any product could be regulated arbitrarily, then we could sell anywhere we wished&mdash;anything&mdash;provided the people at home were prepared to undergo the privation from the lack of purchasing power that such a policy entailed.  Therefore, you would have no right to strike, no right to protest or to have public agitation. All that is impossible because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>You can undersell or disrupt by dumping in any way possible, and undermine whole sectors of an economy.  Other states&mdash;in fact, all&mdash;have recognised it.  India has a particular corporation for carrying out its trading and she regulates it very <Col N="709" /> carefully.  The Soviet <i>bloc</i> itself is grouped into specialised units for this trade attack and the foremost country in this trade attack is Czechoslovakia which has the precision type of equipment and has become the showcase of the communist world.  Then there is Eastern Germany itself with its industrial equipment; Poland with mining equipment; Rumania with machinery for extracting and refining ore, and so on.  And, so, in that way, the trade can be manipulated up and down in a manner which holds very serious consequences for us.</P>
      <P>If we get into trading with such a group, then let us realise the consequences before we begin.  We can only estimate the consequences from examples of what happened.  For instance, take Russia's trading with Finland, a small country.  In 1952, Finland and Russia concluded a five year trade pact.  In the next few years, their joint trade increased rapidly.  Russia was buying up more and more of Finnish produce until, in 1958, it reached the figure that 17 per cent. of Finland's total exports went to Russia.</P>

      <P>At that stage, a general election was held.  The Finnish Communist Party got 25 per cent. of the seats.  Immediately, they started an agitation for admission into the Cabinet.  Russia reacted by beginning a trade boycott of Finland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving on very rapidly.  I am making the point that, if our trade reached 10 per cent., what then about the pressures to which we could be subjected?  Would our trade be sufficient to withstand the pressure to have a Russian Embassy in Dublin?  Answer that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, take 1957.  Russia has always been a large importer of tin, mainly from China.  In 1957, there was over-production of tin in the <Col N="710" /> world.  Russia could have bought this cheaply and stored up a good supply for the years ahead.  What did she do?  Not alone did she not buy on the over-glutted market but she unloaded 10,000 tons of tin on to that market in 1957 and 17,000 tons in 1958 and sold abroad for a price below the then world price and that was below the price she had paid to China.</P>
    <P>These are factors.  The result was very serious damage to the tin-producing countries&mdash;Bolivia, Malaya, Thailand and Nigeria.  She tried a similar business in England in 1958 with aluminium.  She suddenly offered aluminium on the British market at 25 per cent. below the then prevailing price and she announced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps we would like to happen to us, with our butter, what happened to Egypt with her cotton in 1958.  Russia bought up all Egypt's cotton supply at a price higher than the world price in 1958. Then she immediately sold it in the traditional places where Egypt sold her cotton at a price lower than what she had bought it for in Egypt.  Could she do that to our butter market?  Is that the type of trading we envisage? That is not a matter for laughing.  I <Col N="711" /> do not think Senator Ó Donnabháin need laugh when he hears that.  These are facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Again, we have another very dangerous fact. Apart from this selective disruption of an economy which she can bring about, there is this other fact, which seems a great advantage when trading with her.  All trade balances can be settled in the currency of a Soviet exporter or supporter.  There is no further worry about foreign exchange when we are dealing with Russia.  But those balances in our own currency would then be used to foment communist activity and to pay for it within the borders of the state.  That is how it is done.  It is an established fact that this was how it was done in Japan in the riots when President Eisenhower appeared there in 1960&mdash;and it was paid for by the surplus that remained on China's trading account with Japan.</P>
      <P>Again, it is not very long since we read of the efforts of the communists in Karelia in India to take over the catholic schools there and to impose a communist regime in that little state. Where do the funds come from&mdash;from the surplus on India's trading accounts with Czechoslovakia.  These are facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, we come to Professor Mikoyan.  Perhaps Senator Ó Maoláin will take him seriously when he criticised very severely the spending on armaments in Russia.  His own words are that not only was it more profitable to trade with the West rather than to waste money on armaments but that it was, in itself, all that was needed for the subjection of the world to communism. It is rather disturbing to find that such a statement can be taken so lightly and that we just bury our heads in the sand in the belief that this just could not happen to us.  But we had better take care.  There is only less than a few million pounds involved.  In fact, we are selling less <Col N="712" /> than £500,000 worth and we have bought up to the present something around £4,000,000 worth.  Does anybody suggest for a moment that it is worth any of our efforts or time to send out trade missions to those countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless we take care, surely we realise that selling items to those countries places us in the exact position in which India was placed after selling all her cotton crop and in which the tin producing countries were placed on the unloading of the tin market?  Let us, with the limited finances available to us, devote our time and energies to developing markets in democratic countries in which we can cultivate a taste for our products.  Having made progress in the marketing and research development that is necessary for the establishment of that trade, we would have some hope of its continuation in the future when the market may begin to pay off for the research we have carried out.  After all, we are a small country with only a little to export, and that little surely does not call for having trade missions everywhere in the world.  If England or one of the continental countries was exploited properly they would take more than we could export at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to build any hopes on these Iron Curtain countries, but let us face realities and stop the canker before it becomes too great.  We have our job to do and we should not repeat the mistake made in 1958 and 1959 when we spent a considerable amount cultivating a butter market in England.  We got it going quite successfully but the following year, due to low production, we had nothing worthwhile to sell and we simply ignored the market we had developed in England at great cost the year before.  When we came back the year afterwards, we had to start from <Col N="713" /> scratch.  That surely should be a lesson to us.  It shows us how money spent on marketing research can be squandered. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to use this Bill is the only way that I believe it should be used.</P>
    <P>I intend to move an amendment on the next sitting day to tie the Bill down to the countries for which it is intended. It has been presented to us here as a means to control our trade or, as I say, of eliminating our trade with the Iron Curtain countries.  We have been told there is no intention whatsoever to use it otherwise.  But the Bill gives a blanket permission to apply to any specified country.  Only to-day we had an example of a provision by which a duty could be imposed on a specific article to prevent dumping and an additional penny was put on a packet of cigarettes.  In other words, it was used for a purpose for which it was not intended.  Seven or eight months ago, we sat here and deliberated on the Road Traffic Act and we went into it in great detail. We had resolutions about how this would be used logically and reasonably, but what has been the result? One section alone of the Act, Section 53, is almost bankrupting the State as more and more money is squandered bringing cases to court which, last November, it was the clear intention of this House would never be brought.</P>
    <P>That is an example of intentions, and we might take note of the fact that hell is paved with good intentions. If we as legislators take our duties seriously, we should guard against blanket provisions.  If we mean Iron Curtain countries, let us write it into the Bill, because remember it could be very tempting to use this against other countries also.  The Minister said it is not his intention to use it against countries with which we have trade agreements.  It is not his intention but he cannot speak for his successors and I do not know whether an intention is a binding promise given here. Certainly it is not the type of binding guarantee we need in legislation.  Our trade with many other countries, with Germany, for instance, is imbalanced. Why would not the Minister, in frustration with the lack of success of <Col N="714" /> a trade mission going to Germany, reach for this Bill and say that he would teach them and we would be left with a whole lot of new quotas and orders for the goods we want to import from Germany?  To my mind, this is a form of legislation that should not be accepted by a Parliament that is conscious of its democratic functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deliver a lecture on the same lines as Senator Quinlan.  The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing this Bill and I think it answers the arguments put forward by Senator Quinlan.  There is the evidence that we import some £4 million worth of goods from such countries as against exports to them of some £120,000.  It is to protect us against that that the Minister has brought in this Bill.  I should like the Minister to consider the sentiments expressed by Senator McGuire in regard to the import of commodities from those countries which are already produced within the State.  No concession should be given to those countries to export such commodities to us.  One commodity I have in mind which particularly affects the people in my area is coal.  Coal was imported from Poland at a cheap price and sold in my area where there is an industry employing over 400 people.  It was rather unfortunate that it was allowed free sale and endangered men employed in the State.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to provide in the Bill that where materials are being produced here, no concession will be given to any Iron Curtain countries to export such a commodity to us.  It was put forward that we had certain ties with Poland and that it was a country apart from other Iron Curtain countries. We must remember, however, that the cost of production in Poland was considerably lower than in this country and it was quite easy to have it shipped at low shipping rates and sold in competition with our workers.</P>

As I understand this Bill, the Minister is attempting to pass into law a measure which will strengthen our hand, or the hand of <Col N="715" /> the agency we will have available to try to barter with the communist countries from which we import at the moment.  I listened very carefully to Senator Quinlan because I expected him to make some very definite positive suggestion before he concluded.  I also hoped that he would advise the Minister completely to prohibit imports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from those countries so that we would have no excuse to balance them with exports.  As I understand this business, the imports we were getting from those countries come in at a pretty low price and in some cases with improved quality.  I have discussed this with some foreign people who have been keenly interested in the steps taken by the Minister in this connection.  I am glad to be able to tell the House that those people from Western Germany and France&mdash; they are important people associated with chambers of commerce in those countries&mdash;have told me that the Minister has taken a step in the right direction.  They went so far as to say that they could not understand why the imbalance of trade has been tolerated so long.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated very clearly in his opening address in the Dáil that this Bill is designed to deal with certain trading arrangements with the Iron Curtain countries.  Reference has been made to the bodies known as State agencies which control the exports of those Iron Curtain countries.  My information differs slightly from that.  I understand that the economic structure there is also vested to some extent or taken over by the joint chambers of commerce.  We know that recently representatives of the chambers of commerce from Russia and Poland visited London and conducted trade negotiations with their opposite numbers in that country.  It is a pity that we could not have some contacts with those people and particularly with the chambers of commerce.</P>

If we are prepared to import goods from them&mdash;and it is quite obvious that we can get commodities from them which we cannot get as cheaply or as comfortably from other countries&mdash;we should be prepared also to try to export to those countries certain products which we have here and for which we have no market.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill.  We live in times of considerable competition in trade.  In this Bill the Minister is providing himself with a weapon in trading conditions and he is arming himself with a weapon which he can use to increase our exports.  If it happens that we need raw materials in competitive trading conditions, we must buy those raw materials in the cheapest possible market.  We would have to consider very seriously whether or not we should cease buying raw materials from communist states simply because they are communist. With this Bill, the Minister has an opportunity to buy from them.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree at all with Senator Quinlan in his attitude that we should not trade with the communist countries, and that we should have nothing to do with them, because we will be contaminated by any contact with them.</P>

I was sorry to hear Senator Quinlan expressing what was to me his lack of faith in our system.  Senator Quinlan has one good point.  He stressed that communist trade is governed by state agencies and that if you want to export to communist countries, you must deal with the State agencies; that you cannot go to an ordinary importer and deal with him; you must go through the State organisation.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Minister has an opportunity to deal with those State organisations on the basis of a reciprocal trade.  We live in an age when we are exhorted to export, and there is a market, which is comparatively untapped, for our products.  We have an opportunity to go into that market.  That opportunity should be taken.  In that connection I should like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken to export to those countries to correct this imbalance of trade, and I should also like to ask him how many officials of Córas Tráchtála can speak Russian or Czech or Polish to enable some progress to be made in negotiating with the importing organisations of those countries.</P>

      <P>No; in deference to the Senators who did not desire to discuss the Appropriation Bill at such short notice, I came to the conclusion that it would be better to put it off until next Wednesday.  As a consequence, it may be necessary to meet three days next week, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  I should like to inform the House now of the programme of Bills which it is intended to deal with before we rise. There is of course the Appropriation Bill, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, the State Guarantees (Transport) Bill, the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Bill, the Housing (Loans and Grants) Bill and the Army Pensions Bill.  These are the Bills we propose to deal with before rising for the summer recess.  That is why I had hoped that we would get general agreement on the matter of speed in dealing with the Appropriation Bill to-morrow, but since Senators desire to put it off until next week, we must do that.</P>

      <P>Is it the intention of the Bill to restrict all trade with communist countries or do I understand that a Córas Tráchtála trade mission was sent to Moscow this year? Did I see that on the papers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator McDonald, that is not the intention of of the Bill.  I am glad that most of the Senators who spoke realised that the true purpose of the Bill was to protect our interests in trading in modern conditions. Senator Quinlan suggested that the £4 million worth of goods we imported last year from communist countries or Iron Curtain countries would have made no difference whatever to us if we did not avail of the opportunity to export similar quantities to these countries.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to listen to an ideological lecture from Senator Quinlan but as a member of the Oireachtas, I have to face the facts of life.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have to face the hard economic facts of life and these are many and varied.  The Senator does not have to face day after day, week after week, the problems of traders and manufacturers in this country and not only their problems but the problem of trying to maintain employment. Senator Ross put his finger on the difficulty a few minutes ago when he suggested&mdash;I think I am interpreting him correctly&mdash;that it is only right that our manufacturers should have access to raw materials at the cheapest possible prices in order to make them competitive in an increasingly competitive world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> We are not yet in the Common Market.  We have to face from many of the countries, even friendly countries, from which we import, a dual pricing system.  That dual pricing system is practised by most countries in order to give home industries advantages over similar industries in countries to which they export raw materials.  Its purpose is to keep home industries viable and to see that industries abroad which require similar raw materials to those on which home industries depend are given no advantage. It is a fact that some of these dual pricing systems tend to price our industries out of a state of competitiveness and even for that reason is it not worth our while in our relations with those countries to know that if they will not sell us raw materials at a fair price there are other means at our disposal so that we can maintain employment?</P>
    <P>Is it any use to a man who is put out of employment in the West of Ireland or in a city if we say: we could have got the wherewithal to keep you in employment but we have closed the door against raw materials from communist countries?  This is particularly applicable as our competitors all over the Western world trade with communist countries. Britain and America trade with these countries and Australia and New Zealand are increasing that trade. Are we to isolate ourselves from the possibility of being competitive?  Are we to build around ourselves an economic iron curtain that will price us out of the market in other parts of the world because we refuse raw materials from sources where we could get them cheaply?  I have to face the hard economic facts of life.  The Minister for Agriculture recently would have dearly loved to be able to dispose of his surplus butter in any country in the world if he could get cash for it rather than store it in storage space which was difficult to obtain or sell it off at cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Not very long ago I had an approach from a man who gave employment in a rural town and who had a surplus of a certain agricultural product on his hands.  He bought it in the hope <Col N="721" /> that he could dispose of it in favourable conditions as then existed in a certain favourably disposed country but for some reason he failed to find that outlet he had hoped to get in a communist country and because we had no weapon of our own to induce the communists to buy this raw material from him the man lost a considerable amount of money and because of his indebtedness to the bank and his inability to raise credit he was put out of business and we lost that valuable employment in a rural town.  That is not the kind of exercise I should like to be a party to.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I should not like to assist or in any way contribute to the closing down of an industry if we had a possible chance of making it survive.</P>
    <P>I do not support all of what Senator Quinlan said on the Bill but in case I might be misunderstood I want to say that I detest Godlessness and totalitarianism, particularly the communist type, as much as anybody in the Western world does.  I do not think that is in dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, I want to ensure that we in this country will not put ourselves in such a position as will make us less competitive than like-minded countries who perhaps have a great deal more weapons at their disposal in their fight against communism than we have and which, at least in the material sense, are more active against communism but which nevertheless see some advantage or benefit to themselves in trading with communist countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire said he was satisfied with what I said in the Dáil about the possibility of some conflict with our Common Market obligations.  He possibly overstated it.  I said first of all that so far as I saw it now it would not conflict with our Common Market obligations in that we are applicants for membership because there are existing members of E.E.C. who have provisions similar to this.  What I did say in addition was that I thought it might be necessary for us if we joined the Common Market to have some provision <Col N="722" /> of this nature in our legislation in order to ensure the purposes of the Common Market in effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan said that he was going to put down an amendment because he objected to the type of legislation we were introducing here because some future Minister might not be prepared to treat the provisions of the Bill in the spirit in which they have been introduced.  First of all, it is not for me to designate what Iron Countries are.  I do not know what the extent of them is at the moment.  I do not know, as I said in the Dáil, whether the Iron Curtain itself will recede or expand&mdash;I hope it does not expand. It is far better for us to have a provision in this Bill whereby we can designate any country in an Order rather than set out here and now certain countries some of which, please God, may not be Iron Curtain countries in three or four year's time.  Some countries which we now imagine or hope are non-Iron Curtain countries might in fact be so: they might have Communist infiltration beyond what we might think desirable.</P>
    <P>While I think it is wrong that we should tie our hands by setting out in this Bill the names of Iron Curtain countries or the names of countries which we regard as Iron Curtain countries, there is a provision whereby every Order made under Section 2 shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a Resolution annulling the Order is passed by either House of the Oireachtas, then that is the end of it.  Therefore, no Minister will have a free hand in deciding the countries against which he proposes to operate the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a provision, I know, that some people do not like, a provision to which some of our legislators of recent times have expressed opposition.  However, it is a type of provision which is well known to us in practice and one which has not been abused.  This type of provision has not been abused, to my knowledge, since it was introduced.  I may tell the Senator in advance that if he puts down such an amendment, I shall not accept it.</P>

      <P>This is an Order to amend Quota Order No. 13 which is the Order which enforces a quota in respect of woven woollen, synthetic and artificial fabrics.  Under the Order, the quantities of these fabrics that may be imported are restricted.  There are, of course, provisions whereby supplementary licences are given for bringing in extra quantities, and also a licensing provision whereby fabrics which are not made here may be imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Quota Order, when made, must, under Section 4 (2) of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, be confirmed by a Resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the making of the Order by the Government; similarly with an Order that amends the Quota Order.  Such an amending Order must also be endorsed by both Houses.  The Order to be confirmed in this case is called the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1962. The purpose of the amending Order is to bring within the provisions of the quota foam-backed material which appeared <Col N="724" /> to a considerable extent on the Irish market some months ago.</P>

Tá roinnt feabhasanna eile ann comh maith, go mór-mhór ar an dtaobh cúnaimh shóisialaigh de.</P>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to give effect as from 1st August next to the rate increases in non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions and in unemployment assistance announced in the Budget and to make improvements in the contributory schemes also foreshadowed in the Budget.  Apart from this the opportunity has been taken to include a number of new proposals in the Bill for the further improvement of the social welfare codes.  These additional features are mainly in relation to social assistance.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to the Budget increases by providing for an increase of two shillings and sixpence per week in all the existing rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions; the new rates will be 32/6d., 27/6d., 22/6d., and 17/6d. a week, according to means as set out in Section 2 which also provides for two additional rates regarding which I shall have a word or two to say later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All unemployment assistance recipients will also get an increase of 2/6d. a week for themselves, and they <Col N="725" /> will get the same extra amount for an adult dependant as well.  Where the recipient has dependent children the weekly allowance for the first child is being increased from 8/- in urban areas and from 7/- in rural areas to 10/- in all areas; the allowance for the second child is being increased from 7/- in urban areas and 6/- in rural areas, to 10/- in all areas, and the allowance for the third and subsequent children is being increased from 2/6d. to 5/- in all areas.  This will mean that a man who is on unemployment assistance and who has a wife and, for example, four dependent children, will get an extra 15/- a week from the beginning of August if he lives in an urban area.  A man with a similar family in a rural area will get an increase of 17/-.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of widows' non-contributory pension is being increased by 2/6d. and the weekly allowance for the second qualified child is being raised by 1/- to 10/-.  This will mean a weekly increase of 3/6d. for a non-contributory widow pensioner with two or more qualified children.  These increases are provided for in Section 4 which also contains other provisions which I shall later explain.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated the Bill proposes to make other substantial concessions in the assistance schemes apart from the Budget increases in present rates which I have outlined. The extension and alteration in favour of recipients of the means limits for old age, blind and widows' non-contributory pensions and for unemployment assistance is provided for in Sections 2, 4 and 5, to complement the successive increases made in the rates of payment in recent years, as well as the grant, in 1960, of an allowance for each dependent child of widow pensioners and of unemployment assistance recipients, instead of for the first two such children only.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for two additional rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, that is to say, 12/6d. and 7/6d. and a corresponding extension of the means scale from the existing upper limit of £104 15s. a year to a new yearly limit of £130 15s.  At present, a person with <Col N="726" /> means just under £104 15s. gets a pension of 15/- per week, which is being raised to 17/6d. in this Bill, while a person with means just over £104 15s. gets nothing.  In future persons with means between £104 15s. and £117 15s. and between £117 15s. and £130 15s. will get pensions of 12/6d. and 7/6d. per week respectively.  The number of new pensioners under this provision is expected to be about 3,000.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment assistance, the present yearly means limit is a fixed sum of £100, that is, 38/5d. a week, irrespective of the size of the family of the applicant.  Owing to the many improvements made in the rates of unemployment assistance in recent years the fixed means limit gives rise to inequality in the treatment under the scheme of certain family men with means&mdash;particularly in the rural areas. For example, in a rural area, a man with a wife and two child dependants who has the maximum means of 38/5d. a week from a small farm is just inside the scheme, and would qualify from next month for 20/6d. a week unemployment assistance on the basis of the increased rates provided for in Section 3 of this Bill.  The amount payable would become 40/6d. if there were six children, and would rise further by 5/-for each other child after the sixth. If, however, the means of any applicant are even slightly over the present limit of 38/5d. a week the person is outside the scope of the scheme altogether as it now stands and would not be entitled to any payment, so that in certain circumstances a very slight increase in means could result in a considerable drop in income by the complete loss of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>To correct this kind of anomaly, Section 5 provides for a new self-adjusting means limit, which would make special allowance for each child dependant of an applicant and would automatically move upward in line with increases granted from time to time in the rates of unemployment assistance.  Under this section and Section 3 a number of persons with families, who are at present outside the scope of unemployment assistance by reason of their means will qualify <Col N="727" /> for weekly rates of assistance ranging downward from 40/6d. for a six-child family in a rural area, and downward from 48/6d. for a similar family in an urban area, with an extra 5/- a week in each case for each child after the sixth.  The new yearly means limit for a six-child family in both urban and rural areas would be £214 10 0&mdash;as against £100 at present &mdash;and the rate of assistance payable would depend on the means of the applicant within that new limit.  It is expected that about 1,000 persons, mainly in the rural areas, will benefit from this improvement in the means limit.</P>
    <P>An extension of the means limit is also proposed in regard to widows' non-contributory pensions.  The increases provided for in this Bill will allow widows with yearly means at the present permissible limit of £130 15s. 0d. to qualify for minimum pensions.  A widow with means just above the present limit of £130 15s., no matter how many children she may have, does not now qualify for any pension.  To remedy this situation, Section 4 also proposes to modify further the existing table of means and pension rates to provide a table in which the present overriding means limit of £130 15s. would be replaced by a scale of variable means limits related directly to the number of qualified children in the family.  The proposed new scale proceeds in £13 steps from £130 15s. upwards and mainly benefits widows with large families.  For example, a widow with four dependent children and means not in excess of, say, £169 15s. a year, that is 65/6d. a week, will get a pension of at least 21/- a week as against nothing at present.  About 400 would benefit under the proposal.</P>
    <P>I now come to a group of four amendments affecting the assistance services, two of which in Section 6 and part of Section 7, are intended to facilitate and encourage the rehabilitation of certain handicapped persons for employment.  It has been represented to me that there are recipients of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, who, having, for <Col N="728" /> example, recovered from an illness such as tuberculosis, are not fit to resume their normal occupation and are anxious to find an alternative.  These persons can be rehabilitated and trained for some other occupation suitable to their diminished capacity but the law as it stands operates to prevent them from continuing to receive unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit during a training course.  The Bill proposes to relax certain provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts in favour of such persons while they are undergoing training with any organisation approved of by the Minister for Health for the purposes of the provision of such training.  Section 6 of the Bill therefore will enable persons receiving approved rehabilitation training to fulfil the prior conditions for entitlement to unemployment assistance apart from their means position namely to be regarded as unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  It is my intention to make a similar concession in relation to unemployment benefit, but this can be achieved by the amendment of existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 7 includes an amendment associated with Section 6.  Where trainees receive weekly allowances from the training organisation, such allowances would, unless it were specifically provided otherwise, be reckonable as means so that the amount of unemployment assistance payable during training could be reduced considerably, or even cease altogether, in such cases with the result that the concession provided in the previous section would be rendered largely ineffective.  It is proposed, therefore, that any such training allowance should be excluded altogether in the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes and Section 7 includes provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>Apart from the primary humanitarian motive for these concessions, the House will readily see that unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit paid in such circumstances, as well as, in many cases, being expenditure of an immediately productive kind during training, can be an investment likely to result <Col N="729" /> eventually in greater gain to the community, since it will afford to the persons in question the chance of being able to take up regular employment again after training instead of having to depend on unemployment assistance for, possibly, the remainder of their potential working lives.</P>
    <P>Two other amendments of the law are proposed in the Bill with the object of aiding efforts by voluntary bodies to assist certain handicapped persons to restore their morale through useful work.  These amendments provide for disregarding, within limits, certain earnings of such persons in assessing means for unemployment assistance and for non-contributory old age and widow's pensions purposes.  The earnings in question are those arising from work done in their own homes by persons affected in one way or another by physical or mental handicap on materials provided by organisations operating schemes which are charitable in character and purpose.  Representations have been made to me on behalf of one such organisation&mdash;a co-operative guild founded a few years ago in Dublin by a religious order&mdash; that the application of the means test is discouraging or preventing the kind of person they are interested in from participating in such work because the people are afraid of losing their social assistance payments.  Those concerned with the scheme have good reason to believe that the work has a profound and beneficial psychological effect on the morale of the persons participating. I am satisfied that a relaxation of the means tests is justified in the case of persons participating in schemes of this kind and that it is desirable that the praiseworthy social service being undertaken by voluntary charitable organisations providing such work should be facilitated.  Accordingly, Section 7 also proposes the disregard of earnings of this kind of up to £104 a year for unemployment assistance purposes.  Because non-contributory old age and widow pensioners can already have means of approximately £1 a week, apart from any other special disregards applicable, without affecting title to full pension, Section 14, which deals with non-contributory <Col N="730" /> old age and widows' pensions, limits the additional disregard now proposed under these schemes to £52 a year, as against £104 for unemployment assistance. The people affected by the proposed amendments will in most cases, have their full earnings from such a source disregarded.  It is intended by amending existing Regulations to put persons in receipt of social insurance benefits on the same footing in relation to work of this kind.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendment relating to the assistance services is contained in Section 8, which provides for altering the statutory provision relating to the cessation of the pension of the non-contributory widow where she is under 48 years of age when the last child for whom an allowance in addition to pension is payable ceases to be a qualified child.  At present, if a non-contributory widow has not attained the age of forty-seven years and six months when the allowance in respect of her last qualified child ceases to be payable for any reason, her personal pension ceases six months afterwards. It is proposed that the age requirement for the purposes of this provision should be reduced from 48 to 40 years. Experience of the operation of the present provision has shown that hardship was inflicted on the widow who was over 40 years of age but who had not attained 48 years of age when her last qualified child reached 16 years. I think it will be generally agreed that a widow who, up to the age of forty, has to look after young children, should not, thereafter, be deprived of pension.  At that age, her chances of re-entering remunerative employment in a highly competitive labour market are not good.  If she is able to obtain employment which will leave her in no need of assistance from the State the means scale will come into play to disqualify her or to reduce her pension as may be appropriate to the case. It is estimated that about 120 widows will benefit from this amendment.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Bill relating to the social insurance scheme.  Section 13 provides for an increase of 5/- weekly in the basic personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, <Col N="731" /> widow's (contributory) pension, orphan's (contributory) allowance and old age (contributory) pension.  It also provides that the allowance for an adult dependant, where payable with any of those benefits, shall be increased by 5/-, and that the special rate of disability and unemployment benefit for married women and persons under 18 years shall be increased by 4/-. Allowances for each qualified child, where payable with any of those benefits, go up by 3/-.  The rate of benefit payable to a surviving adult dependant of a deceased old age (contributory) pensioner is also being increased, by 5/-, under Section 11, to keep it in line with the rate of adult dependant's allowance.  The increased rates of disability and unemployment benefit and maternity allowance and of any associated dependants' allowances will come into effect on the first Monday in 1963, that is 7th January, 1963, from which date new rates of contribution will also operate.  The new rates of widow's (contributory) pension, orphan's (contributory) allowance, old age (contributory) pension and survivor's benefit, and any allowances payable with them, will come into effect on the first Friday in 1963, that is to say, 4th January, 1963, the first normal payday in the New Year.</P>
    <P>These increases in benefits are substantial and their effect can best be shown by some examples.  An insured man with a wife and four dependent children will receive £5 4s. 6d. a week when ill or unemployed as compared with £4 2s. 6d. at present, an increase of 22/- or almost 27 per cent.  A widow in receipt of widow's (contributory) pension who has four dependent children will receive £4 2s. a week as compared with £3 5s. at present, an increase of 17/-, or 26 per cent.  A married man receiving full old age (contributory) pension which include an allowance for his wife will receive £4 a week as against £3 10s. at present, an increase of 10/- or over 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that these increased rates of benefit will increase expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund heavily and an increase in rates of contribution by employers and <Col N="732" /> insured persons is, therefore, unavoidable. New rates of employment contributions effective from the 7th January, 1963, are provided for in Section 12.  An increase of 1/6d. per week, or 9d. each for employer and insured person, is the most that will be required.  This increase applies only to those contributions which count for all benefits.  Contributions which give title to limited benefits are being increased by an amount related to the cost of the increases in those benefits only.  A special concession is being made, however, in the case of male agricultural workers who, although covered for all benefits, will only be charged 1/- extra of which 6d. will be payable by the employer.  The effect of these contribution increases will be seen from a few examples.  The ordinary male worker at present paying 4/6d. per week will pay 5/3d. while his employer will pay a similar amount.  An ordinary female worker will pay 4/2d. instead of 3/5d. a week and her employer will pay 4/11d. instead of 4/2d., that is, an extra 9d. each.  The male agricultural worker will pay 3/-, as will his employer, as against 2/6 each at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, a word or two about the cost of the various proposals.  In relation to Social Assistance the total costs are £1,377,000 in a full year and £925,000 in the current financial year, all of which will be borne by the Exchequer.  The social insurance proposals will cost £2,823,000 in a full year, of which the increases in the contributions by employers and workers is estimated to yield about two-thirds, namely, £1,882,000, leaving £941,000 to be borne by the State.  In the current year the cost to the Exchequer of the increases in insurance benefits will be about £235,000.  Accordingly, the overall cost to the Exchequer will be £2,318,000&mdash;nearly two and one-third million pounds &mdash; in a full year and £1,160,000 in the present year.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in recommending this measure to Seanad Éireann.  I am sure that Senators will give it speedy and favourable consideration so that its social assistance provisions can be put into effect, as proposed, on the first day of next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to make a Second Reading speech on this Bill because it must necessarily be welcomed by everyone.  It does some measure of justice&mdash;tardy justice some people would say &mdash; to a variety of citizens who, through no fault of their own, cannot provide entirely for themselves. The cost of living has increased; wages and salaries have increased; and living standards have been raised.  It is natural, and indeed just and equitable, that social welfare beneficiaries should not be left behind.</P>
      <P>The Second Reading of a Bill is intended to deal with the principle of the Bill and not, I suggest, with the details.  The principle of the Bill is that certain increases are being made in social benefits, and certain measures are being taken to remedy defects and injustices which have revealed themselves. I am not criticising him personally because he is following a practice pursued by his colleagues over the years, but the Minister might have reserved for Committee Stage the details which he has given us.  The Bill is putting into law certain provisions made by the Minister for Finance in the Budget.  It contains amendments of the law and increases which only the Government could introduce and for anybody here, or, indeed, in the other House, to seek to improve these benefits is impossible under Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>In an inflationary period, no class is harder hit than those living on fixed incomes, no matter how substantial they may be, and those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Social welfare benefits, in the nature of things, lag behind increases in costs, in prices and in wages.  The Bill itself contains added burdens for contributors, employees and employers, which eventually must be made up by increases in prices to some extent, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes some way&mdash;not the whole way&mdash;to make up the difference between the position of social welfare beneficiaries and other classes of the community.  It must be accepted on Second Reading and no doubt in Committee. Since it is an omnibus <Col N="734" /> measure, anybody who wants information, expresses dissatisfaction or makes suggestions can do so, although everybody knows that the amount of money allocated, which is over £2 million, is very unlikely to be increased and so the position one really is in with a measure of this kind is that, however unsatisfactory it may appear in certain parts, it is a desirable measure and should be welcomed.  With the nature of world economics at the moment and of Irish economics as part of world economics, it would appear that this will by no means be the last Bill of this kind.  Personally, I welcome it and welcome it on behalf of those for whom I speak and will leave over any questions of detail for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill and particularly on bringing in such a comprehensive Bill.  Most of us, when we heard this Bill was being introduced, thought it would be the usual measure to implement the decisions in the Budget of the Minister for Finance and I am glad that instead the Minister for Social Welfare has made a review of the general structure of social welfare benefits and has decided to remedy certain anomalies which existed in the legislation passed some years ago.</P>
      <P>In particular, I welcome the extension of the means limits.  Some of these limits are entirely unrealistic and out of date in present-day conditions. I congratulate the Minister on those extensions and particularly on the differentials, that is, that where there are dependants, there is a sliding scale such as has been introduced in other circumstances from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is doing a good job on the whole code, but there is one point which he might find time to look into and do something about: the assessment of the means of certain types of workers.  If a man is employed on a weekly wage, it is possible to obtain a qualification certificate for unemployment purposes, though he may have a high wage like £15 or £20 a week.  If he is engaged in manual labour, there is scarcely any <Col N="735" /> limit.  He can apply for a qualification certificate which is a prerequisite for obtaining unemployment assistance. But if his brother happens to work as a sub-contractor, it is very different.  I know instances of fishermen employed by a fish vendor or of men employed by farmers to fish a river, to make drains, fences or roads on a system of sub-contract and they will fail to get a qualification certificate. Under the present system, different conditions apply to the man who is self-employed and to the ordinary wage earner.</P>
    <P>There are many districts in the country where people of the working classes can get employment only on a task basis.  A farmer who lives ten miles away comes to a workman living down at a bog the farmer owns and offers him so much to cut and save the quantity of turf he wants.  He may pay £20 or £30.  If the worker gets four or five of these operations and if he fishes for a month or two, his unemployment assistance is reduced. If there is a re-calculation of his means, he will fail to establish that his income in sufficiently low to qualify for unemployment assistance and that was never the intention.  Why it is calculated on that basis, I do not know.  There may be good reason, but I can quote cases to the Minister which, particularly in view of the scarcity of labour in the country, the difficulty of getting suitable labour, prove that the system should be revised.  Take a tailor who works for a master tailor.  He often works on a seasonal basis and may be out for two or three months, but he finds it impossible to get a qualification certificate to enable him to get assistance. If he got a weekly wage, he could have more money and still get a qualification certificate for the full amount.  I suggest that the Minister might examine that position which it is not beyond his power to correct.  If he rectified it, he would relieve a lot of hardship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like also to support the Bill.  I realise that the increases provided in the Bill are not very large, especially when compared <Col N="736" /> with the allowances that operate in a welfare state, but I do not think we have any intention here of competing with the conditions in a welfare state.</P>
      <P>I consider our whole approach here to the question of health and social welfare to be an excellent compromise between the comprehensive system of a welfare state, on the one hand, and the exclusively private enterprise system obtaining elsewhere, on the other.  I had occasion a few months ago in a lecture in the United States to explain our system of health and social welfare on this basis and in spite of the fact that the system of private enterprise is almost sacrosanct there and that my audience was largely a medical one, I was very intrigued to find that I got a large measure of support for the type of service we have here.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill, as the Minister pointed out, give us the opportunity of increasing &mdash; not very substantially, it is true, but still increasing&mdash;various allowances and pensions. Though they may not in certain cases be a very great deal, the Minister, as we know, has only a very limited amount of funds to dispose of and he has disposed of them, as far as I can see, quite fairly.  Increases of from ten to 30 per cent. in present pensions are not entirely insignificant and I think it of even greater importance that he has raised the ceiling above which persons are not eligible to receive pensions or allowances under the Bill and its predecessors.  This has always been a headache to me.</P>
      <P>I serve on a number of boards of schools, hospitals, and so on.  From time to time, we have an employee who has served long and faithfully.  If we give him a small pension, no matter how small it is&mdash;it is miserably small, anyway&mdash;it seems unfair that what he has a right to expect by way of some form of allowance in the State system may be reduced.  The increases in this ceiling will be welcomed not only by the people who receive the benefits of them directly but also by all of us who have to work in such connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us with medical connections will welcome what the Minister has done about the earnings of people who <Col N="737" /> are undergoing rehabilitation and who are engaged in what one might call occupational therapy.  The Minister is quite right when he says that the value of the work done by people undergoing rehabilitation is greatly increased, psychologically if it brings them in a little money.  The amounts are never very large.  They work in sheltered workshops.  They work at piecework at home.  They earn a little money. If that can be retained by them, without affecting the amount they can expect from allowances from the State it considerably helps their improvement and treatment.</P>
    <P>I have no major criticisms of these sections at all.  I should like very strongly to support the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small point of which I should like the Minister to take note, if not in this Bill then perhaps at some future time.  It concerns the method of calculating the means of old age pensioners or widows.  We have been trying over the past number of years to encourage people to save. There have been circulars, advertisements, and so on, published to encourage people to save.  A person who comes to pensionable age has perhaps saved £1,000.  A husband or a husband and wife may have saved that much and the wife suddenly becomes a widow and there is £1,000 saved. The calculation of means for an old age pension or a widow's pension is not based on what that £1,000 would bring in to the widow&mdash;perhaps five or six per cent.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I have not the details here as I did not expect this Bill to come on today.  The calculation goes something like this: The first £25 is ignored.  Then some hundreds of pounds are calculated at ten per cent. and the next few hundred pounds are calculated at 20 per cent. or 25 per cent.  That calculation is totally unrealistic. In other words, the person is encouraged to liquidate the £1,000 or the £100 or whatever he or she may have straightaway or else have to settle for a very much reduced pension or no pension at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a widow at perhaps 48 or 50 years of age.  There might be £1,000 or £800, and so on. <Col N="738" /> The income from that amount is calculated by this absolutely unrealistic method.  The point is that the widow is encouraged to spend that money or else she will not get the full pension or she will not get even the interest that that money would bring into her in the normal course of events.</P>
    <P>We should encourage these people to keep their money invested in State loans, for instance, in this country. Surely, at the most, the income should be calculated at the highest amount she would get if the money were invested in State loans in this country?  It is very wrong for those people to be more or less encouraged to liquidate a nest egg which they would like to keep. Surely that money, being invested in the country, is of some advantage elsewhere to the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst it is important to pass this measure and to facilitate the Minister in arranging for payment, I would at the same time point out that in the 1955 Budget 2/6 was given to old age pensioners.  At that time the Government argued that it was the same as what we are now calling a mean increase in this year's Budget.</P>
      <P>An examination of the prevailing prices of essential commodities at the relevant dates shows that 2/6 in 1955 meant a great deal more than it does now.  A representative selection of prices might bear me out.  I shall give the prices prevailing at mid-May, 1955, and at mid-February, 1962.  At mid-May, 1955, butter was 3/9 per lb. as against 4/7 in mid-February, 1962; milk 5d. per pint as against 6½d.  The price of the 2 lb. loaf which was 9d. in 1955 is now 1/4.  Flour cost 4/2½d. per stone in 1955 while in mid-February of this year it cost 8/3.  Tea which cost 4/11¾ per lb. in 1955 cost 6/2¼ per lb. in mid-February, 1962. That is a low-priced tea.  It is not the dearest class of tea.  We could quote other figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rise in contributions by both employer and employee in respect of social welfare makes a big difference. In 1960, the normal contribution of both employer and employee, in respect of both male and female workers, was raised by 1/9d.  In return, unemployment <Col N="739" /> and disability benefits were raised by 2/6d., maternity allowance by 5/-, widow's pension by 5/-, orphan's allowance by 3/- and the contributory old age pension of 40/- per week was introduced, with 28/6 for a dependent wife.</P>
    <P>With regard to the insurance provisions of the Bill, it might be noted that the Minister is not expecting the new benefits to add anything to his contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  Under the 1952 Social Welfare Act, the Minister contributed the difference between income and expenditure to this fund.  In fact, he expects to have to pay £80,000 less towards the fund during 1962-63 than he did in 1961-62.  This certainly shows that the increased benefits are no generous gesture on the part of the Government. They will be more than paid for by the increased contributions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the assistance provisions of the Bill, the total increase in the estimate for social assistance is £264,000, from £18,926,000 in 1961-62 to £19,190,000 in 1962-63&mdash;not a very generous increase considering the figures involved.  I could continue to quote figures.  There was a broadcast to the effect that the position is that since 1958 tax revenue has gone up £32,000,000 whereas only £2,000,000 more has been spent on social welfare. In 1958, 5/- in the £ of tax revenue was spent on social welfare whereas this year the figure is only 4/- in the £.  The recent Budget provided for a tax revenue increase of nearly £10,000,000 and only one-tenth of this increase is devoted to social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few very general remarks at this stage.  Like some of the other speakers, I welcome this Bill.  I should like to make it clear that I welcome it in the sense that any social welfare measure improving the lot of the social welfare classes must be welcomed.  I welcome it, I regret to have to say, in the sense that half a loaf is better than no bread.  This no doubt represents the proportion of the increased national income which the social welfare classes <Col N="740" /> are receiving and about which we have heard a considerable amount recently. I submit that an increase of 2/6 per week to the old age pensioners against the background of a Budget which increased the price of several commodities which might be regarded as necessaries in present day circumstances, such as the pint and the cigarette, in the light of a budget that preceded it which increased the price of postage stamps, and in the light of another budget subsequent to the normal Budget which increased the price of cigarettes by a further penny, is anything but generous and is not the figure which was anticipated by some people.  Furthermore, these people have to wait from the date of the Budget some months ago until 1st August to get the increase.  It is true that the contributory social welfare classes have done slightly better under the provisions of this Bill but, if they have they have done so at the expense of the employers.</P>
      <P>I should like to join in the appeal made by Senator Cole that the method of assessing savings for the purpose of the means test for old age pension should be revised at once.  It is absurd that an old age pensioner who has managed to save £1,000 should have that £1,000 assessed.  It is an unreal method of assessment.  The old age pensioner who is not married can have about £600 and get the full old age pension but after £600 this artificial valuation comes into force and he or she is presumed to be earning 10 per cent. on that amount.  Everybody knows that the most one can earn under the best terms offered by the State is six per cent.  I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Cole that these people should be encouraged to save and that savings within reason should be given a factual valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish first of all to express thanks to the Senators who have spoken, for the manner in which they approached this Bill.  There was some criticism but we have to expect some criticism.  It is easy for Senators to talk contemptuously of 2/6 for non-contributory old age pensioners but unfortunately I have to think of that <Col N="741" /> 2/6 in terms of the £783,000 that that aspect of this Bill alone will cost the State in a full financial year.  The Government have to approach the matter from the point of view of raising the money.  There is no source open to the Government from which to get this money except the community, in some form or other whether from the general taxpayer or by way of contributions from insured workers and the employers.  All the money spent on the various social services is raised in that way.  Naturally, therefore, in considering what increases it is possible to give the Government have to consider the capacity of the community to provide the money in these three ways.</P>
      <P>The provision we have made in this one year for increases in social welfare payments is fairly substantial. As I said, the State's contribution in the full financial year as a result of the measures in this Bill will be an extra £2,318,000 and as a result of what is being done the recipients of social welfare payments in general will benefit by an extra £4,200,000, that is taking into account contributions from employers and employees plus the amount provided by the Exchequer. Of course the total amount comes from the people.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say, as Senator Hayes said, that social welfare payments are lagging behind the increases that have taken place in the cost of living.  The figures show they have more than kept pace with the increase in the cost of living.  I feel what the Senator really had in mind is that they still lagged behind the rates we would consider sufficient to provide a reasonably adequate standard of living.  We all realise, of course, that it would be desirable to raise all these payments further.  This Government have been gradually improving the situation of the recipients of social welfare benefits generally in comparison with the cost of living, according as the state of the economy has been improving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the assessment of capital for purposes of non-contributory pensions has been mentioned.  I must admit that when I first became Minister <Col N="742" /> I was somewhat of the same opinion as Senator Cole and Senator Fitzpatrick but when I looked into the matter I realised it was not, as the Senators think, an unrealistic way to assess capital and not an unfair way. The manner in which it is assessed is that the first £25 is ignored; the next £375 is assessed at five per cent. and the remainder at 10 per cent.  The figure that an applicant for a non-contributory widow's pension, or an old age pension, can have and still qualify for the full pension is £720.  A married couple, both applying for a non-contributory pension, can have double that amount.  The reason I say it is not unfair is that an annuity purchased by a person over 70 years of age would earn a greater rate than the income that is assessed for capital according to the provisions I have specified.  Therefore it is a fact that capital in the hands of applicants for these pensions does in fact represent a greater income than the income that is assessed according to the rules laid down.  Of course, if the people concerned have saved that money for the purpose of passing it on to their heirs, needless to say, it does not represent any income to them. On the other hand, if they saved it in order to provide for their old age, or some misfortune, they can get a greater income from it than is assessed according to the rules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing may not apply in the case of a young widow.  I do not know exactly what is the rate of the annuity for younger widows.  Senator Desmond referred to the fact that there was a 2/6 increase in the non-contributory old age pensions in 1955, and appeared to suggest that because of the fact that practically all commodities were cheaper at that time, something more was done by the Government then.  That argument, I think, is not a legitimate one because, in 1955, no other social welfare recipients were aided except the non-contributory widows.  This year, we have provided substantial increases for every class of social welfare recipient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, by doing that, we have arranged that an extra £4,200,000 <Col N="743" /> will be available for the recipients of social welfare payments.  That is quite a considerable effort in the redistribution of income in favour of the necessitous classes of the community to make in any one year.  I ask Senators, therefore, to pass this Bill in order that we will be able to make these payments as arranged on the first day of next month.</P>
