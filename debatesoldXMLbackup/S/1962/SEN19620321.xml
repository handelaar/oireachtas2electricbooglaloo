    <Title>Cement (Amendment) Bill, 1962&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will see, this Bill is for the purpose of repealing Part III of the Cement (Amendment) Act, 1938.  This Part of the Act, which incorporates Sections 12 to 17, inclusive, is concerned solely with the importation of cement. Section 13 provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to import cement for use in this country save under a licence issued by me in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the Act.</P>
      <P>Cement Ltd. are the sole manufacturers of cement in the State and have been able to supply the home market in full since the Cement Act was passed in 1938, apart from certain periods of unusual supply difficulties, such as that of the World War, when it was necessary to license some imports.  The company have, in addition, built up a substantial export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company now wish to prepare for the conditions of free trading <Col N="119" /> which will prevail in the event of our joining the European Economic Community and are planning to consolidate the industry both technically and financially.  They have represented to me that it is desirable to replace the existing prohibition on imports of cement by the customs duty of 30 per cent., full rate, and 20 per cent., preferential rate, which was imposed by Government Order some time ago, but which, of course, has not so far been applied.  Having considered the implications of the company's representations in all their aspects, I am fully satisfied that it is necessary for the good of the industry and in the national interest, that the existing import control arrangements should be terminated and should be replaced, as proposed, by the lesser degree of protection afforded by the customs duty.</P>
    <P>Cement, Ltd. consider that even though the customs duty of 30 per cent.  (full) and 20 per cent.  (preferential) on cement will, under Common Market conditions, have to be stepped down, and eventually disappear, the protection of the duty should be sufficient to allow the company to consolidate itself in the intervening period to meet any competition, except aggressive dumping.</P>
    <P>Except in so far as it may become necessary to offset increased costs which are outside the control of the company, Cement, Ltd. have undertaken not to increase their home market prices, which, I understand, compare favourably at present with cement prices in Britain and on the Continent.</P>
    <P>As from the 5th March, 1962, Cement, Ltd. increased its prices for cement on the home market by amounts varying from 3s. 9d. per ton to 4s. 9d. per ton, according to delivery zone.  The reasons for these increases have been investigated and I am satisfied that they were necessary to offset increased costs.</P>
    <P>Employment in the factories of the company will not be adversely affected by the new arrangements.  On the contrary it may be anticipated that the strengthening of the company's finances and the improvement of its <Col N="120" /> technical efficiency will safeguard the employment of the workers.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its early passage through all Stages so that Cement, Limited, may be in a position to proceed with their plans as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to us to be a desirable measure.  It is a step towards the liberalisation of the tariff policy which is part of the scheme of the European Economic Community. If it results, as the Minister says it will result and as we hope it will result, in an improvement of the position of the Cement Company, that, naturally, is something we would all desire and agree with.  As far as I can see, the Bill is in tone with the spirit of the time and it is desirable in the interests of the company and in the interests of the people in general, including the employees of the company.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister and looked at the Bill, I must confess I still find it very hard to understand the reasons for it.  I note particularly that the Minister is assuring the House that the passage of this Bill and the change which will result will not interfere with the employment of the workers of Cement, Limited, and will likely make their employment more secure.  Because of that assurance, I am not raising any objection whatever to the passage of the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Short Titles Bill, 1961&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate purpose of the Bill is to assign short titles to certain statutes so as to facilitate their citation.  The statutes affected are those of pre-Union Irish parliaments and pre-Union English statutes applied to Ireland. <Col N="121" /> These are, in effect, the only statutes applying here which have not already got short titles.  Short titles are provided for in all Acts of the Oireachtas and in British Acts passed since the 1880s.  Short Title Acts of 1892 and 1896 assigned such titles to earlier British statutes.</P>
      <P>The Bill is also intended as a first step in the process of statute law revision.  The purpose of such revision is, first, the publication of a Chronological Table of all the statutes which affect or have in the past affected the territory which is now the State as well as a Comprehensive Index of all the statutes now in force, and, secondly, the ultimate publication of a modern edition of the entire body of statute law such as was published in the Six Counties in 1956.  The most recent edition of the pre-Union Irish statutes is that prepared by William F. Cullinan, Irish office, Westminster, and published in 1885.  The body of statute law in Cullinan has, of course, been reduced.  Many statutes have been repealed in whole or in part by subsequent legislation.  Many of them are long since spent.  Many were already clearly obsolete when that edition was being prepared.  Others were repealed by implication as being inconsistent with the Constitution or have been superseded by our own Acts. There remains, however, a body of statute law which, though in some respect archaic, is, nevertheless, regarded as being in force; and it is clear that its publication in an up-to-date revised edition is a matter of considerable importance.  This Bill, by providing a convenient guide to the extant pre-1800 statute law and to the condition in which it stands today on the Statute Book is, as I have already said, a first step in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill, statutes that have been repealed are naturally not included. Statutes which, although not expressly repealed, are clearly obsolete or which are repealed by implication (as being inconsistent with the Constitution) are not included either.  Where, however, there appears to be any doubt as to whether a statute is obsolete or not it has been listed.  The assignment of a short title to any particular statute should not, therefore, be taken as <Col N="122" /> implying that it is still operative.  If, having regard to subsequent legislation or to the Constitution or for any other reason, the particular statute is no longer alive, its inclusion in this Bill will not operate to revive it.  Conversely, the omission of a particular statute will not affect the question as to whether or not it is still in force. Local and personal Acts are not included.  A further Bill providing for the repeal of such obsolete or unnecessary pre-Union Irish statutes or parts of such statutes has been prepared in the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, and I hope to be in a position to introduce it later this year.</P>
    <P>The statutes to which short titles are being assigned by the present Bill are set out in three Schedules.  The First Schedule contains the pre-Union Irish statutes, i.e. Acts passed by a parliament sitting in Ireland at any time before the coming into force of the Union with Ireland Act, 1800. With one exception I do not propose to comment on the individual statutes which are given short titles; there are 132 of them in all.  The exception is the statute to which we are giving the short title Poynings' Act, 1495.  That statute is Chapter 22 of 10, Henry the Seventh, which provided for the application to Ireland of all English statutes &ldquo;concerning or belonging to the common and publique weal&rdquo;. The statute in question is not, however, the Poynings' Law of our history books.  Poynings' Law is an entirely different statute, namely, Chapter 4 of 10, Henry the Seventh, which, Senators will recall, provided that no Irish Parliament could be held until the legislation proposed to be enacted by that Parliament had been sent to the English Council and returned under the English great seal.  This statute was repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act, 1878 and so, while its place in the history books is secure, it no longer has a place on the Statute Book.  It does not fall to be given a short title in this Bill.  The terms Poynings' Law and Poynings' Act have, in the past, been employed ambiguously both by historians and lawyers, but by assigning the short title Poynings' Act, 1495, to Chapter <Col N="123" /> 22 of 10, Henry the Seventh, this Bill should put an end to the ambiguity so far as legal usage is concerned.</P>
    <P>The statutes which are regarded as having been applied to Ireland by Poynings' Act, 1495, are set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill and they are classified into those dealing with distress (that is the taking, without legal process, of a personal chattel of a wrongdoer by the person aggrieved as a pledge, such as seizure of cattle for non-payment of rent), administration of estates of deceased persons, infants' land, forcible entry on lands, and fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule to the Bill lists the English statutes applied to Ireland by an Act of 1634, now to be cited as the Maintenance and Embracery Act, 1634.  All the statutes in this Schedule deal with maintenance, champerty and embracery.  Maintenance has been defined as &ldquo;an officious intermeddling in a suit which no way belongs to one by maintaining or assisting either party with money, or otherwise to prosecute or defend it&rdquo;.  Champerty is maintenance in consideration of an interest in the subject matter of the action. Embracery consists in attempting, by bribes or other corrupt means, to influence a juror.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw particular attention to subsection (2) of Section 1 of the Bill, which provides that column 2 of each Schedule will not form part of the proposed Act.  Instead of setting out the long title of each statute, we have given the subject matter of the statute as unrepealed, indicating specifically those section of the statute still on the Statute Book. This is for information only and will, I trust, be of assistance to practitioners and students.  In many cases the long title would, indeed, be misleading, as will readily be seen by reference to Cullinan's Edition.</P>
    <P>The task of revising and clarifying our statutes is an important one and it will be greatly faciliated by the enactment of this Bill.  I look forward to submitting in due course to the Oireachtas the further measures necessary to complete the work.</P>

    <Title>Coroners Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The office of coroner is one of our oldest surviving institutions and, although now of less importance, nevertheless, performs a very useful function in modern society.  In the earliest days the main object of the office was to safeguard the profits of the Crown.  A coroner was bound to inquire concerning treasure trove, wreck, whales and sturgeons and to secure them for the King's use.  As the Crown was entitled to emoluments arising from the forfeiture of the chattels of felons and outlaws, the cornor was brought into contact with the administration of the criminal law at an early stage.  He kept the record of outlawries; he had to be present whenever judgment of death was passed in a court of private jurisdiction; appeals of felony were commenced before him; and in all these proceedings his concern was rather to bring the goods and chattels of the felon to the King for his use than to bring the felon himself to justice. At inquests, the coroner's function was to ensure that in cases of sudden death the chattels of any persons who were criminally responsible were surrendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> At present the coroner's functions are prescribed by the various Coroners Acts of which there are twelve in all. He no longer has the power, or rather a coroner's inquest has not the power, to return an inquisition charging a particular person or persons with murder or manslaughter and the inquest has now become in practice a matter of ascertaining the facts about a death and establishing how, when, and where it occurred.  Nonetheless, there is a real need for a tribunal of this kind which enables public disquiet about particular violent deaths to be allayed, and the rumours that inevitably circulate at such times to be quelled, by having the exact facts publicised with the minimum delay.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that in connection with a consolidation Bill of this kind the question of continuing to have an office of coroner at all was specifically considered by the Government before deciding to proceed with the measure. The Government recognised, however, that as the coroner's functions have to be done by some person or body the financial saving would be relatively insignificant, and that the persons or bodies on whom his functions would devolve might not enjoy the same degree of public confidence as coroners now do.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself mainly consists of a re-enactment of the existing law which, as Senators will see from a glance at the Repeals Schedule, is spread over a large number of enactments.  But there are a number of changes and I should like to invite the attention of the House to the main ones.</P>
    <P>In Part II of the Bill an age limit of 70 years is being provided for coroners appointed after the commencement of the Act.  Up to now, coroners have held office for life but I think it is desirable in the public interest to have a reasonable age limit for the appointments as there is for all other appointments under a local authority.  This change is being made in Section 11.  Sections 12 and 13 provide that a coroner or a deputy coroner may reside outside their district with the permission of the Minister.  With modern methods of transport the present requirement that <Col N="127" /> coroners and their deputies should live in the district is no longer absolutely necessary; and it may become unreasonable where, say, the coroner may live a few miles outside a county borough boundary while having his main place of business inside it.</P>
    <P>As a result of representations in the Dáil, Section 15, which deals with removal from office of a coroner or deputy coroner, has been amended to authorise the Minister, whenever he becomes of opinion that there has been misconduct or neglect of duty or the like, to give the coroner or deputy coroner concerned an opportunity of putting his point of view before the Minister makes a final decision on the question of removing him from office: subsection (2) of that section requires the Minister to specify the reason for the removal from office in every case.</P>
    <P>The most important change being made in Part III of the Bill, which deals with inquests, is probably that contained in Sections 30 and 31.  These sections prohibit coroners' inquests from considering questions of civil or criminal liability and prohibit juries from adding expressions of censure or exoneration by way of rider to the verdict.  Accordingly, the fact-finding aspect of the coroner's inquest will be further emphasised when the Bill becomes law though the new restrictive provisions will not prevent juries from making recommendations of a general character designed to prevent further fatalities.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that in Part III a statutory obligation is being imposed on medical practitioners, registrars of deaths, funeral undertakers and on every occupier of a house or person in charge of an institution in which a deceased person was residing at the time of his death, to notify the coroner or a member of the Garda not below the rank of Inspector, in any case in which he has reason to believe that the death was caused by violence or misadventure or by unfair means, or from any cause other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and treated by a doctor within one month before his death or in any <Col N="128" /> other circumstances as may require investigation.  This provision has a twofold object.  It is, of course, intended mainly to ensure that all suspicious deaths are notified to the proper authorities but it has the secondary object of improving registration of deaths and of the proportion of those registered deaths which are medically certified.  At present, it is known that there are many deaths which are not registered at all.  In the nature of things there are no statistics of them and their existence only comes to light, usually many years afterwards, when their statistical value has disappeared say, when it is necessary to take out a grant of administration to secure title to land or property.  The percentage of registered deaths which are medically certified is also unduly low by comparison with Northern Ireland and European countries and I hope that the present provision, though it may cause some inconvenience until people have got accustomed to its working, will have the effect ultimately of ensuring that medical assistance is summoned in the final stages of fatal illnesses.</P>
    <P>Section 24 authorises the Attorney General to direct a coroner to hold an inquest whenever he has reason to believe that a person has died in circumstances which in the opinion of the Attorney General made the holding of an inquest advisable.  This new provision is in line with the Attorney General's statutory functions as the assertor of the public's rights and I think it is a useful provision to have.  It is only right to say that coroners have as a rule not been slow to hold inquests in all proper cases and I am sure that the section will have to be invoked only on rare occasions.</P>
    <P>The only new provision requiring mention in Part IV of the Bill, which deals with juries at inquests, is perhaps the modification being made in the existing law relating to the failure of a coroner's jury to agree.  Section 44 provides that if the majority of the jury&mdash;a simple majority&mdash;agree on a verdict, then that verdict must be <Col N="129" /> accepted by the coroner.  At the moment, a majority verdict can only be accepted if the minority does not exceed two.  Therefore, if the jury consists of twelve persons, the views of seven of them will now prevail whereas under the present law a majority of ten persons would be required.  In the case of a jury of six, however, the law will still be that the views of four members may determine the issue.  In considering this matter, Senators will remember that no questions of civil or criminal liability have to be determined by a coroner's jury and that the investigation at an inquest is being confined to ascertaining who the deceased was and how, when and where he came by his death.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards Part V, which contains the miscellaneous provisions, I am sure that Senators will welcome the provision in Section 46 which replaces the existing obligation imposed on publicans to receive dead bodies.  For many years there has been a great deal of agitation to have the obligation removed and I am sure there will be general satisfaction that this is now being done.  In its place, it is being provided that the coroner will have discretion to direct that the body be removed into a convenient mortuary or a morgue or &ldquo;other suitable place&rdquo;.  What is a suitable place is a matter which is being left to the good sense of the coroner to determine but I do not think that a publichouse could by any stretch of the imagination be described as a suitable place for the reception of a dead body.  In remote areas there may be some inconvenience in particular cases at first but any difficulties should be minimised with the provision of proper transport facilities and the cooperation of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to thank publicly all the coroners who communicated observations on the Bill when I invited them to.  All of their suggestions have been carefully considered and some of them have been implemented during the passage of the Bill through the other House.  I have also had the advantage of having discussed the Bill with representatives of the Coroners' Association <Col N="130" /> a few days ago.  The Association welcomed the Bill and made some suggestions on certain minor aspects which I am considering at present.</P>
    <P>As I have said the office of coroner is still essential, even in modern conditions, in the interests of allaying public disquiet and scotching rumours.  Its everyday functioning is associated with a time of severe personal distress to the relatives of deceased persons.  To carry out their duties properly, coroners require qualities of prudence, common sense and independence to ensure that additional distress is avoided so far as is consistent with ensuring that the cause of death is satisfactorily established.  I think I can say that our coroners have shown that they possess these qualities and discharge the duties of the office in a manner which combines efficiency with full regard for the feelings of the next-of-kin&mdash;a difficult task sometimes because people's judgments and attitudes are liable to be very much upset by the sudden death of someone close to them.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to some of the main changes which the Bill proposes to make in the present law and I have not dealt either with the minor changes or with the body of law which the Bill merely re-enacts.  There will be an opportunity on Committee to go into details of the various provisions but if there are any points on which Senators require clarification or amplification at this stage, I shall endeavour to meet their wishes when replying.  I hope that the Bill, as presented, will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large we welcome this Bill.  We think it is a good and desirable Bill.  As the Minister has said, the position of coroner is an important position.  He has very serious obligations to discharge in a case of sudden death.  Personally, I think it would be a mistake to abolish the position of coroner or to seek at present to amalgamate it with any other position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say also in general way that as a practitioner, and I am sure I am speaking for the great body in both professions, any move to consolidate <Col N="131" /> and codify the law is very welcome and a most praiseworthy project.  I know that this Bill has been amended in a few respects in the Dáil and has been improved by those amendments.  However, it would benefit by some further amendments.  I know it is very difficult to raise anything completely new and which has not been said before.  I know that a point was raised in the Dáil on Section 8 which provides for the appointment of a coroner by the Appointments Commissioners but the function is reserved to the Minister of declaring certain qualifications.  Section 8 (c) says:</P>
    <P>the Minister shall, after consultation with the Local Appointments Commissioners, declare, either generally or for a particular appointment, the qualifications as to age, health and character for appointment to the office of coroner.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this subsection which enable the Minister to specify different qualifications for different appointments are provisions to which I object. In the future this subsection could be very much abused.  A particular age limit could be specified by some future Minister for improper purposes.  It could be availed of by some Minister in the future when, perhaps, we are all gone and who would provide an upper or a lower age limit in order to disqualify a certain person.  It is fundamentally wrong that there should be different qualifications for a coroner in, say, Mayo and Cavan.  There is no reason why general qualifications should not be set out and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Section 9 says that the salary of a coroner shall be inclusive of any travelling, subsistence and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by him in the course of his duties as coroner. The coroner should be allowed reasonable travelling expenses.  Some counties are large and quite an amount of travelling would be involved.  It might mean that if the salary were the same for different counties a coroner in one county might be less well off <Col N="132" /> than a coroner in another county. Section 12 deals with the place of residence.  I suppose that on the whole it is only reasonable that in certain circumstances a coroner should be given permission to reside outside his district but I think that the conditions should be exceptional and that a coroner should not be encouraged to live outside his district.  Neither should he be allowed to live any considerable distance out of his district because, human nature being such as it is, one coroner might be tempted to adopt the line of least resistance.  If he is living in his district he will not have the same temptation to, quite honestly, assume there is no need for an inquest, as he might if he lives a considerable distance from where he would have to conduct the inquest.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is more a matter for Committee Stage, I am not sure. Section 13 (5) (a) provides for the discharge of the duties of a coroner by the deputy coroner and then it goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>Where a coroner is absent from his duties with the permission of the Minister, the Minister may authorise the deputy coroner of that coroner to perform all the duties of that coroner's office and, while the authorisation is in force, the deputy coroner shall, for the purposes of this Act, except Section 9, be deemed to be coroner for that district.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the remuneration of the coroner and I think that if a deputy coroner is acting as coroner for any length of time he should be given the salary to which the coroner is entitled. I think a substantial point arises in regard to Section 18.  Subsection (4) of Section 18 imposes on certain people, including a medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker and every occupier of a house or mobile dwelling where a sudden death occurs, to report that dealth immediately to the coroner.  Subsection (5) of the same section states that that obligation:</P>
    <P>shall be deemed to be discharged if he....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" />&mdash;that is the person concerned&mdash;</P>
    <P>immediately notifies a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector....</P>
    <P>I know that there was quite a discussion in the Dáil about various duties to be performed by various Garda officers but I could see this section imposing quite a hardship on people in rural areas.  One might have to travel anything up to 25 miles to contact an inspector of the Garda Síochána.  They are only stationed in the larger towns. The sergeants of the Garda Síochána are all responsible men held in the highest respect in their respective areas and the duty of reporting a sudden death could be quite well discharged by reporting it to the sergeant of the area where the death took place.  This would have the effect of making it more likely that the occupiers would co-operate fully with the wishes of the Minister and the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 25 compels the coroner to adjourn an inquest if requested to do so by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector on the grounds that criminal proceedings are being considered.  It goes on to say that the coroner:</P>
    <P>shall adjourn the inquest for such period as he thinks proper and shall further adjourn the inquest for similar periods so often as a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector requests him on the grounds aforesaid so to do.</P>
    <P>That is too indefinite.  In theory, at any rate, it might mean that an inquest might be adjourned <i>ad infinitum.</i> It might be adjourned for 25 years.  As an inquest is really only an inquisition to find out the cause of death, I do not think any criminal proceedings could be prejudiced by putting a reasonable time limit on the adjournments that could be given.  I can envisage great hardship being caused to relatives of a deceased person by keeping an inquest open indefinitely where a murderer has not been apprehended.  A point of some importance arises on Section 29.</P>

      <P>Under Section 29, the coroner is directed to preserve certain documents. He is obliged to hand them over to the County Registrar when he ceases to hold the office of coroner. It would be much more effective if he were directed to hand them over to the County Registrar every five years. The professions from which some coroners are called are not notorious for being the most methodical people when it comes to bookkeeping, writing, or keeping records.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point there.  It arises under Section 35.</P>
      <P>The last section I want to deal with is Section 46 which, as the Minister has just mentioned, relieves publicans of the obligation imposed under earlier Acts to receive dead bodies. While that may be so, there is a danger here that other people may have a very onerous obligation imposed on them.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>Where a coroner considers it necessary to hold an inquest on, or a post-mortem examination of, the body of a deceased person, he may direct that the body be removed into a convenient mortuary or morgue or other suitable place (whether inside or outside his district)...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect, I submit that, with modern transport, with hospitals with <Col N="135" /> morgues attached being convenient, with public buildings such as court houses, Garda barracks and other buildings under the control of local authorities and the State, there is no reason in the world why a private individual should be called upon to receive and keep a dead body pending an inquest.</P>
    <P>I know that most coroners are reasonable but you can have the exception. A man might be quite reasonable when appointed and, as the years go on, he might grow less reasonable. There is a danger there.  It is only necessary that it should be provided that a body should be removed to the places mentioned, the mortuary, the morgue or other public building.  Subject to that, we welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielHoganJnr" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask a question.  It happens in many cases of sudden death on the roadway that great difficulty is experienced in getting transport to remove the body to a central place, say the county hospital or elsewhere, for an inquest.  As far as I know, as the law stands, the ordinary ambulance which is used to bring a patient to a county hospital cannot, strictly speaking, be used to transfer a dead body to a place for an inquest.  A number of councils to my knowledge have experienced great difficulty in this matter over a number of years.  I hope the Minister will deal with this matter as it is most important that it should be clarified.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is dealing with Section 46, which concerns the removal and custody of a body pending inquest, and so on, I hope he will specify the sort of vehicle that can be provided for its removal.  I trust he will also say whose duty it is to provide that vehicle&mdash;whether that of the doctor who might be on the scene, the coroner, and so on.  These are matters which I should like to have clarified and which in the past have led to endless confusion and misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents a mass of existing and very antiquated legislation.  I see from the synopsis of the Bill that it dates back to the thirteenth century.  Nobody could possibly have any objection to a consolidation <Col N="136" /> of this kind.  The collection of this mass of legislation and its presentation in one accessible piece of legislation must obviously commend itself to everybody.  I just want to raise two small points.  Under Section 52, post-mortem examinations shall be conducted by one doctor.  This section provides that where a coroner considers a second doctor is necessary he must state his reasons to the Minister.  I am not quite sure why that type of provision is considered necessary in a Bill of this kind.  I should like the Minister to explain it.</P>
      <P>Under Section 57, there seems to be a change in the method by which fees and expenses for doctors, witnesses, and so on, are to be provided in future. Heretofore, I understand these fees were fixed by statute.  As far as I can interpret the section, they are now to be prescribed by the Minister for Justice after consulation with the Minister for Local Government.  I presume that provision would make it very much simpler for such fees to be increased or varied from time to time.  This seems another example of the tendency, commented on in the past, to give more and more power to the Minister and less and less power to either of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  There ought to be some provision for appeal against the Minister's decision regarding a particular scale of fees of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on being able, after so recently taking office, to have such a comprehensive measure brought for consideration before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a very important Bill.  In recent years, the general performance in the matter of conducting inquests was not in all cases satisfactory.  It is quite a common experience to find that when a death is reported to the coroner he may take the view that an inquest is not necessary and the matter finishes there.  There was a lot of public uneasiness as a result of some decisions by coroners in that connection. People feel that where there is any doubt the matter should be very fully investigated and disposed of by inquest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> I am very pleased to notice that the Minister has made provision in the legislation we are now considering to correct a malpractice of that kind.  It appears that the Attorney General who, I take it, would be requested to do so by the Garda authorities or by the Minister's Department, can instruct the coroner to hold an inquest where otherwise no decision might be taken or where there might be no other application for such investigation.  That is a very important point and I am glad the Minister has taken care of it.</P>
    <P>In his speech this evening the Minister said that the office of coroner was a very old one.  He indicated that from time to time the opinion was expressed that the office should be amalgamated with some other judicial office in the State, but I think he was very wise to maintain that office as a separate entity and continue it in its existing from.  The position at the moment, as I understand it, is that coroners who have been appointed before the passing of this Bill can remain in office for as long as they live.  The Minister has seen fit, however, to provide that in future a retiring age will apply.  It is an essential condition that a retiring age should apply because a certain amount of difficulty is created for the officers, particularly when they are engaged in a private practice of their own and when they reach an age at which they might not be fit physically or mentally to perform their official duties.  For that reason I am glad the Minister has made provision for a retiring age.</P>
    <P>I understand the existing offices are not pensionable.  I sincerely hope that those who will be appointed in future, when there will be a retiring age, will be made pensionable. Another suggestion I should like to make is that because of the responsible duties now being allocated to coroners, there should be some increase in the amount of remuneration allowed.  So far as I know those who are appointed are mostly medical practitioners or legal practitioners. Other types of professional men do <Col N="138" /> not qualify for the job.  While there is probably quite a lot of competition for the appointments when they are advertised the legal men particularly stand to gain very little in the long run by holding office.  I submit that unless the scale of remuneration laid down is made more attractive you cannot get the best men.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty about the way the scale is computed.  It is inclusive and expenses are not allowed.  I think reasonable travelling expenses should be allowed, but I think the Minister has that in mind when he refers to the amalgamation of districts and the fact that by and large coroners are encouraged to live in their own districts.  Those are a few of the points I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the summoning of juries in Sections 41, 42 and 43, but I think it is a bit loose.  As I read it the provision indicates that if a coroner requires a jury, broadly speaking, he requests a member of the Garda Síochána to summon that jury. That has been the practice heretofore, and a number of people were always available for jury service.  To make the job of constituting a panel as easy as possible the Garda usually asks the same people.  I may tell the Minister that there is a suspicion at large that these panels were generally composed of &ldquo;yes men&rdquo;, that from inquest to inquest they were the same men, and that if one wanted to influence a convenient verdict they were the right fellows to get.  I think there is a point there, and some provision should be made to deal with it.  In other words, it should be provided that persons are not asked to act on a jury more than once in three years or something of that kind.  I want some provision whereby the same people are not doing jury service too often.  I do not know how that could be provided, but it should be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister has emphasised that the necessity for the coroner system is very great.  That is accepted in the country and this Bill has got a good reception.  There are many factors associated with the Bill which go to make it a success, but it does not matter <Col N="139" /> how efficient the coroner is if he does not get proper co-operation from the jury.  The panel of jurors is important. It requires on the whole at least a majority of responsible people.  I suggest that the method of recruiting these people has been rather loose up to now.  I wonder if the Minister can see any way, by amendment of the existing measure or by regulation, of providing that a more responsible type of person is summoned for jury service.</P>
    <P>I submit that any six, nine or 12 people who are summoned by a member of the Garda Síochána at the request of the coroner, and are brought into the room, must be accepted by the coroner.  He cannot object to the presence of any particular person on the jury.  That is all the more reason why the qualifications should be more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that in future the job of the coroner, and the purpose of inquests in general, would be most specific and that he was determined to see it carried out in a specific way.  Generally speaking an inquest is to investigate the relevant causes of death, and there should be no side issues other than on the facts in that connection, more particularly, when the verdict would in no way influence civil or criminal proceedings. It is very important that the Minister has indicated his intention in that regard, but he will have to do something more than make that statement here.</P>
    <P>From past experience you find riders added to verdicts, deliberately introduced to influence at a later stage some particular line or another. I want to ask the Minister to inform the coroner that he is obliged to ensure that no such rider is added to any verdict in his court, and that the coroner and the jury are confined to the business they have been appointed to do by law.  In recent years coroners took it on themselves to condemn what they regarded and termed as the inefficiency or negligence, as the case might be, of local authorities and Government bodies.  Some of them appeared to have a bee in their <Col N="140" /> bonnets about attacking State concerns. This was very bad form. Apart from being undesirable from the public point of view, perhaps, unconsciously, it helped certain people in civil or criminal proceedings, and particularly criminal proceedings. Coroners' reports were usually regarded as infallible and when a coroner stated something people naturally played up to him.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick with regard to the provision in Section 46 which relieves a publican from the liability he had heretofore to accept the remains of a dead person for the purpose of having an inquest held on the licensed premises.  While this is a long overdue development which we all welcome, the alternative provision is a bit vague.  The coroner could take the view that it would be more convenient to have the body of a drowned person at the seaside admitted to a hotel or a restaurant or some other place nearby rather than removed to a hospital 15 or 20 miles away.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that the point should be made more specific.  The facilities are there now to have a body admitted for post-mortem examination in a specific number of places, of which we have quite a wide variety, and it would not impose undue hardship or inconvenience to have the remains removed to one of them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has provided for the appointment of coroners to be made by the Local Appointments Commission.  Senator Fitzpatrick made the point that generally speaking the Minister influences the type of appointment the Commissioners make because of the regulations he is entitled to draft.  That is the usual practice in the Department of Local Government with regard to town clerks, law officers and other officials, where the Minister generally sets up the structure of the requirements associated with the appointment, and it is then passed to the Local Appointments Commission to implement the requirements by appointing a person within the general terms of reference laid down. This has worked very successfully in other Departments also and I see no <Col N="141" /> reason why it should not work in this connection.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make is in connection with the Minister's indication that in this part of Ireland the number of registered deaths which are medically certified was very low compared with the experience in Northern Ireland and other European countries.  The fact that the office of coroner was still being maintained might in some way influence bringing that percentage to a more satisfactory level.  That is very important because we all know from dealings we may have in certain lines of business that the non-certification of the cause of death can be a great handicap in some regards. Nowadays most people who are ill and in their declining years are attended by medical practitioners because the Health Act and other Acts passed in recent years have made it more convenient for people to have medical attention.  By and large, as far as people in that category are concerned there is no reason why the cause of death should not be certified. The point the Minister makes there is very important, particularly in the matter of mortality statistics, and in this regard the Bill will serve a very useful purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When I looked at this Bill I was surprised that it took 59 sections to cover the appointment of coroner, and that there are 38 amendments dealing with such a small matter.  I do not see much merit in splitting hairs about the meaning of phrases and words, because the ordinary person who is not legally minded would not see any great difference between &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo; or &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I speak is that I think the Bill will affect the rural areas, particularly the remote areas, to quite an extent.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage discussion in the Dáil the Minister said at Column 167 of Volume 193:</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we want here to step up the number of deaths notified, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> It is eminently desirable that we have a higher number of deaths notified than we have at the moment.  We have a very high proportion of uncertified deaths.  If the subsection achieves that, it is a considerable advantage.  It is also important from the point of view that it will tend over the years to have doctors called in more regularly and more often in cases of persons who are in danger of death. I think that socially that is also desirable.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland we often find people who have not seen a doctor for ten, 15 or 20 years.  I know people who never called in a doctor in their lives and they are over 80 years of age today.  If such a person should die suddenly, would it not be a reasonable thing to find, without calling a doctor in, that he had died of old age and to certify that as the cause of death?</P>
    <P>A good point in the Bill is that the appointments are to be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners. In the past when a coroner was about to be appointed, people all over knew for months beforehand who was the person who was going to be appointed.</P>
    <P>The question of age is also important, and I would like the Minister to specify what age he would consider appropriate for a coroner on appointment. The Bill provided for at least five years' experience as a doctor, a barrister or a solicitor, and Deputy McGilligan made fairly sure in the Dáil that that would mean full time employment and doing full service.  I would definitely say that no coroner should be appointed under the age of 35.</P>
    <P>Neither would I keep a coroner after 65 years of age.  I shall give my reasons for it.  A young coroner of less than 35 years is not mature.  He is officious.  I remember a case of a girl who was cycling along a road within 100 yards of her home.  She became faint, sat down and died.  She was carried in and put into her own house.  The doctor was brought and he called the coroner. The coroner refused to come out to that house to hold the inquest.  He was a new young coroner.  He said the ambulance would have to be sent out <Col N="143" /> to bring the remains into the morgue. That should not have been done.  It showed a lack of common sense that the coroner would not come to the house in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I also know of another case where a man died in my presence.  The doctor declared that the coroner must be notified because this man had not been attending him.  The last thing the man told me was that he had been attending a doctor.  When I made that statement the doctor told me that, as the man had not been attending him, there would have to be an inquest.  I got busy, however, and located the doctor he had been attending.  Without any hesitation this doctor wrote out the certificate of death and stated that the man had been suffering from cardiac debility. He had attended the man that very day.</P>
    <P>If a man of between 65 and 70 is called out at night time, he does not want to come out.  He wants to avoid all the trouble he can and he asks that the remains be sent to him.  I would not have anyone over 65.  If we appoint a doctor a coroner, that doctor retires at 65 if he is working for a local authority. Therefore, it is only right that the coroner should also be asked to retire at 65.</P>
    <P>In Section 8, paragraphs (c) and (e), there is reference to the Minister laying down regulations and also to the fact that the Local Appointments Commission may appoint in such manner as they think proper.  Accordingly, they can appoint only according to the regulations laid down by the Minister.  I suggest that the Minister lay down regulations for every appointment.  There is a point that he may at any time make different regulations for different appointments. That, of course, will point the finger at the person likely to get the appointment.  There is also the question that appointments are confined to barristers, solicitors and doctors. What qualifications do we require? Do we require a man to have medical knowledge?  If so, the solicitors and barristers are out.  If we require legal knowledge, then the doctors are out. I do not see any point in having it <Col N="144" /> confined to solicitors, barristers and doctors.  A court clerk, a man living on a very small salary, knows sufficient about the law to be an efficient coroner.  Ex-members of the Garda Síochána, who retire at 55 when they are fairly mature, could have their income supplemented for ten years by acting as coroner.  That would not be a bad idea either.  Such people would be as well qualified as doctors, barristers and solicitors.</P>
    <P>There is a lot in the Bill about salaries.  From Section 9 down to Section 11, the Bill deals with the remuneration of coroners.  I understand a coroner gets about £150 a year.  When there is so much about paying that sum, the Minister must have a poor idea of the inclination of local authorities to pay anyone.  I know some of them down our country would not pay if they could get out of it.  There is a section here that they can appeal to the Minister if they are not satisfied with the pay they are getting.  That is a wise provision. The doctors recently had to make use of such a provision to get their money from the local authorities. It is likely in some counties that engineers and other people will have to appeal to the Minister to get their share.</P>
    <P>Under Section 13 the Minister has power to remove a person from the position of coroner for various reasons.  I can understand that.  If a doctor has attended a person a month before the death apparently he cannot act as coroner in that case.  I think, however, that the most important reason why a coroner should not act is that of relationship with the dead person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hogan made reference to Section 46.  There have been a number of incidents throughout the country where there was difficulty about removing the remains.  It usually happens after fatal motor accidents where the body is severely injured and people with private cars do not like <Col N="145" /> to put the remains into the car.  Apparently the ambulance was not allowed to carry these remains.  The Minister would be wise in laying down regulations that the remains be removed by ambulance where no other means is available.</P>
      <P>I hope that in the interpretation of this Bill the coroners will not be having inquests every day of the week. More people are dying suddenly now than was the case a few years ago. Therefore, coroners should show great discretion and common sense.  If anything worries the rural people it is an inquest.  Therefore, coroners should show common sense and not have inquests where the cause of death is not fully established.  I would not be in agreement at all that the appointment of a coroner should be confined to the two classes mentioned here.  That is my greatest objection to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Hogan in regard to fatal accidents. I remember a fatal accident a short time ago.  The ambulance would not take the person involved.  But a good farmer's wife came along with a good car, put the man into it and brought him to hospital.</P>
      <P>I listened to the last speaker referring to ages.  I remember a coroner being appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners after he had been 54 years a medical officer in the district in which he was appointed. There were several unemployed doctors up for the position but they did not get it.  As I say, this man had his dispensary district for 54 years when he was recommended for appointment by the Commissioners and had to be appointed.  The county council had nothing to do with it.  I am glad that the Minister has prescribed 70 years which I think is reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know something about coroners.  My late father was a coroner and it is remarkable that he held the last inquest under British rule. That was on the late Robert J. Byrne of Limerick.  The citizens of Limerick brought in a verdict of wilful murder against Constables Spillane and O'Brien and coroners' inquests were <Col N="146" /> abolished a week later by the order of General Sir Neville Macready and Sir John French.  Coroners as a rule are pretty sensible men and try to put the people concerned to as little inconvenience as possible.  I think it has been more or less an unwritten law that in normal circumstances the necessity for coroners' inquests would only arise where there are suspicions of foul play or in the case of a fatal road accident.</P>
    <P>I have cited this case and I could prove it.  That man had been appointed a doctor for 20 years and nine months and the old British Government would not sanction him.  He kept on going until he had passed 21 years and was appointed.  That was in East Clare.  He held his position until he was almost 90.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister seriously to consider the statement made by Senator Hogan with regard to accidents on the side of the road where a person has been knocked down and killed and left there for everybody to come and look at without people exhibiting ordinary Christian charity and bringing that person to the nearest house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions to put to the Minister but before I do that I should like to welcome the decision to retain the office of coroner. He was largely a king's servant but I think at certain times of our history, as has been mentioned, he has made himself very much a people's officer. In the past coroners have refused to be browbeaten by established authority and the present coroners are still respected for that tradition.  The first question I have to raise is on Section 46 which has been discussed to some extent this afternoon.  My main concern is whether in this section we are not imposing a statutory duty on the coroner which might involve him in considerable expenditure and whether there is allowance made for the recoupment of such expenditure under this section.  The coroner may be required to make his own personal arrangements for the removal of a body to a suitable place.  There could be circumstances in which this would involve the coroner <Col N="147" /> in expenditure.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could indicate to us how such expenditure would be recouped.</P>
      <P>The second query is of an extremely minor character, but it concerns something which occurs to me to be somewhat peculiar.  I understand the position under Section 50, whereby the coroner makes a return of his official certificates to the registrar concerned, is that where one statutory officer is making a return to another statutory officer he has not got the benefit of free postage. I should be glad if the Minister would indicate whether I have been mini-formed or whether there is a good reason why free postage should not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The few points I wish to raise are mostly matters that could be dealt with in Committee but I should like the Minister's view if possible beforehand.  In Section 10 it seems to me that subsection (4) is simply an appeal to the Minister from the Miniter. Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>On a review under this section of a salary, the local authority shall, subject to the approval of the Minister....</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>Where a coroner is dissatisfied with a provisional determination, he may, within three months after being informed of the terms of the determination, appeal against it to the Minister....</P>
      <P>the Minister having already given his approval under subsection (2).  It seems to me we could rearrange that matter. One final decision from the Minister should be sufficient.  The other point is in regard to Section 13.  I think that the coroner should appoint his deputy in writing or in some definite way to the local authorities.  There have been difficulties in regard to dispensary doctors appointing deputies when going away.  In this new Section 18, subsection (4) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker and every occupier of a house or mobile dwelling, and every person in <Col N="148" /> charge of any institution or premises, in which a deceased person was residing at the time of his death, who has reason to believe that the deceased person died, either directly or indirectly, as a result of violence ...or from any cause...</P>
    <P>Then we bring in a clause which I think is unnecessary:</P>
    <P>from any cause other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death.</P>
    <P>Surely there is no reason for that in the section?  We are dealing with instances where a person died from violence, misadventure or, perhaps, some suggested mysterious or unfair practice by another person.</P>
    <P>It seems unnecessary to bring in the fact that a householder, shall we say, is required to judge under that section whether or not the person died from natural causes.  The section would read better and it would bring out the strength of the new section if that clause in it were omitted and it were left a section requiring a person, under penalty, to report any suspicion of unfair treatment or violence or any such thing.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I should like to emphasise is that of riders added to verdicts.  Since I first began to think about these things, I have always thought it very wrong and improper that a coroner's jury should add a rider of any description to their verdict.  They are there to find out more or less the cause and time of the death.  I do not think a rider should have the same weight as the verdict of a jury.  If even what may sound or be worded to mean a general rider is added to a verdict, locally it may obviously point to some person. The Minister would be far wiser to say that no verdict whatsoever shall be connected with a rider.</P>
    <P>Take the quite common rider that such and such a corner of the road is dangerous, or something like that. Does it really have any further effect than if the leader of that coroner's jury went out afterwards and spoke <Col N="149" /> to a person privately and said: &ldquo;I was foreman of the jury in there.  We thought the attention of the county council should particularly be drawn to this corner.&rdquo;  That probably would be just as effective as if it were added to the solemn sworn verdict of these people in the jury room.</P>
    <P>I think it would be very hard to distinguish between a rider pointing at a particular person and a general rider.  I suggest the Minister cut that out completely from the verdict of the coroner's jury.</P>
    <P>I am not too happy about Section 35 (2) where a coroner benefits under a testamentary disposition of a deceased person.  We read in the subsection as it is &ldquo;if he has drawn up, or assisted in the drawing up of, and benefits&rdquo;&mdash;I confess that sometimes when I read it it seems quite correct and at other times I think it would be better expressed by words such as where he benefits or has drawn up or assisted in drawing up.  I think the original section could be read as where he has drawn up, or assisted in the drawing up of, and benefits....</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  Quite recently, in relation to an inquest in a very remote rural area in my part of the country, <Col N="150" /> the body was laid on the trunk of a tree and the inquest was held in the open.  It is a terrible state of affairs that such things should happen.  I am glad the Minister has introduced a Bill that will make provision for the protection of the body following death.</P>
      <P>I have been at a number of inquests. I have often wondered at our callous attitude, especially in a Catholic country, in the case of bodies following death, either sudden or natural.  I have seen them lying in out-offices, on the roadside and in other places.  I often wonder why some arrangement has not been made even with the Church authorities so that the body would be brought within the precincts of a Church, irrespective of denomination.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made provision for the body to be brought to a mortuary or morgue.  That is not always available throughout the country.  On the question of hospitals, I have had experience where bodies were brought about eight miles to a hospital although the fatal accident occurred on the road within about two miles of the burial place of the deceased.  That imposes further hardship and expense on the people concerned.  Where a courthouse or some such public building is available, provision should be made for the body to be brought there and some more respect shown than we have been wont to show on the occasion of inquests.</P>
      <P>Senator Brady mentioned fatal accidents on the road.  Unfortunately, they are only too common at the moment.  Somebody is left to look after the remains.  Time and time again, it has been pointed out that local authorities have no power to send out an ambulance in such cases.  Surely some provision should be made for the removal of a body?  Arrangements could be made for the inquest to be held as soon as possible following the demise of the person.  In remote rural areas, there may not be suitable accommodation. Therefore, provision would need to be made as to where the body should be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of uncertified deaths or deaths that have not been notified, only this morning I read the report for <Col N="151" /> 1960 of the County Medical Officer of Health for Leitrim.  We seem to have a very high proportion of such deaths in County Leitrim, higher I think than most counties.  One often wonders, especially in rural areas, if these people die from natural causes when we hear rumours and read about people being robbed or attacked.  The Minister should take cognisance of that fact and take steps to see that deaths are notified and registered.  Surely, in this year of 1962, people should not die without somebody knowing the cause and their death being notified and registered.</P>

      <P>It is true to say that the House generally has welcomed the Bill and approved of its main features. I am glad to note that the House, almost unanimously, is of opinion that the office of coroner is worthwhile and should continue.  The Government gave consideration to the question of whether or not that office should be abolished, or amalgamated with some other office, but on the whole they decided it was worthwhile, even in modern times, to continue this ancient office.  I am glad to have that decision of the Government endorsed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also true that Senators who have spoken have approved of the principal features of the Bill, and particularly those provisions which are new: the age limit for coroners, and other provisions of that sort which I indicated in my opening speech.  Senators, of course, raised a number of points of detail, and while it is true to say that the House generally is satisfied with the Bill, and happy about its main provisions, individual Senators are worried about certain points of detail.  That is only to be <Col N="152" /> expected.  I am in this difficulty.  I am conscious of the fact that this House, in its usual gracious fashion, is prepared to be more tolerant with its own members, and allow them more latitude in a debate of this sort, than they would an outsider such as myself coming in here, and I think I would be precluded by the rules of order from following Senators into the various byways which they have travelled, and dealing <i>seriatim</i> with the points they raised.</P>
    <P>When we come to Committee Stage we can have a useful discussion on the points of detail which have been raised.  For instance, several Senators mentioned the question of the effective conveyance of dead persons from scenes of accidents to appropriate and suitable places.  The position there is that, in the main, it is the responsibility of the local authorities. The coroner is responsible for making suitable arrangements with the local authority to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>It is not true that an ambulance may not take a dead body away from the scene of an accident to a hospital, a mortuary or a public morgue.  The Department of Health has advised local authorities that they should make sure that, so far as possible, ambulances are reserved for the conveyance of sick persons to hospital. That is the obvious purpose for which ambulances are intended.  The Department of Health has also indicated to the local authorities that that general principle should not prevent a public authority ambulance from taking dead bodies to mortuaries or hospitals.  It is a matter of common sense and suitable arrangements being made between the coroner and the local authority, with the object of trying to ensure, without any unnecessary expense or undue cost, that the decencies are preserved.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the common sense of the Garda, the local authorities, the coroners, and all concerned, would secure a situation where that would happen, and that practical arrangements would be made whereby the decencies with which so many Senators are rightly concerned, would be maintained and, at the same time, <Col N="153" /> excessive expenditure by local authorities avoided.  In Dublin city, the Corporation have made a contractual arrangement with a firm to convey dead bodies in those circumstances. Such an arrangement might or might not be practical in rural Ireland.  It is something on which common sense and goodwill must be brought to bear by all concerned.  That is typical of the sort of point that was raised in the course of the discussion, with which we can deal more fully, effectively and in a more closely-knit fashion, when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I feel that at this stage I should confine myself to saying that I am grateful to the House for the constructive and helpful manner in which it has received the Bill.  It is clear to me that the House has given an almost unanimous welcome to the general provisions and arrangements in the Bill.  As I said, other points on which Senators are not fully satisfied can be dealt with more closely and fruitfully on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has a two-fold purpose. First, it provides for the cancellation of the Road Fund debt on foot of borrowing from the Exchequer and, secondly, for the making of additional grants to the Fund from the Exchequer over the period of three years commencing 1st April, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 2 of the Bill the Road Fund debt to the Exchequer will be completely wiped out.  In addition the repayable advances to be made to the Road Fund under the Road Fund (Grants and Advances) (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1959, will be converted into non-repayable grants.  In the aggregate the Road Fund will <Col N="154" /> stand to benefit to the extent of £1,400,000 approximately by the passage of this Bill.  In exchange for this improvement in the position of the Road Fund I have agreed with the Minister for Finance that the Estate Duties Grant issued annually to local authorities through the Local Taxation Account will be terminated as from 1st April, 1962.  This grant amounts on average to £120,000 approximately per annum.  The net amount which will be saved to the Road Fund is thus equivalent to about 20 years purchase of the Estate Duties Grant.  As Senators will probably be aware I have been able to pass on the immediate benefits of this transaction to local authorities.  The rate of recoupment on the main road upkeep grant has been increased from 40 per cent to 50 per cent.  This increase has been very welcome to local authorities. Furthermore urban road authorities will get an increase of ten per cent. in the amount of their Road Fund grants plus an additional amount corresponding to the amount of Estate Duties grant which they would otherwise receive.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that under Section 1 of the Bill provision is made for additional grants amounting to £700,000 from the Exchequer to supplement the Road Fund.  Of this amount the sum of £400,000 represents the conversion of the repayable advances which would have been forthcoming under the 1959 Act into non-repayable grants and which I have already mentioned.  The remaining £300,000 is being provided as a supplement to the Road Fund to enable the particular road problems which were first tackled under the 1959 Act to continue to be dealt with.  The special assistance provided by that Act was designed to deal with two particular types of road problem viz:&mdash; (a) that created in certain counties by the closing (in whole or in part) of railway lines; (b) that created by traffic serving certain important industrial undertakings, the public road approaches to which have been found to need improvement.</P>
    <P>The amount of £2 million made <Col N="155" /> available under the 1959 Act has now been fully earmarked against specific schemes and programmes of road authorities.  The continuation and extension of the 1959 programme will require a total additional allocation of £900,000 over a period of three years of which £600,000 will be borne entirely on the Road Fund, the balance of £300,000 being provided under Section 1 of this Bill.  Out of this additional sum, substantial grants have been made available to a number of road authorities including Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation, the county councils of Clare, Westmeath, Louth, Kilkenny, Offaly and Laois. A number of other applications which have been received will be fully and carefully examined by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the proposals incorporated in the Bill will have the full support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill has indicated that it provides for certain arrangements with regard to money spent over the past 3 years and further arrangements for money to be spent in the years immediately ahead.  It is, therefore, an opportune time to consider and review our basic road policy and to consider whether the present policies of the Minister and his Department are the best policies to be pursued in the spending of this increased amount of money devoted towards the roads.  If we look at the road position we find ourselves with approximately 10,000 miles of main roads, 40,000 miles of county roads, and about 20,000 miles of lanes not in public charge.  As all members of local authorities know, there is a continual struggle as to the amounts which should be spent on the main roads and on the county roads. These main roads differ very much in quality, and, indeed, some of them are of no concern at all to the local authority.  Many of them deal with traffic whose origin is outside the county and whose destination is also outside the county concerned.  These <Col N="156" /> are largely main arterial roads linking Dublin and the principal cities and towns, and also linking the larger towns together.</P>
      <P>These form a special problem in themselves, and it is worth while for us to give the Minister the benefit of our views freely on the question of how the money should be apportioned between these arterial roads and the remaining main roads and the county roads, and the question also of what organisation is appropriate at the present time for the carrying out of works on these roads.  Traditionally the Minister has divided the amount of his grant between counties on the basis of road mileage.  This is not the only basis on which an allocation has been made, but by and large mileage is the basis.  It is, perhaps, something which has grown up, because as the Minister and Senators know, we have a very large mileage in proportion to population and many of our counties are worse off than others in this respect.</P>
      <P>The first point I would like to raise is that, perhaps, the time has come to make a change and to use the question of traffic as the chief single factor rather than mileage in the allocation of these grants.  The second problem that must be faced squarely by the Minister is the question of arterial roads as such and their removal from the class of main roads.  The third point is that when the Minister is able to spend an additional 10 per cent.  on roads, and we have been spending over £10,000,000 per year, the time has come when some of this money would be well spent in the direction of testing and research.  Money invested in this direction now would repay itself in very much greater value for work done in the years to come.  I would, therefore, suggest that the Minister should review his policy under these three headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that he should take a very long and searching look at the basis for the allocation of grants, and that we should consider roads as not merely so many miles of surfaced and so many miles of unsurfaced roads but for what they are&mdash;traffic arteries connecting one place with another. <Col N="157" /> This should be the prime factor.  After that local conditions and mileage are other factors.  The Minister mentioned tourist grants and special local industries. Questions such as these have also to be taken into account, but these factors should be subsidiary to the main factor of traffic.</P>
    <P>Emphasis is being placed on the great importance of productive investment, and if road investment is to be productive as well as the remainder of our capital investment it is in these forms that the Minister's grants should be given.  There is no question whatever that in other countries in the investment criteria developed and used regarding road expenditure investment in arterial roads has first priority.  It may be that some of these criteria are not appropriate to this country, but they do indicate that arterial roads are first priority and that even a modification of them to suit our circumstances would give us the same answer.</P>
    <P>These are roads which are largely not the concern of the local authority, but are the concern of productive investment from the national point of view.  I would ask the Minister if he would examine on its merits the question of treating these arterial roads as a national problem.  I am not asking the Minister to consider complete nationalisation of all road works.  This, I think, would be most retrograde. But I am asking him to consider that roads which are arterial and which serve that national function should be organised on a national basis.</P>
    <P>We must remember when we look at these roads now that some of them are already becoming overcrowded with traffic, but many of the others do not appear to have the congestion which we see on roads in Britain or in other countries.  The position is that we are just coming up behind.  We have ten years or, perhaps, fifteen, and if we do not move with the times we will get the traffic chaos of the British roads.  Indeed, if Britain had the 15 years to spare which we have now with regard to the problem she would be very glad of the opportunity and time to plan.  I would urge the Minister <Col N="158" /> to see that the problem is tackled and plans are made now so that we do not wait until the cars are already slowed down and queuing on the roads before the problem is tackled.  I would urge the Minister to examine this on its merits.  I can assure him that in any such examination he would have the wholehearted co-operation of the professional bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>The Institution of Civil Engineers and Cumann na nInnealtóirí would be only too glad to help the Minister in any way in an examination of what they recognise, and what they hope the Minister and the public will come more and more to recognise, as a problem already urgent in our view, and one which should be tackled without delay.  Such a move would enable this national problem to be tackled properly.  But it would do something else also.  It would leave the local authorities much freer than they are at the moment to deal with these roads which are largely their concern, the roads in which they have a vital interest.  By removing from them these arterial roads which are not their concern, the local authorities would be freer to concentrate on the remaining main roads and on their county roads.</P>
    <P>As to what this organisation should be, as to whether it should be organised as part of the Minister's own Department, or whether it should be organised as a joint authority between the counties, these are matters which can be gone into.  I personally feel that, perhaps, some statutory body, suitably set up, might be the best solution.  But as I am not asking the Minister to accept anything and merely to examine the question, I mention that only as a possible solution.</P>
    <P>The further point I want to bring up concerns the question of the allocation of money for testing and research. We spend £10,000,000 a year on roads. In other countries&mdash;and on our roads, of course, at the moment we have to learn from them&mdash;automatically a certain percentage of money allocated for road works goes for testing and research. The position at the moment is that although a little is done in this country, not nearly enough is done. <Col N="159" /> We depend largely on getting the results of work done abroad and then attempting in the field to apply them directly to our own local circumstances.</P>
    <P>Something more is needed when we have expenditure at the level of £10,000,000 a year.  We need some organisation, some systematic procedure, whereby there should be personnel, equipment and money for the testing of sites, the testing of soils, and such research on new problems as experimental roads.  Years ago many of our county engineers laid stretches of experimenal roads.  We have very little of this sort of thing today.  There is not the money to spare and no man thinks he has sufficient reputation to spare to put in purely experimental roads, because neither the local authority nor the man himself is prepared to face the chance of failure.  It would be much better if the Minister would allocate a certain amount of money from the Road Fund for the building of experimental roads.</P>
    <P>We have many problems.  We have several problems due to the soil types in the west.  If money were allocated for roads that were specifically experimental roads, then these roads could be treated as such.  Nobody is hurt if the experiment is a failure, and actually on work of this type we often learn more from failures than successes.  It is in this way, I think, we have a real need.</P>
    <P>The main problem of our secondary and county roads is not so much the question of how much we should spend on them, but the fact that we need to develop low-cost methods of building roads for light traffic.  There is no sense in our adopting methods which have been developed elsewhere for high density traffic and applying them to our Irish county roads.  The problem is what to do with the farm-to-market roads which carry light traffic.  This problem has not been solved for Irish conditions.  I do not think it would take too much money to solve it, given the proper organisation. The Minister should set some money aside for the provision of an <Col N="160" /> information centre in which foreign literature could be studied and results made available.  Many of our county surveyors have kept themselves marvellously well in touch with the huge volume of experimental work done in Britain and Europe.  But this is something a man as busy as a county engineer should not have to do in his own time and largely at his own expense. This is something in which the Minister's Department could give a lead.</P>
    <P>There is one other factor on the question of our road policy and the question of getting value for money spent on our roads that I want to bring to the Minister's attention.  Due to the policy of the Department of Local Government in regard to temporary engineers, the efficiency of road work is being interfered with.  The position is that because improvements on roads are the subject of a 100 per cent. grant they tend to be considered largely as not of direct concern to the county.  Many councils are reluctant to assign permanent staff to work on them.  The trouble then is that they must be staffed by temporary staff. Due to an order of the Minister's Department temporary staff cannot be held in any one position for longer than three years.</P>
    <P>Because of this absolute bar, this completely unjust regulation, engineers will tend to move long before the three years are up because they will be afraid they will be caught at the end of the three years.  The result is that most local authorities are well below their establishment in regard to temporary engineers. Indeed, the recruitment of temporary engineers is a matter of supreme difficulty. Already, because of the unsatisfactory conditions in their employment, the amount which has to be paid for the services of engineers has increased in recent years.  If the Minister were to improve the actual conditions of employment here, he would soon find that overall there would be less to pay, and that he would have a temporary staff of higher morale which would give all of us better value on our roads.  Not only is the three year rule in regard to temporary engineers a great piece of injustice, but <Col N="161" /> I think it is also a great source of inefficiency.</P>
    <P>There is one other point in which the regulations of the Department make it difficult for road work to be carried out efficiently, that is, from time to time the insistence that the work should be finished by 31st March in any one year.  This may lead to accounting neatness, but to insist that a particular piece of road work must be finished by the end of March is very often to ask county engineers to have work finished during a time which is the very worst time for operations of this type.  In major roadworks in winter compared with summer you can get a drop in efficiency of 25 per cent and sometimes very much higher.  Nothing that the Minister does in regard to regulations of this type should further aggravate this situation.</P>
    <P>While the increased allocation of money to roads is very welcome, I should like to say, speaking as an engineer, that in the expenditure of this money these points should be kept in mind.  The roads should be treated largely as a means of carrying traffic, not as different lengths of service, and the problem of arterial roads&mdash;something like 1,500 miles of them out of the 10,000 miles of main roads&mdash;should be separated and given special treatment, and in all of this work an allocation of money for training courses abroad and for research would be money very well spent.</P>
    <P>Up to a few years ago many of our engineers did training courses at the Road Research Laboratory in England. The numbers attending these courses have decreased greatly in recent years and I think that at a time like this the numbers should be increasing rather than decreasing.  While I would welcome the expenditure of more money on roads, I would put before the Minister these considerations on how the money might be more efficiently spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, as a member of a local authority, to thank the Minister for the increased allocation for roads estimates this year but I would appeal to him to indicate earlier than at present the amount of <Col N="162" /> money that will be available to local authorities.  We in Leitrim are possibly one of the earliest counties to decide the rate.  We have not been intimidated in any way.  We sat until 11 o'clock on the first day of the estimates and decided the issue away back in February. I notice that some have not yet decided and they will have the Minister's decision, while we in Leitrim had not.  For many years past it was a bone of contention and councillors mentioned that the Minister should indicate the amount to be allocated because we had to strike a rate on the assumption that it would be the same as the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the amount of money is formidable as the last speaker said, I wonder, apart from the benefit of improved road conditions, what other benefit it will bring to the country because no matter in what part of the country you travel at the moment you can see machinery at work but very few people.  In a county such as mine road work is a tradition. I come from a county where, unfortunately, the rate is the highest in Ireland. Farms are small and uneconomic and people have had to supplement their income by road work.  Many have large families.  We had a man recently who is the father of 11 children looking for work on the roads but we have to use the money in the same way in Leitrim as counties with a higher potential.  The Minister in the course of the debate in the Dáil pointed out that the primary duty of local authorities is to provide roads not employment but I feel that in the case of a county such as mine we should be given some leeway regarding the spending of the money.  Unfortunately, the practice is growing up of machinery taking over from human beings.  It may be good economics but if you have reached the stage of drift of my own native county you could say that it is good economics to have people working at home irrespective of what state the roads will be in afterwards.  Road work in Leitrim is looked upon as an income.  If the money were made available for people to work on the roads we could have consistent employment all the year round.  Those people could also look <Col N="163" /> after their smallholdings, rear their families and be an asset to the country. As it is, they are being driven out by machinery.  The quarries are closed&mdash; and the quarries were looked on as the local stone industry or stone factory&mdash;in favour of centralised quarries.  If the Minister has any function in the matter, he should step in and indicate to local authorities such as ours that employment should also be a primary concern.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for the increased contribution.  We in Leitrim are getting £189,000, twice the amount of the contribution from the rates.  The unfortunate thing is the policy of cutting out of turns to which there is growing resentment.  I do not agree that the complete elimination of bends is a good thing because more accidents occur on straight roads than occur at dangerous turns.  On that point my attitude was that it should not be done but the other fellows said: &ldquo;If the money is not spent in your area, it will be spent somewhere else,&rdquo; so I was in favour of removing the bends.</P>
    <P>This realignment of roads mentioned by other Senators could be eased off to some degree and the money more usefully spent throughout the county on giving more extensive employment. I would certainly ask the Minister to consider very carefully that employment, particularly in a county such as mine, should be a primary concern apart from the making of good roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the matters mentioned by the speakers one which was discussed to quite a detailed degree was road reclassification.  All I would wish to say is that I announced, when speaking on roads, a year ago, at any rate in the Dáil, that this was a matter to which we are giving full consideration in the Department with a view to making whatever changes may seem desirable or necessary in the classification of roads, particularly arterial routes which were mentioned here this evening.  We are on that examination as already announced some time last year.  We are continuing it and as soon as we have any worthwhile conclusions, all concerned will be hearing from my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Of the question of taking into consideration traffic rather than mileage in the allocation of grants, it is true to say that many things are taken into consideration other than mere road mileage and a traffic count has become quite a feature in recent years in investigations for my Department by local authorities in determining their road programme and the necessity for various improvements.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a rather commonly held view that the realignment and widening of roads and taking away of bends is something forced on local authorities by the Department of Local Government.  It is true that in certain cases these things are economically desirable and almost necessary and in those cases the realignment should be done but we in the Department, as long ago as 1958, drew the attention of road authorities to this very subject, not in order to instil into them that they must realign or straighten all roads, but rather as an admonition that they should have regard to economics and to the necessity for any such realignment before they undertook any such scheme.  We set out heads as a guide to road authorities when considering these matters.  Realignment should be considered in the case of roads with a bad accident record.  We asked them to put the microscope on such roads and if realignment seemed the answer and if road surfacing or improvements were necessary, then the realignment should be done together with the road surfacing rather than the uneconomic idea of doing a job on the surface today and coming back tomorrow to dig up the road and put a different surface.  This is our approach and by and large the approach people down the country make towards the whole problem.  The idea of over-costly jobs is one which we do not desire in the Department of Local Government. Realising the limitations on the financial resources of all of us and the huge problem of roads, of the entire network, and the money we must speno, to the extent of a large sum of £10 million a year, we know that it must be spent wisely and well if we are to make the most of it in our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> Another matter which I should like to refer to was mentioned by Senator Mooney.  He seemed to be under the impression that if an alignment or realignment were costly and where the councillors were not in agreement with the engineer's proposal they would lose the money to somewhere else if they did not go ahead with it.  That is entirely wrong and whoever dictated that line of approach to the Senator was also wrong.  Indeed, on this matter also I issued a circular to the local authorities as far back as 1958 pointing out that they should exercise their right of having brought before them, as an elected body, all proposals by their engineering staff before they were submitted to my Department for sanction and approval.  It had come to my notice that in the past local councils in many cases were being presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Local engineers submitted their schemes to my Department, received approval and sanction and then submitted them to the council. The circular which I issued in 1958 indicated that local authorities should see these proposals and further, having seen them, if they did not agree with them and if they could not resolve their disagreement between themselves and the engineer's proposals, they were invited to send their alternative proposals to my Department, in addition to the engineer's proposals and my Department would then adjudicate between them.</P>
    <P>The most striking feature about this is that no such dispute has been submitted to us over the past three years. It speaks well of the members of the councils and the engineering staffs that while, I am sure, disagreement must have arisen it was always possible to resolve it at local level and no recourse has been had to this suggestion.  In so far as research is concerned, it is true that we do not specifically set aside moneys of any worth for this purpose but it is recognised that over the years there has been recourse by our engineers not only to the various findings of research in this country but also to those abroad.  The fact that engineers have been sent abroad, and have been helped to go abroad by the various councils over the years, has <Col N="166" /> made up part of the want that may be said to exist in regard to lack of research within the country.</P>
    <P>It is true that occasionally within the country we do get our county engineers and other engineers together for a conference, which lasts for a day or two and which is addressed by various experts selected for their knowledge in particular fields of engineering related to the work of local authority engineering.  I suppose it is true that if we had the facilities and plenty of money we could usefully use some of that money for further research.  On the other hand, I would not like it to be taken that my mind is closed entirely to the idea of providing further facilities and it is a matter which is being kept under constant review by my Department.  If we feel that something worthwhile can be got from an extension of the idea of money for research, in whatever direction it may be, I can assure the House we will consider any such help favourably and sympathetically.</P>
    <P>There is also this question of the injustice of the regulation which does not permit the employment of an engineer or a temporary official for a period greater than three years.  Off the cuff, my recollection of that, and, indeed, it was before my time as Minister, is that it arose from the fact that greater injustice was said to have been caused by the continuance in temporary office of various officers and professional people in the local authorities for years and years and finally they were not permanent or pensionable.  The three-year bar was brought in and if that injustice is in being today it is directly the result&mdash;and I am subject to correction on this&mdash;of trying to remedy the previous injustice whereby temporary officers were allowed to continue for ever and always to their own detriment and the detriment of those they served.  I do not know whether there is any real answer as between the two extremes.  I should be glad for further light on the problem.  If the speaker who referred to the matter wishes to let me have any I shall examine it.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was referred to was the insistence of my Department <Col N="167" /> on the completion of work before the 31st March each year.  We are not quite as hidebound as that. It is true that we have got to try to ensure that works are completed within the financial year.  This is not just merely a matter of bookkeeping. By and large, if we find a county engineer's programme is such that it is beginning to overlap and run into the next year, then there is something wrong somewhere.  There are exceptional circumstances and cases and where these are presented to us we do, in the Department, allow these works to go on into the following financial year, particularly if the work is of a nature that it would be wasteful if done during the early days of Spring.</P>
    <P>Machinery versus manual workers was also referred to.  This presents us with a problem to which, strictly speaking, I think there is no real answer.  If we follow it along we find it is a question of using the Road Fund and the money provided by county councils and the Central Exchequer as employment relief moneys. They are not such.  They have never been intended for such but I agree and admit that their expenditure over the years, particularly in the poorer counties, has had the effect of being of very great assistance to the uneconomic holder and the small farmer who is only part time engaged on his land, who is not able to make a living off the land, and has been able to supplement his income from the smallholding by virtue of casual work on the roads. However, we should not get the idea that because that has come to be a practice over the years this money can be regarded solely as unemployment relief money.  It is not that and, unfortunately, we have not at our disposal money of the magnitude necessary to make it into such and do the roads in a proper way at the same time.  On the other hand, I should not like anyone to think that I am all for the idea of mechanisation as it would appear to be developing at the moment.  Machinery can and, I am sure, is, in certain cases, not very economic.</P>
    <P>Machines, if purchased in quantity and in size beyond the needs of the job <Col N="168" /> on hands, cannot be said to be economic and never will be economic.  In cases where that could be found out, it would be far better that these moneys should go to the manual workers in their wages rather than wastefully spent in over-mechanisation or in the misuse of machinery, which also can arise.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to criticise the use of machinery and to point out the faults and fallacies in its use in various counties and on particular jobs.  We should have some appreciation of the fact that this is a big job but is only one of a multitude of jobs which our county engineers have to perform.  They cannot be masters in every last aspect of the administration as well as masters in their own profession.  Like all of us, they are subject to error.  By and large, I should think that where you have a reasonable engineer&mdash;I think most of them are reasonable&mdash; and where you have reasonable councils&mdash;as a whole, I think they also are reasonable&mdash;working together and in co-operation, and using the best in the minds of all of them, they can hit the happy medium whereby the greatest possible amount of manual labour is employed and, at the same time&mdash;and a very necessary aspect of the whole problem&mdash;the greatest possible amount of road mileage is improved out of the moneys available.  If we all work in that direction and bear in mind the difficulties on all sides then if we cannot go the whole hog in all directions we can hit the happy medium which, in the main, will give the most economic road repair and improvement which is so necessary throughout the country.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Bill will generally be welcomed&mdash;I am sure it will not be opposed&mdash;by all concerned.  Where we get the Central Exchequer adding to the Road Fund, we are all very happy because it is not a practice which has very often been participated in by any Government in the past.  I am sure the House will praise and accept this Bill for what it is worth.</P>

      <P>When introducing the Bill in the Dáil, the Minister said a sum of £900,000 was borrowed by the Fund from the Exchequer in 1957-58 and, of that amount, a sum of £622,603 principal will be outstanding as a debt due to the Exchequer on 31st March, 1962.  On that point I should like to ask what the Road Fund is composed of and whether it was actually used up when that sum had to be borrowed from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As a result of having insufficient funds, local authorities are not able to carry out necessary work.  There is a good deal of complaint in county council areas that the public are paying their rates and so much towards the Road Fund but that all roads are not getting the benefit of the Vote.

      <P>A net question was asked in regard to figures.  I should just like to give this answer.  The Senator asked whether or not the £900,000 of the debt incurred in 1957 was still due, as to over £600,000 of it, to the Exchequer and why that £900,000 was then raised.  That £900,000 was raised early in 1957 in order to make it possible for the then existing level of road grants to be continued during the year 1957-58.  Without that £900,000 they would have had to cut the grants substantially. That money was lent by the Exchequer to the Road Fund so that there would be no cut in the grants to the councils in 1957-58.  Since then, we have been paying back part of that money.  We have paid almost one-third of it but we still owe about £600,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fund Bill, 1962, has for its main purpose the giving of statutory authority to the Vote on Account for 1962-63 recently passed by Dáil Éireann.  The Vote on Account amounts to £49.34 million and Section 2 of the Bill authorises an issue of that amount from the Central Fund.  The <Col N="171" /> Bill is also required to authorise an issue from the Fund in respect of Supplementary Estimates voted in the current year and not covered in the Appropriation Act, 1961.  These Supplementary Estimates amount to some £12 million and the corresponding issue from the Central Fund is authorised by Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 3 empowers the Minister to borrow up to some £61.34 million which is the total of the Vote on Account and the Supplementary Estimates referred to.</P>
      <P>In 1962/63 expenditure of £148.4 million is proposed on the Supply Services, being an increase of £16.66 million on the total of the current year's estimates volume.  £123.7 million is for current services and £24.7 million for capital; expenditure on current items is up by £12.96 million and that on capital services by £3.7 million.</P>
      <P>Of the total increase of £16.66 million, however, amounts aggregating £1¾ million do not represent net increased burdens on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, additional broadcasting licence fees which will be collected and paid into the Exchequer as miscellaneous non-tax revenue will offset the additional £550,000 provided in the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs for transfer to the Broadcasting Authority on foot of net receipts from these licences. Second, a reduction of £600,000 in Central Fund charges will arise from the transfer to the Vote for Agricultural Grants of the sum formerly borne on the Fund.  This reduction will counterbalance £600,000 of the increase on the Agricultural Grants Vote. Third, retention in the Exchequer of the revenue which was formerly paid into the Local Taxation Account will offset the increase of £600,000 in Supply Services expenditure arising from the arrangements for compensating local authorities and departmental votes for the cessation of payments from the Account.  The new arrangements with regard to the Agricultural Grant and the Local Taxation Account are in the nature of reform and simplification of the accounts.  They bring <Col N="172" /> no profit to the Exchequer.  Legislative authority is required for these proposals.</P>
    <P>An itemised list of the increases and decreases on the Supply Services as compared with the original 1961-62 Estimates has already been circulated to Senators with the Estimates volume I do not propose to go into this in detail but will relate my comment to the broader divisions of expenditure within the Supply Services.</P>
    <P>Remuneration accounts for a very large proportion of the State's expenditure. The provisions under this head made in the various Supply Services estimates total approximately £51½ million.  Increases in remuneration account altogether for £5¼ million of the additional expenditure in the coming year.  This £5¼ million is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Regarding remuneration, it should be remembered that the rates of public service pay are largely determined, under conciliation and arbitration procedures, by the rates in other employment. Although constant efforts are being made to increase productivity through improved organisation and methods, the general advance in wage and salary rates cannot but affect remuneration charges in the public service, unless the services themselves were to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The social welfare and health services at £36.6 million, including remuneration, constitute the largest single category of expenditure in the Book of Estimates and account for 30 per cent.  of the total of current Supply Services expenditure proposed for 1962/63.  The provision represents an increase of £1.7 million over what was originally provided for this year. The increase arises partly from the <Col N="173" /> cessation of the former payment of £314,000 from the Local Taxation Account to the Vote for Health; partly, from having to provide for a full year for the extensions of social welfare benefits provided in the last Budget, but mainly&mdash;£1.16 million &mdash;from the heavier outlay arising from the State contribution of 50 per cent to health services expenditure by local authorities.  About half of this additional £1.16 million results from the rising costs of health services generally and half from pay increases for local authority staffs.</P>
    <P>The next largest category of expenditure is agriculture at £28.5 million.  The corresponding figure this time last year was £24.4 million but this did not include the £600,000 provided in the Central Fund Services for the Agricultural Grant.  When adjustment is made for this, the increase on last year's original provision is reduced from £4.1 million to £3.5 million, Large elements of expenditure on agriculture are, of course, classified as voted capital.  These include expenditure on bovine tuberculosis eradication, farm buildings and water supplies, the phosphatic fertiliser subsidy and the land project.  If these elements are excluded and the non-capital content in both years compared, it is seen that the proposed expenditure in 1962/63 is £2.2 million more than was originally provided this year.</P>
    <P>I must advert, however, to the large supplementary provision for agriculture which was made by Dáil Éireann last December.  This supplementary estimate provided an additional £10.3 million, of which £5 million was for export payments in respect of fat cattle and carcase beef.  This has no counterpart in next year's estimate, apart from a residual provision of £200,000, because the scheme, having fulfilled its purpose, is being terminated at the end of the present month.  The remaining £5 million or so of the supplementary estimate was also exceptional.  It provided for losses on the 1960 wheat crop and for additional support for butter and bacon prices in special circumstances.</P>
    <P>I may say that £16.8 million of the total proposed expenditure of £28.5 million on agriculture in the coming year is directed either to stimulating <Col N="174" /> production or towards reducing farmers' costs.  These items will attract about £1½ million more than was originally provided in 1961/62 and include such services as the fertiliser subsidies, arterial drainage, land and farm buildings improvement and grants in relief of rates.</P>
    <P>Another major item I might mention is the outlay on bovine tuberculosis eradication.  The cost of that scheme in 1962/63, exclusive of staff costs and the fat cattle guarantee payments, on which I have already commented, is estimated at a net figure of £5.8 million, an increase of £1.3 million on the sum provided this year.  The 1962/63 provision allows for the introduction of special measures in the six southern counties for the speeding up of eradication.</P>
    <P>For the coming year a total provision of £19 million has been made available for Education.  This figure, which does not include the cost of recent awards to secondary and vocational teachers, is some £3 million more than last year's figure and, excluding capital items, it represents 15 per cent of total current expenditure.  I have also excluded teachers' pensions as these are better classified with public service pensions generally.  In the main, the increased provision for education next year reflects the additional charges arising from the national teachers' pay award, capitation grants, and increments and allowances.  Increased grants are also proposed for all the constituent colleges of the National University and for Trinity College so as to enable teaching facilities to be improved and staff salaries to be raised.  A capital sum of £520,000 is provided towards the cost in 1962/63 of building the new science block at Belfield for University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs amounts to nearly £13 million. This is reduced to £10.6 million if Post Office pensions and annuities to repay telephone capital advances are excluded as being more appropriate for classification as public service pensions and debt service charges, respectively. This sum of £10.6 million represents an increase of £1.7 million over the <Col N="175" /> figure for this year but £550,000 of it is attributable to the grant to Radio Éireann on foot of licence receipts which, as I have already said, will be counterbalanced by additional non-tax revenue from these licences.  The increase of £1.2 million which remains when this item is excluded arises almost entirely from increases in the remuneration of the various staffs providing the postal, telephone and telegraph services.  The rising costs of these services will, as already announced, necessitate certain increase in charges in order to restore financial balance.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, excluding pensions, £13.85 million will be spent directly on the Army and Garda Síochána in the coming year, or £1.6 million more than this year's original estimate.  Pay awards account for nearly £1 million of the increase while approximately £400,000 extra is being made available for the purchase of Army stores and defensive equipment.</P>
    <P>Expenditure aimed at the promotion of industry shows a further substantial increase for the coming year.  At £3.35 million, it is £950,000 more than was originally provided this year and £350,000 higher than this year's revised figure.  £½ million of the increase will go to An Foras Tionscal and £50,000 to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    <P>Public service pensions will cost £6.7 million in 1962/63.  The increase of £300,000 which this figure represents is occasioned by higher levels of retirement pay and is but another reflection of the effect on public expenditure of pay awards.  There is likewise an increase of £300,000 approximately in the amount provided for tourism.  This represents 50 per cent. more than the provision made for this year.</P>
    <P>Debt service charges falling on the Supply Services will amount to £5.8 million in 1962-63 or about half a million more than this year.  The increase arises mainly under the State contribution to the loan charges of <Col N="176" /> local authorities in respect of housing and sanitary services and from the servicing of telephone capital expenditure. The bulk of debt service is, of course, a Central Fund charge, but a large part of it is generated by Supply Service expenditure on the voted capital services.  These services now account for approximately £25 million of Supply Services expenditure.  The annuity necessary to redeem the borrowing on foot of next year's outlay and the various supplementary provisions of this year will, alone, add £1½ million to the debt service charge to be borne by taxation.</P>
    <P>Excluding remuneration, which, as I have said, is integrated in the cost of various services, the ten categories of expenditure to which I have referred account for £125.5 million or 84.6 per cent. of the £148.37 million on the face of the Estimates Volume.  They account between them for £12¾ million of the net increase of £14.9 million in next year's proposed expenditure.  To recapitulate briefly the respective increases are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>These are the main features of the 1962-63 Estimates and I would ask the approval of an Seanad for the Central Fund Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill opens very large areas for discussion.  In fact, as you know, we can cover the whole field of government but instead of roving over a large number of subjects, I propose to confine myself to a few general remarks.  I should like to preface my remarks on this Bill by a few thoughts on parliamentary criticism and I hope that this will not seem either too unctuous or too obvious.  The problem in politics is to balance constructive criticism with national co-operation in <Col N="177" /> the solution of our problems.  We are all trying to do our best for Ireland, so it is important that in carrying out our democratic system of Government and Opposition we do not injure our common heritage.  We do not want to injure the State by unnecessary or unfair criticism.  Mere destructive criticism is quite useless.  Indeed, it can be dangerous but constructive criticism and, where possible, practical suggestions about Government action or Government policy are to be expected from a politically mature parliament.  Our system was never intended to create conflict and disorder but rather to operate as smoothly as possible the highly complicated machinery of government. It would seem that all of us concerned in our Parliament have a high responsibility to the State in our Parliamentary activities.  It was very satisfactory for us all, I am sure, who saw a recent broadcast on Telefís Éireann, a feature on EEC, when the Taoiseach, Deputy Dillon and Deputy Corish all spoke with such dignity and such unity on a matter which was of common and national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of State housekeeping which has been built up here is, in fact, I am sorry to say, in violation of that which governs individual citizens and private business operations. The State spends first and collects the necessary funds afterwards. Income is arbitrarily adjusted to expenditure, whereas the citizen in his private life or business can spend only according to his income; otherwise he goes bankrupt.  I know that the standard answer to Opposition criticism is to ask: &ldquo;what expenditure do the Opposition propose to cut out?&rdquo;  but in my submission this is no real answer.  The fact is that it is for the Government to manage the finances of the State in accordance with the ability of the citizens to pay. It is for the Government to decide what can be afforded having regard to the desirability of the proposed expenditure.  This is a responsibility which political parties face when they offer themselves for election as the Government of the nation, a responsibility which they definitely undertake when they are elected as Government <Col N="178" /> and that applies to any party that is elected.  That is not a responsibility which can be shirked nor can the Government blame the Opposition for their shortcomings.  This applies to any Government.  I am talking in the abstract but it applies to this Government as to any other.  In private life one cannot have everything one would like to have.  One is limited by the extent of one's income.  A question the Government should ask themselves is whether they are going to accede to popular demands of a vote catching nature which increase the cost of Government or whether they will have regard to the already heavy burden which citizens have to bear and against which an increasing volume of protest is building up all over the country.  The time must come&mdash;indeed, a lot of people feel the time has come &mdash;when the Government must have the strength of character to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to things we cannot afford.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister may reply by saying that the Fine Gael Party even now are asking for more expenditure. Every Opposition ask and will go on asking for more expenditure and at present this is true in connection with pensions.  Our Party are asking at present for increased pensions for people affected by the rise in the cost of living and the depreciation in the value of money.  But it is for the Government to be able to afford this. Following my original statement that constructive criticism should be made and constructive suggestions if possible, my own suggestion is that I do not think this pensions proposition is, in fact, unreasonable and that it can be offset by changing the health system.  I make no bones about it.  We have a most expensive Health Act which is far too expensive and is not giving value for money.  Pruning could be done there which would compensate for the claims of the pensioners.  The advent of more taxes and higher local government rates is already creating an atmosphere of apprehension and tension in trade and commercial life. There is no end to the demands of the tax gatherers.  Can we go on indefinitely building up State expenditure at the present rate, sinking capital in ventures <Col N="179" /> which give a loss or which do not give an adequate return on capital invested? We cannot risk projects of a purely political impetus where vote seeking outweighs economic value.  It is not enough for the Government merely to defend increases in public expenditure. I should like to hear what steps are being taken to ensure that every penny spent, every penny of expenditure, is justified, that full value is received for the money spent and that there is positive action to offset the increased expenditure in some way.</P>
    <P>At a time when business people are being exhorted to efficiency and to prepare for the free trade competition which we are now about to face whether we go into the Common Market or not, higher cost of government can be a major impediment to confidence and selling competitively in a general market.  Even small private business today are paying anything up to 40 per cent. of their profits in taxation.  This is a very heavy burden on efficiency, costs and our ability to sell our goods both at home and abroad.  At present everybody is being urged to greater productivity&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;but I should like to ask what productive efforts are being made by the Government in its own sphere of operation?</P>
    <P>Can it be said that its machinery is efficient or economic?  The Minister in introducing the Bill and in the Dáil said that productivity improvements are constantly being sought through better organisation in the operation of Government Departments.  I for one am very glad to hear that but I should like to hear from the Minister what actual steps are being taken to make the machinery of State more efficient and less wastefully bureaucratic.  As costs rise more and more it is imperative to be more efficient.  That is what everybody has to do in business nowadays. I do not like quoting the Dáil debates, I think we should make our own speeches here, but Deputy Cosgrave did mention that there was an increase of something like 500 in the number of civil servants, apparently over the year. This is at a time when the population <Col N="180" /> has not grown any bigger and the business community is not any more numerous.  Even if we have more business people here they are not in full operation.</P>
    <P>In that case it seems to me that this is not evidence of any success in achieving productivity in the State service. Anybody from outside can look at the enormous amount of form filling, papers and files.  In my own business in the past few years we have consulted people on this question of productivity. Productivity really means getting a greater return from what you are paying out and we found we could cut out an immense amount of paper work even in a small business employing, say, 300 people.  We found we had duplication of all kinds.  Anybody who deals with the Civil Service can see the fantastic amounts of paper-work which surely could be cut down.  A lot of people could be done without if this were achieved.  Nearly every day I have occasion to fill in a form in connection with the custom authorities and on 25 lines I have got to write my initials 27 or 28 times and sign the paper twice or three times.  Surely a document could be produced that would obviate that?  If I had to do it 10 or 20 times a day, it would be maddening.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest that if this question were gone into we could have a considerable saving in the bureaucratic machine.  I should also like to ask the Minister if computers could be used in the Civil Service.  Are there some in operation at present?  If not, it should be possible to eliminate quite a lot of expense by installing them. Not only that, but there is room for inquiring into expenditure generally in order to ascertain how public moneys are being applied.  It is true that the Comptroller and Auditor General examines expenditure but his function is to verify the accuracy of what is spent and not the efficiency of the expenditure.  I do not mean only to inquire into expenditure in the Civil Service.  There are plenty of schemes which have come under Government control and under Government impetus for years past and I am sure many of these would be found to be over-expensive <Col N="181" /> and wasteful, but once embarked upon they are there and they can easily remain there.</P>
    <P>In every business one has all the time and at all levels and in all departments to find out if one is getting value for money spent and it is surprising that every time one does this one can eliminate something which has grown up but which has now lost its usefulness.  In the many items mentioned by the Minister as being responsible for the large increase in his Estimates considerable responsibility is attributed to the eight round increase in wages.  Some Opposition speakers blamed the removal of the food subsidies for the eight round of wage increases but in the interests of accuracy I do not think this is altogether true.  Undoubtedly, the removal of the food subsidies was a major factor in the seventh round of wage increases, but I would say the Government's responsibility in the eight round stemmed from the picture of prosperity painted for the general election and in which the trade unions felt they should participate.  I am not blaming the Government for going before the country in the last election and telling the people how prosperous the country was.  Unfortunately, it had boomerang repercussions.  I am not making a political point but an industrial point.  The unions have said it. I have seen it in letters and I have one before my mind at present in which a certain group of workers have actually used the phrase that they wanted to participate in the prosperity in which everybody has been participating in the eight round of wage increases, which is only on the table at the moment.</P>
    <P>There was also the fact that there was an element of responsibility on the Government because they allowed a State monopolistic body to set off the round with a settlement which was made without regard to the effects on the economy generally and private enterprise in particular.  That settlement was set off at a figure with which, of course, the workers were delighted, and quite rightly so, but which was much too high and which <Col N="182" /> set the ante at a very high figure and out of all proportion to any money increase given previously in England or Ireland.  What is not generally realised is that the eight round did not place its justification in the cost of living but upon the standard of living.  The unions made no bones about this.  It was not based upon the cost of living.  It was tied to nothing and that is quite visible from the figure that eventually came out.</P>
    <P>I am not complaining about that. The lesson to be learnt is that when something goes wrong and when something goes slightly off balance you should use it as a headline to do the right thing in the future and I am glad to see that the trade unions with the Federation of Employers, and with the blessing of the Government, are getting together to see if they can make out a line of country for the future which will be sensible and where we can all work together and afford what we pay out in wages and salaries.  I refer to the forthcoming conference, the national employer-labour conference, which we hope to stage very shortly.  The fact to be faced is that we must either cut expenditure or raise the national income sufficiently to carry our improving standard of living.  These are the alternatives.  In any business if you do not increase your business you must cut down your expenditure. If you want to increase expenditure, you must increase your business, and income.  That applies both to business and to the nation.  You will not achieve this aim of increasing national income either by working less or by working less hard.  Wages and salary increases are highly desirable but they must be earned and the shorter hours and the more holidays campaign is untimely, premature and irresponsible. While we all wish to see increased salaries and wages paid, and our energy should be directed to achieving just this very thing, however, it is manifestly irresponsible that higher wages should be demanded at the same time as shorter hours and longer holidays.</P>
    <P>I am all for giving a man higher wages for doing more work and giving <Col N="183" /> bigger and better wages for more efficient working but, in the present state of our economy, when we are about to face competition in the open market of the EEC, our workers and many of our people generally want to work less and to get more money.  It really is beyond my comprehension how any sensible thinking person can justify that proposition.</P>
    <P>There may well be places and cases where people are still working too long hours and where people do not get holidays or enough holidays.  However, where people are not working very hard and getting reasonable holidays, there is not a case for asking for more time off, for less work and at the same time more money.  There is no magic formula by which that ridiculous proposition can be sustained except the obvious way of devaluing money, thereby making it less useful and at the same time making it impossible for people such as pensioners and persons on fixed incomes to live.</P>
    <P>I was walking across Molesworth Street yesterday.  I met a lady whom I used to know many years ago.  She is now in her seventies.  She was very neatly and nicely dressed as she always used to be.  I asked her how she was getting on.  She is living in Monkstown, I think.  She told me she comes into town about once a month only and I asked her why.  I think she had been working in a bank or in some similar occupation when she was younger.  She said there was no pension scheme in her time with the result that her money is becoming less and less valuable and she has just a few rents which her father left her from houses.  Incidentally, this is the kind of person who is called a &ldquo;landlord.&rdquo;  She said she is now able to come into town less and less frequently and that she can only look at things but cannot buy them.  These are the kind of people hurt by the demand for more money and more wages for less work.  By such actions we are merely depreciating the value of our money and we are not gearing ourselves for the great effort we have to make if we are to face the draught of open competition without protection.</P>
    <P>Our whole national effort should <Col N="184" /> now be directed to economic advancement and the raising of the national income.  In order to do this, it is important to use all the forces and resources available, working in co-operation with one another.  In recent times the degree of Government consultation with vocational and representative groups of citizens has increased enormously.  I welcome that trend.  It is a sensible and democratic policy in comparison with what we had in the past, namely, over-reliance on Government Departments acting sometimes with little practical experience in many of the matters with which they were dealing</P>
    <P>This co-operation, I am glad to say, seems to be growing with trade associations, professional associations and the trade unions.  That is the manner in which I feel Government should operate&mdash;everybody working and helping each other.  This new approach is welcome.  It is one which is characteristic of a true Christian democracy as distinct from a totalitarian autocracy.</P>
    <P>Far from taking away from the importance and dignity of the Civil Service, co-operation and consultation with appropriate groups of citizens bring both together in a harmonious and personal relationship.  I would say that between trade associations today and vocational groups including trade unions, there was never such a good relationship with the Civil Service officials.</P>
    <P>Years ago, I had the unhappy experience of actually being almost thrown out of the Department of Industry and Commerce on the question of tariffs.  At that time one was hardly allowed to open one's mouth to the officials in control of that operation at the particular time.  Now, Secretaries of Departments and their officials are mixing and working with the citizens. One sees them at social functions as well as at business conferences.  It is very good.  It is a feature I welcome.</P>
    <P>I come now to the drive for productivity. In this commendable drive, there has to be an extensive examination of different situations.  In the manufacturing sphere, a committee has been set up know as the CIO, Committee <Col N="185" /> on Industrial Organisation, to see what should be done to enable Irish industry to be prepared for the Common Market.  There is another committee dealing with productivity called the Productivity Committee. These are both under Government auspices.  As well as that, you have existing bodies such as Chambers of Commerce and the Federated Union of Employers dealing with industrial relations, and the Irish Management Institute.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in the setting up of some of these new committees.  It must very carefully be watched that they do not overlap and interfere with one another.  If there is overlapping and interference, there is a grave danger that these committees will do more harm than good.  They can set up conflicts of personalities and interests. There is a tendency very often when a committee is given a roving commission of that kind, so to speak, to poke their noses into things beyond what they are asked to do and to interfere with something which is being better done by somebody else already. It is most noticeable in the body with which I am associated, the Federated Union of Employers, which is the expert body on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other, there is hardly a society or federation in the country that do not think they are experts on industrial relations or that do not have some people in their associations who think they are experts and think they should interfere with this particular subject, which is dynamite. Anybody acting individually in the sphere of industrial relations can upset the whole atmosphere and create conditions embarrassing to employers, not excluding Government employers, semi-State employers and even the trade unions themselves.  The trade unions, any more than we, are not very fond of people acting too individually.</P>
    <P>In connection with the bodies being set up at present, has any estimate been made of the costs being incurred by the activities of these new committees? Very often, by seeing what a thing is costing, attention is drawn to what we are getting for the money and what they are doing.  There is a danger, <Col N="186" /> on the other hand, that they may try to do more than they are supposed to do in order to earn the money.</P>
    <P>I hope that co-operation and coordination between all the elements of the community will succeed in preparing us for what we all want in the future, namely, a prosperous and successful entry into the new trading era when we will either be in the Common Market, where we shall have to face open competition, or outside the Common Market when we shall have to face even more open competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this debate is rather narrow. It is limited to Government expenditure and Government expenditure as a whole.  I take it that we are concerned in this debate with the total Estimates for the year and not with the individual items in the Estimates, which would take us very far afield.  The debate is also concerned with expenditure apart from revenue.  Later on, in July of this year, we will be debating the Budget in which case taxation and revenue will be the main subjects of the debate.  The amount of taxation which we will have to face in the year is very largely&mdash;in fact, entirely&mdash;determined by the amount of expenditure decided today.</P>
      <P>There is a very striking contrast between the State and the individual in this matter.  The individual's expenditure is limited by his income, but in the case of public authorities and the State, their income is determined by their expenditure.  In the case of the individual, unless he is very improvident and living beyond his means, he will make some sort of a budget as to what his income will be, and he will try to cut his cloth according to that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the State and the public authorities, the first decision is how much the Government will spend and then how the money will be raised.  Therefore, this division between revenue and expenditure is really fictitious. We are laying the foundation for the Budget today because the <Col N="187" /> Budget will decide how revenue will be raised.  The amount of revenue raised will depend on expenditure, and expenditure depends on the decision of the Dáil and Seanad in regard to the Estimates.  Those are the matters we are debating this evening.</P>
    <P>Looking at the trend of expenditure, there is no question at all that public expenditure has risen.  That is not peculiar to this country.  It is a world-wide tendency today.  Over a long period there has been a trend for public expenditure in every country to rise in relation to national income as a result of some political forces, as a result of the growth of nationalisation, of increases in public and semi-public utilities.  It is also a reflection of the growth of the social conscience.  People are appalled nowadays at the spectacle of poverty, ill health and illiteracy and, therefore, in every country in the world more and more is being spent on the relief of those evils, on the operation of nationalised industries and public utilities of one kind or another.  Therefore, this country is in no way an exception.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure is rising all over the world in every country and, as the Taoiseach said at column 1194 during the debate in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>The key question which the Government and the Dáil have to consider is not whether these extensions in Government services are desirable&mdash;there is no question of their desirability&mdash;but whether we can afford them.  Because of the economic expansion which we have experienced in recent years, we can now afford a higher level of Government services than we could have afforded previously, and as long as that economic growth continues, so also will the scope of these services expand in line with the rate of growth.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems relevant in this discussion to consider what is the probable trend in the rate of growth because of the possibility of public expenditure increasing.  As the Taoiseach very properly said, expenditure <Col N="188" /> is limited by the rise in the growth of the national income.</P>
    <P>That involves casting our eyes back over the year which is coming to an end now, and casting our eyes forward to the coming financial year to which these Estimates apply.  Looking backwards I think we could very shortly summarise 1961 as a year in which national income increased by five per cent.  Investment and employment other than in agriculture increased quite substantially.  Industrial output increased by nine per cent.; the population was stable; the rate of emigration was not greater than new employment in the industrial field.  The balance of payments was not unsatisfactory. It is expected to show a deficit of about £5,000,000 on current account but there was an inward flow of reserves.  The external assets in the banking system were substantially increased, with the result that the balance of payments is not such as would give rise to any anxiety.</P>
    <P>As Senator McGuire said, the one disquieting element is the rise in wages and the rise in costs.  The eighth round of wage increases does seem to have exceeded the increase in productivity of the average worker.  Therefore, I do not think it is unfair to say that some evidence of cost inflation has begun to appear in the system.  By cost inflation I mean a rise in prices caused by a rise in costs.  Government expenditure has been rising more rapidly than national income.  National income has risen by about five per cent., and Government expenditure has risen by more than that, and that brings about what the economists in their despised jargon call a demand inflation: an increase in prices caused by an increased demand.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think it is not unfair to say that most people would agree with me that, looking back over 1961, there is evidence of two types of inflation, cost inflation as a result of the increases of the wage level and demand inflation caused partly by increases in incomes and partly by increases in Government expenditure.  Those two types of inflation mutually act and react upon each other and, therefore, I <Col N="189" /> do not think it is unfair to say&mdash;I may be incorrect; I speak subject to correction and I am only expressing my opinion&mdash;that in 1961 there were exhibited in this country some symptoms of inflation, partly cost and partly demand.</P>
    <P>I should like to examine shortly the reason for the growth of public expenditure.  I think it can be divided into two classes.  In the first place it is the result of a rise in the cost of existing services, and secondly it is the result of increases in services. That is an important distinction.  The extent to which the increase in public expenditure reflects the increase in the cost of the existing services is to some extent unavoidable, and the extent to which it represents an increase in the number and type of services is less unavoidable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in the Dáil, the increases in expenditure, both in the present year and in the coming year to which these Estimates apply, is a result of increases in remuneration. In other words, it reflects the eighth round wage increases to which I have referred.  At column 1060 of the Dáil Debates the Minister referred to the additional expenditure of £5.24 millions caused by the increase in salaries and wages.  Undoubtedly, that is a reflection of the general rise in salaries and wages throughout the country.  No one could express disagreement with the Minister, even from the lowest practical point of view, apart from ethical considerations, when he said that remuneration given to public servants must move in the same direction as in private business.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of column 1060 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The rates of public service remuneration are largely determined, under conciliation and arbitration procedures, by the rates in outside employment.  Although productivity improvements are constantly being sought through better organisation and methods, remuneration charges in the public services cannot but be affected by the general increase in wage and salary rates, unless the <Col N="190" /> public services themselves were to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>That is unquestionable.  There is no question at all that the rise in wages and salaries in the public service reflects the general rise in wages and salaries in the country generally. Having said that, I think we must say this on the other side, that although the Government are to some extent the victims of rising wages, they are to some extent responsible for them. In certain cases in this country the rises have been started in the public service.  It is a two-way operation. There has been a raising of the level in private service which has been translated into the public service, but there has also been a raising of the level of wages and salaries in some public utilities which has been translated into private industry at the same time.  In other words, there is a reciprocal relation between the public and the private sectors.  Rises in costs in the private sector are, as the Minister said, undoubtedly reflected in the public sector, but rises in the public sector are equally reflected in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The trouble in that case is that rises in the public sector may be tolerable, whereas rising costs in the private sector are not tolerable and cannot be passed on.  In discussing this question of the raising of labour costs, one must draw a distinction between industries that can pass on rising costs and industries which cannot do so.  Amongst industries that can pass on rising costs, in the first place, are the protected industries, protected in the home market.  In the second place, we have a number of public services of all kinds&mdash;essential public services for which the public have to pay&mdash;and increases in those services can be passed on.  That can be done by way of increased charges, as we see all around us, such as increased postal charges, or&mdash;which is a less desirable thing&mdash;they can be passed on by increased taxes.  The protected industries and public services are able to make the consumers or the taxpayers, or in some cases, both, pay increased costs.</P>
    <P>Industries which are trying to <Col N="191" /> export, which are not protected and which have to meet competition from outside, are not in this happy position. Therefore, they find themselves faced with the danger that if costs rise in the protected industries and the public services, they may find themselves going to the wall.  This is a very real danger today.  It must be remembered that the field of public employment is growing all the time, and on that, I should like to refer to a British White Paper dealing with public expenditure, known as the Plowden Report from the name of the Chairman, which pointed out that &ldquo;as a consequence of these changes in public expenditure, the public sector of the economy in Great Britain now employs about one quarter of the total labour force&rdquo;.  I do not know exactly the figure for Ireland, but whatever it is, it is rising and it is considerable. Therefore if there is a substantial rise in remuneration in this considerable sector, obviously there will be demands for equivalent rises in the private sector and apart from protected industries which now are becoming less and less important in this country, these increases in remuneration may not be able to be met.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, have a duty.  It is perfectly true, and I agree with the Minister on this, that to some extent the Government are caught up in a tendency from which they cannot escape, but at the same time, they themselves are to some extent responsible for setting higher targets.  Certainly at a time like this, when we are faced with the new competition in Europe, the Government have a very grave responsibility, indeed, to hold down costs in the public services.  By holding down costs, I do not necessarily mean reducing money wages.  As Senator McGuire has stated, real costs of production depend on a great many other things, such as mechanisation, automation, scientific management and intelligent use of existing resources. For the Minister to plead that the rise in the Estimates is the result of rising salaries and wages which reflect rises in salaries and wages in the private sector is only a half-truth.  It is not untrue, but it is only a half-truth, because the rise in the private sector is, <Col N="192" /> to some extent at any rate, a reflection of the rise in the public sector for which the Minister or some of the public utilities which the Government to a greater or a lesser extent control are&mdash; I do not like to say to be blamed&mdash;the people at whose door responsibility must be laid.</P>
    <P>So much for the rise in the Estimates caused by increases in the cost of existing services.  Another factor increasing the Estimates is, of course, the increase in the number of services. Here again, I do not want to appear critical of the Government because these rises in public expenditure, as I have said already, are a reflection of social progress, of the emphasis which has been placed more and more on social services and on public utilities and therefore a sign of social progress. As the Taoiseach said, again quoting from column 1194, it is a function of the Government.</P>
    <P>to try to keep the rate of expansion of the services provided by the Government in line with the expansion of national resources, as well as to use the machinery of taxation to level out inequalities and to ensure the equitable distribution of the benefits of economic expansion among all elements comprising our national community.</P>
    <P>That is perfectly true, but at the same time it must be remembered that, if public expenditure increases more rapidly than national income and if there are Budget deficits or near-deficits at a time like this, the Government are adding more fuel to the inflationary fire which we have already noted, because, as I tried to point out earlier, there are inflationary symptoms in the economy.  If the Government by well-meaning but ill-judged increases in public services at a time like this increase public expenditure, they are adding fuel to the fire.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this debate is that anybody who criticises any new proposed services is looked upon or classed as being unsympathetic to advances in social services, and there is practically no claim that can be made for increased Government expenditure that cannot be very ably defended in <Col N="193" /> debate, but at the same time, it is the duty of the Government to resist these demands if they outrun the capacity of the country to afford them.  As I said already, quoting the Taoiseach, it is the unpopular duty of the Government to resist these schemes.</P>
    <P>There are two main justifications put forward for these increases in expenditure. One is that, in the widest sense, they are social services, and the increase in expenditure in this country is largely due to this according to the Minister.  I quote him from column 1061 of the Dáil Debates in which he said:</P>
    <P>By far the largest category of expenditure is that comprising the social welfare and health services. These two items combined account for £36.6 million or 30 per cent. of the total of Supply Services.</P>
    <P>Then, in column 1063, he says:</P>
    <P>The next most important grouping of State expenditure is education.</P>
    <P>Health, social welfare and education are all social services of which everybody will approve.  Nobody would be so obscurantist or so old-fashioned today as to say that these are not a perfectly proper subject for public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The next justification invariably put forward is that any increase in public expenditure would appreciably increase national productivity and on that I want to quote again from the Minister, column 1063 in the debate in the Dáil, where he justified £28 million expenditure on agriculture if it is directed either towards reducing farmers' costs or stimulating production.  At column 1064 he said that grants for the promotion of industry continued to comprise a large and expanding element of expenditure. He said that for tourism, and industry with potentialities of rapid expansion, another million pounds would be available.  In other words, the expenditure could be justified on the grounds of increasing production in agriculture, increasing production in industry and increasing production in the tourist trade.  This is all perfectly true.</P>
    <P>There is this to be said about the <Col N="194" /> expenditure on the social services.  It does not in itself make a demand on the national resources.  It is of a redistributive kind.  There is a plus and a minus.  It does not make the demand on the national resources that such things, for example, as the Army and Navy do and we are lucky in this country to be saved large expenditure on defence for that reason.  The greater part of the expenditure on social services is redistributive and there is a minus and plus which balance out. That expenditure is not exhaustive, it does not make a claim on the resources of the country.  It merely shifts an amount of wealth into what the Government judge&mdash;rightly no doubt&mdash;to be productive or socially desirable uses.</P>
    <P>The point I am coming to is this. Although this expenditure is redistributive mainly and though it has social justification&mdash;such things as health, education and the relief of poverty&mdash; and though it may be productive in the long run, in the short run it does involve the necessity for more taxation and puts up the Budget.  That is what we have to face because this debate is on public finances in general and economic policy.  From the public finance point of view, unless the national income expands very rapidly, increases in expenditure, however well justified on social or productive grounds, do lead to demands for additional levies and the shape of the Budget is being decided in these debates.  If additional revenue is derived from indirect taxation we have more costs to face; the cost of living rises; the trade unions are on the warpath again; we have the ninth round of wage increases.  If it is met from direct taxation on savings, enterprise and incentive are discouraged. The business people, the saving classes, find more of their income taken in meeting current Government expenditure.  The Taoiseach has already stated in the Dáil debate that the rate of savings in this country is one of the lowest in Europe. &ldquo;The percentage of our total national income which is saved for investment in future development is one of the lowest in Europe.&rdquo;  An increase in direct taxation will lower it still more. <Col N="195" /> So that, if this additional expenditure leads to a demand for additional revenue, it has to be met, assuming the Budget is balanced which I would assume, by increased indirect taxation and a ninth round or by direct taxation which reduces incentive for saving which according to the Taoiseach is already unduly low.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think we are entitled to warn the Minister of certain dangerous trends shown in this Vote on Account.  Government expenditure seems to be increasing more rapidly than national income and though each individual item may be justified, taken in isolation, the total shown in the Book of Estimates is rather large and, as I said at the very beginning, this debate is concerned with the total, not with individual Estimates.  We do not debate Estimates in this House; we debate only the total.  The total shown in the Book of Estimates does suggest that Government expenditure is rising more rapidly than national income.  Therefore, the trend is for expenditure to outrun current income which will inevitably call for an increase in taxation in the future.</P>
    <P>So far I have been looking back, it is the backward look, at 1961.  Now let us look forward to 1962, the year to which these Estimates refer.  Again, I am expressing only my personal opinions, but they are opinions based on a good deal of study and research.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments this year will not be as satisfactory as last year. That can be safely predicted.  Agricultural exports will not be maintained because last year agricultural exports were largely maintained by running down of stocks.  The inflation which is undoubtedly present in the system, in so far as it is a cost inflation, will make exports more expensive and less competitive and in so far as it is a demand inflation will call for additional imports.  Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a deficit in the current year.  The balance of payments in 1962 will be less satisfactory than in 1961.</P>
    <P>As Senator McGuire stated, this country is exceptionally sensitive to <Col N="196" /> external influences.  It is probably the most open economy in the world. Every wind that blows in the outside world can have effects here.  From the point of view of external markets the outlook is not unsatisfactory, if it were not for the complications regarding the Common Market situation. The future demand in Great Britain seems to be a rising one.  Continental production is rising.  There is no sign of a recession in the United States of America.  Therefore, the external market position seems to be reasonably satisfactory.  But there is no getting away from the fact that the prospect of Ireland either being admitted or not being admitted into the Common Market generates an atmosphere of considerable uncertainty and nothing is worse for business than uncertainty.  If business people knew their fate one way or another they could take decisions but many business people now are completely baffled by the prospects.  The result is that there is a running down of stocks.  People are not making long-period production decisions regarding either working capital or fixed investment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the country is facing a position of great uncertainty with regard to its export markets, in spite of the fact, as I said, that the business condition in the main markets is itself satisfactory.  We are entering into a position of great obscurity and there are certain questions which the Seanad is entitled to ask the Minister to apply his mind to.  Is the national income in 1962 going to rise as rapidly as in 1961?  I want to make a very clear distinction between the money income and the real income.  Possibly the money income will rise, because when a country is in inflation money income rises quite rapidly.  This is one of the symptoms.  Will the real income, in terms of gross national product, apart from money value, rise in 1962 as rapidly as in 1961?  I am asking that question.  I do not attempt to answer it.  Will the balance of payments in 1962 be as satisfactory as it was in 1961 to this extent, that although there was a deficit in 1961 it does not call, in my humble opinion, for anything in the <Col N="197" /> way of a drastic correction: because the reserves increased, and the inward flow of funds more than neutralised the deficit in the balance of payments? Have we any reason to believe 1962 will be equally good?  That is a question that must be faced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the purely public financial side, which is what we are debating here, will the revenue continue to be as buoyant as it was?  The financial year now closing has been very lucky for the Minister.  Revenue has been very buoyant in view of all the uncertainties regarding production and the balance of payments.  Can that buoyancy be expected to last?  Will the amount of saving and investment keep up?  The Taoiseach has already stated it is altogether too low.  Will it increase or sink to a lower level?  These are some of the questions which the Minister for Finance must ask himself and must attempt to answer when he produces Estimates showing an increase of 10 per cent. for the present financial year.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that the background is one which does not justify large increases in Government expenditure, that the prospect, as far as we can judge, of production and the balance of payments is one that calls for extreme caution in regard to public finances and in that I include not only current but also capital expenditure. The capital expenditure must be pruned quite as carefully as current expenditure because capital expenditure, although it may be met out of borrowing, does involve taxation in the future.  I should like to refer to a valuable paper entitled: &ldquo;Trends in Public Expenditure&rdquo; published in the February issue of the British Bulletin for Industry which is very relevant to this debate.  I am quoting from that now.  It says:</P>
    <P>Investment expenditure in so far as it creates new buildings, etc., tends to increase current expenditure in the future in the maintenance and staffing of new buildings.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to weary the Minister with a subject on which I have harped year after year.  It is of <Col N="198" /> such importance that it should be repeated.  Just as I have said in regard to current expenditure, that although the fact that it is productive may justify it, it does not avoid future taxation, in the same way the fact that a great deal of public investment is productive does not mean that it does not involve future taxation because a great deal of public expenditure of a capital kind may be productive only in the long run.  Such things as school buildings, agricultural colleges, arterial drainage, are all things which, in the long run, will be productive but in the short run the debt service has to be met.  As I have told the Minister at other times in other Senates&mdash;I hope it will be new to the new Senators because I feel ashamed repeating it&mdash; the distinction between productive and unproductive capital expenditure by the Government is not the same as that between the self-liquidating and dead-weight debt.  If capital expenditure is not productive in the long run it has no justification at all but even the most productive capital expenditure may involve the Government in considerable dead-weight debt, in which case the charges in relation to the Central Fund will also increase.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Parliamentary Question on Thursday the Minister stated that the debt service for the current year had risen from last year from £20 millions to £22 millions, or 10 per cent., the same increase as in the Estimates, and twice the increase in the national income.  That is not a healthy situation.  The national debt service must be very carefully watched for two reasons.  As I have said over and over again in these debates, interest rates are not going to fall.  If the Minister has the idea that he is going to be able to borrow at less than about 6 per cent. in the next few years he is nursing an illusion.  Interest rates are keeping up.  Secondly, although the population is stable and seems to have ceased to fall, the <i>per capita</i> burden of interest rates has not eased as it has in countries with a rising population.  Therefore, the incurring of the dead-weight debt should be approached with great hesitation.</P>
    <P>The only expenditure properly relevant <Col N="199" /> to this debate, I agree, is the Supply Services but I think I am entitled to warn the Minister that expenditure below the line and expenditure on voted Capital Services can in the long run have just as evil effects on the public finances as increases in Supply Services.  I know it is very easy for us to talk the way I have been talking and to advocate economy in public services.  If one is asked on what services one would economise it is very difficult to give a satisfactory reply.  Once a service has entered into the pattern of the Estimates it is very difficult to cut it out.  If one looks at the British public finances for the past ten years one sees a very notable dip in the proportion of the national income taken in public services.  That is the aftermath of the war, disarmament and reduction in defence expenditure. We have nothing of that kind. There is no large section such as Defence in a period after the war which can distinctly be cut.  Therefore, I entirely agree with the Minister that it is very easy for us to advocate reducing the Estimates but very difficult to point to what should be reduced.  The moral to be drawn from that is this. The Estimates of tomorrow result from the decisions of today.  It is when decisions are made in regard to public expenditure that the future expenditure is decided.  That, I entirely agree with.  Once a decision has been made, once there is an increase in the social services, it cannot in practice be dropped.  Therefore, if there is one lesson that should be learned and followed by Ministers for Finance today it is the necessity for planning public expenditure well ahead in relation to the problem of national resources.</P>
    <P>Again, I refer to the report of the Plowden Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure, where the following opinion is expressed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Regular surveys should be made of public expenditure as a whole, over a period of years ahead, and in relation to prospective resources; decisions involving substantial future expenditure should be taken in the light of these surveys.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> On page 8 of the same Report we read:</P>
    <P>The other side of the survey is the prospective development of income or economic resources.  This is susceptible to prediction five years ahead only within broad limits. Moreover, public expenditure will itself be affected by the rate of economic growth; and the rate of economic growth will be affected by the size and nature of public expenditure. Nevertheless, we think that it should be possible to form worthwhile judgments about whether a certain prospective size and pattern of public expenditure is likely to stimulate or to retard the growth of gross national product, and is likely to outrun the prospective resources available to finance it.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to that passage which I think should be learned and digested and practised in every Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In the long run, everything depends on the growth of the economy itself. If the national product continues to grow at the rate at which it has been growing for two or three years, the considerable expansion in public expenditure can be tolerated.  It is just like the case of an individual man.  If his income grows, he can afford things he could not afford earlier.  As he becomes richer, he can afford things he could not afford when he was less rich.</P>
    <P>As I said already, when we come to deal with the State, we have to draw this vital distinction between an increase in money income and an increase in real wealth.  If a man's money income is increasing, except in a period of gross inflation, he is becoming better off.  In the case of a nation, if the money income is increasing, whereas the net product is not increasing, the country is not becoming better off.  It is simply running into inflation.  We have already noted some signs of inflation in this country.  If that inflation is not corrected, the Government may find it necessary, in carrying out an approved national policy, to damp down growth in the country <Col N="201" /> by putting on brakes, monetary or fiscal controls that will curb the expansion of the economy and cut down the inflation to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>A slowing down of that kind, a brake of that kind may produce very undesirable consequences.  It may produce symptoms of deflation, causing unemployment and in this country emigration as well as depression in the national income.  Therefore, it should be avoided if possible.  The way to avoid it, of course, is to prevent the necessity for it arising.  The way to prevent the necessity for it arising is to curb inflation early.</P>
    <P>One never picks up a discussion on economic questions today without reading that there is a conflict within stability and growth and that if the money income of the community grows too rapidly, instability appears in the currency, in the exchanges, and in order to restore stability the growth has to be retarded, held back, which, as I said, may produce extremely undesirable consequences such as redundancy, unemployment and in this country emigration.</P>
    <P>In the long run, of course, there is no conflict between stability and growth.  No country can grow healthily unless it has monetary and financial stability.  Therefore, it behoves the Government, the guardian of the national finances, to preserve stability, because if they fail to do so, they may have to check growth in order to restore stability.  In that case, the check on growth is a result of earlier unwisdom in the field of public finance.</P>
    <P>To discuss all the measures necessary for a Government to preserve stability in the national finances would involve lengthening this speech which is already far too long.  However, I would refer the Minister again to the important publication from which I quote, Bulletin for Industry, February, 1962, in which the British Treasury expresses these views which I commend to the Minister's attention:</P>
    <P>In its measures to strengthen control over public expenditure the <Col N="202" /> Government are applying the following criteria:</P>
    <P>(1)  insistence on value for money by working to secure maximum efficiency in use of public funds;</P>
    <P>That, as Senator McGuire said and as I said earlier, is about efficiency in productivity in the public service.</P>
    <P>(2)  determination of the relative importance of different classes of spending at different times;</P>
    <P>That is, priorities.</P>
    <P>(3)  allowance of special priority to classes of expenditure which will foster economic growth and improve Britain's efficiency and competitive power.</P>
    <P>That is particularly true today on the eve of the new events in Europe.</P>
    <P>(4) examination of public expenditure as a whole, over a period of years ahead, to see that it is planned in proper relationship to prospective resources.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would observe these four counsels of perfection, he certainly would be deserving of the applause and approval of the Seanad in future years.</P>

      <P>In this general debate on the financial policy of the State, Senators have a choice, I think, of three ways of approaching it.  They can approach it as statesmen, taking a detached and general view, such as, if I may say so, Senator O'Brien has just taken.  We have listened to him with the greatest of interest.  One can always admire the width and profundity of his outlook.  The second approach that the Senator can adopt is that of a Party politician, attacking the Government at all costs and on all counts.  The third approach is to speak as a vocational representative.  That is probably the humblest role of all, but it is the one which I propose to adopt this evening.  I propose to talk on the Vote for Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that we cannot go into the precise details of the Estimates.  Government policy on education, as is quite clear from the statement before us, is one of expansion. A notable feature of the general policy is the marked increase towards universities.  That is a matter of wisdom, I consider, and of generosity, and I commend the Government for it. I am speaking especially from the point of view of Dublin University.  The members of that college and the graduates of that college are pleased and more than pleased with this gesture of confidence on the part of the Government as displayed in these increased grants.</P>
      <P>This is not simply a matter for the Vote for the Department of Education because much of the Vote has gone towards our historic buildings. Our historic buildings are part of the historical inheritance of the whole country.  They are at the disposal of the whole country while they are in that college.  Although some people think otherwise, I can assure them that they are there for Ireland as a whole and in general.  I can also assure the Minister, to use Senator O'Brien's phrase, that we will do our utmost to see that he gets &ldquo;value for the money&rdquo;&mdash;value in terms of service to the whole of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the generous grants towards the library fund of Trinity College.  I think everyone who has seen it and other buildings of the kind throughout Europe or the world will realise that this is one of our most precious possessions&mdash;the main room is so magnificent in proportion, and the collections of books are so rich and various in scope.  The Government once again have shown that they are determined to preserve our historical inheritance.  All such things can bind a country together, although they can also divide it.  They can bind it together, and in that sense of a common historical inheritance we in Trinity College would like to play our part in uniting the country and in preserving the history of the country. I could say a great deal more on these <Col N="204" /> topics but I shall not do so, and I appreciate your indulgence, Sir, so far.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention another example of the fact that the present Government are &mdash; and, indeed, previous Governments were&mdash;determined to see that what is good in our Irish history will be preserved.  It may seem a small thing to the House, but I think if Senators reflect on it for a moment they will think differently. Members of the House may remember that some months ago&mdash;this will come under the Vote for the Office of Public Works&mdash;during the progress of excavations in Dublin Castle there were found some very remarkable archaeological relics going back to the 11th century or, perhaps, earlier.</P>
    <P>Here I think it should go on the records of the House that very great credit is due to the excavator from the Office of Public Works who did that excavation.  Under very great difficulties he worked fast, carefully, and accurately, and produced this most interesting memorial of Irish history going back, perhaps, to the time of the Norsemen in Dublin.  Another Government&mdash;I do not say an Irish Government&mdash;in another country might say: &ldquo;That is all very well but we are putting up a block of buildings there.  The designs are passed and the money is voted.  The relics will have to be covered up, and the building will have to go ahead.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is greatly to the credit of the Minister that he made a different decision.  He decided that that site would be preserved not only for the citizens of Dublin but for the visitors who will find it full of historic interest. That site will now be preserved in perpetuity by this generous policy at a time when Governments are trying to save as much money as possible, and at a time when some people say that too much money is being spent on building. The Government said: &ldquo;We are going to spend this money.  It will be a confounded nuisance to change our plans and get extra money voted, but we will do it.&rdquo;  I should like to thank the Minister on behalf of everyone interested in the history of the country for that decision.  It will remain there <Col N="205" /> as a permanent memorial to enlightened Government policy.</P>
    <P>The next matter on which I wish to speak is rather a contrast to what I have just been saying.  Last August we sanctioned something like £300,000 for local authority university scholarships. That, again, was a mark of increased interest in education.  During the course of the debate a member of the House pointed out to the Minister for Education that there were certain anomalies in the granting of university scholarships by some local authorities.  I have before me&mdash;I received it today&mdash;the University Scholarship Scheme of the Dublin Corporation.  An anomaly to which I referred on that occasion, when the Minister implied that he would look into it, is still flagrantly there.  In fact there is a flagrant injustice in this publication by the Corporation authorities in relation to this scheme which is now being partly paid for by public moneys from the public Exchequer, I understand.  No citizen of Dublin can go to Trinity College, Dublin under a Dublin Corporation scholarship.  I appeal to the fairness and justice of the House.  A very large share of the rates of the city is paid by members of the minority, if you include the firms and households of members of the religious minority. Yet not a single citizen of Dublin can get a university scholarship to Dublin University.  That would not come under our scope or our control were it not for the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister pays for some of the scholarships.  The Minister for Education undertook last <Col N="206" /> August in this House to look into the anomalies and to do the best he could to persuade the local authorities to remove them.  I simply want to urge the Minister for Finance to urge the Minister for Education to go further in looking into these anomalies.  I say it is a flagrant injustice&mdash;and I do not believe a single member of the House would say otherwise&mdash;that people who pay a large share of the rates of the city should not be allowed to go to the University of their choice. I appreciate your indulgence, Sir, in allowing me to ventilate that matter.</P>
      <P>My last point is a small one in compass, but it is a matter of great importance to the country.  There has been a very large increase in the Vote to Bord Fáilte.  I simply want to say that is completely justified.  I have travelled up and down the country a good deal in the past year or so, and wherever I go I see marked improvements in the looks of places and in the amenities.  Last St. Patrick's Day I was in Greystones and it was astonishing to see the changes that have been made there in the past year or so.  I think that this is due to Bord Fáilte.  They have a forward-looking policy. They are looking at the country as a whole, not just districts here and there, and these increases are very thoroughly justified.  In general, though, I share some of the apprehensions voiced by Senator O'Brien, I believe the Minister is wise in this policy of more spending and that besides being wise he has been generous in many of the grants he proposes to give.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator O'Brien speaking, I was reminded of a professor telling one of his pupils that he had been a bit reckless with his money and should be more careful for the future.  My line, I am afraid, must be completely different. My approach to the Minister's problem is that the Minister tends to be far too careful and far too conservative in his approach as Minister for Finance in this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it useful to look at what I said in this debate in March of last <Col N="207" /> year when the Central Fund Bill was before the House.  At that time I was taking the line of expressing the concern of the Labour Party and the trade union movement at the state of the economy.  I criticised what I regarded as the unwarranted air of optimism by Government supporters, and I suggested that the Government had failed by their own test, the test laid down by the Taoiseach, namely, of providing gainful employment in this country.  My theme could usefully be similar on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It would be relevant to make reference to the question of employment. The mark and assessment of the merits of a Government always advocated by Fianna Fáil are whether or not the Government can provide gainful employment for Irishmen in this country.  I find looking back over the years that the peak in employment was in 1955. At that time there were 455,000 employed in agriculture and 726,000 in non-agricultural work.  The last year for which official figures are available is 1960, and they show that 413,000 were employed in agriculture and 699,000 in non-agriculture&mdash;an overall drop of 69,000 in those five years.  It is true that the estimates for 1961 show a slightly better figure.  The estimates are that in agriculture for 1961 there were 410,000, a drop of 3,000 as compared to the previous year, and in nonagricultural work 709,000, an increase of 10,000, but still leaving the picture that from the peak of employment in 1955 down to the estimated figures for 1961 there has been a drop in employment of 62,000 persons.</P>
    <P>The improvement last year, which is welcome, was at the estimated rate of 7,000 people more in employment.  It is good to see that the trend has been reversed but I am entitled to make this comment, that at that rate of improvement it would take us another nine years before we got back to the level of employment which existed in 1955&mdash;another nine years which we will not have.  That is ignoring the question of the rate of unemployment in this country, which is now about six per cent. and which is the highest in Western Europe, and ignoring the <Col N="208" /> natural increase in population, so that even at best the efforts of the Government in what they termed a very successful year with a buoyant economy, employment over all has been increased by 7,000.  At that rate of gain it would take us nine years before we got back to the 1955 level.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien said that he thought we had reached stability in regard to population, but I am afraid I cannot agree with him.  The figure used by the Minister in reply to the debate in the Dáil was that the net outward movement of passengers last year was 27,000, and I think the estimated natural increase in the population in the same year was about 25,000.  In other words, the population last year dropped again by another 2,000.  Granted that is not a very big figure.  I do not mind speakers from the opposite benches getting up to say that the trend is much better than it was five or six years ago.  It is a very welcome trend, but there is still that drop in population and I hope it will be quickly reversed.</P>
    <P>It might be said that in our difficulties we are creeping forward.  We are making some progress, but I am satisfied that in the light of these difficulties such creeping forward is not sufficient and is not good enough. There is far too much complacency. There is no real sense of appreciation of the position facing the country and no real dynamic effort to tackle the problems of providing employment for our own people in our country.  We have not another nine favourable years before us in which to get back to the 1955 position.  The most recent years have certainly been favourable to the Government.  The balance of payments has been good.  We have not run into difficulties in that respect.  There has been no international crisis which would upset the applecart and create difficulties here and things generally have been fairly favourable for the Government.  They have been lucky in that respect, but we have not the possibility of more favourable years before us in which we can creep further in order to provide more employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to what I thought was a failure over decades to <Col N="209" /> provide enterprises to take up the slack in the economy here.  I suggested that in this country we have shown a particular aptitude to exploit successfully public organisations or enterprises. We have the strange contradiction that we had in the debate here last year, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael arguing the point as to who started certain public enterprises.</P>
    <P>There was a dispute about who started the Sugar Company.  Still those two Parties, those two conservative Parties, become very coy and apologetic in other circumstances when reference is made to the large sector of this economy taken up by public enterprise. It is the view of the Labour Party and of the trade union movement &mdash;it has been traditionally their view&mdash; that we have not in this country had enough State participation in promoting development, participation which in the system here would not alone have been justifiable but could, indeed, have been regarded as essential.  My fear is that in some way we have missed the boat, that there will no longer be opportunities, as there were in the past, for a native Government to participate in enterprise to advance employment here.  Fianna Fáil have had most of 30 years of government.  I feel that too often probably Governments have been dominated by older, safer, conservative Ministers.  It seems to have lost its dynamism, perhaps due to the war, but that is the position.  The Fianna Fáil Party and successive Governments had that opportunity in the past 30 years and I do not think they successfully exploited it.  In the inevitable progression towards free trade I do not think we will have the opportunities for active State participation in promoting employment and industry as were available in the past three decades.</P>
    <P>Let me turn for a moment to the money being asked for in this Bill and Book of Estimates.  The increase&mdash; and great play was made of it in the Dáil&mdash;is £16½ million approximately. The Minister has&mdash;as I think is customary for all Ministers at this time of the year&mdash;made a very gloomy forecast of the Budget, warning us of dark <Col N="210" /> consequences, <i>et cetera.</i>  It is true that some £5 million of the increase in the Estimates is due to pay adjustments related largely to the effect of the eighth round of increases.  Thanks to the effects of PAYE which the trade unions advocated and supported for years, the Minister has readily available to him an immediate income.  I suggest that PAYE will immediately bring in probably most of the £5 million required to pay the increases in remuneration to State employees.  I was recently looking at the figures paid by notional people on set incomes and relating that to the eighth round.  You get some surprising results.  I am sure the Minister is probably aware of this anyway.  A person on an income of £1,000 per annum up to now, a single person, if he is affected by the eighth round might get an increase of 15 per cent.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with expenditure involved in increased remuneration to State employees and I am making the point that it is largely recovered by the effect of PAYE on increased wages resulting from the eighth round but I will be very brief. A person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  We have been discussing the possible inflationary effect of the eighth round.  I do not think there is too big a risk in that <Col N="211" /> round because of the existence of PAYE which is immediately anti-inflationary. It means that the income resulting from the eighth round is immediately largely siphoned off before it gets into the worker's pocket at all.  You have that situation and by reason of that the amount being siphoned off is proportionately much greater than the actual increase.  Take a man whose wages are increased by 15 per cent.  He was on £1,000 per annum and he goes to £1,150.  If he were a single man his rate of income tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made my point that PAYE and the fact that it is in existence is a very anti-inflationary measure and will enable the Minister to recover the increased costs of the eighth round to the employees of the State.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, speaking to this debate in the Dáil, made reference to the various rounds of increases and was good enough to say of the seven previous rounds at column 1199, volume 193:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the whole period from the end <Col N="212" /> of the war up to the eighth round of wage increases the improvement in wages was not out of line with what was justified by rising productivity.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, that is what the trade unions had been saying all the time and we welcome very much this acknowledgment by the Taoiseach, even though it is somewhat belated. He goes on to criticise the eighth round and I can understand his concern, but let me make the point that from estimates already prepared&mdash;I think Senator O'Brien made a passing reference to this&mdash;productivity in 1961 is up by 5 per cent.  I hope that the increase in productivity will continue and not alone that the trend will continue but that it will rise, because, again, the Taoiseach, speaking in the same debate, had some very sound things to say about the question of productivity.  What he said was admirable and we can all subscribe to it and it bears repetition here.  He says at column 1200:</P>
    <P>It is the only means by which increases in wages can be made possible, without consequences in prices or in employment, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I want to underline this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving productivity is a function of management; it is largely a matter of giving workers better machines, organising their work more efficiently or securing the maximum utilisation of capital equipment.</P>
    <P>That is quite true and is accepted and acknowledged by the trade union movement.  I might say, too, that the trade union movement is increasingly welcoming efforts to improve productivity and many of the more progressive trade unions would now feel somewhat worried if they found an employer who was not making efforts to improve productivity.  They welcome it, provided arrangements are made for proper consultations and provided things are done by agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very large employer and I wonder would it be appropriate to direct his attention to what the Taoiseach was saying about managerial responsibility, that it is, in <Col N="213" /> fact, the responsibility of the Minister to improve productivity in the Civil Service.  He said efforts are being made, but, quite frankly, many of us think that possibly there is not sufficient drive about it.  I am always advocating that we should look every so often at the way we are doing things.  The way we are doing things might have been sensible twelve months or ten years ago.  That same method might no longer be sensible or economic because of change in costs.  That is why productivity examinations should be a continuing process.  It is very hard for people&mdash;I find this myself&mdash;who are doing a job to look critically at the way they do it.  It is often a very useful exercise to get somebody from outside to have a look at the way things are done and to make suggestions. Sometimes the suggestions are daft, and sometimes they make sense. It is just a question of a fresh mind looking at the way things are done to see if they can be done more efficiently and if productivity can be improved.</P>
    <P>I hope the effects of the eighth round can be largely absorbed by the increase in productivity that has taken place, and by further improvements in the coming year.  We have no evidence that the increased costs in the Civil Service are going to be met to any appreciable extent by improved productivity.  Perhaps, things are being done most efficiently at the moment and nobody could see a more efficient way of doing things.  Maybe so, but if I were dealing with an employer and found there were no changes resulting from increased costs, that no more mechanisation was being introduced, I would be afraid and I would regard it as my responsibility to say to that employer: &ldquo;What are you doing about trying to absorb the increased costs? What efforts are being made?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not saying, and nobody should try to misinterpret me, that employees in the public service are not working hard.  As the Taoiseach rightly said in that debate, it is not a question of working hard.  It is a question of working more effectively, and the responsibility lies with the management, with good management and good supervision. When I see a group of workers <Col N="214" /> hanging about and obviously trying to dodge the time, trying to find excuses until it comes to lunch time or the afternoon break, I feel very vexed, not because they are doing that but vexed at the management and the supervision which produces that result.</P>
    <P>None of us chases after work.  None of us goes along and says: &ldquo;I have not enough work to do, give me more work.&rdquo;  None of us does that but all of us are very much happier and get what I call job satisfaction if things are so arranged that the work-load is proper and we feel we are usefully doing something.  I think that particularly in the local services management and supervision are not what they should be.  Productivity could be improved and I am not talking about dismissing workers.  I am talking about arranging things so that you get far more job satisfaction out of your work and are fa rmore usefully employed.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire said he thought the claims pursued by the trade unions for a shorter working week were irresponsible. I think he said something to the effect that workers should not be looking for reduced working hours when not working hard in the longer hours.</P>
    <P>I remember dealing with a problem myself where I argued that in certain larger offices the hours could be reduced by one hour per day without any increase in staff and without any drop in efficiency provided things were better arranged and provided the staff were given the opportunity of cooperating. I am glad to say that I proved that point in some half dozen or ten offices employing between them some 400 employees and where, in fact, hours were reduced by one hour per day without any increase in staff or without any drop in efficiency.  That happened simply because the hours were already too long.  Eight hours for sitting at a desk working at routine repetitive work was, I suggested, too long and could be successfully reduced to seven hours by giving the staff the opportunity of organising their work better and getting away an hour earlier, and they did it.  That is the answer largely to this notion that it is <Col N="215" /> irresponsible to look for a reduction in the working week.  It is not.  It brings more pressure on management to accept their responsibility of increasing productivity, of so arranging things that the workers can be better and more usefully employed.</P>
    <P>May I go back for a moment to this question of the eighth round and its effect on the Estimates and the economy generally?  I shall be very brief on this.  I have already referred to the increase in productivity in 1961 and the hope for increase in 1962.  I hope there will be concentration on efforts to increase productivity rather than any approach to meet the position by increasing prices.  I think that road would lead to disaster to this economy, namely, passing on too lightly or too quickly increases brought about by improvements in wages and improvements in conditions of service.  In some circumstances I know there is really no alternative but I think that for any money offered there should be an increasing drive to improve productivity. The trade unions at present are anxious, from what I know of the position, to co-operate in improving productivity.  I would ask that employers would avail of that cooperation rather than take what would immediately be regarded as the easy way out of increasing their charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, this Central Fund Bill is a Bill which proposes to give authority to the Minister for Finance to expend money in anticipation of the Budget and the Finance Bill which will be introduced in the Dáil in the near future.  The basis of this Central Fund Bill is the Book of Estimates, which was circulated to each Senator a short time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I further understand that this Bill affords the Seanad an opportunity of discussing Government policy in general in the light of the proposed expenditure for the coming twelve months.  This Book of Estimates constitutes a record.  It is a record in the sense that it is the highest bill that has been presented to the Irish taxpayer since the foundation of the State. <Col N="216" /> It is a record, too, in another sense, in that it constitutes the steepest increase in public expenditure in any one year since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>These two records would not, in themselves, be evidence on which to charge the Government with failure to carry out their duty, would not in themselves be evidence on which to indict the policy of the Government as a complete failure.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates presented to the country represents an increase of £17 million.  If it were presented to the country in the light or in the background of an increasing population, of a state of affairs where emigration did not exist and, above all, in the light of a thickly-populated contented and prosperous countryside, then it might be justified.  However, I suggest that this monstrous bill is presented to the House and to the country at a time when our population is falling, when fewer people are being called upon to pay this much-increased demand, when emigration goes on steadily, when there is wholesale flight from rural Ireland, when the farming community&mdash;let this be said again as it cannot be said too often&mdash;who constitute the backbone of our economy are completely dissatisfied, are up in arms and have risen up in arms and when we have a highly inefficient, very costly and unwanted health system.</P>
    <P>If I may be permitted to deal with these items separately, I shall do so. There have been many discussions as to whether the population has or has not fallen, as to whether emigration is on the decrease or on the increase. The only accurate material available to me is the last census.  There is no use in arguing a case on figures that are not yet available in the hope that those figures will prove what you want them to prove.</P>
    <P>Between 1956 and 1961, the last five years covered by statistics, the population decreased by 84,000.  Between 1951 and 1956, the population decreased by approximately 62,000. Between 1946 and 1951, the population increased and it increased for the first time since, as far as I know, <Col N="217" /> the year 1881.  If you look down the Table given in the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> you will find that, in the period 1946 to 1951, there is a plus, the only plus in the Table, and the present Government had no control over this State for practically the whole of that period.  Before leaving the subject of population, I think I am entitled to discuss it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into figures, I think I am entitled to discuss population in a general way.  I come from a town which tops the poll, so to speak, in a fall in population in all Ireland, the town of Cavan.  I come from what is left of our effective jurisdiction of the Province of Ulster, where the fall in population has been the highest&mdash;a bad example I venture to suggest.  Therefore, I say that fewer people are being called upon by this Government to pay the increased bill of expenditure.</P>
      <P>So far as I can ascertain, more people have emigrated in the five year period from 1956 to 1961 than at any time in any five years in the history of the State since 1881.  That can be borne out and proved.  Therefore, again I say that at a time when the Government have failed to arrest the problem of emigration or the decline in population, they are calling upon the country to pay £17,000,000 more than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think people are emigrating because they suffer from wanderlust as some people say, or because they like to go abroad.  I know of a tenant who has been paying a rent of over 12/- a <Col N="218" /> week for the past 12 months while the family are in England.  They are working in England, and in order to keep a home in Ireland&mdash;although it is locked up&mdash;they are paying rent to the local authorities in order to keep a home here to return to.  That is not the act of a man who has emigrated because he does not like Ireland, or because he wants to go abroad.  It is the act and the attitude of a man who is being driven out of the country by sheer necessity.</P>
    <P>The questions of a fall in population and emigration are serious problems but in my respectful opinion by far the most serious problem facing the economy of the country at the moment is the flight from the land and the disappearance of the small farmer and the not so small farmer. Again I repeat&mdash;and it cannot be repeated too often&mdash;that the cornerstone and the foundation of our economy is a rural economy, an agricultural economy, an economy based on the family farm.  The most disastrous aspect of the situation at the moment is the disappearance of the small farmer, the flight from the land, and the callous indifference and complacent resignation of the Government Party to those facts.</P>
    <P>I might blame the Government from time to time for this, that and the other thing, but I admire them at all times for having a very good propaganda machine.  For the past few months I have heard sources, which are usually well informed of what is going on in Government circles, saying that the flight from the land is not confined to Ireland, that it is a cycle that goes on all over the world, and that it is happening everywhere. When I heard that, I said that those people were suffering from depression and that it was only their own point of view but in the course of a Dáil debate on the Vote on Account I heard Deputy Booth, who is a responsible and a respected member of the Government Party, saying that the flight from the land was not peculiar to Ireland, and that it was nothing more nor less than the output of efficient machinery replacing man power.  I think he went on to say <Col N="219" /> that as a city man he would shudder at the thought of having to bring up a family and live on a farm himself.</P>
    <P>Does that represent Government policy?  Does that represent Government thought on this cancer which is eating into the very foundations of the country?  Does Deputy Booth think or do the Government think that it is only the workers who are disappearing?  He seems to think that.  I would invite him to come down to Cavan, Monaghan and the neighbouring counties, and he will find that it is not only the farm workers who are disappearing, but the farmer with 40 acres who is bailing out and clearing off to England. People who used to be considered quite substantial farmers are now delighted to get a job as a lorry driver, a porter in a hotel, or any job away from the farm.  I often wonder are those people being encouraged to adopt that attitude, and is this loose talk of the Government Party that is going on all over the country calculated to encourage people to get away from the basic economy of our country.  It was bad enough to hear Deputy Booth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall go right on to someone who can reply.  It was bad enough to hear members of the rank and file of the Government Party saying that, but in his concluding remarks on the debate the Minister repeated it. He repeated that it was a world trend, and at column 1626 of the Official Report of the debate of 14th March he said:</P>
      <P>There was some talk about people leaving the land.  We were blamed for making the excuses that that is going on in every country, and so it is.  These figures have been quoted so often that I do not want to bother the House with them again.  Every country is having that experience and even-</P>

    <P>Mark &ldquo;fairly&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>substantial increase in the number of people leaving the land.</P>
    <P>There you have what I thought was an irresponsible attitude on the part of a member of the Government Party backed up, corroborated and accepted by the Minister for Finance.  I feel that when he said that the Minister had his tongue in his cheek because he said &ldquo;...even in agricultural countries...&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Even thought I may be an amateur, some of the hardy warriors on the other side of the House seem to be getting annoyed.  I want to ask is this wholesale flight from the land Government policy.  Have they any policy?  The only policy they have is that it is going on everywhere else&mdash;America is even mentioned&mdash; but in most of these other countries people can turn to industry as they have raw materials of their own from which to manufacture but here we have no such raw materials and we are tied to agriculture because that is the way the country was created.  Again I ask is the only answer, the only policy of the Government on this subject, that it is going on everywhere else?  If that is the only policy it is not a policy. It is like the policy of the businessman who made a complete and utter failure of his own business and then religiously reads the <i>Gazeite</i> each week in the hope that he will find consolation by finding some of his friends also bankrupt and going out of business. That is a very poor outlook.</P>
      <P>This huge bill is being introduced at a time when the farmers are up in arms and rightly up in arms.  Some controversy has been going on as to whether or not the Taoiseach chastised the farmers.  I do not propose to quote him.  One would have to read his entire speech, but I do not think it is unfair to say that the Taoiseach's attitude was very critical of the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I will mention one point.  He said the farmers were being led by an irresponsible organisation, an organisation which had become irresponsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are marching behind an irresponsible organisation it means they are irresponsible. The Taoiseach also said that in the first half of the decade just ended the farmers were so prosperous and made so much money that it took the past five years for the other elements of the community to catch up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from column 1199 of the 8th March:</P>
      <P>The general pattern revealed by our records is, however, that from the period from 1948 to 1961 farming incomes per head improved more rapidly during the first half of that period and non-farm incomes caught up in the second half.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite the Taoiseach to go down the country and put that in his manifesto for the next election. When he goes on a tour of the rural constituencies and says that, I will not blame the farmers if they ask him&mdash;I may be pardoned for going back a little&mdash;how long it took farmers following the 1932-38 period to catch up on the incomes of the rest of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When asked by Deputy Corish in the concluding sections of the debate on the Vote on Account why agriculture was not progressing better than it was and why there was not a better return for the money which was being put into it, the Minister for Finance said that what was wrong was the marketing, that everything was all right until it came to the marketing operation.  Now in my opinion that was a worthwhile admission of the Minister but it was a most shocking indictment of Government policy and of the Government which had charge for approximately 23 of the 30 years.  I think that <Col N="223" /> is a fairly accurate statement.  They set out at the very beginning of that period to look for markets.  They come now at the end of that period and say the farmer is down and out and he is as bad as he is because the marketing system is wrong.  I remember before 1957 the present Minister for Transport and Power talked in the Dáil and in the country frequently on agriculture. I think it is fair to say that he had then the most wonderful schemes imaginable for marketing farm produce if only the present Government were put back into power.  After they were put back into power a sum of £250,000 was voted to enable them to seek markets throughout the world. In response to a question recently it transpired that out of that £250,000 the Government in their search for markets had spent the comparatively paltry sum of £23,000.  In my respectful submission this is the greatest indictment of Government policy that has ever come before either of these Houses and coming out of the mouth of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that during the past five years the Minister for Agriculture at home must have been doing nothing to find markets and that at the same time the Minister for External Affairs was going round making bad friends with people who would naturally be some of our best customer.  However, that is a matter of external affairs with which other people are better qualified to deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I think it is in order.  We are not equipped to go into the Common Market.  The agriculture community is not equipped because the Government so misused the money at their disposal that the Irish farmer is not in as good a position as he should be to compete with other farmers in the world.  That can hardly be denied. Over the last 30 years, I think it was during the two terms when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture that anything of a worthwhile nature was done for the farmers of the country.</P>
