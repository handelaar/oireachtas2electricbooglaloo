    <Title>Geneva Conventions Bill, 1961&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, as can be seen from the long title, is to <Col N="418" /> enable the State to become party to the Geneva Conventions which were signed on behalf of this country on the 19th December, 1949.  As Senators will know, it is our practice not to become a party to any international agreement unless or until we are in a position to enforce the provisions of the Agreement.  This legislation, therefore, is intended to make it possible for us to enforce certain provisions of the Geneva Conventions.  The texts of the Conventions, without Annexes, are scheduled to the Bill. The Conventions themselves came into force in October, 1950.  Already 82 States have become parties to them.  The Conventions are entitled as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in the Armed Forces in the Field. This is the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Geneva Convention.</P>
      <P>2.  The Convention for the Amelior-action of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea. This so-called &ldquo;Maritime&rdquo; Convention extends the treatment which is provided for in the first Convention to sailors, etc. who are covered by this Convention.</P>
      <P>3.  The Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.  The earlier Convention to this, of 1929, which was also known as the Prisoners of War Convention, was successful during World War II in alleviating the condition of millions of prisoners of war on both sides.</P>
      <P>4.  The Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.  This is the first international treaty of its kind.  It responds, in this day and age, to a particular need, since, according as war becomes more and more devastating, there is no longer much distinction in its evil effects on armies and civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like once more to express the Government's recognition of the essential part played by the International Committee of the Red Cross in the negotiation and conclusion of the Geneva Conventions.  The history of the Conventions is the history of the Red <Col N="419" /> Cross itself from its foundation in 1863. The humanitarian treatment provided for in the Conventions is only a reflection of the activities of the Red Cross personnel throughout the world.</P>
    <P>This is the third piece of legislation which the Oireachtas has been called upon to pass in order, as I said earlier, to enable us to be in a position to carry out the provisions of the Conventions in full.  Already, in 1954 and 1956 respectively, the Oireachtas has passed the Red Cross Act and The Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act.  The purpose of each of those Acts was to make provision for miscellaneous matters covered by the Conventions but which the Government did not feel able to carry out in the absence of domestic legislation.  This Bill, also, which consists of eight clauses, will enact into our law some of the provisions of the Conventions.  The most important of these provisions are those relating to &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; of the Conventions which are covered in Clause 3 of the Bill and Articles 50 of the First Convention, 51 of the Second Convention, 130 of the Third Convention and 147 of the Fourth Convention.  We also take power in Clause 4 of the Bill to punish persons who commit minor breaches of the Conventions.  The term &ldquo;minor breaches&rdquo; does not, in fact, appear in the Conventions but, as is set out in Sub-clause 4 of Clause 4 for the purposes of the Bill it means a contravention of any provision of the Conventions which is not a &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo;. The Conventions themselves are not as specific in relation to the enactment of legislation for the punishment of &ldquo;minor breaches&rdquo; as they are in relation to &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; but they do provide that parties should take &ldquo;measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions&rdquo; of the Conventions.  The proper course appears to be, therefore, that we should also provide in our legislation for the punishment of &ldquo;minor breaches&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be observed with regard to &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; that we propose to take power to institute proceedings irrespective of where or by whom the breaches have been committed.  This <Col N="420" /> is admittedly a new departure from our criminal law which normally confines itself to offences committed within the jurisdiction of the State or to certain offences committed by nationals outside the State.  Nevertheless, it is necessary that we should take this new step because the Conventions so provide.  If the Senators refer to the following Articles of each of the Conventions, namely, 49 of the First Convention, 50 of the Second Convention, 129 of the Third Convention, 146 of the Fourth Convention, it will be seen that the State is under an obligation &ldquo;to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed such &lsquo;grave breaches&rsquo; and shall bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before its own courts.&rdquo; Alternatively, we could, perhaps, under the same Articles have handed such persons over for trial to another State.  We preferred, however, to choose the first alternative here.  Many other countries have also preferred this procedure and have enacted similar legislation to that which we are considering here.  Among them are Australia, Britain, India, The Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the provisions of Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill.  As can be seen, Clause 5 relates to procedural matters.  Clauses 6, 7 and 8 contain certain guarantees and protection to persons charged with offences.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that we are not enacting all the provisions of the Conventions into our law; the full texts of the Conventions are only scheduled to this Bill in so far as they are relevant to the &ldquo;minor breaches&rdquo; provided for in Clause 4 and also, of course, for convenience of reference.</P>
    <P>May I express the hope, which I am sure the members of Seanad Éireann will share, that it will never be necessary for us to enforce the provisions of this Bill or, for that matter, of the Conventions.</P>
    <P>It would be our intention, subsequent to enactment of this third piece of legislation regarding the Conventions and our ratification of them, that we should print in the Treaty Series <Col N="421" /> the full texts with annexes, so that they may be available for everyone.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Bill will meet with the approval of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which will surely meet with the approval of everybody in the Seanad. It is an example of international agreement. The first object, I presume, of all international organisations is and has always been the avoidance of war. If that is unsuccessful as, of course, it has proved to be unsuccessful so far, the second object is to provide that in the event of war the effects of the war will be mitigated for those who take part in it.  As the Minister has indicated, this particular Bill shows that Conventions have now to be made not only for the treatment of soldiers but also in mitigation of the position of civilians in war.</P>
      <P>It is interesting and I suppose comforting to know from the statement made that over 80 States have already signed these Conventions.  It is proper that we should do so also.  One can only join with the Minister in hoping that in the first instance war will be avoided and that there will be no necessity for putting any part of this Bill into force; and in the second place that in the event of war coming the provisions with which we, of course, agree and which are in accordance with our general outlook and mentality, the provisions of this Bill and of the Conventions which the Bill embodies, will be observed.  I think the Bill is very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously nothing in this Bill that any sane man could disagree with, in principle at any rate.  We would all be happier and a great deal more satisfied with this type of legislation if we could be satisfied that in fact this type of conduct would be followed by all countries in the event of war.  I just want to ask a few questions merely out of interest and for information on the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, I notice that the 1949 Conventions in the Bill replace apparently Conventions signed in 1929. I should like to inquire precisely what countries have subscribed to the new set of Conventions in relation to 1949. <Col N="422" /> If the information were available I should like to see a comparable list of the countries which subscribe to the 1929 conventions.  Information of that kind might help us to assess whether or not we are advancing at all.</P>
    <P>The various sections of this Bill, particularly the ones that lay down legal penalties for those who break the Conventions in this country are set out in some detail.  Are the same penalties imposed by all the other subscribing countries as are imposed on our citizens here by the passing of this type of Bill?  If the same penalties are not imposed I should like to ask why they are not.</P>
    <P>Article 47 of Schedule I provides that the information contained in the text of the Convention and its principles should be disseminated as widely and as far as possible particularly among the military forces and the general public in the countries which subscribe to it.  I should like to ask what precisely are we doing in our own country with a view to seeing that that is done among the members of our own armed forces and the general public.</P>
    <P>Finally, these Conventions were actually signed on the 12th February, 1950.  I should like to know why it took some 12 years for us to be in the position we are now in, in 1962, in passing a measure of this kind in respect of Conventions signed apparently in 1950.  I ask those questions not out of criticism or disagreement with the Bill.  It is the type of information which the House ought to be put in possession of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise two points, one of which has already been touched upon by the previous speaker. The first one is this.  It seems to me that we have got under Clause 7 of the Bill a liability to appoint solicitor and counsel in some cases for anyone who is charged under this Bill.  It seems to me that there could be a danger that we might find ourselves with the expenses of a trial such as the Eichmann Trial in this country where we might have no direct interest other than our liabilities under the Convention.  I suppose that is something which we <Col N="423" /> must take on in signing the Convention but there is a possibility of heavy expenses in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The other point touched upon by the previous Senator is this question of information, which was discussed in the Dáil, and the obligation under Article 47 of the First Schedule to provide that the text and the principles of the Convention are disseminated as widely as possible.</P>
      <P>I remember during the emergency period when I served for a time with the Local Defence Force that the only information we were ever given touching on the Geneva Convention was that if we were ever taken prisoner we were only to give our name, number and rank.  The Minister dealing with this point in the Dáil did say that the officers dealt with the matter very fully in the Military College.  Certainly it would be very important that it should be dealt with at the level of the ordinary soldier.  He should know not only his rights as a prisoner of war but the other side of the picture, how he should behave if he were to take a prisoner of war.  I have talked to one or two serving soldiers and beyond being told to give their name, rank and number I do not think it has been driven into them what their rights are. It is very important at the present time, as soldiers may be put on United Nations service at short notice, that they should know not only their rights but their obligations under this Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Seanad for the manner in which this Bill has been received.  Senator Crowley asked for the list of countries which signed the 1949 Convention. There are 83 of them.  Unfortunately I have not got the list with me but I shall send it to the Senator. The penalties which we have set out here may not be exactly the same as provided by other countries for breaches of the Convention but they are the penalties which seem to us to be appropriate here.  For very grave breaches we provide the maximum penalty of death or penal servitude. Then for minor breaches there are <Col N="424" /> lesser penalties.  There may be some countries which have abolished the death penalty so they would not be in exactly the same position as here.</P>
      <P>Senator Crowley and Senator Ross referred to the dissemination among the Forces and among the public generally of the duties imposed by these Conventions on our Forces in time of war.  In the Military College the officers up to now have got lectures, and are open to be examined, on the Conventions that existed heretofore. I take it they communicate to the soldiers so much of the lectures they get as they deem appropriate for the education of the soldiers in their duties.  If we look through these Conventions, or indeed the previous Red Cross Conventions, there is nothing in them that one would not expect from ordinary Irish soldiers: that they should not abuse prisoners, but treat them with reasonable humanity.  One of the things which Senator Ross thought should be impressed on soldiers was how they should behave if taken prisoner.  That is something which they would have to be told but I do not think they would have to be forbidden to do the things forbidden by these Conventions.</P>
      <P>In regard to the expenses of providing for a trial here, we took that course because we thought it was the one that was preferable in our circumstances. Of course, it would not preclude extradition proceedings being taken in our courts by some other country.  However, we have provided that if somebody is caught here who has committed a grave breach elsewhere, we can try him here for that offence.  That is the main direction in which this Bill is going.</P>

    <Title>Pharmacy Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Col N="425" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill it is proposed to assemble in a convenient and modern form certain provisions relating to the control of pharmacy which are at present dispersed through various earlier enactments and to make additions to the body of law on this subject which experience has shown to be necessary.</P>
      <P>The law on the control of the practice of pharmacy may be said to have originated in an Act of the year 1791 which confined the sale by retail of medicines to licensed apothecaries. By the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the exercise of this monopoly had resulted in an insufficiency of authorised dealers in poisons and medical prescriptions, to the great inconvenience of the public.</P>
      <P>Therefore, by an Act of 1875, a new category of persons was permitted to share the monopoly.  These persons are rather quaintly described in the preamble of the Act as &ldquo;persons who, although they do not desire to practise the art and mystery of an apothecary, desire and are qualified to open shop for the retailing, dispensing and compounding of poisons and medical prescriptions,&rdquo; and the title given to them by the new statute was &ldquo;pharmaceutical chemist&rdquo;.  This Act&mdash;the Pharmacy (Ireland) Act, 1875&mdash; specified that only these, together with the licensed apothecaries and other medical practitioners who had passed an examination in pharmacy, could keep open shop for the sale of poisons or the dispensing or compounding of medical prescriptions.  The Act also provided for the establishment of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and since that time the general government and control of pharmacy has been carried out under the aegis of that body and through its Council, which is elected by those pharmaceutical chemists who, by reason of their payment of an annual fee, are members of the Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By later Acts, further categories of persons were authorised to keep open shop.  The grade of registered druggist, authorised to sell poisons but not dispense medical prescriptions, was <Col N="426" /> created in 1890 and in 1951 a further grade of dispensing chemist and druggist, limited as respects entry to existing druggists and created to further the eventual disappearance of the latter, was given the same rights in respect of keeping open shop as the pharmaceutical chemists themselves.</P>
    <P>I should now like to describe briefly how the present Bill will affect these earlier Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill re-states the law on the keeping of open shop for the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions and the sale of poisons, with some minor changes. Those who are at present entitled to keep open shop for these purposes will continue to be so entitled.  I have already mentioned that this group, in addition to the licensed apothecaries, includes other medical practitioners who &ldquo;in order to obtain their qualifying diploma have passed an examination in pharmacy.&rdquo;  In fact, such entitlement to keep open shop as medical practitioners, other than licensed apothecaries, may have had has long since become a dead letter and I am advised that if I were to drop them altogether from the list of qualified persons, I should not be doing an injustice.  However, in order to guard against the possibility of interfering with any right, however nebulous it might be, I have decided that the existing provisions in regard to medical practitioners, as such, should be continued for all those at present qualified, for those who have already embarked on their medical courses and for any who may do so prior to the commencement of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also contains provisions whereby a pharmacy business can be carried on by the representatives of a pharmacist who dies or becomes bankrupt or of unsound mind.  It is only in the case of a death that this can be done at present.</P>
    <P>Specific provision is included in Section 2 on the carrying on of a pharmacy business by a corporate body.  While there is no explicit reference to this in the present pharmacy law, registered companies have become an important feature of modern business and it is considered <Col N="427" /> desirable to specify clearly the conditions for their participation in retail pharmacy.  The section will require that a corporate body which &ldquo;keeps open shop&rdquo; must employ a full time qualified manager who is not carrying on business on his own account or for anyone else.</P>
    <P>In Section 3 of the Bill provision is made for the protection of the titles, emblems and descriptions which are commonly used by pharmaceutical chemists and others authorised to keep open shop for the purposes specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the making by the Council of the Society of regulations dealing with its courses of training and with the examinations for persons aspiring to become registered. I might mention here that there has recently taken place a very important change in the method whereby persons are trained to become pharmaceutical chemists.  Until quite recently the entire course was carried out by the Pharmaceutical Society.  Now, however, the academic course is taken partly in University College, Dublin, and partly in the Society's own College.  In these circumstances it was considered desirable to re-state the Society's functions in relation to this matter of pharmaceutical education.</P>
    <P>Section 4 therefore provides that the Society may make regulations dealing with the courses of training and examinations to be taken by candidates for registration in any of the registers maintained by the Society.  These regulations may provide for the approval of lecturers and for the conditions of admission to examinations.  They may also provide for the recognition by the Council of the course of study and training and of the examinations of outside bodies.  The new provisions will, I think, give a flexibility in the law on these matters which is desirable in view of the Society's co-operation with the University in the training of pharmaceutical students.</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society will have power, in accordance with regulations, <Col N="428" /> to register as pharmaceutical chemists such persons as can satisfy the Council that they have gained satisfactory qualifications or experience abroad.  The lack of some provision such as this has in the past proved an obstacle to the recognition of Irish pharmacists abroad.  In certain instances when Irish pharmacists wished to have their qualifications recognised in other countries, it was found that this could not be done as no power existed whereby the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland could offer reciprocal recognition to pharmacists trained abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the charging of fees by the Society.  The section re-states the rights of the Society to levy fees for examinations, courses of training and registration and to collect annual fees from those on the register who choose to be members of the Society and thus to participate in its governance.  The section also contains a new provision for the levying by the Society of annual retention fees on persons other than members who are on any of its registers.  I think that I should explain this provision and the reasons for it in some detail.</P>
    <P>Pharmacists as a body enjoy a valuable monopoly in the conduct of their business.  For the protection of this, it is necessary that the Pharmaceutical Society should continue to exercise its important functions of training pharmaceutical chemists, and of maintaining supervision over the observance of the pharmacy code.  It is in the interests of all pharmacists&mdash;and particularly those keeping open shop&mdash;that the Society's activities should be enable to proceed without being hindered by a severe shortage of funds. In fact, the Society is now short of financial resources and has been operating on a deficit for a number of years.  It relies for its income on examination fees, fees for courses, registration fees and the membership fees to which I have referred.  There are at present some 2,600 persons registered as pharmaceutical chemists, but of those only about 1,100 have chosen to pay the annual fees entitling them to membership of the Pharmaceutical Society.  Thus, the financial burden of the Society's activities, in so far as this is <Col N="429" /> defrayed by membership fees, is borne by persons who constitute less than half those eligible for membership.  In the circumstances, I consider it reasonable that provision should now be made for the payment of reasonable annual retention fees by all pharmacists who desire to remain on the register.  There is nothing novel in this.  At present, dentists and opticians pay quite substantial annual retention fees and so also do solicitors and patent agents.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out to me in the course of the debates in Dáil Éireann on these provisions that the monopolistic benefits enjoyed by pharmacists who keep open shop are considerably more valuable than those enjoyed by other pharmacists, such as those employed in hospitals or in industry.  I am satisfied that there is some force in this contention and it has accordingly been provided, by an amendment made in the Dáil, that different fees may be charged on pharmacists keeping open shop and on those engaged otherwise in pharmacy.</P>
    <P>The amount of the fees for retention on the register and of other fees will be subject to the consent of the Minister.  This should be sufficient to ensure that the fees are not fixed at such a level as would impose undue hardship.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the conferring by the Society of the title of Fellow of the Society, or a similar title, on a person registered with the Society.  This, I think, is a very desirable innovation, in view of the developments of pharmacy in recent years, the improved arrangements for the training of pharmaceutical chemists and the desirability of encouraging research in the field of pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the cessation, after the dates laid down, of the existing rights of licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall to become registered as pharmaceutical chemists.  This right was given to licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall by the 1875 Act.  The cessation of this right in accordance with the provisions in Section 8 is based&mdash; and I want to emphasise this&mdash;on an agreement between the Apothecaries Hall and the Pharmaceutical Society <Col N="430" /> of Ireland.  Existing licentiates of the Hall who have not yet registered as pharmaceutical chemists will have until the 31st December, 1963, to do so.  Students registered with the Apothecaries Hall before the end of this year will be entitled to register as pharmaceutical chemists until the 31st December, 1970.  This will allow them the full period which is normally required for the completion of their medical studies and a short additional period. The cessation of the right to registration as pharmaceutical chemist will not affect in any way the entitlement of licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall to keep open shop for the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions or for the sale of poisons.</P>
    <P>I think I should emphasise that two separate things are involved here: the right to be on the Register which is maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society and the right to keep open shop.  So far as the right to keep open shop is concerned, the existing licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall will not be affected in any way whasoever.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill makes good an omission in a section of the principal Act which relates to penalties for false representations in order to secure registration. It will provide for the imposition of a fine in such cases as an alternative to the term of imprisonment which is already provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the repeal of the sundry provisions in the old Acts which are replaced in other sections of the Bill.  It also provides for the repeal of an existing provision which requires the Pharmaceutical Society to supply inspectors of weights and measures with copies of its registers.  This is expensive and inconvenient from the Society's point of view and it has proved in recent years to be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the short title, the collective citation and the commencement of the Act.  It is intended that the various provisions of the Bill will be brought into operation at the earliest convenient dates after its enactment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole this <Col N="431" /> is a good Bill, and it was distinctly improved during its passage through the Dáil.  Indeed, by amendments which the Minister introduced in the Dáil he has robbed me of what I hoped would be a number of cogent points.  This is an important Bill because it represents the emergence of the pharmaceutical chemist as a member of a profession in the modern mould.</P>
      <P>There are four main topics which arise under this Bill: the keeping of open shop; the restriction of title; the question of education and examinations; and the question of the financing of the Pharmaceutical Society. As the Minister mentioned, there are at present on the register of the Pharmaceutical Society more than 2,600 persons, and only about 1,100 persons are members of the Pharmaceutical Society.  If the register becomes, as a result of this Bill, what one might term a clean register, it will not contain anything like 2,600 persons, but something of the order of 1,800 persons.  We are, in fact, legislating for 1,800 persons or thereabouts, who actually practise pharmacy, and it is with them and the manner in which they do their business that the Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to the keeping of open shop, this is a term which I find neither informative nor instructive.  I take it that it has been maintained in order to preserve various judicial determinations as to the keeping of open shop and circumstances concerned with it. The provisions in the Bill in regard to open shop show a distinct improvement and there are only a few minor points which I should like to raise in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the phrase which is being used in regard to authorised persons&mdash;&ldquo;personally manage&rdquo;&mdash;is the best phrase that could be used.  The practice in pharmacy at the moment is that when an authorised person is in charge of a pharmacy he is the person who actually supervises the compounding or dispensing which is done by the pharmaceutical assistant or by an apprentice in the shop.  I understand <Col N="432" /> that the practice in pharmacy is that the actual bottles used are checked, the weighings are checked, and the compounding is checked.</P>
    <P>That is the position at present, and when the Minister is introducing a Bill to consolidate the law he should give statutory effect to what is the practice among good pharmacists.  I doubt, however, that the phrase &ldquo;personally manage&rdquo; is quite appropriate.  I do not know if the phrase has been judicially determined in regard to other legislation but there seems to be a connotation in the word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; that might involve merely the laying out of a procedure and an over-all check or a spot check to ensure that such procedure was carried out.  I think what is actually done at present, and indeed what we all agree should be done, could be better described by using a term such as &ldquo;personal supervision&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;personal management&rdquo;. I do not think the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society or those in pharmacy practice would object to a statutory provision being made in this regard because, as I say, those who carry out their business in a proper manner at the moment are carrying it out in this way.</P>
    <P>I think this should be done in the Bill.  It might be said that it could be done by regulation but we might run into difficulties there if the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society sought to impose something by regulation which was stricter than what was imposed in a section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would say this phrase should be used in regard to compounding and dispensing.  As regards the sale of drugs across the counter I think here the words &ldquo;personally managed&rdquo; might be maintained.  After all, it would be unreasonable to look for personal supervision every time a bottle of iodine is sold across the counter by retail.  In regard to compounding and dispensing that is something which would need a little thought.</P>
    <P>In regard to the restriction of title, subsections (4) and (5) of Section 3 were well amended when the Bill was <Col N="433" /> going through the Dáil.  I think the case made by the analytical chemists has been very deftly and fully dealt with by the Minister's amendment which he brought in on that occasion.</P>
    <P>There is just a point in regard to the position under the earlier subsections of Section 3, subsections (1), (2) and (3), which have regard to the taking of the title of pharmaceutical chemist.  We are not dealing now with the question of operating a business but merely with the question of taking the title of pharmaceutical chemist. I wonder if here the legislation is not a little restrictive.  I wonder if it would not be better if the restriction on the use of the title of pharmaceutical chemist related only to the use of the title in connection with business or employment.</P>
    <P>The position is that many persons who were not in employment as pharmaceutical chemists or were not in business as pharmaceutical chemists might on a private occasion describe themselves as pharmaceutical chemists. I do not want to be unreasonable about this minor point.  I could take the case where a person described himself in a reply to a simple inquiry as a pharmaceutical chemist though he was no longer on the register.  He might be a person who is a visitor to this country and might describe himself as a pharmaceutical chemist.  I am not at all sure what his position would be under subsection (1) of Section 3.</P>
    <P>It may be thought that we would never get prosecutions under this section but we read on the paper yesterday where a person was prosecuted for the sale of intoxicating liquor on the grounds that liqueur chocolates were sold on the premises.  If our prosecutors start a prosecution against liqueur chocolates on the ground that they involve the sale of intoxicating liquor, I think it is our duty in the House, even if we think such prosecutions to be folly, to remove from our eager prosecutors the occasion of such folly.  That is the reason why I raise this point as regards the question of the restriction of title.</P>
    <P>With regard to the very important <Col N="434" /> question of education and of examination here we have what will be in the future the most important development under the Bill.  I welcome very much the new dispensation in regard to the education of pharmaceutical chemists.  I think here we have the true emergence of pharmaceutical chemists as professional people in that their education is now an integration of the academic and the professional.</P>
    <P>I understand that both the Pharmaceutical Society and University College, Dublin, are pleased with the arrangements and that the arrangements are working well.  Indeed, I think we all welcome this particular development.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the recognition of foreign qualifications, the Minister in his opening speech mentioned that this was a desirable thing so that we in turn could have recognition abroad, but when we are discussing this particular point we should not forget that it is not only the fact that we do not recognise other people that will be a stumbling block to recognition by other countries.  The position is that unless we continue to raise the standards of pharmaceutical education as they have been raised by the Pharmaceutical Society we will find ourselves in great difficulty from the point of view of securing recognition.</P>
    <P>When we talk of recognition we must always relate that to the position under the European Economic Community. The position is that under the rules which have been laid down by the Commission under the Treaty of Rome pharmacists must be either harmonised or mutually recognised by the end of 1967.  I think it will need very good work in order to get pharmacy training in this country to a European standard by the end of 1967.</P>
    <P>On this question of education, I might say it is very easy to make a transition from the subject of pharmacy education to the subject of the financing of the Pharmaceutical Society. The position is that the Pharmaceutical Society has been running at a deficit largely because of the burden it has been carrying in relation to the education of pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> The position is that the Pharmaceutical Society has had to spend capital sums of the order of £40,000 in order to equip themselves with laboratories in order to maintain a modern standard of pharmaceutical education.  The present position of the Pharmaceutical Society is that it has a budget of £9,000 a year and are running at a deficit of £2,000.  Of the £9,000 about £5,000 appears to be spent on education judging by the balance sheet in their present calendar.</P>
    <P>There is a point I should like to raise here.  The point has already been urged on the Minister before.  It seems that in this very important question the State should be willing to do something to assist.  I understand the reluctance of the Minister and the even greater reluctance of the Minister for Finance to make a contribution towards the College of Pharmacy.  In particular, I can understand his reluctance to make a contribution, which would become a recurring contribution, to the College of Pharmacy.  I would ask the Minister to consider one point and perhaps bring it to the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The College of Pharmacy has spent £40,000 and is now running at a deficit of £2,000 a year.  I would urge the Minister to ask the Minister for Finance to make a once for all contribution of £40,000 to the College of Pharmacy.  The College of Pharmacy was obliged to realise its own investments in order to spend this money.</P>
    <P>Here is something which the Government could do and which would not tie them to recurring expenditure in the years ahead if they were to make a non-recurring capital grant for these laboratories.  I have examined the question of the amount of space in the laboratories and I am quite satisfied that the money was well spent. In this way he would then be able to put the Pharmaceutical Society into a position not merely to reach a precarious balance but to move on further and bring about further improvements in their standards which would enable them to make our pharmaceutical training comparable to that of the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> On the question of financing, there is no doubt that some of the deficit of £2,000 will be met by the provision of retention fees but I doubt if even all of the £2,000 will be met by it.  If it is, it will only barely cover the amount.  On the question of retention fees, there is just one point I should like to raise. The Minister in the Dáil made a provision whereby different fees can be charged for those who keep open shop and those who are employed in open shop.  These are all in one category and all others are in another category.  I think when the Minister gives permission to charge a larger fee to those employed in open shop this should only relate to those employed as managers.  There will be a number of pharmacists employed in open shop but not employed as authorised persons. It would be more in the spirit of the amendment the Minister introduced in the Dáil if he confined this particular fee to those who keep open shop and those who are employed as authorised persons for keeping open shop.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I wish to mention.  There are two minor points. One is that there should be provision in the Bill that Fellows should pay special membership fees.  The second is that the provision in the 1875 Act for the election of the Council could well now be done by a matter of regulation. I do not want to stress unduly the matter which was discussed in the Dáil as regards the composition of this Council but I would like to say that the position is that a number of specific things were mentioned in the 1875 Act and a lot of those have now been removed.  One thing does remain in the Act, the exact size of the Council of 21 members and the method of election is specified in the Act.  I do not want to encourage the Minister to do too much legislation by regulation but it is reasonable that the question of the size and the method of election of the Council of a body such as the Pharmaceutical Society should be a matter for regulation rather than a provision in a section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the main points which I should like to bring to the <Col N="437" /> Minister's attention; first of all, that the authorised person should personally supervise compounding and dispensing rather than personally manage it; that the question of restriction of title should be a restriction of the use of title in connection with business and employment.  I would urge that there is a case for a capital once-for-all grant to the College of Pharmacy in the nature of grants made to such bodies as the College of Surgeons and, finally, the point regarding the size and method of election of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  In general it raises the status of the pharmaceutical profession and I shall confine my remarks to one small point to do with the composition of the Council.  With the growth and power of the Council I suggest that the composition might be widened.  It now has very extensive educational powers in relation to, amongst other things, education in University College, Dublin.  It has a certain amount of power in regard to professional discipline and power to institute and finance research.  Owing to the historical evolution of the Council the Council does represent, practically speaking, the point of view of retail pharmacists in the country.  This, as the Minister stated in the Dáil, could be rectified.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that at present the retailers' point of view is dominant in the Council and it is likely to remain so in future.  To suggest that the Minister might have the power to nominate representatives of the medical profession on the Council is not very revolutionary.  I understand the similar council in Great Britain includes three members of the medical profession who are nominated by the Privy Council and if the Government can nominate members on the British Pharmaceutical Society there is no reason why there should not be the power to do so here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present composition of the Council contains certain anomalies. For example, no teacher of pharmacy who examines in the examinations is eligible for membership.  The only doctors eligible are doctors who have the Apothecaries Hall qualifications and that excludes a very large number of examiners and doctors who are very <Col N="438" /> eminent members of their profession and who are not eligible to sit on the Council.  The other professional bodies which are allied with the medical profession, as the pharmaceutical profession is, have medical representatives. There are medical members on the Dental Board and also medical members on the highest bodies of the veterinary profession and really there is no reason why there should not be similar representation of the medical profession on the Pharmaceutical Society's Council.  Part of the training now for pharmacists takes place in University College, Dublin, and the Council under the Bill has the power to regulate that part of the training and it seems to me to be reasonable that University College, Dublin, should have some representation on a Council that has these powers.  These are matters which perhaps will be dealt with by the Report of the Commission on Higher Education. I do not want to press them.  I simply want to draw the Minister's attention to them and to hope that perhaps he may consider meeting some of the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to those who have contributed to the debate on this Bill.  I wish to point out that the Bill is not concerned with the reorganisation of the Pharmaceutical Society as such.  It is primarily concerned to clear up some ambiguities which, perhaps, appeared in the principal Act as originally drafted and which have not been clarified by the decisions of the courts.  It is also designed to deal with such questions as reciprocity which have become very substantial in existing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Senator Dooge's speech with great attention.  I think that perhaps there may be one or two points that would require further consideration but I cannot think that there is anything very much in the point about the connotation of the personally managed as distinct from the personally supervised.  It seems to me management certainly involves supervision and that a person who is responsible for the management of a business of this sort must also be responsible for its close supervision.  I do not think there is very much in that and therefore I <Col N="439" /> do not undertake that on Committee Stage I will bring in an amendment to meet the point which has been proposed by the Senator but I will give it some further consideration.  The question of whether a person should be entitled whenever it would seem to enable him to avoid embarrassment to hold out that he is a member of a profession that has a certain statutory status, is another matter.  I think we just cannot when we are legislating to regulate a profession with such intimate contact as this, have too much regard to the personal susceptibilities of an individual.</P>
    <P>The question of the contribution which we might make to the education of pharmacists is, of course, important, but in that connection we should not overlook the fact that since a substantial part of the new curriculum will be followed in University College, Dublin, the State will be already very definitely giving a substantial subvention to those students who take part of their courses there.  However, there might be something in the point which the Senator made that we should recoup the Society for the expenditure which it has incurred on its laboratories, and I will take that up with the Minister for Finance, but I would be very disingenuous indeed if I were to suggest that there was any great hope that my representations would be acceded to.</P>
    <P>Regarding special membership fees for Fellows, we are in this slight difficulty that, as the intentions of the Society have been conveyed to me, their idea is that the title of Fellow should be an honorary one conferred for distinction in the practice of pharmacy and perhaps for those who have merited the distinction by reason of their contribution to the general development of the profession.  It would be rather invidious to try to sell an honour and charge a special membership fee to a Fellow whom you really felt not merely would be an ornament to the Society but also would enhance its prestige.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, this is not a Bill to reorganise and reconstitute the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.  Perhaps some such <Col N="440" /> measure will come in due course, but this is merely designed to deal with problems that have become immediately pressing.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm 17 Orders made during 1961 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, which provides that Orders made by the Government under that Act, imposing or amending duties, must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
      <P>Three of the Orders imposed new protection.  Eight amended existing duties which experience had shown were either inadequate or were open to evasion.  Two others provided for new or increased duties which would come into operation in the event of existing quota or other import restrictions having to be removed.  The remaining four Orders provided for reductions in the rates or scope of existing duties. Two of these are consequential on recommendations made by the Industrial Development Authority following reviews undertaken in accordance with the provisions of our trade agreements with Britain.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has been circulated to Senators.  I shall, of course, be willing to give any further information or answer any questions which Senators wish to ask about the Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to criticise adversely any of the proposals in this Bill, of which there are 17 in all.  Our Party is in agreement with the policy as regards industrial development of which these orders are an expression, but in continuing the policy of protection we must all be aware of the position that in the new era which we face with <Col N="441" /> the existence of the Common Market these tariffs and subsidies will have to disappear.  I notice that the Order No. 12 which is in the explanatory memorandum replaces a quota order by a tariff imposition.  I welcome this action because quotas, generally speaking, come into the category of very highly restrictive and protective methods and they should be retained only in extreme cases.  Industries which have to rely on quota protection would appear to have very little hope of survival in a free trade market.  Therefore, I feel that it is very important at this stage to exchange tariffs for quota protection in as many cases and as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Committee on Industrial Organisation which is studying the position of Irish industry in the context of the Common Market is considering and perhaps advising the authorities here and the Government on the policy that should be taken at present in regard to tariff and protection policy.  I see that these tariffs are advised by the Industrial Development Authority, and I take it that it would be in close contact with the examination that is being carried on at present in regard to the future.  In other words they are not merely working on past or present policy, but that policy is now being merged into the creation of a new policy for the future which we are going into in the free trade area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to say that with the ending of protection now in sight it is to be hoped that those connected with Irish industry, employers and workers, will bear in mind the fact that we are now going into a free trade area and that it is important for both employers and workers engaged in our industrial activities to do everything to make themselves competitive and see that our products will be able to take their place in the open market in quality, design and price.  I myself at this year's dinner of the Federation of Irish Industries heard the Minister refer to this very point and I quite agree with what he said.  He pointed out that though a large number of our industrialists and workers are aware and show that they are aware of the necessity for <Col N="442" /> efficiency and for girding ourselves for this future market, on the other hand there are signs that there are still quite a large number of both employers and workers who do not seem to be thinking in terms of a free trade market, who are still thinking in terms of the protected market in which we have been working for so many years.  If they persist in that form of action and approach they will find that we and they will not achieve the efficiency and ability to operate in the future.  The consequence, of course, will be that they will not be able to exist in the future.  I would hope, therefore, that any protective measures which are introduced both now and in the future will not be allowed to foster inefficiency or complacency in the employers or the workers.  I support the Bill which confirms those Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised by Senator McGuire are worthy of some comment.  As I pointed out in my opening statement, of the 17 Orders which are confirmed in the Bill now before the House, only three are in respect of new tariffs, and those tariffs refer to new industries.  When those tariffs were imposed in respect of these industries full regard was had to the policy outlined in the Programme for Economic Development, that industries that sought tariff protection would be given such protection only if they can show that after a short initial period they can carry on without such protection.  That policy has been strictly adhered to in the Department of Industry and Commerce, as reflected by the fact that since the beginning of this year no new tariff has been imposed, while it is true that many tariff applications have been made and refused.</P>
      <P>The functions of the CIO are related mainly to an analysis of industries broadly, and of particular industries and particular factories, to discover to what extent assistance can be given by the State, if necessary, for their readaptation, and to what extent these industries may adapt themselves or amalgamate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice of the CIO will be of assistance to us in our negotiations for <Col N="443" /> entry into the Common Market, negotiations in which we hope to have applied to us a rhythm of tariff reductions which will take adequate account of the state of our industrialisation.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Taoiseach has stated in his opening statement to the representatives of the Governments of the Six that we will conform to the desire of the Common Market countries to end our tariff reduction regime at the end of the transitional period as now envisaged by the Six, but we would hope within that period to get a rhythm of reduction that will suit our industries.</P>
    <P>I take it it will be the function&mdash; and I expect it will be done&mdash;of the CIO&mdash;the Committee on Industrial Organisation&mdash;to advise on what industries are particularly sensitive, and on what industries may require special looking after, so to speak, because there is provision within the Rome Treaty for special protocol for some degree of protection beyond the end of the transitional period.  It may be possible to find out from the CIO if any such industry exists or if there is any range of industries that might require to be taken care of in that respect.  I cannot indicate in advance to any extent whether we will be successful in negotiating such terms for such industries.</P>
    <P>As regards the tariff reductions, some are provided for in these Orders, and Orders have been made affecting at least one tariff reduction, if not more, since the Bill was introduced. Therefore they were not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill, but the Industrial Development Authority, which is the successor of the Prices Commission in this respect, has been conducting a serious review of the tariffs as provided for in the Trade Agreements with Britain. At present they have under review a very wide range of commodities which bear tariffs.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other points were raised by the Senator which require comment.  If there are any other questions I would be glad to answer them.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill, as the Long Title indicates, is to make provision for the grant by the State of free legal aid to poor persons in certain criminal cases.  At present free legal aid is provided by the State only in murder cases where the accused persons cannot afford to provide legal aid themselves but the practice has no statutory backing. It is proposed in this measure to allow accused persons of insufficient means legal aid in practically every kind of criminal proceedings in which they may find themselves involved. They may obtain it in the district court for summary offences or for indictable offences which are dealt with summarily with the consent of the accused.  It will also be available for the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence in the district court as well as for the subsequent trial in the Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court, as the case may be.  Legal aid will be provided, too, in the case of appeals from each of these various courts, including appeals to the Supreme Court from the Court of Criminal Appeal; and there is provision for aid in proceedings by way of case stated and in appeals from a determination of the High Court on cases stated by district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of legal aid is in every case subject to the relevant court being satisfied that it is essential in the interests of justice that it should be provided and that the accused cannot afford it.  Other limiting words are contained in the provisions dealing with proceedings before the various courts and, in general, the principle sought to be adopted is that aid should be provided only in serious cases, or in exceptional circumstances, where it <Col N="445" /> would be essential in the interests of justice that the accused person should have free legal aid.  The proposals in the Bill are therefore designed to help to prevent, as far as possible, genuine miscarriages of justice but not to allow legal aid to be granted in any general or indiscriminate fashion.  There is a body of opinion in favour of allowing legal aid automatically to every poor person accused of an offence but this extreme point of view is unacceptable to the Government as a matter of principle and, in any event, the cost of providing such a service would be wholly excessive having regard to our limited resources and to the various calls there are upon them from other, and I think more deserving, classes of the community.  The fact is that there is no evidence that injustice or hardship is being caused on any significant scale by the absence of free legal aid. The voluntary contribution made by both branches of the legal profession in undertaking without reward the defence of poor persons and the concern of the courts to ensure that an accused in not prejudiced in any way by the absence of legal representation have been largely responsible for bringing about that situation.  However, the possibility of an innocent person being convicted because he cannot afford to pay for his defence or to obtain free the services of a lawyer still remains and is the justification for the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Bill I have been in consultation with the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society on the operation of the scheme and I have every confidence that it will be possible to work out satisfactory arrangements for its detailed operation and to have the full co-operation of these professional bodies in ensuring that we get the best possible value for the money to be spent on it.  I share with both branches of the profession their concern that there shall be no diminution of standards in connection with the professional services to be provided to accused persons who are allowed legal aid.  In the important matter of remuneration I am hopeful that it will be possible to prescribe professional fees which will be generally <Col N="446" /> accepted as fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  I expect that the members of the legal profession, as reasonable people, will accept something less than full scale fees having regard to the fact that they already have a tradition for giving their services free in deserving cases and also because the scheme is necessarily experimental and may cost the Exchequer, in the event, much more than anticipated.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the experimental character of this measure. There are a number of unknowns which combine to make it difficult to forecast to what extent the scheme will be availed of.  I myself believe that the courts will behave with a proper sense of responsibility and ensure that legal aid is confined to really deserving cases&mdash;and in this belief the decision whether to allow free legal aid or not is being left exclusively to the judge or justice concerned.  However, it is still the case that the scheme is breaking entirely new ground and it would be unwise, I think, to lay down the detailed arrangements for the operation of the scheme in any precise way in the Bill itself.  The sensible thing to do is to leave these details to be provided for by regulations and to allow a period of one or two years to elapse and then have a general review of the scheme in the light of its actual operation during that period.  In framing the initial regulations, we shall have the advantage of the precedents set by the schemes which have operated satisfactorily for a long time in Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that there is no question of requiring an accused person to disclose his defence in connection with an application for the grant of legal aid.  It will be a matter for the accused person entirely to decide whether or not he should do so.  In fact, during the passage of the Bill in the Dáil I moved an amendment to make it clear that the trial judge could decide to grant legal aid on an application by the accused at any time during the trial so as to provide for what I would regard as a most exceptional case of its becoming evident to the trial judge at some stage of the trial that he ought to allow legal aid.  However, <Col N="447" /> I think that any judge would be entitled to expect, when asked to consider an application for free legal aid, some indication from an accused person of the reasons why it would be essential in the interests of justice that that aid should be provided.  This would not apply, of course, in a case of murder where free legal aid will continue to be available to poor prisoners as of right but it should apply in all other cases where the grant of legal aid is not automatic.  Otherwise, there might be a possibility of free legal aid being given to people where the facts are perfectly straightforward and no difficult question of law is involved and where it is clear to everyone that what the interests of justice require is that the accused person should be convicted and adequately punished with the minimum of delay. It has been well pointed out that miscarriages of justice can occur through the guilty escaping punishment no less than from the conviction of the innocent and I am afraid that miscarriages of the former kind occur far too frequently.  The judges and justices can, as I have said already, be trusted to exercise the powers being given them by the Bill in a commonsense way which will take full account not only of the fundamental rights of accused persons but also of the need to avoid the grant of aid unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Bill will commend itself to Senators as a measure of social reform which is long overdue and that the House will agree to give it a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of our Party, I welcome this Bill.  In a general way I think it has been presented by the Minister as a social reform and as a move in the right direction.  As such, I accept it and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Bills come before the Oireachtas as contentious matters and have to be dealt with by politicians as such.  Other Bills are not contentious. They come before the Dáil and the Seanad as pieces of legislation bringing about social reform and bringing our social system into line with modern social thinking.  Those Bills are not <Col N="448" /> contentious and should be approached by the Minister who presents them and by both Houses in an effort to make the best possible job and to ensure that the Bill, when it becomes an Act, will give effect to the intention of the Oireachtas.  This is one of these Bills and I think we should approach it in that light.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that this is the first time in which free legal aid as such has been given.  It is also true to say that members of the legal profession saw to it in the past that necessitous poor persons charged with offences rarely were left without some legal assistance on the criminal side of the courts.  I think it is true to say that on the civil side of the courts no person with an arguable case is left without legal assistance.  I think, as the Minister has said in the Dáil, it is unreasonable to expect that that can continue&mdash;that the legal profession can be expected to continue to provide an adequate free legal service without any remuneration whatever.  That is speaking in a general way.</P>
    <P>If this free legal aid scheme is to be a success it must, first of all, have the confidence of the type of person it is intended to help, that is, the necessitous accused.  It also must have the full co-operation of both branches of the legal profession.  If it does not fulfil those two qualifications, then I feel it will not be successful.  It is under those two headings and in a general way that I propose to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I fear that there are a number of reasons why the Bill, as it stands at the moment, might not have the confidence of the necessitous accused.  Irish people in general, I think, and people who might hope to avail of this Bill in particular, are very often suspicious of the law, suspicious of the people who administer the law, whether as a police force or as prosecutors or, indeed, as members of the judiciary.  For that reason, we should be very careful to see to it that the accused person has no genuine reason why he should be suspicious of an offer of help from the State.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it is stated in the Bill that one of the considerations <Col N="449" /> which a circuit court judge who is asked to provide legal aid in an indictable offence shall take into account is the nature of the defence, if any, sought to be put forward.  That is an undesirable provision in the Bill.  It is established here down the years that, when a person is returned for trial before a judge and jury, he invariably reserves his defence and does not disclose his defence until the case opens before a judge and jury or, indeed, until it is necessary that he should do so to make his case.  Any lawyer of any experience would advise an accused person that he would be very foolish to disclose his defence at an early stage.</P>
    <P>I admit that the Minister is quite correct when he says there is no obligation on an accused person to disclose his defence in order to get free legal aid but it is stated in the Bill as one of the matters to be taken into account by a judge before giving legal aid.  I think the Minister stated in the Dáil that the nature of the defence is a circumstance bearing on the matter.  An accused person might think it necessary, or might think he had a better chance of getting legal aid, if he disclosed this defence.  He might even be encouraged by some people to disclose his defence in order to get legal aid.</P>
    <P>I know it is a recognised legal principle that it is not necessary for an accused to make a statement but how often do we hear it stated in court, at any rate in the district court, that when cautioned the accused made no statement? How often do we hear accused persons say that they were advised by a member of the Garda that if they made a statement things would be easier for them?  I could see a situation arising where an accused person could be told &ldquo;if you tell us what your defence is you will get legal aid and you will get off scot free&rdquo;.  Therefore I am strongly against a provision in the Bill which suggests&mdash;I would not put it any stronger&mdash;or which invites the court to consider the defence, if any, being put forward before giving legal aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that a judge may at any time give a certificate of <Col N="450" /> free legal aid.  I do not think that is a good point.  I do not think that has any merit.  If a trial starts before a judge and jury surely the judge is not going to suspend the trial to give the certificate for free legal aid and allow the accused person to instruct a solicitor and counsel?  It might mean that the jury would have to be discharged or the trial adjourned for a week in order to give the solicitor and counsel, if there was one, an opportunity to prepare the defence.  If the free legal aid is not given before the trial commences it will not be practicable to give it during the trial for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that is fundamental to the provision of free legal aid.  From the discussions in the Dáil and indeed from the Bill, it is apparent that the accused person will not have a free choice of solicitor.  I know the Minister has come some way in reply, I think it was to Deputy Sweetman, by saying that the first regulations would provide for the wishes of the accused person to be taken into account.  I do not think that is sufficient.  The accused person should be given a free choice of solicitor.  That of course does not mean that he can obstruct the course of justice or obstruct the machinery of the court by being unreasonable.  It means no such thing because what I say is a free choice will in effect be a limited choice but at any rate there will be some choice.  The choice will be limited to a panel of solicitors attached to the court in question and who are prepared to act in free legal aid cases.  First of all, it will be limited to that extent.  It will be further limited to the members of that panel who are available at the time they are required and who are prepared to act.  Surely that is only reasonable and I do not think any undue obstruction can arise as a result of giving the accused that selection.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands, the district justice or circuit court judge will be invited to make the choice.  It is a choice which I do not think he should have to make.  He will have to make a selection perhaps between some two or three solicitors sitting in court before him and he will have to say &ldquo;I am giving you solicitor B instead of A <Col N="451" /> or C who are also here and also willing to act.  That will put the justice or judge in an invidious position.  I would urge very strongly that unless the accused person is given free choice within the limits I have mentioned he could not be expected to have any confidence in the legal aid provided, and that in fact he will have no confidence. I can see the position arising where the accused person goes into court and he says &ldquo;I want solicitor A to represent me&rdquo; and for some reason or another the presiding justice in his wisdom will say &ldquo;I am sorry, I will assign solicitor B&rdquo; and solicitor B takes the accused person into an ante-room, he discusses the case with him and he advises the accused person to plead guilty.  What on earth will that accused person think except that it is some sort of set-up between the prosecution and the bench in order to get him to plead guilty and get the case over?  It would be an impossible position.  Furthermore, if the accused wants solicitor A and does not get him but gets solicitor B and the case goes on and the accused is convicted then until his dying day he will be certain that if he had solicitor A, the man of his own choice, he would have been acquitted.  The answer to that is of course that many people who employ a solicitor and perhaps pay him fairly well are not satisfied with him but they have nobody to blame but themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak from a not inconsiderable experience of the type of case and the type of person this Bill is introduced to facilitate.  I believe that my colleagues in the Dáil who also spoke on it are men of considerable experience of this type of case, and perhaps other members of my profession will speak here too.  Perhaps we have much more practical <Col N="452" /> experience than the Minister or his immediate advisers because we have come up against this over a good number of years, in the rough and tumble of the district court and circuit court practice.  I was interested to note that in Dáil Éireann members of the legal profession from both sides of the House seemed to be putting forward the same points of view.  I honestly and sincerely say that views like that put forward on a non-contentious Bill like this should not be brushed aside lightly by the Minister or his advisers.</P>
      <P>So much for free choice.  There was another thing which I was slightly worried about in the Minister's opening speech in the Dáil.  He seemed to say that of course this legal aid would not apply to the habitual criminal, that the State had no intention of facilitating the defence of the habitual criminal. First of all, it is rather difficult to define what a habitual criminal is. Does a person become a habitual criminal because he is charged once, twice, or three times?  The thing that immediately struck me about it is that I cannot think of anybody who would require legal assistance more than the unfortunate person who had fallen foul of the law on a number of occasions, perhaps rightly, and then became suspect in the wrong, because the dice is loaded against him from the very word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  That is the classical case where a great miscarriage of justice could take place, and indeed the most likely type of case.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister not to have any preconceived idea that because a person was unfortunate enough to be convicted once or twice he was thereby an outlaw and would not benefit by this piece of social legislation.  It is fundamentally wrong in the first place. It would be calculated to drive those people further against the law, to regard them as outcasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing that strikes me in a general way from the point of view of the accused is that he has to make application for legal aid, as far as I can see, in open court.  He has to go before the district justice or the circuit judge publicly and in the presence of the press and make his application for legal aid.  He has to disclose his <Col N="453" /> means, and to fill in a form that may be required by one of the later sections of the Bill in which he is invited to give particulars of his means.  That is undesirable. I do not know whether this point has been raised elsewhere, but this is the type of application which should be heard <i>in camera</i>, or indeed, in a judge's chambers.  If a man is branded as a pauper, so to speak, or a man of no means, his defence in a certain type of case might be prejudiced most materially.  An essential factor in his innocence or guilt might be whether or not he was a man of means, and if he is presented before the jury as a man of no means, a man without sufficient means to employ a solicitor or counsel, then indeed the jury might take the view that he was the type of person who might commit the type of offence with which he is charged.</P>
    <P>Apart from that I do not think that an innocent person&mdash;and we must presume that all these people are innocent until they have been convicted&mdash;should have to go into court before his neighbours and before the press and give particulars of his means and perhaps be cross-examined on it in order to get legal aid.  I repeat that that should be done in chambers.  Those are the reasons why I think the Bill might not be acceptable to accused persons.</P>
    <P>Now I will deal with it very briefly from the point of view of the legal profession.  The Minister has stated that in the past the solicitors' profession and the barristers' profession have been generous in aiding necessitous persons. That is all the more reason why this scheme should be operated in full co-operation with them.  As the Minister knows, in other countries where this scheme has been introduced many years ago, as in England, the full administration of it has been handed over to the equivalent of our Incorporated Law Society.  In England they will have a free legal aid scheme both on the criminal side and on the civil side of the courts.  That is not being done here.  We are having a scheme limited to the criminal side of the courts, and even limited within the criminal side.  Furthermore, we are <Col N="454" /> being given a Bill which will largely be operated through regulations to be made by the Minister.  The Bill as presented is really in skeleton form and will be operated through regulations to be made under Section 10.  If the scheme is to be a success it should be obligatory on the Minister to consult the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council before making these regulations. They are the people who will have to operate the scheme, and if it is not acceptable to them it is doomed to failure before ever it comes into existence.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has already consulted both the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council, and he says that he intends to continue to do that.  I accept that, but he is only doing it as a matter of grace.  He could go to these professions and have a chat with them and go off ignoring what they say.  If it was obligatory on him to consult the Incorporated Law Society and the Council of the Bar of Ireland it would be much more likely that they would get down to having a heart to heart chat about it and that what they said would be listened to. A much more desirable way of bringing these regulations into force would be to set up something in the nature of a Rules Making Committee.  We have a Rules Making Committee for the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and I think the Supreme Court.  That is a body which is composed of representatives of the Department of Justice, the judiciary, the solicitors' profession and the Bar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Department of Justice was represented there.  At any rate, it is composed of members of the solicitors' profession, the Bar and the judiciary. The Minister would be well advised to set up the type of committee of which I have spoken, representative of the Department of Justice, the solicitors' profession and the Bar, presided over by a member of the judiciary, or, when a question of fees or remuneration is involved, by one of the Taxing Masters <Col N="455" /> of the High Court.  That would be the ideal way of dealing with it, but if the Minister cannot see his way to go that far, he should write into the Bill in black and white for his own guidance, and the guidance of those who follow him, that these regulations are to be made only after consultation with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council.  If he does that there is a much better chance of the Bill being a success.</P>
      <P>That is all I want to say in a general way.  I sincerely hope the Minister will not take anything I have said as being ungrateful or ungracious.  Anything I have said has been a genuine effort to help the Minister to make a success of this very worthy scheme which he proposes to put into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some clarification from the Minister in regard to legal aid.  On page 3 of the Bill, it is stated that a person &ldquo;may apply for the certificate to the court&rdquo;, and on page 4 it is stated that &ldquo;the court shall grant the certificate&rdquo;.  If we look at paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subsection (3) of Section 4 it would appear that the court shall grant a certificate for free legal aid if &ldquo;the conviction is of murder&rdquo; or if&mdash;</P>
      <P>it appears to the court that, by reason of the serious nature of the offence or of exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interests of Justice that the convicted person should have legal aid in the preparation and conduct of an appeal.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify that, because it would appear to convey that the court may not grant a certificate on appeal even though it appeared to the court that the means of the person are such as to qualify him for free legal aid.  That would convey that the offence must be of a serious nature, and that if it was a case that was regarded as a minor case, even though the person had no means to defend himself, a certificate would not be granted.  I think the Minister should look at that.  It is the court that decides on the granting of the certificate if this Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be sufficient that the person <Col N="456" /> has not the means to obtain legal aid, and it should not be on the basis of the seriousness of the offence, because any offence is serious to the person who is charged even though it may not appear very serious to the court who would be granting the certificate, or to the members of the Seanad or the Dáil, or the public.  It is serious to the person concerned and if he is in need of legal aid he should have it regardless of the offence with which he is charged. Otherwise he could be convicted, and conviction could be a serious matter for him.  We should be consistent in a matter of this kind and it should not be on the basis of what is called a very serious offence&mdash;&ldquo;by reason of the serious nature of the offence&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This again is where the Minister comes in.  There are always means of dealing with abuses of privileges granted by the State, and if there are abuses in regard to free legal aid in the opinion of the Minister, or in the light of experience, he has the right to come back and have the legislation amended.  Where are we to draw the line?  The court in this case will draw the line and decide what is a serious offence.  That is leaving it very open, and with all due respect to the legal profession and the learned judges, it is leaving it very open if they <Col N="457" /> are to decide what is a serious offence. I should like to hear the Minister on that aspect of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>As matters stood, as the Minister has already said, heretofore poor people who had no means of defending themselves depended on the kindness and the sense of professional responsibility of the legal profession to defend them.  Probably in these days that might appear to put some people at a disadvantage and a man, because he has no means, might feel: &ldquo;Why should I be under a compliment to anyone?  Why should I not be able to select any lawyer I like at the expense of the State and the community to which I belong, particularly if I am innocent?  The State have to pay for my prosecution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the other hand, we must appreciate that there are many cases where the person who is accused of a crime is undoubtedly guilty even though found not guilty.  He has already offended against society, and put society to the additional expense of prosecuting him, and now he is asking society to bear the expense of defending him.  Therefore, I can quite appreciate the Minister's point of view when he says there must be certain limits to the expense to which the State is put in those cases, that the offence must be such that it is of a serious nature, and such that there would be a possibility of an injustice being done if the man were not provided with legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the profession to which I belong I should like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation, not because it takes any burden off our shoulders&mdash;as a profession that is a burden which we freely accept as our professional duty&mdash;but because it is a piece of social legislation for the common good and for the benefit of what one might call to a great extent the rag-tag and bobtail of our society, the unfortunate people who fall into crime and who belong to the lower strata of society and who cannot pay for their own defence.  Those people belong to our society and if one of them is wrongly convicted it would be a grave offence on the part of our <Col N="458" /> society.  Therefore, I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation.  I can quite appreciate that it is of an experimental nature and that, being of an experimental nature, it, perhaps, cannot contain or embody within itself many principles which should be embodied and which for the most part will have to be by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>I feel, however, that there are certain principles in the Bill as it stands which we hoped the Minister would have put otherwise.  I must say that with my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, I am in complete agreement on some of these. The section which I see can cause the greatest difficulty to our profession is the section which prevents the accused from fully and freely selecting his own lawyer.  Any lawyer who has a sense of pride in his profession will feel that he does not wish to act for anyone if he is not the free choice of that person. When countries went over to Communism the first profession of whom the Communist Governments took control was the legal profession because in the end the legal profession is the last buffer for the protection of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I personally have no hesitation in saying that I would not like to be dependent upon any judge or any justice to appoint me or not to appoint me to defend any accused.  If the accused wants my services he will get them freely.  I think it should be left open to the accused to select his own lawyer or his own lawyers as the case may be.  I do not think that it is practicable to suggest that because the accused can select his own lawyer the course of justice can be interfered with or held up.  The man who can pay his own way can select any lawyer he likes freely himself and the course of justice cannot thereby be held up. The only difference between the two selections is that under this Bill he selects his lawyer and instead of paying the lawyer himself the State pays for him.  That, I may inform the Minister, is a point upon which my profession feel very strongly.</P>
    <P>As regards the other matter, we appreciate that this is a small country and that the amount which the country <Col N="459" /> can afford to bear by way of expenses is limited.  We appreciate that the matter to a great extent is experimental. Speaking on behalf of my profession, I can assure the Minister that assuming the whole thing will depend upon the regulations&mdash;assuming that the regulations are reasonable and we have no doubt that they will be reasonable&mdash;the Minister can certainly count upon the co-operation of the solicitors' profession in putting the Bill into practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to make it clear to the House, and to Senator Fitzpatrick, in particular, that I do not at all resent suggestions for the improvement of the Bill.  I fully appreciate the spirit in which the suggestions and criticisms are offered.  I genuinely and sincerely believe that any matter which comes into this House can be improved by all Senators bringing their experience, knowledge and their professional qualifications, such as they may be, to bear on it.  I have always found this House to be particularly co-operative and helpful in that way.  I readily accept that is the spirit in which they are approaching this measure also.  Indeed, I may say that the Bill has received a more gracious commendation than it did in the Dáil.  I felt that the Deputies in the Dáil who spoke to it might have given a little bit more credit for the fact that the Bill was introduced at all. However, that is neither here nor there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Fitzpatrick and Nash spoke about the position in the law that a poor person will be defended free by members of the profession. That noble tradition has always been there and it is a very fine tradition but I think the time has come when we must do something more.  I want to point out this about that particular tradition.  It is unfair to the legal profession as between themselves because I myself know a very eminent practitioner in the courts who does a very great deal of criminal work.  He told me that he never defended anyone free of charge.  He was always paid for the work he did.  That is a very legitimate <Col N="460" /> attitude for him to take up.  Against that, you had other members of the profession who were in prosecutions defending accused persons free of charge.  Therefore, some members of the profession were bearing an unfair burden in that regard.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I think that most of us would agree that our thinking on these matters has advanced from the stage when we would be prepared to accept the situation where poor persons would have to rely on the generosity of individual members of the legal profession to procure their defence.  Thinking with regard to social services generally has rejected that sort of approach.  It is better that the State should now assume this obligation where it is essential in the interests of justice to provide proper legal services for an accused person.</P>
    <P>Senators Fitzpatrick and Nash spoke about the question of the freedom of choice which they would like to see made available to an accused person.  I do not want to go too deeply into that on Second Stage.  We will be speaking about it on Committee Stage.  However, I want to say this.  First of all, it is wrong to create an impression that there is a principle involved here and that accused persons are entitled to and should have complete freedom of choice as to the solicitor they wish to defend them. That freedom of choice is illusory in any circumstances.  Take the case of an accused person who is able to pay his own way and look at all the limitations he suffers from.  It is all very well to say that he is entitled to choose any solicitor he wishes.  When you examine the matter, you find that is not so.  He can choose anyone for whom he is able to pay.  The solicitor must be prepared to take him as a client.  He must be prepared to take the case, provided he is available. You go along to the office of some eminent solicitor and say: &ldquo;I want to employ So-and-So, the eminent legal man, to take this case and defend me.&rdquo;  When you come to court you will find the case is being handled by some junior of his.  Admittedly you have the eminent practitioner in name <Col N="461" /> but in fact you have some junior member of the staff of the office.  So that even, as I say, where the client or accused person is paying his own way this question of complete freedom of choice is just not real at all. Furthermore, I made this point in the Dáil and I should just like to repeat it here, every day in my office I get letters from persons who have been defended by solicitors and counsel, whom they selected themselves and whom they paid, but nevertheless they complain to me that the solicitors and counsel made a complete mess of their case and they want to know what am I going to do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That sort of thing happens so we cannot possibly hope to legislate on the basis of satisfying every crank.  Admittedly there will be people who might get free legal aid who will not like the solicitor or counsel assigned to them but they will not like or dislike their solicitor or counsel until their case gets under way. You cannot hope to satisfy everybody.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke about experience and said that the practising lawyers have more experience than my advisers or myself.  That is not strictly true because what we are talking about here is something new. Practising lawyers have experience of the law and the working of the criminal law in courts but they have not got experience of any free legal aid scheme no more than we have but we took the precaution of going to the North of Ireland where they have a scheme like this in operation since 1946 and studying in detail how it works up there.  At least we have covered ourselves to that extent so that we are as much in a position to examine the relative merits of this particular proposal as eminent practitioners might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I leave the question of a free choice of solicitor I want to make this clear.  As the Bill stands at present it can provide in the regulations exactly <Col N="462" /> what Senator Nash and Senator Fitzpatrick would like.  In other words, as the Bill stands there is no reason why the regulations should not provide a complete free choice of solicitor or counsel to the accused.  The only difference is that I propose to frame the regulations on the basis that the final assignment will be made by the judge. The regulations can be changed at any time.  If my suggestion turns out in practice not to work satisfactorily we can change the regulations and there is nothing in the regulations to prevent us from giving a free choice.  However, in the experimental stage I think it is much safer and more prudent to leave the final choice to the judge after considering any wishes of the accused. It might be argued that as the State are footing the Bill in this case they therefore should be entitled to select the solicitor and counsel.  That would not have been an entirely unreasonable case to put to the House.  However, I can understand Senators very rightly objecting to that.</P>
    <P>I can imagine what Senators would urge if I came in with that proposal. They would urge that it should be given to the judge and taken from the State.  That is what we are doing.  It is important that we try to make this scheme work freely whether we like it or not.  There are persons who make a profession of crime and who know every trick in the game and who would, I am quite certain, if we do not watch the scheme carefully, make this whole scheme unworkable by the way in which they would behave in regard to it.  It is to avoid that that I want to provide that the accused person will be consulted and unless the judge has some perfectly good or valid reason for not assigning any counsel or solicitor the accused person has asked for, he will have to assign that person.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the habitual criminal.  In the Dáil, when introducing the Bill, I did say that an accused person who was a habitual criminal &mdash;a term I use for want of a better one&mdash;could in fact get free legal aid in exceptional circumstances.  I did make it clear that there could be cases where, because of the exceptional circumstances of the case, even a habitual <Col N="463" /> criminal would be entitled to and would get free legal aid.  I want to repeat that here.  We would not normally envisage that persons who are habitually being convicted of crimes would be entitled to free legal aid but we do think that there might even in such cases be exceptional circumstances which would justify the judge in giving a free legal aid certificate. And we are leaving the judge or justice perfectly free to use his discretion in this respect.</P>

      <P>Or any accused, but I think he said an habitual criminal. With regard to the general question, we do propose to provide in the regulations for some simple type of form which will be filled in by the accused. On the basis of that the judge will make up his own mind as to whether or not the person's means are such that he is or is not entitled to free legal aid. We are leaving it very largely to the discretion of the judge and we are leaving it very flexible.  I think that is the right way to leave it.  I feel sure the courts will be reasonable about the matter and that they will be quite capable of deciding in any individual case coming before them whether the person's means are such as to justify the granting of free legal aid or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators made the point about handing over the control of this scheme to the legal professions.  There is a misunderstanding about this aspect. Some Senators said, and it was also <Col N="464" /> said in the Dáil, that in Britain this type of scheme has been handed over to the equivalent of our Incorporated Law Society to be administered.  That is not so.  First of all, this free legal aid is in two parts, if you like, free legal aid in criminal matters and free legal aid in civil matters.  At the moment in this Bill we are only dealing with free legal aid in criminal matters.  Free legal aid in criminal cases was introduced in Britain in 1903 but it was not until 1960 that the English Law Society were given any responsibility, and then only in the matter of fixing fees in magistrates' courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>A very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It is not correct to say that the scheme in Britain has been handed over to be administered by the Incorporated Law Society there, nor has it in the North of Ireland. A similar scheme to the one we are proposing now has been operated there since 1946 and the Incorporated Law Society up there does not enter into it at all.  We are in fact not being in any way substantially different from Britain or Northern Ireland in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of consulting the professions has been raised.  I have already made it clear that I have had consultations with the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council and I propose to have further consultations. Those consultations are on a voluntary basis.  Senator Fitzpatrick would like to make them obligatory. I explained in the Dáil, and I think I am right when I say, that those consultations would lose a very great deal of their value if they were carried out as a result of any statutory requirement. The relationship between the Minister for Justice for the time being and the two professional bodies should be such that they would consult together from time to time on all sorts of different matters.  That is the way I approach it.  I intend to continue that.  The value of that would be a great deal lessened if the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council knew that I was merely approaching them because a statute required me to do it.  Consultation in that way could <Col N="465" /> become quite formal and indeed of very little value.</P>
    <P>Senator Desmond asked me about the provision of Section 4 with regard to the granting of a legal aid appeal certificate.  Right through this Bill there is the principle that free legal aid will be granted only where it is essential in the interests of justice because of the serious nature of the offence or because of exceptional circumstances.  I should like to make it clear that it is not just confined to serious offences.  It could also be very minor or trivial offences which had exceptional circumstances, such as where some person was accused of larceny and had a very technical and difficult defence.  The offence itself might be a minor one and the charge would not be of a serious nature, but there might be exceptional circumstances of a technical nature which would entitle the accused to free legal aid.  Senator Desmond, therefore, first of all is not correct in saying that it is confined to exceptional and serious charges.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I want to say quite frankly to the House that this is a limited, experimental measure. There are a lot of unknown factors in it.  We do not know what it is going to cost.  We do not want it to run riot.  We want to keep it under tight control in the beginning and see how it works out and then see whether circumstances indicate that we should introduce refinements of one sort or another.  In the beginning we feel that we should act with prudence and confine the scheme to cases where it is essential to avoid a miscarriage of justice that the accused should get free legal aid. It would have to appear to the court that either the charge was of a serious nature or that there were exceptional circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>We could not possibly contemplate in an original trial or in an appeal that in every case the accused would be entitled to free legal aid.  It would certainly work out, if particular accused persons could get free legal aid in every case or there were no limits proposed in the Bill, that the number of appeals which would be <Col N="466" /> taken on trivial grounds would multiply enormously.</P>
    <P>I think that those are the principal matters which were raised in the discussion.</P>

      <P>I do.  Indeed I would not contemplate that there should be any examination in open court of the accused person's means.  That would be undesirable and I shall endeavour to work the scheme so that that would not happen.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill sets out to solve a problem. It will be generally accepted that the custom which has grown up in our society whereby organisations of one kind or another are permitted to go to the public and seek funds by subscriptions for their objects is a desirable one.  On the other hand, we have a duty to ensure that the general public are not excessively importuned and are not subjected to any excessive degree of nuisance in this regard and that, within reason, the public are protected against the abuse of fraudulent collections. The Bill attempts to reconcile these two conflicting factors and to keep a reasonable balance between them.  It provides for the regulation of collections of money from the public by way of what are commonly called flag days, by way of house to house visits and by way of boxes left in public places, such as shops, licensed premises, hotels, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> At present street collections are subject to control under Regulations made in 1930 by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána pursuant to section 5 of the Police, Factories, etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1916.  These Regulations provide for the granting of collection permits by the Gardaí and for the prevention of inconvenience to the public but they do not empower the Gardaí to refuse permission to collect even to the most unsuitable persons. Furthermore, the regulations apply only to street collections.  The present Bill is designed to remedy the defects in the existing law by providing a modern comprehensive enactment to regulate all collections from the public, including house to house collections, and to enable the holding of such collections to be prohibited in specified circumstances.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Collection&rdquo; is defined in Section 1 of the Bill so as to exclude street trading, ordinary trade or business, collecting in accordance with a licence or permit under the Gaming and Lotteries Act (which covers collections for non-stop draws, pools, etc.) and begging. Accordingly, the Bill does not apply to these types of collecting. Furthermore, it will not apply to house to house collections unless and until an Order is made by the Minister for Justice under Section 2 extending the proposed Act to such collections.  I am satisfied that while house to house collections at the present time may occasionally be a source of annoyance to some householders, they do not constitute a widespread nuisance.  Generally, the public is not being excessively importuned by them; and I do not see any necessity for the making of an Order under Section 2 in present circumstances.  At the same time I think it is desirable that the Minister for Justice should have the power to regulate such collections if this becomes necessary in the public interest.  Senators will observe that an Order under Section 2 may apply the provisions of the Act to house to house collections generally, that is to say, throughout the country, or merely to such collections in a particular district or area.  Moreover, an <Col N="468" /> Order may exempt specific house to house collections or classes of such collections from control.  If it ever becomes necessary to apply the Act to house to house collections, I envisage that collections made for religious and other obviously legitimate purposes would be so exempted.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill prohibits the holding of any collection in respect of which a collection permit has not been granted by the Chief Superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the locality in which the collection is to be held. Section 5 provides that applications for permits will have to be made in writing in the prescribed form and be accompained by the prescribed particulars. Generally speaking applications will have to be made not more than six months and not less than fourteen days before the collection is due to commence.</P>
    <P>Section 6, which deals with the grant of permits, proposes that where there is a clash of applications to hold collections on the same day and in the same locality, and where only one permit is to be granted, priority will be given to the object in respect of which a collection was held on the corresponding day in the previous year.  This is designed to protect the interests of what, for convenience, may be called the old established charities, which have been collecting in this way for many years.</P>
    <P>A Chief Superintendent will be obliged to grant every permit applied for unless in his opinion such grounds for refusal exist as are specified in Sections 9, 10, 11 or 12 of the Bill. Where the Chief Superintendent is of opinion than any of these grounds exists he will be obliged to refuse to grant a permit.</P>
    <P>In addition to refusing a permit, a Chief Superintendent may attach conditions to a permit, and he may also revoke a permit.  However, where a person is aggrieved by the Chief Superintendent's decision, provision is made in Section 14 for an appeal to the district court, and the court is given power to direct the Chief Superintendent to grant a permit with or without conditions attached to it.  The <Col N="469" /> court may also amend or delete conditions attached to a permit by the Chief Superintendent.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in Section 15, makes it an offence for a person to act as a collector unless he is in possession of a written authorisation from the holder of a collection permit.  The issue of such authorisations to collectors under the age of fourteen is prohibited in Section 16.  The minimum age of collectors under the existing law is sixteen years, but on the whole I consider that fourteen is an appropriate and reasonable compromise between the conflicting interests involved.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the marking on collection boxes of the object for which the collection is being held.</P>
    <P>The keeping of full and proper accounts of the amounts collected is dealt with in Section 24.  Specific powers of entry and arrest and specific powers to seize money and collection boxes in certain circumstances are given to the Gardaí in Sections 21 and 25.  The Bill makes it an offence for the owners of certain public places to allow unauthorised collections to be held therein. The penalties for offences under any of the provisions of the Bill are set out in Section 26.  They are a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposed powers and the penalties are no more than adequate to ensure compliance with the law.  Senators will appreciate the difficulty which might arise in enforcing the proposed Act if organisers of unauthorised collections choose to ignore the law.  It is for this reason that the Bill includes the additional deterrent in Section 21, namely, the power given to the Gardaí to seize money and collection boxes in the case of an unauthorised collection.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil I indicated that, since the measure had no political implications, I would welcome suggestions from all sides as to the best way of implementing the general purpose of the Bill.  It is in the same spirit that I present the Bill to this House.  I think that it represents <Col N="470" /> a reasonable and sensible approach to the problem but I shall carefully examine any suggestions for its improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill by and large.  I think it is tidying up the position.  I think I am correct in saying that there is provision at present for the granting of licences by a Chief Superintendent and that it is illegal to take up a collection without such a licence.  Apparently the difficulty is that a Chief Superintendent cannot refuse to grant such a licence unless it clashes with another collection on the same day and in that case he merely gives it for another more suitable day.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the Bill is probably due to the activities of one organisation and it is best to be frank about that, but I hope its operation will not tend to hinder the collection of money by voluntary organisations who are doing good work of a charitable or social nature.  I do not think it will and I certainly hope it will not.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Bill applies to the sale of tickets because that comes under the Lotteries Act, presumably. I have not studied the Lotteries Act and I do not know whether any conditions attached to licences given under it prohibit the sale of tickets by young children, but I think it is most undesirable that children of tender years, to use a legal expression, or perhaps of not so tender years are let loose with books of tickets to sell around the country with no proper check on them. As well as being an annoyance to the public it puts a serious temptation in the way of the young children who have the tickets.</P>
      <P>One interesting section is Section 15. If it is enforced strictly it will present considerable difficulties to people who have charge of certain annual collections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person shall not act as a collector in a collection if he is not in possession of an authorisation in writing (in this Act referred to as a collector's authorisation) relating to the collection and granted to him in accordance with the provisions <Col N="471" /> of this section by the holder of the collection permit relating to the collection.</P>
    <P>Presumably in the case of a national collection the person applying for the permit would be the chief executive of the organisation concerned.  He would get a permit and he in turn would have to issue authorisation to each individual who &ldquo;stands at the table&rdquo;.  That authorisation&mdash;perhaps this would be more relevant on the Committee Stage &mdash;would have to contain the name and address of each person &ldquo;standing at the table&rdquo; as well as his age if he were under 21.  I just do not think it could be enforced strictly.  The best that would happen would be sheaves of blank forms let loose in the hope that they would be filled up at various lower levels down through the organisation. I simply think that that is a section which one could not expect or hope to enforce properly.</P>
    <P>Age is another thing.  I did not read all the discussion in the Dáil.  As a matter of fact I read only the discussion on the Second Stage and I do not know what amendments were introduced or accepted.  The age 14 is not altered.  I do not know whether it was sought to alter it.</P>

      <P>I think that this Bill has more to do with the cities than the country.  I do not think country people have as much annoyance as we have in Dublin from some of these collections.  We are all in favour of deserving charities and some of the most deserving depend to a great degree on the money they get from flag days and collections.  We are all in favour also of the Bill in its desire <Col N="472" /> to avoid fraudulent collections, but I feel there should be some limit to the number of days in a week on which collections are allowed, perhaps two days in the week or three at the very most.  In Dublin, week after week, every single day there is a collection. I wonder if the Chief Superintendent could bear in mind the number of collections in any particular week.  It is not so much the money as the nuisance.  Every day there is a collection of one kind or another.  Could the Chief Superintendent have regard to the number of collections at any given moment in the issuing of the permits?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point.  I know it would not be possible to make it obligatory in the Bill, but I think a flag should be given in exchange for money.  Sometimes the box has not been filled and all the flags are gone.  There again there is a nuisance and an annoyance.  You put your 2/- in the box and go along and &mdash;it may be a nice lady or a boy of 14 years&mdash;you are importuned again if you have not got a flag.  I know it cannot be made obligatory but it is desirable that a flag should be given in exchange for money where possible.</P>

      <P>As a fellow victim with Senator McGuire in Dublin I should like to ask the Minister to try to limit the number of flag days.  Really they are pretty well every day.  That is my first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point may sound unreasonable but I think that, as in the case of public houses, there should be some limitation of hours as well as numbers.  The collections should not be allowed to start until 10.30 a.m. or 11 a.m.  One comes into town short of change, not in the best of tempers, in a hurry to get to work, and a box is thrust in one's face.  The collectors probably lose quite a lot because of the bad tempers they arouse.  Quite seriously, I should like to suggest that <Col N="473" /> some regulation should prevent them from starting too early.</P>
    <P>My third suggestion is that a permit to hold a flag day should be refused to any organisation which employs loud speakers in the streets.  It is perfectly terrible sometimes in addition to being teased for money, to have these vehicles going up and down with loud speakers blaring.  Those are the only suggestions I have to make in regard to this admirable measure.</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator McGuire knows the country when he suggests that this thing is confined to the city.  We have the same experience in the rural areas as they have in the cities.  My one worry on this Bill is the question of the wren boys.  They are an old traditional custom we have in the country and I should not like them to be hampered or hamstrung by this Bill. I read the debate in the Dáil and I know that some Deputies raised this matter.  The Minister observed that they did not collect, but in actual fact they do.  They go from house to house, they collect from people in the streets, or in any gathering.</P>

      <P>As I say, they are an old traditional custom.  They may decide to go out on a particular day, but according to the Bill they must make provision for a permit.  The Christmas holidays extend from Christmas Eve until some days after <Col N="474" /> Christmas, and weather conditions and other things govern the wren boys. They are not confined to St. Stephen's Day but go out on different days in my part of the country.  The Minister should not include them in the Bill. After all, they are one of the distinguishing marks we will bring into the Common Market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it is the first specific comprehensive measure that has been brought forward in an attempt to regularise this very awkward question of collections which has been causing everyone quite a lot of trouble for years.  I have been looking through the Bill to see if it takes in any previous Acts and I have only found one.</P>
      <P>In the past the situation was, of necessity, rather chaotic.  The Bill undoubtedly goes a long way to endeavour, so far as the Minister can, to regularise the whole question of collections.  Now that we have tackled it, it would be a pity if we did not bring forward another measure at a later stage to provide for every contingency.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that some people think the age of collectors should be higher than 14 years and others think it should be lower.  I think the age of 14 years is somewhat low.  Usually organisations that have to resort to engaging people of 14 years to make collections do not appear to enjoy the confidence of the people. Most organisations, and particularly charitable ones, which are obliged to make house-to-house or street collections can get them done more effectively by adults.  Perhaps there is difficulty now in getting sufficient people to volunteer for this job and, of late, it is a noticeable development that very young children are being engaged to carry out the duties attaching to collections.  I suggest that the Minister has nothing to worry about in regard to the age limit.  If anything, he has fixed it at a rather low limit, but I would be very disappointed if there were any attempt at this stage to change it.  We should try the limit laid down and see how it works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion the Bill does not provide sufficiently well for organisations <Col N="475" /> which make collections too often. Under the Bill the Superintendents and Garda officers can refuse permits to organisations which have trespassed on the generosity of the people sufficiently often already.  Some organisations, particularly those that do not work on a regional basis, seem to have adopted a practice in recent years of holding collections two or three times a year. Another Senator made that point.  I agree with the suggestion that there should be some limit and I think once a year would be enough.</P>
    <P>I take it that it is clear beyond yea or nay that no individual or organisation can make a collection without a permit.  We have had the experience in some parts of the country in recent years that organisations made collections on dates on which permits were issued to other organisations.  They merely bulldozed their way into the collection area and succeeded in frightening off the people with the permit. That was allowed to go on without any action being taken by the authorities. I believe there was some doubt as to the provisions of whatever regulations were then in existence.  For that reason the Guards were rather reluctant to prosecute.</P>
    <P>Flags were mentioned by Senator McGuire and another Senator.  I am in entire agreement that the Bill should put an obligation on people holding a flag day to have a permit.  In connection with these collections, one puts a penny in the collection box but no flag is given.  That is the type of stunt that seems to pay dividends.  The person has only to go another 100 yards when he is held up.  And rather than explain that he has already supported the particular charity he allows the collectors to impose their influence on him again.  This time the person concerned will probably get a flag.</P>
    <P>A great deal of fuss was created by statements throughout the country, when this Bill was being introduced, that it was brought forward for the purpose of victimising a certain organisation or organisations.  Anybody who reads the Bill can see that there is no discrimination or attempt at discrimination <Col N="476" /> in that connection.  What we want to do is make applicants recognise that there is authority vested in the Government for this particular operation and that they have to submit themselves to that authority the same as any other applicant.  It is time that was made very clear.</P>
    <P>I was about to dwell on a good point but Senator Mooney was too quick.  That was the question of collections by &ldquo;wran boys.&rdquo;  The wran boys are a very old tradition.  They go from house to house, particularly at Christmas time.  I think it also happened in February but the custom has gone further than than in recent years. We have revived the custom in County Kerry.</P>

I should like to see that there would be no hitch as far as the law is concerned in regard to the promoting organisation.  I take it that if they apply for a permit the Superintendent will normally give the permit except he is of opinion that the operation will interfere with the peace. I should like the matter to be clearly legislated for.  As a matter of fact, these collectors do not get anything individually.  There are prizes either in cash or kind.  They go towards paying expenses.  If the issue is not clearly provided for, I hope the Minister will look into that particular point.</P>

    <P>There is imposed on collectors the obligation of having sealed the boxes into which subscriptions are put in an open street collection, that is, outside church gates, public buildings, or such places.  In the past that obligation was not adhered to.  It was impracticable as it would unduly delay the person making the deposit and giving the subscription. Apart from that, collectors in their wisdom always made sure that the coins were distributed fairly widely over a table or such receptacle. Usually, the organisation making collections <Col N="477" /> in that form have paper and pencil.  They take names and addresses and receipts are issued.</P>

      <P>Níl ach ceist bheag amháin agamsa.  Is mian liom a bheith cinnte dhe i leith na mbailiúchán náisiúnta a deintear sa lá céanna i rith na seachtaine céanna ar fud na tíre ná beidh an trioblóid ann go ndearna cuid de na Seanadóirí tagairt di.  An mbeidh ortha an t-údarás scríofa a bheith acu i ngach áit ar fud na tíre?  An dóigh leis an Aire go mbeidh an iomad trioblóide ansin? Bíonn bailiúchán náisúnta ag Connradh na Gaeilge ar siúl sa tseachtain chéanna ar fud na tíre.  Má bhíonn ar gach bailitheóir páipéar údaráis a bheith aige beidh trioblóid agus achrann ann.  Ba mhaith liomsa go mbeadh sé soiléir go bhfuil slí as sin beartaithe i leith na dlí atá dhá cur i bhfeidhm againn.  Bíonn bailiúcháin ann Lá le Pádraig agus ar ócáidí eile agus má bhíonn ar rúnaí agus ar ard-rúnaí na h-eagraíochta bheith freagarthach&mdash;agus na céadta daoine eile a bheith freagarthach&mdash;beidh antrioblóid ag gabháil leis na cúrsaí. Beidh sé beagán deacair é a riaradh. An bhfuil slí as an scéal sin?</P>

      <P>I was going to say that there was one good thing about the &ldquo;wran boys&rdquo; and that is they appear only one day of the year.  Apparently, they have improved on that in Kerry. I do not think they will ever come to the situation we have reached in Dublin where you have flag days and collections every other day.  I have the impression that some years ago flag days were infrequent but that recently they have tended to increase in numbers. Now it is rather unusual not to have some sort of a collection or a flag day every day.  You do not contribute to a charity.  You pay a ransom to move through the streets.  It may be <Col N="478" /> small but it is still a ransom.  Visitors are rather puzzled and sometimes annoyed by the situation.  I hope this measure will do something to remove or lesson that annoyance.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Bill does not seek to control another annoyance in the streets of Dublin, namely, street photographers who buttonhole innocent looking people, get them into a corner and extract money from them and write on a slip of paper some sort of receipt.  That is an annoyance on the streets which should not be permitted.</P>
      <P>Another point is the question of age. Why is there an age limit at all?  Why is 14 mentioned?  I suggest it is because we all know young children should not be sent around collecting money, that they are being put in the way of temptation. We think that after 14 or 15 it is prudent and safe for children to be allowed into the temptation or be in groups going around collecting money. I think 14 is far too young and I hope that between this and the Committee Stage the Minister will give further consideration to this point.  I would not like to suggest that people going around selling flags might steal money but why is it that we have an age limit?  We all know it is to avoid putting youngsters into temptation.  The age limit should be much higher and I hope Senators will agree with my reasoning.</P>

      <P>I am not acquainted with the wren boys but I am conversant with another gentleman who goes around at the Christmas season and that is the mummer.  I do not know if they exist in many parts of the country.  We have them in Donegal and we have mummers from November to February collecting night after night, thereby torturing the people.  If this Bill restricts their activities it will be doing a very good job.  Years ago mummers were seen out a few days before Christmas but in recent years the mummer has become younger and fonder of money and accordingly has become a greater nuisance to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I feel it will protect in many ways the small business man in rural Ireland.  Senator McGuire seemed to think it would <Col N="479" /> affect Dublin only but I disagree with that.  Business men who are subject to collections in small towns are in a way partly blackmailed.  They must pay to every collection to which they are asked to subscribe in order to ensure their sales of flour, beer or anything else will continue.  Sometimes they are asked to subscribe to collections about which they know nothing. This Bill will to a certain extent restrict the activities of many collectors. I also agree that the age limit should be increased to 16.</P>
    <P>The rural business people might be blackmailed but in Dublin the various associations use a different means of blackmail: the people they get to collect on the streets always seem to be the finest looking girls.  This in itself is a form of blackmail because no matter how disinterested one might be one finds great difficulty in not giving a subscription.  The Minister should examine that.</P>

      <P>As Senators themselves have indicated, most of the points raised are really Committee Stage points, and I feel justified in leaving them over until that Stage.  I do want to say I have a great deal of sympathy with Senators who find themselves importuned by good looking girls and who have not got the moral courage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>However, I imagine that strictly speaking it is not my function to protect these Senators from themselves.  I also have a great deal of sympathy for the Senator who, in coming from his house in the early mornings, is set upon by a collector and has a box rattled loudly before his face.  I am not sure whether we can do anything to control the degree of loudness but I can readily recognise that it would be distinctly uncomfortable for certain Senators in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>The question of wren boys is a matter that is, of course, of the utmost importance.  Senators from different counties will read for wren boys, where appropriate, &ldquo;mummers&rdquo;. This is a subject to which I have been giving some thought and carrying out some research.  The House will probably be interested to know this; and I am indebted to my young daughter for the information that the wren became the king of all birds by a simple process.  All the birds assembled on one occasion to decide which would be the king and they agreed whichever could fly the highest would be king.  The birds flew up into the sky and, naturally, the eagle soared the highest.  He was just at the peak of his accomplishment and was about to proclaim himself king when a little wren which had been nestling on his back flew five or ten feet higher and automatically became king.</P>
      <P>I did put forward the suggestion that it might not be strictly true to say that wren boys requested money. I understand that the custom may vary in different parts of the country, but when the wren boys go from house to house they do not, as far as I know, ask for money.  All they ask for is an answer: &ldquo;Give us our answer and let us be gone&rdquo;.  I think it might take the Supreme Court to decide properly on the niceties of the point.  In any event, the wren boys are not covered by the Bill as it stands.  They can truthfully be described as house to house collectors. It is not proposed that the Bill should apply to house to house collections immediately.  Indeed, the provisions of the Bill may only be extended to house to house collections by Ministerial order; and there is provision in Section 2 for exempting in the Order certain collections.  At the stage of making the Order, consideration at high level could be given to the question of excluding wren boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various other points made by Senators will probably come up for more detailed discussion on Committee Stage and I assume the House will have no objection if I do not deal with them now.  I shall, however, deal with one point which concerns not so much what <Col N="481" /> is in the Bill as what is not in it.  It was suggested that there is excessive importuning of the public, particularly in Dublin, because there are too many collections.</P>
    <P>There is nothing specific in the Bill with regard to the number of collections. We provide that, in the case of a number of organisations applying for permits for the same day, the Chief Superintendent would have to be satisfied that the public would not be excessively importuned before he could grant more than one permit, but I am afraid that there is not in the Bill at the moment anything to deal with the problem of there being too many flag <Col N="482" /> days altogether.  That is something we will look into.  We have not, to my knowledge, had any complaints from the Gardaí, or from any other source about that particular problem, but now that it has been mentioned here we will undoubtedly give some consideration to it.</P>
    <P>I shall confine my remarks to those few points.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
