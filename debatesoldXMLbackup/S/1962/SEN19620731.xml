      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw your attention, Sir, and the attention of the House, to work that has begun outside the Dáil Chamber, and to say that it is work which I think would be a great disfigurement to the building and which should not be carried out.  It should be said, Sir, that since 1922, the Office of Public Works have carried out a great deal of excellent work in this building.  Now a plan has been submitted to the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses for an extension of the building.  In connection with that particular extension, there has been a suggestion that certain Seanad rooms should be given over to the Taoiseach. To give access from our landing to the Dáil Chamber work has now begun for putting a gallery five feet wide over the entrance to the Dáil Chamber and beside the entrance staircase.</P>
      <P>Though work has actually begun, no plan for that gallery was ever submitted to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have been making inquiries and I understand that no plan of that kind was submitted to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  There seems, therefore, to be no authority for that work, because it has been understood at all times that no change in the fabric of the building would be undertaken, without consultations with both Houses.  The work which has now begun would mar the elegance and dignity of the approach to the Dáil Chamber and it would be a disfigurement of the building of which we are tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask you, Sir, whether you have been consulted, and whether you <Col N="1038" /> would use your influence to see that the work is postponed, that the whole question is postponed, until such time as both the Dáil and Seanad Committees on Procedure and Privileges have an opportunity of discussing the plan. I have no doubt neither would agree with any such plan.</P>

      <P>I was at the last meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and we decided to send a deputation to see the Taoiseach on that matter.  I should like to know what was done since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We saw the Taoiseach on the matter and he was very reasonable indeed.  This suggestion of the erection of a gallery is consequential on the Taoiseach getting certain rooms here.  The Taoiseach, as I say, was reasonable on the matter.  No plan of a gallery was ever submitted and no decision was reached upon the erection of a gallery.  I am of opinion, although I have no authority, that the Taoiseach seemed to adopt the attitude with the deputation that he himself is not in favour of any such disfigurement. The deputation was very well received.</P>

    <Title>State Guarantees (Transport) Bill, 1962    (Certified Money Bill) &mdash;  Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the existing statutory powers of guarantee vested in the Minister for Finance in respect of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The House will be already aware that there is provision in existing legislation covering the borrowing of moneys for capital purposes by CIE and the guaranteeing of such borrowings by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2) of Section 30 of the Transport Act, 1950, the Minister for Finance is empowered to guarantee the repayment as to principal and interest of moneys borrowed by CIE under the provisions of that Act.  Guarantees under subsection (2) of Section 30 of the Act relate to guarantees of borrowing for long-term capital requirements.  CIE may also borrow for short-term requirements and the Minister for Finance is empowered also under subsection (1) of Section 30 of the same Act to guarantee such borrowings.  The maximum amounts which the Minister for Finance may guarantee have been amended by the Transport Act, 1955, and the GNR Act, 1958.  Under those Acts, the upper limits of borrowing by CIE which might be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance were raised to £12 million for long-term and £1½ million for short-term borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is intended to serve a purpose rather different from the existing <Col N="1040" /> statutory provisions governing guarantees by the Minister for Finance.  The existing provisions empower the Minister for Finance to give guarantees only in respect of borrowings.  The Bill is designed to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee, in addition to borrowings, the payment by CIE of moneys due by the Board on foot of contracts entered into.</P>
    <P>CIE had received an attractive offer of extended payments at favourable terms for the purchase of new diesel locomotives.  The terms of contract provided for payment in instalments over a period of five years, with interest at the rate of 5½ per cent. per annum on the balance outstanding subject to a Government guarantee. As the law stood, the statutory powers of the Minister for Finance did not enable him to give a guarantee in the terms required.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the Government that acceptance of favourable credit terms such as were offered in this case should not be prejudiced by the absence of a statutory power enabling the Minister for Finance to give the required guarantee when the Minister for Finance is in fact already empowered to give a guarantee in respect of borrowings.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory limit for borrowing for long-term purposes by CIE has been reached by the recent £2 million stock issue and it is not intended to propose a new upper limit for such capital borrowing by CIE until the position of the whole organisation comes to be reviewed towards the expiry of the five-year trial period provided for in the Transport Act, 1958.  In any event, it was desired to accept the particularly favourable extended credit terms which were obtainable in the present case.  A payment scheme of this kind amounts in fact to a pay-as-you-earn scheme which is a wholesome arrangement for an organisation faced, as CIE is with the obligation to pay its way.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will enable the Minister for Finance to implement an undertaking given to CIE that power would be sought from the Oireachtas to permit of a guarantee being given for the payment by the <Col N="1041" /> Board of the instalments specified in the contract for the new diesel locomotives to which I have referred.  To enable the construction of the locomotives to be put in hands at once with a view to early delivery, authority was given to CIE on 8th March, 1962, to purchase the locomotives from General Motors and later, on 18th April, 1962, CIE were given a formal undertaking on behalf of the Government subject to subsequent legislative confirmation, that payments under the contract would be met as due.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that, as the authority of the Oireachtas was to some extent being anticipated, it would be appropriate, if only as a matter of courtesy, to include a reference to this particular contract in the Bill.  It was claimed by certain Deputies in Dáil Éireann that the contract should, therefore, be scheduled to the Bill or tabled in the House.  There is no precedent for publishing in this, or any other manner, a commercial contract entered into by a State-sponsored body in the exercise of its statutory functions and, as the inclusion of a reference to the contract was not necessary, I withdrew it by amendment in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the opportunity was taken by certain Deputies to suggest that my refusal to schedule or table this contract was an attempt to cover up irregularities by CIE and the suggestion was made that the contract had been secretly and irregularly entered into prior to the invitation of tenders from other suppliers.  This imaginative invention was based on a newspaper report of last October, when representatives of General Motors were visiting Dublin, that they had obtained an order for 30 locomotives from CIE This report was publicly denied by CIE at the time.  The representatives of General Motors had indeed visited CIE and were naturally seeking business. They were told that CIE would probably be in the market soon for about 30 locomotives and that they would probably be invited to tender. The Board did decide to acquire 37 diesel locomotives and, on 5th December, 1961, General Motors and seven other manufacturers were invited to <Col N="1042" /> tender.  The General Motors tender was accepted on 28th February, 1962, subject to the provision of the necessary Government guarantee, and the contract was finalised on 4th May, 1962.  How General Motors could be expected to accept an irregular and presumably unenforceable contract in October last when they would not accept a perfectly legitimate contract some months later without a Government guarantee of payment is beyond my comprehension.</P>
    <P>I mention this matter only to express my dislike of the unfair and unworthy reflection on the Chairman and Board of CIE which it implies.  The debate in the Dáil makes it essential for me to observe that even if Deputies and Senators disagree with the policy and actions of the Board, it is not too much to ask that they should abstain from using the privileges of the Oireachtas to make statements, without a shred of evidence, which can only reflect on the honesty and good faith of the directors and chairmen of State boards.</P>
    <P>The question of diesel locomotives does not arise on the Bill as amended but to anticipate Senators' questions I may say that, while neither I nor my Department had anything to do with the tender or contract, the acquisition of the 37 diesel locomotives was approved by me as part of the capital programme of CIE.  The locomotives are essential for the maintenance of an efficient railway system even if the system has to be on a smaller scale than at present.  The locomotives will in addition enable CIE to achieve substantial economies in operation and thus help the Board to achieve its statutory obligation to pay its way.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill for the approval of the House.  It does not commit the Government or CIE to any expenditure that would not otherwise be undertaken.  It merely provides an alternative to existing borrowing procedure which can be used where advantageous.  Particularly favourable terms were offered in the case to which I have referred and may well be offered in the case of other transactions from time to time, because the transaction qualified for <Col N="1043" /> export credit financing arrangements and, under such arrangements, it is generally necessary to provide a Government or similar acceptable guarantee if the best terms are to be got.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be accepted.  It offers, particularly in the light of the amendment made by the Minister in the Dáil, a very good example of how little power the Oireachtas really has over State-sponsored bodies.  In fact, the Minister in his Second Reading speech just now has made it quite clear that the Oireachtas has no power whatever over State-sponsored bodies.  He had a section in the Bill which made a specific reference to a contract.  There was some talk about the contract. What did the Minister do?  He took out the subsection which dealt with the contract and now his position, without that subsection, is as good as it was when he put it in, and indeed probably better, from the point of view of order and debate.  It is really a case of heads I win, tails you lose.  The Minister has some power over these bodies.  Parliament has none at all.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that perhaps he would be better advised not to give advice at large to Deputies and Senators that they should refrain from abusing their privileges.  I say in all mildness that the Minister and his Party got into office by the most flagrant abuse of their privileges in the Dáil.  They abused everybody inside and outside both Houses of Parliament when they thought that would be of any advantage to them.  In any event, so far as CIE are concerned, the Company should get an opportunity of making good and this Bill is merely for the purpose of allowing the Government to guarantee particular contracts rather than to guarantee loans made to CIE.  I have no intention whatever of criticising any of the directors but the Minister's attitude would appear to amount to &ldquo;Shut your eyes and open your mouth and see what Childers will send you.&rdquo; People are not prepared to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the general point of view of <Col N="1044" /> State bodies, the first State body, the ESB, was set up in 1926.  On that occasion, the question arose as to how the Dáil could exercise some control over it.  I said from the Chair in the Dáil at the time that I did not know and that this would not be the last State body to be established.  The position we are in at present is exactly the same.  The Minister has power to advise CIE; he may have power even to coerce them.  He may refuse to bring in certain measures into Dáil Éireann but there is no means by which the Dáil or Seanad, and the Dáil in particular, can influence them. I agree entirely that there would be no use showing me a contract made by CIE for the purchase of diesel engines as I admit my ignorance in these and other commercial matters. The situation then is that the more State control you have&mdash;and there are people committed to State control&mdash; the less Parliamentary control you have.  It would be possible to argue the point&mdash;I do not propose to do it at this late hour of the day&mdash;that perhaps we exercise more control over private enterprise than we do over CIE or the ESB.  However, I will not argue that point.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill and there is nothing we can do about it in the position we are in with regard to these bodies.  It may indeed be a good thing that we are not regarding them as being purely on a commercial basis. We regard electricity as a social service and I presume we regard the preservation of railways as something to be regarded not entirely on a commercial, dividend-paying basis.  However, the Bill is one which I think merits a Second Reading from the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party welcome this Bill because we welcome any move on the part of the Minister to ensure that CIE is run on an economic basis.  We have subsidised CIE for too long and if there is any move to make CIE a paying proposition, it will be welcomed by this House and the people generally.  As far as we are concerned, the chief point at issue is whether the contract for the purchase of the diesel engines between <Col N="1045" /> General Motors and CIE should be placed on the Table of the House for the benefit of the House.  I understand in Dáil Éireann the Minister refused to give any information regarding the contract.  He said it was not a matter for him; yet it is a matter for the people to put up a sum of money and to guarantee the money for the firm supplying these engines.  We as representatives of the people are entitled to certain information which the Minister is not prepared to give us.</P>
      <P>We would like to know who is the agent acting on behalf of CIE in connection with the purchase of these engines.  We would like to know the conditions under which this agent is working and whether he is working on a commission basis or not and, if he is, what is the amount of the commission. We should also like to know how he came to be appointed to act in a huge contract of this nature.  These are questions we would like to have answered by the Minister.  I hope he will not continue to withhold the information we have been seeking.  If the money is being provided by the State, we are entitled to know whether the lowest contract has been accepted or not, how many people have tendered, and how it was that a particular firm were selected to supply these engines.  I hope the Minister has changed his mind about giving the information to the House.  We in this Party will press for that information. We believe the people should know where the money is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill, we are asked to guarantee money to CIE and consequently we should have a general look at the Company and at the soundness of the proposition because it is a very serious business to pledge the country's credit to the extent of £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing which perhaps we might observe is that CIE appear to be making a very determined effort, and what outwardly appears to be a successful effort, to meet the grave challenge which confronts them.  That challenge is part of the challenge which railroads everywhere are confronted with.  In England, America and elsewhere, <Col N="1046" /> railroads are having great difficulty in maintaining themselves and especially is this true in the passenger line where they are faced with so much competition from other forms of transport.  To that extent, our problem is not unique.  We might congratulate CIE on what they have done.</P>
    <P>There is one facet of their management which appeals very much to me, that is, that in their recent reorganisation, the technical men have come very much to the fore.  They are apparently showing that on a foundation of good technical training and experience in practice, if to that is added the training and experience necessary for management, a technical man can rise to the challenge of management as well as and, in fact, better than, a nontechnical man.  In that there is a great lesson for us in the way in which we plan to meet the challenge of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The main handicap CIE are fighting in the country is simply a lack of people.  The Minister has at various times given statistics wherein he has shown that per thousand of the population, we have too many miles of railroad, more miles than anywhere else. I would much prefer to look at it the other way and say we have too few people per thousand miles of railroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the Senator to the fact that this Bill does not cover the whole gamut of transport?  It is an enabling Bill relating to a specific item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the specific point as to whether we, as representatives here, shall pledge the credit of the nation to guarantee £5 million to CIE.  I submit with all sincerity that we have to have a brief look at this Company and see in what way is it going to know is it wise to pledge the money asked for in this Bill.  The point I want to make is that for the problems of the future, it does seem we will have to have a great increase in population over the next 20 or 30 years, whether that increase is provided by ourselves or greatly augmented by an influx from abroad under the Common Market.  Consequently, we should never lose sight of <Col N="1047" /> that and, although facilities may be apparently uneconomic and be in excess at the moment, we have got to keep our eyes on the future and plan in that way.  It would be very wrong that CIE should be compelled by lack of Government support to cut down the system to the point where we may regret it later.  In that regard, we have a very positive statement that came from CIE in their report for the year ending 31st March, 1961.  At the end of page 9, it is stated:</P>
      <P>The Board announce that, except for some small stations, these were the final sections of the railway system that would be replaced by road services within the five-year period set out by the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
      <P>That was a solemn statement made by CIE less than a year ago.  It is on that basis we should deal with CIE and with their request for more money. We should view any departure from that as very grave indeed.  Surely any general all-round increase, such as that being caused by the eighth round increase, cannot affect whether a particular section of the system is economic or not?  We would expect the eighth round increase should apply to the road freight people just as well as railway freight.  Consequently, it should not be a factor altering the balance between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come then to the question of whether we should vote this money or not.  In voting this money, it behoves us, as ordinary, prudent representatives, to look at the balance sheet of this company to see what is the actual position and whether the money should be voted or not.  The last balance sheet came to hand about last September and is for the year ending 31st March, 1961.  This balance sheet was greeted in the national press with all forms of exaggerated hyperbole that such wonders had been achieved as, for instance, that the losses had been cut from £709,000 to £246,000 in the past year and that that was a continuation of what had happened in the previous year when the losses had been cut from £1,200,000 to £700,000. I submit that all that picture is totally <Col N="1048" /> false and that, although a good deal has been done, the worst enemy of CIE at present is the way in which their accounts are presented.  These accounts bear no relationship whatever to reality.  Any private businessman who would present his accounts in that form would not deserve to last very long.</P>
    <P>The figure that was seized on&mdash;it is given on page 5 of the report&mdash;states that for the year ending 31st March, 1961, there was a net deficit of £246,000 compared with a net deficit of £709,000 in the preceding year.  That is a very positive statement.  It is one that has been seized on to show that CIE, by their own efforts, by the reorganisation and by what is usually referred to as superior management&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator now relate these matters to the amending Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating it to the fact that we are being asked under the Bill to approve that the Minister may guarantee a sum which, according to Section 2, shall not exceed an amount equivalent to £5 million.  I take it that in discharging our duty to discuss that, we have a right and a duty to look at the financial position of the company involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making the point quite categorically that while I give full credit for what has been done&mdash;I can say that as great an effort has been made as was made by any other railroad company and everything that could be done has been done&mdash;the fact is that the picture is not as presented here.  In point of fact, CIE, by their own efforts, just about held the line last year.  Holding that line was quite a substantial achievement.  Take the figures that really matter: passengers carried. There is a slight reduction in this, some three per cent. as shown in this report.  Perhaps that was due to a strike that operated for some period. Anyway, there was no increase there. The only section that showed a worthwhile increase was railroad freight, in which there was an increase of seven per cent. over last year.  Road freight increased some 20 per cent. over last <Col N="1049" /> year.  There was a total increase in freight carried of 14 per cent.  These appear to be very substantial increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am doing is examining the profit and loss account to show that the picture presented of the account and the picture that has been painted from that account by the national Press is not the real picture.  The claim that the position had improved last year from a deficit of £709,000 to a deficit of £246,000&mdash;an improvement of £463,000 &mdash;is not real because the figures that make up that £463,000 are, first, interest received for CIE investments; and the interest received was due to the fact that the State has been giving a grant of £1,125,000 each year for five years, and CIE have been setting a good deal of that aside as not required for present purposes, and have been getting a good interest on the money provided by the State.</P>
      <P>The increase in amounts received under that heading was £80,000&mdash;from £109,000 in 1960 to £190,000 in 1961. That is an increase, as I said, of £80,000.  There was a statutory contribution to the County Donegal Railroad Joint Committee, which was relieved by an Act of Parliament, giving a net reduction of £14,000.  The modernisation programme shows that, for the first time, and this is very important, in the accounts for 1961 CIE brought over some of the surplus that was made by selling railroad tracks, and other goods that had been written off, and, as it puts it here, used it on modernisation and reconstruction of rolling stock, stations and buildings, and office equipment.  That is at the bottom of page 23 of the Report.  It used £128,000 out of £173,000 that had been obtained from the sale of surplus stock.  I take it that if that surplus stock had not been available, if the railroad tracks had not been taken up, the modernisation programme would still have gone ahead and would have been paid for out of moneys made available in that year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the Bill.  I am on the profit and loss account of CIE in their account ending 31st March, 1961.  I have accounted for £80,000, £14,000 and £128,000 of that.  The closing of the canal contributed another £28,000. That was an act of merely shutting down.  With regard to fuel, due to the heavy investment that the State has made in the dieselisation programme, and the development of that programme, which is, in itself, a very good thing, fuel bills have decreased to considerably.  They have decreased to the tune of £105,000.  Other goods which were written off account for £36,000.  In short, there is not a point of actual difference due to the actual operation of the lines.  That may be a very substantial achievement, holding the position in that way&mdash;I think it is &mdash;but it is not in the interests of CIE that their profit and loss account should be framed in this way; and it is not in our interests here that, in voting this money, we should be fooled by such an account, that we should take it that the position has shown considerable improvement whereas, in fact, what has been done is merely to hold the line.</P>
      <P>If anybody is interested in seeing an analysis of the accounts for the preceding year, then these accounts, which showed a spectacular reduction of £1,200,000, are available.  The reductions were, in effect, of exactly the same kind so that, again, there was nothing substantial in it.  In fact, the only figure that appears substantial in the profit and loss account is the improvement in the freight department.  That improvement, as shown here, accounted for an increase of 14 per cent.  That is a very good increase.  But it must be remembered that last year our exports increased by 18 per cent. and our imports of 16 per cent and CIE got its proportionate share of the increases available.  Again, full marks to them for doing that, but let us not be misled into believing that the present management is so much superior to past management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> All management in CIE have tried to do their job well and efficiently.  Certainly the previous manager, Mr. T. C. Courtney, was one of the most hardworking and able officials that this country has ever had the good fortune to be served by and, consequently, I should not like any ballyhoo to be used to suggest in any way that the present administration has worked miracles where all other administrations failed. In point of fact, nothing will succeed with CIE except hard work on the part of all its employees, plus more goods, more transport, and so on.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one other comment on the present position of these accounts.  These have been contrasted very unfavourably with the previous accounts in this little green book.  Actually there is more real information in the little green book than in the balance sheets and reports of the past two years.  The report last year even cut down on the information that was given in the preceding year.</P>
    <P>I make the appeal then that if we are to go ahead, as I suggest we should go ahead, approve of this guarantee, and allow CIE to go ahead with the dieselisation programme, then we should do that on the understanding that the system of accounts shows clearly the actual position of CIE, that such things as interest received from Government grants, or moneys received from the sale of stocks, which have already been paid for by the taxpayer, should be shown quite distinctly in the accounts and should not in any way lead to the type of confusion that prevailed last September in regard to the accounts.</P>
    <P>In going ahead with this guarantee we are taking CIE at their word in their announcement here that, having closed the Waterford-Tramore, the West Clare and the West Cork lines, that was the end of the closing down of railways.  I suggest that in granting this guarantee, we should base it on the actual factual statements made by CIE in that report.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to support Senator Hayes very strongly in his statements with regard to the great uneasiness <Col N="1053" /> we feel in the Seanad in dealing with semi-State bodies.  Apparently, we have no function but to hand out the taxpayers' money.  It is high time that some positive approach was made to deal with such companies.  I suggest that there should be committees of the House which would go into issues such as contracts&mdash;the contract in this case should have been attached to the Bill &mdash;and other important items.  The examination would then be under the secrecy of the committee and the affairs of CIE would not perhaps&mdash; this is what the Minister quite rightly objects to at the moment&mdash;be dragged into public debate in the House.  Surely there is a happy medium&mdash;a happy medium which works in all progressive countries where there are Select Committees of the House?  They report to the House that they are satisfied that everything is in order.  If we had that, there would be far fewer grounds for criticism in regard to the relationship between the Oireachtas and the semi-State bodies.  That would be for the good of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with only one small point in the Bill.  Does the Minister consider this a better way of dealing with the matter?  We are guaranteeing a hire-purchase agreement. There must be a considerable amount of interest involved in this case &mdash;a matter of five years.  Over a number of years a considerable amount of interest and capital will be paid out of the country.  What difference would there be in the State paying this direct and letting CIE pay it back to the State if and when they are able?</P>

      <P>I have just a few remarks to make on this Bill.  We should not have a full dress debate on the policy of Córas Iompair Éireann on a Bill of this kind when we are not, as some Senators seem to think, voting money for Córas Iompair Éireann.  We are guaranteeing money on behalf of the State to Córas Iompair Éireann to carry on their good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a suggestion here that there is uneasiness in the people's minds as to the operations of the semi-State bodies.  This is the first time, I must say, that I have heard any suggestion <Col N="1054" /> of the kind that there is uneasiness anywhere about the working of these semi-State bodies.  If I were to pass any remark on their operations, I would say that, instead of any uneasiness existing in the people's minds as to the way they are carrying out their respective policies, the people look upon them as good examples of efficiency.  There is no doubt about that.  These semi-State bodies have done wonderful work.  I doubt very much if they would have been as successful in the carrying out of their work as they have been if, as has been advocated here, they were compelled to put their day-to-day administration before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">

      <P>It was never intended, when these bodies were set up, that they would have to account to the Oireachtas for their day-to-day administration.  They were set up, as has been described, as semi-State organisations and, as such, they have carried on their work very well.  They have given good employment and if Córas Iompair Éireann have not been entirely able to meet their commitments there are many contributory causes of that.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann are a huge State organisation and all we are being asked in this Bill is to guarantee to the extent of not more than £5 million. That is a very small item when we take into account the great amount of employment they are giving all over the country and the good services they provide for the people when all is said and done.  Senator Quinlan seemed to make little of the improvement that has been brought about by the present Chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <P>It was very queer kind of praise I must admit.  When we praise the present Chairman, we are not by any means detracting from what has been done before by other chairmen.  They were all up against a very difficult and complicated problem. <Col N="1055" /> Everyone knows that but I shall not go further into it.  I should not like to embark upon a full debate on the policy and administration of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do say, however, that they have made a good job of the transport system of this country.  They have been called upon to perform a difficult task within a certain limited time and they are going a good way towards doing it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan mentioned certain things.  He said their investments should not be taken into account.  Why should they not?  If any business concern makes wise investments and derives advantage from them, are they not entitled to claim credit for them and are they not entitled to put that into their accounts?</P>

      <P>CIE have had to meet many difficulties and have recently had to meet increases in wages which put an extra burden on their shoulders.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in Senator Quinlan's analysis of the economic position of CIE.  For my own part, I formed the opinion that I would support this Bill when I read recently the very lucid statement made by the Chairman, Dr. Andrews, entitled, I think, <i>The Future of CIE.</i> I read that with great interest and I thought it gave a very forward-looking, constructive picture of the whole enterprise.  It gave a sense of leadership, a sense of confidence which I had not seen in any statements about this concern before.  It encouraged me greatly and I felt that having read that statement I should do anything I could to give further encouragement in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an honest statement because the Chairman referred to the difficulty, which has just been mentioned, of wage <Col N="1056" /> increases.  The biggest burden of that has not been revealed in the report which Senator Quinlan has analysed. That has to come in the present year and the situation which seemed so rosy just recently will not be so rosy at the end of this year, as we understand from this statement.  Therefore, on account of the terrific effort that has been made in this company and on account of the impression I have received for the first time that they are really tackling this almost impossible situation, I should like to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is the right moment to engage in a full-scale analysis of the position of CIE, which I could well do, and to give a detailed account of all the tremendous and fundamental changes that have taken place in the operative organisation of the company concerning which I have had full particulars from the Chairman.  Neither do I think this is a suitable occasion on which to outline again in detail how these changes will eventually affect favourably the financial fortunes of the company.  Therefore, in order to keep the debate within the confines of the Bill, I shall have to confine myself to a few points that were made by various Senators on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes suggested that we indulged in violent criticism at the time of the general election and asked, therefore, if we attack another Party during a general election, why should there not be an attack on the Chairman and Board of CIE?  I do not see how the two things could be the same.  I have no objection to the cut and thrust of politics.  I am prepared to experience that at all times but as I have complete responsibility for the general conduct of CIE in respect of legislation enacted in this House, as I review constantly the effect of all legislation in relation to State companies and as I meet the chairmen of the boards of these State companies at frequent intervals in order to discuss with them their operations in relation to general Government policy, their intentions to borrow, the increase in efficiency they can bring about and their part in the growth of the economy, I <Col N="1057" /> should like attacks made by Deputies or Senators on the general working of any State company to be directed against me and not against the chairmen or directors of State companies who themselves are unable to answer in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil and as I should like to repeat here, there has been a very good tradition in regard to that over the years, with some few unfortunate exceptions.  Let us forget the exceptions and keep to the tradition. A Minister can always be challenged in the Dáil or the Seanad to consider the general efficiency of a State company and to consider his part in the direction of that State company, and that seems to me the best way to do it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear the members of this House, either directly or by implication, praise the work of the present Chairman of the Board of CIE. Virtually everybody who spoke here today reversed the most unfortunate situation which arose in the Dáil where, by implication, these men were not doing well and not trying to help the country in their efforts.  I am glad therefore to hear this praise being given, although it was given with reservations in certain cases.  Nevertheless, we have here a much better atmosphere in regard to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know how I can deal with the powers of the Oireachtas in relation to State companies except very briefly to refer Senator Hayes to the statement made by the Taoiseach to the Institute of Public Administration on the relation of State companies to the Government, to Ministers and to the Oireachtas.  What he said there is to be recommended as the answer to the question as to whether the Oireachtas should have more power.  This is a matter which has been discussed in many countries and by people of both the socialist and capitalist hue of politics.  People have very widely divergent views on the subject but my own feeling is purely pragmatic in character.  On the whole, our State companies have done very well and I cannot see the necessity at the moment for any drastic change in the procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> I was delighted myself when the Taoiseach suggested that if Deputies wished to discuss the affairs of a particular State company in considerable detail, an occasion could be made available by a resolution asking to discuss the annual report of the company being moved by any Deputy.  That has already been done in the case of CIE and there was a very prolonged discussion in which I gave a great deal of detailed information on the general position of CIE, quite enough for the purposes of the debate.  If, on the occasion of any debate of that kind, allegations of a really serious character, with factual evidence, were made, or if statements made responsibly by Opposition Deputies or Deputies of any Party reflected on the general efficiency of the Board or the character of its policy, any Government in office would be almost compelled to institute some kind of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, this agreement by the Taoiseach to accept resolutions of that kind offers a very good solution for the problem of enabling the Oireachtas to discuss in more detail the operations of a particular company. Of course, in the ultimate, the Oireachtas have set up commissions of inquiry into the working of boards and State companies and the whole of the present legislation is based on one of the finest reports ever presented to the Oireachtas&mdash;the report of the Committee on Internal Transport which led to the 1958 Act.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words here about the contract between CIE and General Motors.  I naturally consulted the Minister for Finance in respect to this contract and it would be setting a most undesirable precedent if I gave any kind of a disclosure of the character of this contract and entered into the question of the agent and his commission. The agent of General Motors is very well known to everybody in this country.  As I said, it would be setting a precedent by which every contract between any State company and their suppliers could be questioned by Deputies and Senators and it would tend to set up large-scale political interference which would be wholly undesirable.  It is perfectly obvious that if I were to schedule this <Col N="1059" /> particular contract, members of either House could in future raise all sorts of questions about contracts, whether the lowest tenders were accepted by the ESB and by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and you would get the growth of pressure lobbies introduced into the debates on the affairs of these companies.</P>
    <P>We are all human beings in respect to those sort of things and there has been a tradition since the inception of Parliament that the proper thing to do is to appoint a first-class board, to provide legislation of the right kind, to insist on the presentation of full annual reports by these companies, to regard the efficiency of the board as the index by which a company is judged and to leave the carrying out of the day-to-day operations to the board without any political interference. I feel quite sure that any Government which might succeed ours will never take steps to publish individual contracts of State companies. If I felt there was a necessity to do that, what I should do would be to ask for the resignation of the chairman of the board or to undertake the institution of a committee of inquiry into the workings of the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan touched briefly on the policy of CIE, which in fact is based on the 1958 Act, in relation to the social and economic patterns of this country.  I do not want to delay the proceedings by going far beyond the ambit of the Bill now before the House except to assure Senator Quinlan that we have made a very detailed study of the Beddy Committee Report and its consequential effects in relation to the CIE decision to close branch lines.</P>
    <P>The study has been based on various assumptions regarding the social and economic state of this country and I can assure the Senator that, having made a comparison between this country and others in relation to congestion, or absence of congestion, of population, in respect to the movement of goods, the availability of roads, the lack of congestion on roads outside the immediate city areas, even if there were a very starting increase in population&mdash;say <Col N="1060" /> 50 per cent.&mdash;in the areas where the lines have been closed and a starting increase which I hope will take place in economic activity, I have no fear that the closing of branch lines closed up to now would seriously affect the economy of the country or create serious problems which would be better solved by allowing trains to run virtually empty over the years until the population increased.  The Netherlands have 11.5 million people and 2,030 miles of line.  In this country, there are 1,564 miles of line and we have 2.8 million of a population which shows there are very wide disparities.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan also made some observations on the character of the CIE report.  I cannot understand the Senator on this.  He said information was lacking in the report and then proceeded to give the information.  I can only tell the House that the accounts were properly audited, that the public in general do understand them and do know that there has been an improvement in the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement was that there was much more information in the older accounts than in the present ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator went far beyond that.  He suggested that the reduction in the loss had been somehow caused by chance happenings in the life of CIE.  I can assure the House that as a result of dieselisation and a growth in the volume of road freight by 50 per cent. since 1957-58, plus a slight increase in the volume of rail freight since that time, and as a result of increasing the output of various sections of the services, of introducing work study and effecting increases in output in the maintenance of diesel engines and wagons, there has been a genuine improvement.  I can <Col N="1061" /> say further that if the 1958 Act had not been passed and if there had not been dieselisation and a full programme of reorganisation, the loss in the year just expired would have been well over £3 million and we would have a much more serious problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Cole asked about the financial advantage of this method of financing the purchase of the diesel locomotives.  I would say there are two advantages.  First, the rate of interest is somewhat less than would have to be provided if CIE had to secure the money by way of public issue and if the public issue were not fully subscribed partly due to the unfair criticisms of people who should know better; and secondly, the Government encourages foreign investment here for production purposes because of the very heavy capital programme in general that has to be undertaken and the still heavier capital investment that will be required to help us to meet our commitments in the foreign market. This type of transaction of entering into a hire-purchase arrangement with a foreign bank we regard as very favourable to a country still in the process of economic development as we are.</P>
      <P>I think I have answered the major points without engaging in far more widespread controversy than would be justified in the case of this Bill.  I should say, in conclusion, that CIE reckon that diesel engines cost to run, including all items, about one-third of what steam engines cost and that the financing of this purchase is a real help towards the economic position of CIE.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that the guarantee was for a hire-purchase arrangement with a foreign bank and that this apparently was very advantageous.  Less than two years ago, we passed a Bill here to make us members of the World Bank and at that stage we felt that for foreign borrowing, a world bank had great advantages for us.  I should like the Minister's comment as to whether the World Bank could have been used in this situation?</P>

      <P>As far as I know, this transaction was effected by the American Import-Export Bank authority and I do not think the World Bank would have been interested in a proposition of this kind.  I have no knowledge of it.  We were glad to accept the proposition as made to us by CIE in regard to this transaction and there was no point in finding out whether some other banking institution would have served us equally well because the General Motors corporation and, indeed, American exporters in general, in the ordinary way, work through this bank.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) to authorise the increase to £135 million of the existing statutory limit of £120 million on capital expenditure which the Electricity Supply Board may incur for general purposes, that is to say, exclusive of capital expenditure on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
      <P>(2) to authorise the increase to £37 million of the present statutory limit of £32 million on the expenditure which the Board may incur on the electrification of rural areas.</P>
      <P>(3) to provide statutory authority for the payment of increased subsidy for rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1961, authorised the E.S.B. to incur capital expenditure for general purposes up to a total of £120 million, that is, an increase of £20 million on the then existing statutory limit of £100 million. The Board's generating plant programme announced early in 1960 was based on an estimated rate of growth in the demand for electricity of 7 per cent. per annum and provided for the <Col N="1065" /> raising of the Board's generating capacity to 1,148 megawatts by 1968-69.  The Board subsequently found it necessary to accelerate this programme because of the continued increase in the rate of growth in demand for electricity.  The rate of increase over the previous year during each of the last three years was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1959/60, 10.4 per cent.; 1960/61, 7.9 per cent.; 1961/62, 8.4 per cent. The present total installed generating capacity of the Board is 723.5 megawatts; this includes 90 megawatts of old plant at the Pigeon House now available only for stand-by purposes and the four small turf fired stations on the western seaboard representing 20 megawatts.  Under the revised programme, total capacity would be increased to 1,109.5 megawatts by 1966-67.  The decision to accelerate the generating plant programme was indicated by the need to avoid power cuts, particularly for industrial uses.</P>
    <P>The Board recently reported to me that on the assumption of an estimated annual growth of at least 8 per cent. in the demand for electricity over the next five years, and taking account of plant retirals in the meantime, it will be necessary to provide further new generating capacity in 1967-68 in addition to the capacity in the programme already approved.  The Board propose to provide a coal or oil station of two 60-megawatt sets in the Waterford region, the first to be commissioned in the autumn of 1967 and the second in the summer of 1968.  The target for 1968 is therefore now raised to 1,229.5 megawatts excluding retirals. As it takes over five years from the time of the decision to build before a generating station can be commissioned, it will be necessary for the Board to enter into commitments for the Waterford station in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The Board's expenditure and commitments for general capital purposes to 31st March, 1962, amounted to £119 million.  The Board's capital expenditure for general purposes at that date amounted to about £84 million and work in progress or work approved represented about £35 million. <Col N="1066" /> The addition of the projected new station at Waterford, estimated to cost £7.8 million, to the Board's existing programme would therefore raise the total of their approvals above the statutory limit of £120 million on capital expenditure for general purposes. In addition, over the next two years it will be necessary for the Board to authorise capital expenditure on transmission and distribution systems and on buildings to the extent of about £7 million.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the raising to £135 million of the existing statutory limit of £120 million on the Board's capital expenditure for general purposes which on the basis of present estimates should be sufficient to cover expenditure likely to be authorised during the next two years or so.</P>
    <P>The installed capacity for hydroelectric plant at 31st March, 1962, was 219 megawatts.  All the important rivers have now been harnessed for electricity generation.  While the development of other rivers would in present circumstances be uneconomic, the Board are continuing to collect data and investigate other rivers with a view to possible development later for hydro-generation.</P>
    <P>The Board's generating programme provides for the absorption by 1968 of the annual output of all the bogs which are at present considered economically usuable for the generation of electricity. This will mean an increase of 202.5 megawatts on the Board's existing peat fired generating capacity of 205 megawatts.  The programme provides that coal-oil-fired stations will be sandwiched between peat-fired stations so as to ensure maintenance of electricity supply in a year in which weather conditions would be very adverse for either peat or hydro-generation of electricity or both.  To ensure continuity of bog development and employment by Bord na Móna, the coal-oil stations will be used only to the extent that hydro and peat generation will be insufficient to meet demand.</P>
    <P>The investigation into the possibility of utilising deposits of low-grade semi-bituminous coal at Arigna in an additional electricity generating unit is <Col N="1067" /> still in progress.  It has been established that there are sufficient reserves of lower ash content coal but before any decision could be taken in this matter it must be first established that the coal can be extracted economically on a regular basis over the life of a new station.  The necessary investigations are still proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Board experienced a record peak load in January this year when to meet a load of 606 megawatts the Board had in operation 40 out of the 44 generating sets in their system.  Two of the remaining four sets were out for overhaul and two small sets, one each at the North Wall and Poulaphouca, were standing by leaving the Board with just enough capacity in reserve to cover breakdown of the largest single generating unit in their system, which is 30 megawatts.  The system peak load of 606 megawatts experienced in January last, compared with peaks of 540 megawatts in December, 1960, and 476 megawatts in January, 1960.  The addition of the 40 megawatt Bellacorick station to the system later this year should help the Board to meet the peak loads next winter.</P>
    <P>From the end of the present decade onwards, the contribution made to electricity supply by native resources is bound to grow proportionately less.  The Electricity Supply Board are keeping in touch with the work being done in various parts of the world in the application of nuclear energy to the production of electricity.  It is clear so far that conventional fuels are cheaper than nuclear power for electricity generation.  A nuclear station would not be commissioned in this country until the base load has increased to a point where a nuclear station of the minimum economic size could be given continuous night running of reasonable magnitude together with full load day operations.  It is not expected that this stage will be reached in this country for at least ten years and even then the choice of a nuclear station as against the conventional thermal station will still depend on the relative economics of the two types of stations.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Government recently decided that increased <Col N="1068" /> State assistance should be provided for the extension of rural electrification. Under the existing rural electrification scheme which was started in 1946 and is due to be completed this year, 775 out of a total of 792 rural areas will have qualified for development.  The remaining 17 areas failed to qualify under that scheme because the total fixed charge revenue from them would not have been sufficient to meet the minimum return on the capital cost of development required under the scheme.  These areas are mostly remote areas with low density of population and correspondingly higher costs of connection and low average return per house.  A special subsidy of £90,000 is now being provided under the Bill to meet the cost of the necessary &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; lines in these areas so as to enable them to be developed, and it is expected that as a result connection can be offered to about half of the estimated 6,000 dwellings in these areas at normal rates of fixed charge.  Other dwellings can, of course, obtain supply but they will be asked to pay some extra charge.</P>
    <P>The initial development of all the rural areas, including the 17 areas at present undeveloped, is designed to connect some 283,000 out of a total of 395,000 rural dwellings.  Of the total rural dwellings, some 269,000 or 68 per cent. will have been connected at standard rates of fixed charge compared with the target of 69 per cent. which was set when the rural electrification scheme was initiated in 1946. Some 112,000 rural dwellings throughout the country will still remain unconnected when the development of all the rural areas is completed.  The initial development scheme, on completion, is estimated to cost about £32 million, of which the E.S.B. will have contributed £25½ million approximately and the State £6½ million.</P>
    <P>The ESB are incurring very heavy annual losses on rural electrification despite the State subsidy towards the capital cost of rural electrification.  In recent years these losses have grown to around £700,000 and are expected to continue at a very heavy rate for some years thereafter, and, thence, to reduce gradually.  In order to avoid further <Col N="1069" /> increases in losses in rural electrification the ESB have been connecting houses for electricity on post-development only on the basis of a minimum return by way of fixed charge of 7.3 per cent. of the capital cost of connection, this being the economic return on the investment after taking account of the State subsidy of 50 per cent. of the cost of connection.  The return required by the Board for initial development has been 4.7 per cent. but even after taking account of the State subsidy this has been very uneconomic as can be seen from the losses of the Board on Rural Account.</P>
    <P>With a view to stimulating a more rapid rate of connection in the areas already developed the present Bill provides that over the next five years the existing subsidy of 50 per cent. in respect of connections in areas to which a supply has already been extended will be increased to 75 per cent. subject to a maximum of £75 per house.  The increased subsidy is designed to permit of about 77,000 of the 112,000 unconnected premises in rural areas being in a position to obtain the electricity at nominal rates of fixed charge.  About 23,000 premises would have to pay a special service charge but except in very few cases, the special charge will not add more than 50 per cent. to the normal fixed charge.  There will still remain some 12,000 households, mostly in remote areas, which could be offered electricity only at rather higher rates of fixed charge because of the very high cost of connecting such premises.  The average cost of connecting these premises would be about three times the average cost of connecting other premises and, in the circumstances, these householders are being offered, as an alternative, a subsidy of £10 per house to enable them to instal bottled gas.  The bottled gas subsidy will cover the cost of two full cylinders, two blanked-off points, a regulator and the necessary pipes.  A further announcement will be made in regard to this scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>Following on the provision of increased subsidy the ESB will adjust the charges of rural consumers who are already paying special service charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> Of the 15,000 rural consumers at present paying special service charges, some 3,000 will have these charges eliminated altogether and the charges in the case of the remaining 12,000 households will be reduced by about half.</P>
    <P>The ESB have reported that due to unforeseen circumstances such as severe storm damage there has been delay in completing the development of the economic areas but it is expected that all these areas will have been developed within a few months. The ESB will then start on the development of the 17 uneconomic areas and expect that work on most of these areas will have been completed before the middle of 1963, and that the development of the few remaining areas will be completed before the end of 1963.</P>
    <P>Most other European countries had made considerable progress with rural electrification before our rural electrification scheme was started in 1946.  The provision of rural electrification in these countries did not, however, present the same problems as in this country because most of their rural inhabitants live in villages and hamlets thus making connections easier and cheaper whilst in this country most rural dwellers live in scattered farmsteads thus adding to difficulty and cost of connection.  When these factors and also the differences in social and economic conditions are taken into account this country's rural electrification scheme is a note-worthy achievement.</P>
    <P>Senators are well aware of the significant contribution which the ESB, the first of our semi-autonomous State sponsored bodies, has made to economic development and social well-being generally in our country in the 30 odd years of its existence.</P>
    <P>The proposals the subject of this Bill will enable the Board to continue the good work and I recommend it for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this Bill will be welcomed by every member of this House.  It can be welcomed on three quite separate counts.  In the first place, we can welcome this Bill <Col N="1071" /> because capital expenditure by the ESB will provide in the years immediately ahead the necessary foundation, the infra-structure, which is absolutely essential to any industrial development.  Therefore, this Bill will help industry in the years to come.</P>
      <P>In the second place, we can welcome this Bill because it contains several sections that enable the last lap effort to be made to bring rural electrification in this country as close to completion as we reasonably can expect it to be brought in this day and age.  This, again, is very welcome.  The electrification of rural Ireland was envisaged right from the beginning in the electrification of the country.  I think it is a happy thing that it should be brought to conclusion within the lifetime of many of those, technical and otherwise, who were concerned with the development of the Electricity Supply Board through its many years.</P>
      <P>There is a third reason why I think this Bill should be welcomed.  A notable section in the Bill contains a provision of £90,000 for the 17 uneconomic rural areas.  This is welcome. It reflects something which I think we should have a great deal more of, that is, a recognition that social and economic factors must both be brought into account in trading arrangements such as this but going beyond this and recognising that, if we are to be realistic and to understand what we are doing, social and economic costs should be separated in the analysis of such products.</P>
      <P>In the economic climate which we shall have either to suffer or enjoy in the years that are to come, it will be necessary that in all our projects, public and private, we should never forget social factors but equally necessary that we should never confuse social and economic factors.  The social factors should be there in the final decision to be made, particularly in the final decision to be made on matters of public importance, but, before making that decision and before seeing how much these social factors should weigh, these two factors must clearly be separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> I come now to the details of the proposals in the Bill.  The first thing which the Minister asks us to do is to extend the limit of capital expenditure allowed to the ESB from £120 million to £135 million.  As he mentioned on the Second Stage, in the 1961 Act, when the ESB commitments were at about £101 million, the Minister asked the Oireachtas to provide an increase from £100 million to £120 million on the ground that the ESB load was increasing and that their capital expenditure would increase at a rate of about seven per cent.</P>
    <P>With a growth rate of seven per cent., the Minister in the 1961 Act asked for an extension to £120 million, representing an increase of 20 per cent. in the capital provision for the ESB. He comes to us today and asks for a further approval.  At a time when it is anticipated, as he says, that the growth rate of the ESB system will, in the next few years, be at least eight per cent., the Minister asks us for £15 million extra, even though the ESB is now virtually on its limit of £120 million.</P>
    <P>The figure which the Minister is asking for today is one which is both absolutely and proportionately lower than the sum asked for in the 1961 Act.  Today, he is looking for £15 million on £120 million and previously he was looking for an increase of £20 million.  Earlier this afternoon, the Minister introduced a Bill in which he said no limit was being placed for the next few years on the amount of borrowing by CIE.</P>
    <P>When he was bringing this Bill through the Dáil and the Seanad, I think the Minister would have been very well advised to increase this particular sum.  If we take even the proportionate amount of 20 per cent. increase, I think the Minister could well have raised the borrowing power of the ESB to £145 million at the very lowest.  This would have saved him from continually having to come back in the near future.  We have had the 1961 Act and now we have this 1962 Bill.  I think the Minister has not allowed himself sufficient latitude in providing merely an extra £15 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> In speaking of the general extension of the ESB, the Minister made a reference to nuclear power being at least ten years away.  I should like to comment on the Minister's remarks in this connection.  It will generally be agreed that nuclear power should not be part of the ESB programme in the next five years, but we should not be too complacent in putting nuclear power completely off for five years and thinking that in five years' time, it will be time enough to start thinking about it. There is a need to look ahead so that we will not be caught unprepared when this development comes.  We must remember that there is always a possibility of a break-through occurring in the development of atomic power.</P>
    <P>Prior to this, the work on atomic reactors has been largely on reactors of the size of 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts which are far beyond the range we would require in this country, but there are indications that research and development in this field may now turn to smaller units and there may well be a quickening of development in this particular direction in order to serve undeveloped countries.  It may be that during the next few years we will get a technical or an economic break-through in regard to nuclear reactors of the size, say, of 100 megawatts.  If such a thing should occur, then the picture will be altered as far as power in this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this particular topic, the Minister mentioned that it was not envisaged that nuclear power should be brought in until it could have a full base load running at night and also a full day load.  Here again perhaps the thinking is a little restricted. I think that the development in other countries is rather in the direction that if we got a base load at night, there would be no necessity to look for complete full day running.  If the atomic power were completely integrated with pumped storage, the night load nuclear running could be used for pumping to elevated reservoirs and the power used in day-time in order to take the peak day load.  The probability is that in years ahead nuclear power will increase tremendously in importance.  Many <Col N="1074" /> experts have told us that hydro-power will still remain at about the same percentage of total power because pumped storage will become a natural accompaniment of nuclear power. While the Minister said, and it is a fact, that our major rivers have been developed there are sites which could be developed for pumped storage and which could be linked in with nuclear development.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing in this general direction which we should not neglect.  Various steps should be taken to ensure that physicists and engineers are trained and some of them trained intensively.  It is terribly important that some men should have an extremely intensive training.  As far as I know, no person from this country has yet been trained at any of the courses given at Oak Ridge or any of the American reactor schools.  In a sense, we have missed the bus in regard to several of these training courses because whereas training courses were available a few years ago, and persons from all over the world could go and take their training in the American schools such as Oak Ridge, the position now is that countries elsewhere in the world all have their own nuclear research reactors which they use for the purpose of training their physicists and engineers.  So much is that a fact that the courses at Oak Ridge and elsewhere have been discontinued.  Now we find ourselves in the position that we have no nuclear research reactor and we have no course to which we can send our people for training.  This is something which should not be forgotten because if we are caught unawares by these developments, time might be lost by the adaptation of the ESB system because power in the future is going to be largely based on nuclear power.</P>
    <P>Apart from this question of general training and the training of a few people intensively, it is necessary that our engineers in the ESB, and indeed, the administrative staff of the ESB, and people in the Minister's Department, should get some general training, some appreciation courses so that there will be a general diffusion of the new attitude which will be necessary when <Col N="1075" /> this revolution in power hits this country.</P>
    <P>To pass from something which may appear unrealistic at the moment, we can come back to earth on the question of rural electrification.  All of us welcome very much the decision to increase the subsidy from 50 per cent. to 75 per cent. in order to enable the ESB to finish the job they started. In welcoming what the Government have done, we should pay tribute to what the ESB have done.  The Minister gave us the figures for the division of the capital expenditure on the original rural electrification scheme.  The position is that three-quarters of this capital load was carried by the ESB and one-quarter by the State.  In the annual report just issued by the ESB, it states that the loss on rural electrification was £690,000 which is a tremendous loss, even for a body as big as the ESB, to be carrying year after year.</P>
    <P>The decision, therefore, of the Government is most welcome.  The Minister mentioned the 112,000 people not connected at the moment and said that 77,000 will be connected at normal rates and 23,000 at normal rates, plus a special charge of something about 50 per cent.  That is extremely good news indeed.  So, too, is the news of the special grant of £90,000 for the 17 uneconomic areas.  This grant, which is for the provision of the backbone lines in these areas, is something public representatives will welcome if only because of the fact that there must scarcely be a member of this House, or indeed of any county council, who must not be within the reach of one of the 17 uneconomic areas and subject to representations over the past few years in regard to their inclusion in the general ESB scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the recognition of the principle of separating the social and the economic elements here in these 17 areas which were, by the ESB yardstick, uneconomic, is very welcome.  The Government now come in with £90,000 and say: &ldquo;We will provide £90,000 as a contribution to the social value of electrifying these 17 areas&rdquo;, and the <Col N="1076" /> E.S.B. go ahead and make the economic contribution.  We have here a solution to a problem and the right approach to it.</P>
    <P>I should like to pass on from this question of recognising the separate social and economic costs to ask whether there are not some other parts of the ESB operations where this principle might not also be applied. For example, if we take the last annual report of the ESB, on page 38, we see in the final column the total cost per unit of power sent out.  Now these are figures which might be objected to, on the ground that they should be refined because the load factor is not the same in every case.  The figures by and large do represent true conditions. Let us look at the position of the four 5-megawatt stations on the western seaboard.  The cost per unit is 1.9 pence, whereas the cost in the other economic stations of the Board is something between 0.9 pence and 1.0 pence.  While the load factor is very low in these 5-megawatt stations, and it might be thought if they carried a greater load, they would be more economic, I think the very high probability is that their load factor is not due to their position in the system, or anything the E.S.B. do in their operations, but rather that the supply of turf in the immediate neighbourhood limits the amount of the load which can be carried by them. Therefore, we must take this cost of 1.9d. against the cost of possibly something like .9d. or 1d.</P>
    <P>That means that by generating power in these four stations along the western seaboard, the ESB is losing 1d. per unit which they would not lose if they generated the power in one of the more economic plants.  We all agree a reasonable social purpose is being served by the provision of these small stations which are fuelled by handwon turf, that a social purpose is being served by giving an outlet to the people in the immediate neighbourhood of these stations, but we should not ignore the fact that this social service is achieved at a cost which I calculate from the figures in the ESB report to be something over £200,000 a year.  In other words, <Col N="1077" /> by generating power here rather than elsewhere the ESB are being put to a cost of close on £250,000 per year for a social purpose.  Just as the Minister was correct in coming in on the 17 uneconomic areas in rural electrification, so, too, he would be justified in coming in on the Board's uneconomic generating plant, which is serving a social purpose also.  Here, too, a reasonable case can be made that the State should meet the costs of these particular plants in order to serve the social purpose for which they were set up.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I want to raise on this Bill.  In previous Electricity Supply (Amendment) Bills, the opportunity was taken to redress anomalies in the ESB code for the superannuation of their employees.  It is therefore a matter of very great regret that in this Bill the Minister has not taken the opportunity to remedy what is not only an anomaly but a glaring injustice in the present ESB superannuation code.  Many of the Board's servants of more than 20 or 30 years' service, who are now about 60 years of age, will suffer when they come to retirement, due to the particular way in which the ESB superannuation code came into being.  That code came into being in 1942.  The position is that persons of 40 years or over got their prior service but persons under 40 did not.  It is a matter for very great regret that the Minister did not in this Bill bring in legislation which would have remedied this injustice.</P>
    <P>The Board are perfectly agreeable that the amendment should be made. The employees all wish that the amendment be made.  The employees are willing to bear the cost on their own pension contributions of providing added years for this group of servants. I regret it is not in this Bill and I urge the Minister at the very earliest opportunity to give his consent in regard to this point, on which the Board and the employees of the Board are agreed. With the Minister's consent, this could easily be passed into law before these people, now 60 years of age, reach retirement.  Otherwise, people with the same service might get higher pensions <Col N="1078" /> based on 10 years or more extra service just because they happened to be six months older at the time the scheme came into force.</P>
    <P>In brief, I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have given.  I suggest to the Minister he might have increased the capital allowed the ESB to something above £145 million rather than the £135 million in the Bill.  I commend him on the provisions which enable the last lap of rural electrification to be completed and also on the decision in regard to the 17 uneconomic areas.  I ask him to consider very strongly the question that on the principle he used in finding a solution for these 17 uneconomic areas, he should seek a solution for the burden which lies on the ESB in regard to the four 5-megawatt handwon turf stations. Finally, I ask him if he would examine again the ESB superannuation code those who were just short of 40 years of age when the scheme came into force.</P>

      <P>We can all welcome this Bill as a routine Bill making the necessary provisions for the ESB for the next three to four years.  As such, it is in line with previous Bills that we have had.  I do not intend to speak for very long except to mention one or two points worthy of notice. First, we have the emphasis on rural and urban.  Naturally, we all welcome the encouragement being given to extending the rural electrification scheme still further, but I am not happy about this division between rural and urban.  I would not like to see this become a feature of ESB reports in the future.  If it is used simply as a means of getting an additional subsidy for apparently doing some uneconomic task for the rural people, there is a tendency then to do a costs analysis and to come up with certain figures. Any of us who have had any connection with cost accounting know how indeterminate most of the items are and how two different cost accountants will come up with two different figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why the rural section should be regarded as uneconomic; in other words, why there is any special privilege attaching to electricity that <Col N="1079" /> does not attach to other commodities. For instance, the rural population for years saw the cities with all the amenities they did not have.  Yet they paid the same rates and taxes that went to provide many of those amenities.  There was no question of any rebate to the rural people due to the fact that they did not have electricity when the people in the towns had it.  Take television at present.  They did not have television facilities when these were available in the towns.  Take the 101 other services which are available first to one section of the community and which take some time to find their way to the other sections.  We are all one people.</P>
    <P>I hope this division between rural and urban as far as costs are concerned will disappear from the ESB accounts in a very short time.  After all, one might even advance the case that the cost of electricity supplies depends on where the electricity comes from.  Senator Dooge made that point. Surely the people in the remote areas, especially in the western seaboard, and the towns in the midlands which have suffered so much from the flooding of the Shannon, might very legitimately lay claim to a first priority on the electricity produced from the water that caused such damage to them?  In other words, they might legitimately claim that they should get electricity at the cost of production per unit at Ardnacrusha.  As given here that is only .33 of 1d. per unit, or less than one-third of the national cost.  Calculated on that basis you would probably find that the cost per unit to the rural consumers would be below rather than far above the average.</P>
    <P>Again, if there is any question of subsidy, it is certainly more efficient that the ESB should be its own subsidising agent, striking a level tariff as against having to appeal to the Minister for certain subventions and the Minister, in turn, collecting this money from the taxpayer, bearing the resultant cost of collection.  We should get back to a uniform rate as quickly as we can.  From the point of view of the way in which rural electrification has been approached, and the difficulties <Col N="1080" /> associated with it, I admit there is a case for subsidies, but I do not think these subsidies should stop at any predetermined level, such as £75 per house connected.  I do not think one can actually measure a value like this in monetary terms.</P>
    <P>Many of the amenities of the countryside in relation to the town dweller are supplied by these people who stay in these out-of-the-way places, making them attractive in the summer months for holiday makers, and who have themselves to suffer living in them during the winter months.  Consequently, we should get away from producing figures which, at best, can be only very rough and arbitrary estimates of costings in regard to supplying a service to various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I should like to direct attention in these accounts of the ESB&mdash;this is a point to which I also directed attention twelve months ago&mdash;is this tendency on the part of the ESB to spread itself into retail and contracting business.  That is a very dangerous development.  It is one that could prove very unfair to private enterprise traders in these spheres.  The provision of appliances and repair facilities by the ESB could work out very unfairly and to the detriment of private enterprise traders.  In England great care is taken to ensure that a monopoly does not compete unfairly with private enterprise.  The equivalent body in England has its costings carefully checked by, I think, a Committee of the House to ensure that the costings are fully loaded and that they give no unfair advantage to the large public utility as against the small private trader.</P>
    <P>I know that traders here have grievances because of the ESB pushing into this field.  In Cork City one of the leading establishments in Patrick Street is now owned by the ESB.  It has been renovated at considerable cost.  I wonder was that necessary? Take the small towns.  The one I know best is Kilmallock.  Despite the fact that there are two local traders, the ESB have come in and put up their establishment; they are in the retail trade and in the contracting and <Col N="1081" /> repair business also.  I do not regard that as a desirable development.  I do not think it is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Electrical contractors in Cork City, and elsewhere, are greatly perturbed at having to compare with the ESB. They feel, rightly or wrongly, that the ESB do not carry their proper percentage of overheads.  At page 20, account No. 6, installations trading account for the year ending 31st March, 1962, we find that, while direct salaries and wages accounted for £43,000, the amount of overheads charged was just £21,997.  That figure strikes me as being rather low.  It is certainly one at which no private enterprise firm could compete; such a firm would have to charge higher overheads. I wonder is there any machinery for meeting these complaints by private enterprise in relation to these activities by the ESB.  Obviously, it would be neither right nor proper that they should be cut out of those fields.  The point is where does one draw the line or how does one ensure a correct balance?  That is just one of the many problems awaiting solution.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to add anything to what Senator Dooge has said in relation to atomic power except to stress the urgency of keeping abreast and ensuring that our leading engineers are given ample opportunity to keep up with developments abroad. That is one point.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the size of the stations.  At present they are very large, mainly in the 300 to 500 megawatt range.  I know many of those engaged in the distribution of electricity in England and elsewhere are now thinking in terms of a European network.  Such a network would enable the load factor to be considerably improved and the heights and hollows to be levelled out somewhat.  It is now a practical proposition to transmit electricity under the sea.</P>
    <P>We are faced with the prospect then that in a comparatively short time we may be able to get connected into the European grid.  If we do that, it may become a practical proposition for us to sell large quantities of electricity to Europe.  I know the siting of atomic <Col N="1082" /> power stations is causing great concern on the Continent because of the very high density of population.  It is felt by some that some of our more remote areas would afford excellent possibilities for the siting of large atomic energy power stations from which to transmit current to Europe. One of the diffculties would be, of course, the amount of capital involved and, from that point of view, I think the development is only likely to arise in connection with a general European development.  It could, however, become an important factor in relation to our entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I should like now to pay a very high tribute to the staff of the ESB especially the superb technicians.  I suggest to the Minister that there is in the ESB a pool of highly skilled technical talent that could be called on to man some of the new industries we wish to establish.  We have long looked for a large electronics industry. The ESB could, perhaps, provide the material to man such industries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, accepting it as marking the extension of the 17 per cent. rate.  That is something we all welcome.  It should be adequate.  Like Senator Dooge, I should like to see a little more discretion in the upper limit so as to provide for rather larger extensions when the Common Market comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill but I have a few reservations. First of all, I am very pleased to see that everything is being done to bring electricity into all rural homes.  I wonder if Senator Quinlan is aware that even in O'Brien's Bridge, which is only a few miles from the Shannon Scheme, it is only quite recently that electricity was installed there.  As the crow flies, it is only five or six miles. I should like to take the Senator into another portion of my country in the area of the Burren, where there is a sparse population.  Bringing electricity into the homes of these people is a wonderful thing, particularly into the farmsteads where it helps to eliminate slavery and drudgery of all kinds.  It helps to brighten up life for the housewife and for those on the farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> I have one little reservation but it is a very important one.  The ESB owe us in the Clare County Council an awful lot of money and they show no sign of paying it.  Mr. Seán O'Grady, when he was a Senator, raised this matter here before.  All the Shannon Scheme undertakings are derated in the county.  I take it that the Shannon Scheme is a national undertaking, the same as several other national undertakings.  It may have been justified in those early stages.</P>
    <P>The land right down into Whitegate and Portumna is all derated again, with the result that the gross poor law valuation is diminished.  When you diminish the poor law valuation, you must vastly increase the rates.  That happened some time ago.  I subscribe to the policy of giving these millions to the ESB but the Minister might consider the injustice which has been perpetrated on the local authority and his conscience might prick him.  As an act of retribution, the ESB might say to themselves: &ldquo;We owe these people a good deal of money and after 30 or 35 years, we should give them back something.&rdquo; All that land, all those houses, all those fisheries and everything else were derated in the county by the Shannon Scheme, while other national undertakings, such as Shannon Airport, pay rates to the local authority.  The ESB have got away with this for years.</P>
    <P>I would be lacking in my duty, as a representative of that county for over 37 years, if I did not call attention to that fact.  I have been a great advocate of the ESB ever since they started.  I said that current should be brought into the homes, the creameries and everywhere else&mdash;even to shave.  I helped them in every way I possibly could.  I hope that either the ESB or the Minister will say: &ldquo;Now that we have got so far and have almost brought electricity to everybody in the home, we ought to give back something to the Clare County Council of which we have deprived them for the past 35 years.&rdquo;  They have got away with murder.  Nobody else in the world could do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in <Col N="1084" /> the welcome extended to this Bill, particularly the provisions under which rural electrification will be speeded up but I am extremely disappointed that this objectionable special service charge is being retained in the Bill.  I do not know of any provision in the rural electrification scheme which is so unpopular or which annoys people so much as this provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that only 15,000 of these uneconomic homesteads have been connected under the Rural Electrification Scheme so far. I think that is correct.  If it is correct, it is evident to me that this provision is deterring a great number of people from availing of rural electricity.  The Minister said that of these 15,000 households, 3,000 will be relieved under the provisions of the Bill but 12,000 will continue to pay some special service charge.  Of those who have not yet been serviced, 23,000 households will be called upon to pay more than their neighbours&mdash;to pay a special service charge&mdash;and a further number of thousands will not be provided with electric current at all because they, unfortunately, reside in out of the way places.</P>
      <P>As I see it, when the scheme of electrifying rural Ireland was first introduced, it was accepted that it would be uneconomic.  It was accepted that it would have to be subsidised by the State.  I think the Government should at that time have gone the whole hog and said that they would provide electricity for those who wanted it in any area into which they went.  That would not have been unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge has drawn our attention to the fact that electricity is being generated from hand-won turf at a higher cost than it could be generated elsewhere, on the ground that it is providing much wanted employment in those areas.  I do not object to that; I think that is a good thing.  It is desirable to promote employment in these out of the way places but it is equally important, if not more important, to encourage people to continue to reside in backward places where they have been living for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I complained on the Central Fund Bill about the drift from rural <Col N="1085" /> Ireland, I was told it was something about which we could do nothing, that migration was something which was happening all over the world. Here is one way we can stop it.  We can give the unfortunate people in rural Ireland electricity at the same rate as their neighbours get it.  The Board must find that where current can be provided only on payment of a special service charge, the people are very slow to accept it.  I should be surprised if that is not the experience of the Board.  There are two reasons for that.  There is the economic reason that people are not prepared to pay more and there is the psychological reason that people are not prepared to pay more than their neighbours situate a very short distance away.</P>
    <P>A case can be made for giving people who live away from the main thoroughfare service at the expense of the State.  These people are contributing their fair share to trunk roads which they very seldom use.  They are contributing their fair share to the national television system of which they will not be able to avail at all as long as they cannot get electricity. They are, I am sure, contributing their fair share to the capital cost of the telephone system and, in one way and another, to various national services of which, because of their geographical situation, they themselves cannot avail.  Therefore it is not unreasonable to say these people should have service at the same rate as their neighbours.</P>
    <P>Somebody else made the point, which I thought was a very good one, that it is as important to keep the people there as it is to provide employment. If rural Ireland is to be denuded of its people, if they are not to be encouraged to stay there it is a very short distance until the people in the small villages and towns will follow. That is the only point I wish to make on the Bill at this stage but I do feel the Bill has been spoiled by the continuation of this special service charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree to some extent with Senator Fitzpatrick, who comes from a county similar to my <Col N="1086" /> own, with regard to remote rural areas at the same time, in common with other Senators, I welcome this Bill because I believe it will help to solve some of the problems that have arisen in my county and I might say in Senator Fitzpatrick's county as well.</P>
      <P>There are two areas, of which the Minister is aware, in which there has been recent agitation to have the supply extended but due to the cost it was not possible to get the necessary percentage of applicants.  We were told that new legislation would be introduced to enable the ESB to get some help in this regard.  I can assure the Minister that help has been very much welcomed.</P>
      <P>There is one matter about which the ESB should do something.  It is the case of a man who has been a consumer and who has bought property from somebody else who has not been a consumer, who refused to avail of the supply.  The man who was previously a consumer with the Board should not have to pay a service charge.  I have drawn this case to the attention of the Minister and it is one that should be considered very favourably by the ESB.  Senator Brady referred to people within earshot of Ardnacrusha not having light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I said they got it only recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, recently.  However, in my area there are people without electric light who are overlooking the source of the supply, Lough Allen, and they are hoping they will get it soon.  At this stage I should like to pay a tribute to the contribution which the ESB has made to the economy of my area.  As a result of the establishment of a power station in that area approximately 400 miners are in constant employment.  They are using the resources of the Arigna area and I am happy to note that following a recent survey there the prospects are good for the extension of that station or the provision of a new one.  I would ask the Minister to expedite such extension or the erection of a new station because I understand there are large reserves of coal which have been <Col N="1087" /> found suitable but that it is a question of designing a station to use them.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Brady I have my reservations in regard to the ESB.  I agree with Senator Quinlan that their function should be to provide power and light and that they should keep out of other businesses.  It is most unfair that they have the use of our national radio and television service to go into competition with traders throughout the country.  It is easy for them to compete because they can always float a loan and get the necessary money, whereas the ordinary trader is just trying to make ends meet from his own resources.  It is not my intention to be derogatory but the ESB should confine their activities to providing power and light.</P>
      <P>There is a further point I wish to make, if I am in order, seeing that the scope of the debate has been widened.  The time has come when the ESB should be relieved of its fisheries responsibilities.  That matter should be dealt with by people connected with fisheries such as the Inland Fisheries Trust who, to my mind, are doing a good job of work.  I am not saying the ESB have failed in regard to fisheries but again it is a question of confining their activities to providing power and light.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Quinlan, I wish to pay tribute to the members of the ESB with whom I am in constant contact.  While the general opinion may be that they operate autocratically, I cannot say that from my long experience.  I have found them most helpful.  When they are contacted by phone and told there is something to be done, it is attended to immediately. I wish to pay a personal tribute to the ESB in respect of the work that has been carried out by them and in respect of the contribution they have made to the economy of my part of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my support for this Bill which increases the facilities in regard to rural electrification.  While the Minister has no direct responsibility, I should like to make the point that school managers should avail themselves of electricity, <Col N="1088" /> which is now being extensively supplied throughout the country, to light and heat their schools in an effective way.  At the moment the heating of schools is almost a national disgrace.  School authorities could easily avail of this form of power for the purpose of thermal storage heating as a supplement to the heating system already in existence or as a complete substitute for inadequate methods of heating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this Bill, I should like to say I was very much impressed by Senator Dooge's speech. However, there was one point on which I cannot agree with him.  He suggested the Minister should come to us and ask to have the total expenditure of the ESB extended from <Col N="1089" /> £120,000,000 not to £135,000,000 but to £145,000,000.  It seems to me the Minister, in asking for an extension to the smaller sum, has given us an opportunity of debating the ESB, and when he comes to us again for more, as I feel certain he will, we will have a further opportunity of debating the ESB.  The Minister is to be commended for taking only one bite of the cherry at this stage so as to allow this matter to be debated.  It is extremely difficult for the Oireachtas to keep their eyes on State-controlled companies and the Minister here, in dealing with a comparatively small sum, does give that opportunity for discussion.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge dealt most impressively with the wider aspects of the ESB and their policy.  I should like to deal with a couple of rather minor points.  To my mind the ESB on the whole present a public image in a situation of some importance.  I was particularly impressed by the report of the extremely efficient way in which they were able to put all main lines back into commission after 48 hours following the storm last December. That was a very good advertisement of the efficient way in which they work.</P>
      <P>I should also like to pay a tribute to the manner in which they from time to time deal with specific problems. I had a problem only last Friday when a family I know range me up to say they had arrived from the North of Ireland at a house which had not been connected to electricity supply.  This was at about 5 p.m.  I was able to tell them which ESB branch to contact&mdash;in fact, it was Bray &mdash;and within a short time, a radio van was contacted, the connection was made and these people had electricity for the week-end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I must talk about the other side of the picture.  Senators Quinlan and Mooney deplored the fact that the ESB engaged in the retail trade and the maintenance trade in competition with private traders. I think that is a pity and I should like the Minister to look at what seems to me to be the autocratic method of the ESB in a number of instances in which they use their <Col N="1090" /> monopoly position extremely unfairly in matters of trading policy.  The first is a case in which a private trading company may be in certain trading difficulties.  There is a debenture holder who tries to protect his interests by putting in a receiver.  I am talking in terms of a receivership and not liquidation.  This is a company which is in difficulties, which will quite obviously recover.  The receiver has one interest, to protect his debenture holder.  His debenture holder is secured but anybody else owed money by that company is an unsecured creditor.</P>
    <P>There is no law in this country whereby the ESB becomes a secured creditor.  However, the ESB, by what I can only describe as a most autocratic method, make themselves a secured creditor in a receivership. When the receiver goes in, he sees that money is paid to his debenture holder.  The other traders must divide what is left.  If the receiver goes out and the company is forced into liquidation they may get a shilling in the £, or 5/- or 10/- in the £, but they will get only a small proportionate amount.  The attitude of the ESB is such that in those circumstances the local manager gets on to the receiver and says: &ldquo;If I am not paid in full, I will cut off supplies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course he is paid in full because the supply of electricity is vital to the future of that company.  In that way, the ESB become, in effect, a secured creditor and are paid before any other trading creditor.  To my mind, that is completely unfair.  What the ESB should do is to rank as an ordinary unsecured creditor just like any other trader and if the ESB wish to continue to supply that company as they should do, they would be perfectly in order in asking for a deposit of a substantial sum to cover the provision of electricity for three or four months, as the case may be.  By the present method, they are forcing the receiver to pay them in full, to the detriment of other traders, which is unfair.</P>
    <P>The other point which I wish to raise in this connection of the autocratic methods of the ESB is a very simple one and affects the individual. Senator Dooge talked of the ESB <Col N="1091" /> concern for a social purpose on a wide scale but they do not always seem to have concern for a social purpose on a narrow scale.  I do not know of any trader who, when he is owed a debt, does not send a demand for it before he takes some action.  If the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not paid their bill, they write a letter to you, a stereotyped form which states that if payment is not made within seven days, the service will be cut off.  Not so the ESB.  The ESB send their bill and if, after a certain period, that bill is not paid, a man arrives to cut off your supply.  That is done unless a great deal of fuss is made by somebody, some power or authority able to defend itself.  Payment of some nominal sum then has to be made in order to have the supply reconnected.  That, in the case of people who may have genuinely made a mistake for some reason or other, is completely unfair because it is not so much the cost of the reconnection that is at stake as the tremendous inconvenience caused, say, to a mother with school children whose supply for cooking is cut off without notice.</P>
    <P>I should like to leave these two examples of the autocratic behaviour of the ESB with the Minister and ask him to consider raising them with the appropriate departments of the ESB so that that body can put itself in an ordinary fair trading position, as would any other company.</P>

      <P>I subscribe to the sentiments expressed by other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  My welcome is all the greater since the Bill has attempted to rectify the very difficult situation by which the special charges added to the fixed charges in the case of uneconomic pockets of countryside, made it impossible for the Board to supply on what would be normal terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators said they were quite disappointed that the principle of the fixed charge was not removed and I am somewhat disappointed that these charges have not been levelled up to a greater extent.  I have always felt that the system which the ESB <Col N="1092" /> employed in calculating the original flat charges could have been so devised that a little extra would have been added to the ordinary charges in order to offset the special charges such as would arise from connecting uneconomic areas.  It is hard to understand why the ESB adopted that form of calculation but I suppose it is rather late in the day to expect them to change it now.</P>

      <P>As we stand at the moment, the Minister's statement is somewhat encouraging for quite a large number of victims in regard to these fixed charges.  As I understand it, the Minister said there would be a reassessment of the whole fixed charge system and that adjustment would be made with retrospective effect whereever these extra charges were applied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at this matter as it has happened in thousands of cases which he told us about here in which fixed charges had to be applied and the people concerned had no alternative but to accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going into new arrangements now and areas developed with the assistance provided by this subsidy which the Minister is now proposing to allocate, over £90,000, will avoid the special charges that have been applied to similar areas that have already been done.  Surely the Minister will look into that point and arrange with the ESB that where special charges are already applicable, some part of this subsidy may be allocated with a view to relieving <Col N="1093" /> those cases?  It would be quite inequitable if any other course were adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that 17 areas will qualify for this new subsidy.  I take it that those are areas which have hitherto not been developed in whole or in part, that they are new areas and that it is possible to undertake development now only because the new subsidy is available.  The people who suffered these additional surcharges are people who in many cases have been looking forward for a number of years to some relief such as is given under this Bill.  Quite a number of them, I think, would never have agreed to connect at all but that they had been living in hopes that some additional subsidy would be introduced which would enable the ESB to lighten the burden placed on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the subsidy which it is proposed to give in very isolated cases for bottled gas. Those living in the most isolated parts who could not reasonably expect to get an electricity supply will certainly be thankful for that subsidy but at its best, while gas is a big improvement on the traditional paraffin and turf used for lighting and heating in those areas, the ESB should be asked not to turn down any application where a number of householders are on the borderline between entirely uneconomic and partly economic.  Gas, in my opinion, is not as acceptable to the ordinary householder as electricity. Only in cases of extreme hardship would gas be accepted as a fair substitute. The answer to this problem is for the Minister to make the subsidy somewhat optional: in other words, if the householder who would qualify for the subsidy under the bottled gas scheme is in a position to pay the difference between the subsidy and what the ESB would require, he should get the benefit.  If he is prepared to make up the difference, I think he should have the advantage of getting electricity.</P>
    <P>I should like to register my disapproval of certain trading practices of the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before business was suspended, I was dealing with the question which has been raised here in connection with the ESB going into other lines of business in the commercial field.  I said I disapproved of that form of activity, as did other Senators.  A concern such as the ESB which are a monopoly, in the first instance, and are subsidised in quite a number of ways by the State, in the second instance, should confine themselves to the production and distribution of electricity and should be rather limited in the matter of the supply of accessories and appliances.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that private enterprise could do a good job in the matter of electricity installation and the provision of appliances and accessories. Perhaps they could do a better job in some instances than a monopoly.  That is my main reason for saying that I disapprove of the ESB going too far afield in activities of that kind.  They have an advantage over private enterprise in so far as they can give unlimited credit facilities. With the large revenue the Board enjoy, they are in the position of having substantial liquid reserves and they can give very favourable terms of hire purchase or easy payments, as the case may be, which no private concern could possibly manage to give.  Quite a lot of disapproval of the matter to which I am referring has been expressed from time to time by public bodies and it would be well if the Minister had a look at the matter and suggested to the Board that they might curtail their activities in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collection of accounts has been mentioned and the dictatorial manner in which the Board set out to cut off supplies when accounts are not paid. There have been, perhaps, exaggerated statements in that connection.  If I am correct in assuming that the policy of the Board is to issue the account at regular intervals and then, without further reminder, to deprive a supply of electricity if the account is not paid within a certain period, I <Col N="1095" /> feel such action is entirely unwarranted.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a monopoly but they should conduct their business affairs with the public on ordinary business lines.  Those of us who are engaged in business would not be long in our particular line if we were to demand payment and then to refuse to supply a service if the payment were not made within a short period.  Drastic action might be quite justifiable in the case of consumers who persist in delaying payment on every occasion when it is due&mdash;I refer to old offenders.  When, however, it comes to customers who have been good payers the Board should relax their attitude somewhat in that matter, and should endeavour to contact the consumer personally through the local representative or on the telephone and give a further reminder that the supply may be cut off within so many days, if payment is not made.  Generally, if people are dealt with in that way, it will save a lot of inconvenience to the consumer and to the Board and, in the long run, there will be better relations between both parties.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister in relation to the subsidy which he proposes to introduce.  If it covers only those areas not yet developed, I think it most unfair to the areas which have been developed and where additional charges were imposed in the cases referred to here.  I said to the Minister earlier that this matter should be looked into and dealt with retrospectively. Perhaps &ldquo;retrospectively&rdquo; was not the appropriate word.  I did not intend that the Minister should go back to the date of the original contract and remit the surcharge from that time.  My suggestion was that such cases in the developed areas similar to those now in the areas to be developed which the subsidy is supposed to cover, should be reassessed. The special service charge in those cases should be reviewed.  The subsidy should apply so that the ESB would be able to remit the charges where applicable, thereby having a system of standard based fixed charge <Col N="1096" /> plus special service charge or surcharge as on the same basis where it has to be imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the House for the friendly way in which they have received the terms of this Bill.  I shall deal as briefly as I can with the points raised by various Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge made a very able speech in praise of the general terms of the Bill.  He gave a very full account of the position of the ESB.  He suggested that CIE borrowing powers are not limited in some way.  In fact, they are very limited.  The amount of borrowing by CIE is now being fully taken up.  Therefore, there is no difference between the rules in regard to placing a limit on borrowings of the ESB and of CIE.  The principle is the same.  There is a maximum which is examined from time to time and new legislation is introduced into the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>If the ESB needs more capital I shall have to come back again to the Oireachtas to secure additional amounts.  Senator Dooge need have no worry about that matter.  He also spoke at length on the question of nuclear energy.  I am assured by the ESB that they have people observing developments.  I have made it quite clear to them that the moment anything emerges from the research now being taken to suggest that small units could be economic it should immediately be considered by the ESB in relation to future plans, after the whole of our native resources have fully been exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made observations on the accounts of the ESB.  I am afraid I am in total and absolute disagreement with everything he said. The loss made on rural electrification account will be made clear to the public of this country as also the assistance given by cross-subsidisation within the ESB system by the urban consumer.  I have no intention of allowing the ESB to alter the character of the accounts they give or to coalesce the two accounts.  If Senator Quinlan wants to see an account without cross-subsidisation in it, he might <Col N="1097" /> look at account No. 8 of the General Account of the ESB.</P>
    <P>Senator Moloney suggested that the ESB is subsidised.  I want to make it quite clear that when I refer to a subsidy, I refer to a capital grant by the State towards the improvement of the system.  Thank heavens, there is no current operating subsidy by the taxpayer to the ESB.  As long as I am in charge of the Department of Transport and Power, that will be done only over my dead body.  I think the idea of the consumer as a taxpayer paying money out of one pocket in order to take it back again in the form of some cheaper charge from the ESB is utterly ludicrous.  The ESB is a magnificently run institution and one of the reasons is that it has to pay its way and it has to pay back the State and the public for the capital it borrows.  Long may that position continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the sale of equipment by the ESB and Senator Moloney also referred to that matter.  I should say that I have received no complaint of importance that the ESB undercut private traders in any way.  I myself think that the publicity of the ESB for the sale of equipment assists not only them but other traders.  I believe advertising by one firm assists advertising for other firms indirectly.  One can give the famous example of the Old Gold cigarettes which were put on the American market and an enormous advertising campaign undertaken.  The sales of other cigarettes as well as those of Old Gold cigarettes started to increase while the major campaign was on at a greater rate than the normal increase when the special advertising appropriation ceased.  Then the increase in the sale of cigarettes in general went back to the normal increase.  The ESB have a very good function in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should say that the ESB offer to approved agents the same hire purchase facilities in the nature of payments at the time of paying the ESB account as it offers to its own consumers. That is an immediate valuable aid.  The agents have to be approved by the ESB.  They do not <Col N="1098" /> offer these facilities to everybody who sells electrical equipment but only to those who are likely to do well and whose financial position is sound and who have the right ideas, so that the well-qualified agent for electrical equipment is not placed at a disadvantage by the fact that the ESB have immense credit facilities, as undoubtedly they do have.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan concluded by, as usual, challenging the auditors of the ESB by suggesting there was some thing wrong about the Board's equipment account.  I have nothing more to say on that other than to express full confidence in the auditors for the ESB and in the Board in the proper presentation of their accounts.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady referred to the fact that the ESB do not pay rates.  I do not intend to do anything about that at the moment.  There again if any change were made, it could result only in someone paying for the rates of the ESB.  If they started to pay rates, it would alter their financial position.  There have been some protests, but not in very large measure, in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick posed the question of why we could not make a complete job of rural electrification by enabling the ESB to offer everyone a connection without any extra charge whatever.  I am afraid that would be really impracticable.  There are only a few thousand people involved and it would cause the total amount of capital required to leap up by roughly £5 million for the whole capital operation.  The State subsidy would increase by £5 million; it would nearly double itself.  The result would be that the total extra costs involved on the consumers, either directly paying extra taxation to cover this capital cost, or through paying more for ESB current, would amount to £8 million a year.  I do not think that is possible under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The main point about it is that the number of persons who will have to pay a high extra charge will be very small in comparison with the enormous extra cost to the ESB.  We chose the most equitable proposal out <Col N="1099" /> of a number of different proposals in relation to the subsidy and which seemed to us to be the best and the fairest in all circumstances.  I would remind the House that there are 77,000 people who can be connected without any extra service charge and there are 23,000 who will have to pay up to 50 per cent. extra charge, many of whom will have to pay only a very small additional amount.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House by giving strings of figures but I can assure the House that for the average small farm with a valuation of £8 to £15, or the county council cottage, to pay another 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. on the standard service charge under prevailing circumstances is not a great hardship.  Because we have the 75 per cent. subsidy proposal in this Bill, there will be nobody who will be required to pay 50 per cent. to 100 per cent. extra charge, or very few. There are just 12,000 who will be required to pay 100 per cent. or more and to whom we offer the bottled gas subsidy.  If these people chose to pay the extra charge, they can get current and if they secure bottled gas and if their circumstances improve they can still get current, if they pay back the £10 subsidy for the installation of the bottled gas.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to the general position of the rural population. I should tell the House that the rates charged for electricity in the rural areas compare quite favourably with the rates charged in a very great number of areas to farmers in Great Britain.  They compare favourably even if you take the allowances for the very heavy subsidy for agricultural production in Great Britain as compared with here.  I do not want to go into figures but the House can accept my word that the difference is quite substantially in favour of the ESB even after making allowance for the heavy subsidy for English farmers.  I refer to the farmer with the small farm of from ten to 40 acres.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to tell the Senator that the more current consumed in the rural areas, the better will be the <Col N="1100" /> position of the ESB financially.  It is hoped, with the growth of the agricultural economy, that the loss on rural account may diminish at a faster rate than now appears to be the case. There is one very hopeful sign but which is not of great magnitude.  There has been a very big increase recently in the sale of electrically-powered farm machinery during the past two years which I hope will continue.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear to the House that the capital subsidies we are providing will involve the taxpayer in a considerable extra impost over the years.  This year, for example, the Vote in my Department for the sum required to finance the Minister for Finance, who makes the advances for rural electrification, is a sum of £284,000.  If this Bill passes the Seanad and comes into law, next year&mdash;these are approximate figures&mdash;there will be an additional sum immediately of £60,000.  That will rise by £36,000 per year over a period of 14 or 15 years, until this additional sum reaches the total figure of some £570,000 a year.  It will then remain at that figure for about 10 years and slowly diminish. There is quite a considerable amount of taxation already imposed on the taxpayer in order to finance this capital subsidy.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the ESB control of fisheries.  The ESB have power under present legislation to lease part of their fisheries to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Although the fishery side of the ESB is now supervised by the Minister for Lands, as far as I know, fairly happy relations exist between the ESB and the Trust.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan made some observations in regard to household appliances and suggested that more vacuum cleaners should be used.  All I can tell him is that the number of vacuum cleaners used increased by 20.8 per cent. from 1959 to 1961.  That was a satisfactory growth in the sale of this very useful equipment.  He might equally be interested to know that the number of electric blankets sold increased by over 50 per cent. in recent years.  The public, therefore, are becoming acquainted with the <Col N="1101" /> various uses of electricity for domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>Referring to the use of electrically-run farm machinery, in the last two full years, the sale of a number of water pumps increased by 40.7 per cent.; grain-dryers by 42 per cent.; Burco boilers, 19 per cent.; elevators, 38 per cent.  Although the actual numbers in use are not great, it shows a very lively attitude on the part of farmers, or at least a good many of them, towards the advantages of electricity.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the actions of the ESB in cases where there were proceedings to recover costs in respect of companies going through a difficult phase of their activities. My answer is that the other traders would do what the ESB do if they could.  I do not think there is anything else I can say about it, except I should make it clear I would not like the public to feel that any State company was going to be precluded from taking the maximum action it could to safeguard its financial position.  If we were to start that, it would create conditions when political pressure would make it impossible for these companies to function in a truly commercial manner and, in the long run, the taxpayers themselves would be the sufferers.  The whole administration of these companies would tend to decline, directors would cease being serious about running the company with the maximum efficiency and, in the end, the public are the people who would suffer in that they would be paying more and more for the services offered.</P>
    <P>Senator Moloney suggested that in the financing of rural electrification, it might be possible for one group of the community to subsidise other groups less well circumstanced even to a greater extent than they do at present.  I should explain to the House that the methods of calculating the amount of ground rent are fairly complicated. It would take me at least 20 minutes to give a full, detailed description.  Very briefly, at the moment amongst those who pay no extra service charge there are, mercifully, a very considerable number <Col N="1102" /> whose service charge actually provides a surplus to the ESB in relation to the interest on the capital charge for the installation plus the depreciation plus the cost of maintenance of the installation.  That surplus goes to increase the number of people who can be connected without paying an extra service charge.  If it were not for that group of people within that particular category of persons, it would be impossible to give, for example, those 77,000 people connections at the normal service charge under the terms of this Bill.  They would be fewer in number if there were not a considerable group who are actually going to afford a surplus and who can well afford a surplus.</P>
    <P>Senator Moloney also asked about this question of the number of persons paying additional service charges.  I want to repeat that from the enactment of this Bill those subscribers to the ESB will be placed in exactly the same position as those who are now going to be connected.  Three thousand out of 15,000 pay no extra service charge.  The remainder will pay something less than half or about half as much again.  But all of them will be in the same position.  Of course, as Senator Moloney himself admitted, that cannot be done retrospectively. Nobody needs to feel any sense of injustice in respect to his service charge because the whole of these 15,000 people will be placed in a position which corresponds to that of those now being connected in relation to their service charge.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross and Senator Moloney raised the question of the arrangements made by the ESB to disconnect consumers who have not paid their accounts.  This matter arose before.  I did tell the House on the last occasion that the cost of sending reminders separately would be extremely high for the ESB.  It also would be, I believe, quite ineffective as far as bad payers are concerned.  People cannot expect to be kept in credit from the ESB. The ESB have to take the same attitude as any good company takes in regard to the collection of accounts.</P>
    <P>I think my last statement got fairly wide publicity.  It was, I hope, read <Col N="1103" /> by anybody interested in this question. It was this.  Each bill is marked by the ESB in red and the red mark covers a sentence which says: &ldquo;This account is now due and should be paid within 30 days, but if it includes arrears, it must be paid at once.  Otherwise, the supply will be withdrawn without further notice&rdquo;.  Very wide publicity was given to that warning by the ESB, which is in the nature of a second warning in that it warns the consumer that, if there are arrears in the accounts from the previous two months' bill, they must be paid right away.  Everybody probably knows that the amount for which the consumer is billed is in respect of electricity supplied in an earlier period and is already, possibly, due for two months. I do not think the ESB could be expected to give more than the whole of the two months in which to pay in between the collection of one account and another.  I might add that the ESB use the power of disconnection very sparingly.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say we have had very few complaints in the Department in this regard and the number of bad payers is, I am also glad to say, a very small proportion of the total number of consumers.  I am not going to do anything which would result in consumers generally ultimately paying for the bad payers.  I think that is reasonable.  If people cannot pay, then ultimately assistance should be rendered by the local authority or by the State, but it would be quite wrong to saddle State companies with this responsibility.  It would simply lead to a sentimental, false attitude which, in the end, would do nobody any good, least of all the bad payers.</P>

      <P>I agree with the view expressed by Senator Ross that the minimum amount necessary to carry out the capital development should be provided by the Oireachtas because that ensures the Minister coming back and getting approval for the expenditure of more capital.  That is the only way in which this House can discuss the activities and operations of State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give expression now to what might be described as a pipe dream of mine.  In North Longford there is an area, Lough Gowna, very well known to the Minister.  The river Erne and Lough Gowna are at least 50 to 60 feet higher than North Cavan.  I have often wondered if the ESB <Col N="1105" /> would consider surveying that area with a view to developing a hydroelectric scheme on the Upper Erne, using the waters of Lough Gowna, changing the course of the river, and running the river towards Arva, and ultimately to Lough Oughter.  It is theoretically possible to do all this, but it may not be practicable.  Investigation might show that the game would not be worth the candle but, as far as I know, no survey has ever been carried out to either prove or disprove the theory.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us an assurance that he will bring this matter to the active consideration of the Board with a view to having an investigation made.  The Minister represented this area honourably and well for many years.  It is an area in which he has many, many friends.  I have raised the matter with ESB officials and also with the people in charge of arterial drainage.  It is rather vital at the moment because the people concerned with arterial drainage are carrying out a survey of the Upper Erne with a view to spending fairly substantial sums on drainage.  I believe that, if real value is to be got for the money spent, now is the time to carry out the investigation and survey I suggest.  It could easily happen that the people concerned with arterial drainage would spend State moneys without having any regard to the power potential of the area, and the ESB might come along at a later stage, having exhausted the possibility of development of more economic schemes, their standard being the capital cost in relation to the economic return in terms of kilowatts.</P>
    <P>There is a drop of at least 50 to 60 feet along a four mile stretch.  As the Minister knows, Lough Gowna has an area of seven miles.  It is only a question of raising levels five feet in one direction and lowering them ten feet in another direction and one immediately has a head of water which, without being an expert, I can say would be a very substantial head indeed.  The game might be worth the candle, but that can be decided only after investigation.  I hope the Minister will take steps to ensure these <Col N="1106" /> investigations are carried out.  I first became interested in this proposition when I was told, when fishing on Lough Gowna many years ago, that Lough Gowna was an artificial lake created by an inundation about 3,000 years ago, possibly as a result of some cattle war between whatever families ruled Cavan at the time.</P>

I presume that part of this money will be spent by the ESB on erecting the new headquarters in Dublin.  There is a strong body of opinion who are anxious to know what may happen to the magnificent Georgian buildings in Fitzwilliam Street.  This matter has already been gone into in great detail. I should like to ask the Minister whether he has any function in this matter.  I appreciate that the ESB are an independent body and that Ministers of the day cannot interfere but this is a matter of very great importance.  Somewhere in the region of £1 million will be spent on the headquarters.  I wonder if the Minister would use his good offices to ensure that this magnificent architectural feature is not destroyed.</P>

I do not wish to go into the question of the Fitzwilliam Street houses but I should like to add my voice to that of Senator Yeats and ask the Minister whether he has any views about this matter and if he would convey his views to the ESB.  As the matter has been allowed to be discussed on this Bill, I would certainly be very interested, as a citizen of Dublin, to hear what the official attitude is on this very vexed and important question.</P>

      <P>First of all, Senator O'Reilly asked about Lough Gowna and its possibilities for development as a hydro station.  The ESB are carrying out hydrometric research on the Erne but that does not mean that I can offer any hope that any one of the lakes or rivers will be chosen for hydro-electric generation.  In any event, the hydrometric data have been collected in a number of areas so that Lough Gowna is not being forgotten.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Senator Yeats and Senator O'Brien said about the Fitzwilliam Street houses, I regard that as a matter for the Dublin Corporation planning department and the Minister for Local Government to whom appeals can be made in certain instances.  I have not myself interfered directly except to make quite sure that everybody understood the position.  I should remark, in passing, however, on the fact that so far four of the greatest architects in the world have commented on this matter and have divided council, which, perhaps, is all the more reason why I should leave this matter to the proper authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other observation I have to make is that there, again, I might think of interfering myself&mdash;I must say on a broad principle&mdash;if it were not for the fact that I do know that the architects are not disagreed about the absolutely enormous cost of preserving the very best of Georgian Dublin in the course of the next 30 years.  That is a matter that has to be brought into the whole question.  It is far better to leave the matter in the hands of the Dublin Corporation town planning department, or the Minister for Local Government.  They ought to <Col N="1108" /> have full responsibility in regard to the whole question.</P>

I should like to have some understanding that the ESB will co-operate and will co-ordinate their work with that of the Board of Works, in view of the possibility of State money being spent on the river Erne in the foreseeable future.</P>

As I read Section 4, there is no ceiling implied. I should like to hear the Minister on that.  I should like to know whether he had in mind having a ceiling implied in Section 4.  The total sum provided&mdash;£90,000&mdash;seems to me to be a very inadequate sum for places that were regarded as totally uneconomic. It would seem that even one of these areas in connection might take a sizeable portion of the £90,000.</P>

      <P>It would take a very considerable time to go into the details of the different schemes that were examined, but, as the Senator will appreciate, there is, first of all, the amount of subsidy.  Then you have to examine the maximum to be granted in the case of each house joined; then the minimum return which the service charge will bring to the ESB has to be examined and what percentage that bears to the capital cost, depreciation, interest and maintenance.  It would take a tremendous time to examine all these various alternatives, what happens when you increase the amount that can be spent per house.  I can only assure the Deputy we have chosen what we <Col N="1110" /> considered to be the optimum scheme out of a great many that were examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another very complicated question.  It is extremely important that the ESB should be in a position to say to every subscriber that there is a ruthlessly exact method of calculating his service charge, that it is all in the book, that it can be seen and that the Minister for Transport and Power of the day can be questioned and can justify the ESB charge in every case.  Once you depart from a rigid formula, there might be a suspicion of some kind of favouritism.  Therefore, once this Bill comes into operation, the ESB will set an absolutely rigid pattern in every single case and there can be no departures in that regard.</P>
      <P>The ESB indeed have had a wonderful reputation over the whole period of development.  We have had continuous correspondence going on with the Minister of the day, with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Transport and Power, as to the reason for service charges but never has the ESB been questioned in regard to the method by which they calculate the charge, unless they inadvertently make a purely accountancy mistake or a mistake in calculating, which is very rare.  All this goes to prove that the charge made was fair and that it related to a regulation which under all circumstances must be maintained.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's proposals for granting increased rate relief to farmers were announced by the Minister <Col N="1112" /> for Finance in his Budget statement last April.  The purpose of the present Bill which will apply to the three financial years ending on the 31st March, 1965, is to give legislative effect to these proposals.  The Bill proposes:</P>
      <P>(a)  to increase from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. the primary allowance on land valuations up to £20 and on the first £20 of higher valuations,</P>
      <P>(b)  to grant a supplementary allowance of 25 per cent. of the general rate on land valuations over £20,</P>
      <P>(c)  to reduce the minimum qualifying age for the employment allowance from 17 to 16 years, and</P>
      <P>(d)  that the total grant be paid from voted moneys instead of partly from the Central Fund and partly from voted moneys as at present.</P>
      <P>The net effect of these proposals will be the payment of Agricultural Grant totalling approximately £8.6 million in the current year.  This will afford farmers relief to the extent of 57 per cent. of the gross rates leviable on agricultural land, as against the relief of 42 per cent. given last year.</P>
      <P>Legislation dealing with the relief of rates on agricultural land was initiated by the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898.  Under that Act, the grant was a fixed annual subvention and gave a flat rate of relief on all agricultural land in county health districts.  The total amount of the grant and its method of distribution were altered on several occasions, but until the year 1946 the total of the grant was always a fixed amount.</P>
      <P>Under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, the total amount of the grant, instead of being fixed in advance as heretofore, became related to the actual rate struck by county councils in a particular year. That Act provided that the grant should be the sum needed to give relief on the following basis:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuations up to £20,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> (2)  a supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation over £20, and</P>
    <P>(3)  an employment allowance, calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation over £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance should not exceed £6 10s. for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the proceeding calendar year.</P>
    <P>This method of distribution operated until the passing of an amending Act in 1953 which abolished the suplementary allowance, increased the employment allowance to £17, but left the primary allowance unchanged.  The grant was continued on this basis up to and including the last financial year.</P>
    <P>The total amount of the grant has increased from £599,011 in 1898 to £2.91 million in 1946/47, to £5.84 million in 1961/62, and it would have increased to £6.1 million in the current year if no change were made in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Sections 1, 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the payment of the increased primary allowance of seven-tenths of the general rate, and the supplementary allowance of one-quarter of the general rate, on land valuations over £20.</P>
    <P>The amendments made by the Bill will result in the payment of primary allowance totalling approximately £5.9 million in the current year.  To those who might hold that the Bill is not sufficiently generous to the small farmer, I would point out that the primary allowance alone this year will exceed by a considerable sum the total of the grant paid last year.  The supplementary allowance applicable to land holdings in excess of £20 valuation which is provided for in the Bill will cost an estimated £1.7 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the continuance of the employment allowance of £17 per workman introduced by the 1953 Act.  One of the conditions attached to the grant of the allowance is, however, being eased.  Up to the present a workman, in respect of whom <Col N="1114" /> this allowance could be granted, had to be at least 17 years of age at the commencement of the qualifying period.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the reduction of the minimum qualifying age to 16 years, which is the age at which a person becomes insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The cost of this concession is estimated at £90,000 in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill do not call for much comment.  Section 5 provides that the total of the employment allowance and the supplementary allowance in any case will not exceed the total rates payable on the land valuation over £20.</P>
    <P>Under Section 48 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, the basic agricultural grant introduced by that Act and amounting to £599,011 yearly is paid from the Central Fund, while the balance of the grant is defrayed from a special Vote accounted for by the Minister for Finance.  Section 6 proposes in effect that the full amount of the grant shall be met in future from voted moneys.  The increased allowances provided for under the Bill will have the effect of reducing the net rates payable by farmers on agricultural land in the current year to below the amounts paid by them in the year 1956/57.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Being familiar as I am with the type of farming which is carried on in Counties Cavan and Monaghan, I find it difficult, if not impossible, to work up any great enthusiasm for this Bill.  In so far as it gives some relief, perhaps considerable relief, to certain types of farmer and some very small relief to others, of course it must be welcomed. It will be agreed by all&mdash;I feel sure there can be no controversy about this &mdash;that some type of relief for farmers was absolutely imperative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates have been increasing by leaps and bounds over the past number of years and a point had been reached where the matter could not be allowed to go any further.  However, I am afraid that the farmers about whom I speak&mdash;those of Cavan and Monaghan &mdash;are very disappointed with the <Col N="1115" /> amount of relief given in this Bill.  I might say that while there is considerable relief given by the Bill to a very small number of farmers, there is a very miserable contribution made to the masses of the small farming community in the counties about which I speak.</P>
    <P>There is as little as 1/- a week, or £2 12s. a year, relief for the small farmers, which means that the position this year has not been improved in any degree, because under the Budget various commodities which they have to purchase have been increased in price to an extent which will more than take away from them any small benefits they get under this Bill.  However, a worse feature of the Bill is that it gives something to farmers but does very little good for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The idea behind giving relief in taxation to the farming community should be to encourage production.  I respectfully submit to the Minister and the House that there is no encouragement whatever for production in this Bill. The farmer who farms badly, who does not mind how he does his work, gets the same relief under this Bill as the enthusiastic hardworking farmer.  The farmer who lets his land and does not work it at all, who goes off to England, gets the same encouragement under this Bill as the farmer who is proud of being a farmer, who is enthusiastic and hardworking, who wants to improve the standard of his land, who wants to hand it over to his son in a better condition than when he started to work it.</P>
    <P>That is the worst feature of the Bill. It is not for me to say how the farmers should be encouraged to help the economy generally by producing more. The Government have at their disposal experts and technicians who should be able to work that out.  The only explanation I can find for the introduction of a Bill which gives no encouragement to production is that it was introduced without any thought, that the Financial Statement giving relief from rates was made in a hurry, perhaps under pressure from the farming <Col N="1116" /> community.  It leads me to believe that were it not for the pressure brought to bear on the Government by the various farming organisations a very short time before the Budget no relief would have been given.  It is not for me to say how relief should be given to encourage production but one very good way of doing it would seem to be a calf subsidy.  That scheme was advocated by the Fine Gael Party and others but it was not accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>This Bill also strikes me as a Bill not giving relief equally to the country as a whole.  Perhaps there is a considerable amount in it for the bigger farmers of the south and midlands but there is certainly nothing in it for the small farmers.  Did the Government ever think of zoning agriculture or zoning the relief given to agriculture?  Did they ever think of zoning agriculture for the purpose of applying relief or subsidies for the encouragement of production?  I believe the best results cannot be expected from applying the same scheme throughout the country, to the wealthy farmers of the south and midlands and to the poor farmers of the west and north-west.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill gives some relief it is welcome but as a contribution to the national wealth and as an effort to encourage national production, it is disappointing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Bill increases from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. the rate of free allowance on land valued at up to £20.  Let us take the relief that has been given for land up to £20 valuation.  I say that the people who are expecting relief under this Bill on land up to £20 valuation will get none.  If the Minister wanted to do something that was really beneficial to people in that category, he should have derated them completely.  Some people have the impression that all farmers in Westmeath are big farmers.  Perhaps I should give an idea as to the type of farms we have.  We have 6,500 farms of under 50 acres; 1,200 of between 50 and 100 acres; 500 of between 100 and 200 acres and 320 <Col N="1117" /> of over 200 acres.  Let us see what employment is given on the land in Westmeath.  We have 820 farms of over 100 acres each in Westmeath and in 1956 when I became a member of Westmeath County Council I asked how many farm labourers, excluding relatives, were employed on the land there.  The answer I got was 1,595.  I asked the same question a few days ago in respect of 1961 and the answer was 816.  I am told that if I ask the same question in a few days' time, when all the claims for rebate come in, the figure would recede into the seven hundreds.  That is the case notwithstanding that we have 820 farms of over 100 acres&mdash; 500 between 100 and 200 and 320 of over 200 acres.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that any Minister wishing to give relief should not first consider what he would give the small farmers.  It is hard to imagine that the Minister would give relief to the man with £100 valuation&mdash;there are some with £300 and £400 valuations&mdash;and expect people who earn a salary to pay income tax.  None of the farmers of Westmeath ever filled in an income tax form.  They know nothing about it. A man with a £10 valuation in Westmeath gets £1 17s. 8d. relief under this Bill: a man with £20 valuation gets £3 15s. 6d. or 1/6d. a week.  A man with £30 valuation gets £8 9s. 10d. relief; a man with £40 gets £13 4s. 2d.; with £60, he gets £17 18s. 6d.; with £70, £22 12s. 10d.; with £80, £27 7s. 2d.; with £90, £36 15s. 10d. and with £100 he gets £41 10s. 2d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go no further.  I shall not deal with the £300 valuation and the relief that owner gets.  I did not expect to have the Minister for Local Government here.  I thought it would be the Minister for Agriculture, but I am delighted to see the Minister for Local Government here.  If a person seeks a medical card and he has land, each £1 of his valuation is counted as £12 income.  We can therefore assume that the figure has been worked out by some Government Department.  Therefore, a man with £100 valuation, we must assume, has an income of £1,200. He will pay £124 12s. 1d. income tax as a single man.  A single man earning <Col N="1118" /> £1,200 in any job will pay £257 5s. income tax.  Is it not extraordinary that a man with £100 valuation and who is supposed to have £1,200 income, under the Health Act, should pay £124 12s. 1d. and have the best security in the country&mdash;land&mdash;whereas the man with £1,200 income pays £257 5s. and has no security only his health?</P>
    <P>If I were drawing up a scheme to relieve farmers I should certainly give relief to all farmers of under £50 valuation.  I could not give them enough relief.  I did not come from a farm myself but all my relations did and I know their difficulties.  They came from small farms such as we have in North and West Cork, 15 acres of land and 100 acres of mountain. Their valuation would not be too big and they will not go very far on the relief they will get under this Bill.  To every person with land of under £100 valuation, I would say: &ldquo;I shall give you £52 for the first man and £52 for the second man you employ.  I will give that relief if you employ two men.&rdquo; In Westmeath, there are 820 farms over £100 valuation and yet there are only 816 farm workers.</P>
    <P>There is another item in the Bill with which I totally disagree.  The allowance of £17 is being given in respect of people who are 16 years of age.  There is a big difficulty there and the Department of Justice may have reason to worry because of the fact that that concession has been given. At present we see young boys driving tractors and when they are under 16 years of age they are not entitled to a licence to drive a tractor.  We read every day in the papers of accidents with tractors.  I do not think those people should be employed on farms at all.  We should have people working on farms who would be getting a decent week's wages.  Boys of 16 years of age would do anything to drive a tractor.  They do not care about the money.  They would do it for £1 a week, or they would do it for nothing just to be allowed to drive the tractor.</P>

In some cases that £17 allowance would nearly cover what they would pay to the young boys.  Because of that I have an objection to this Bill. Relief should be given to farmers with valuations up to £50 and after that it should be an employment allowance instead of 25 per cent. of the gross rate.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Senator who has just spoken and the case he has endeavoured to make. Every farmer has not got a tractor.  The total number who have would be very small.  I am sure the Minister and his predecessor were asked over a number of years by county committees of agriculture and public bodies up and down the country to reduce the employment allowance age limit.  I want to congratulate the Minister for having got down to brass tacks and given effect to those representations. We all know that it is increasingly difficult every year to get agricultural labourers.  If this is an incentive at all, it is an incentive to the farmers not to employ people of 16 years of age.  If they are employed they do the same type of work as is done by people of 17 or 18 years and the employers get an allowance for them.  Farmers do not employ people of 16 years of age because they are 16 years or because they are juveniles.  In regard to the case made about young people driving tractors they are very isolated instances for the simple reason that the type of farmer who employs such a person has not got a tractor at all and he uses that type of employee in the ordinary farming operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was hoping the Minister would clarify the employment period.  I think the Minister has received more representations than any other Minister in that connection.  There is real difficulty in getting farm labourers to work for the full 12 months in certain counties where the traditional period of service is 10 or 11 months.  It is almost impossible to get farm hands to work the full 12 months service period in those areas.  That applies particularly in the south and the west <Col N="1120" /> of Ireland.  On a number of occasions in the Dáil I made representations to the Minister to try to scale down that allowance to cover the 10 months period which proved to be a traditional period of service.  I thought they should be eligible for an allowance of ten-twelfths of the normal allowance, and in regard to the eleven months period that they should be allowed eleven-twelfths.  Ten months should be the minimum because there is a basic principle behind the allowance. The Government, and every Government, naturally, want to encourage employment in agricultural operations to the best of their ability.  I was hoping the Minister would clarify that point because I can tell him there are different interpretations of the regulations in that connection by the various county managers.</P>
    <P>It has been the established practice in some counties for years past that the 11 months period is allowed.  If a ratepayer goes to a little trouble to prove that the person cannot be employed for a longer period he will eventually get the allowance.  In the case where an employee falls ill and the illness is somewhat indefinite, it might take the employer a week or two to start to look for another employee.  He might wait for a couple of weeks.  Perhaps the Department has been able to clarify the regulations with the local authorities, but there should be some uniformity so that the necessity for an appeal to the Minister would not arise.</P>
    <P>I am slightly disappointed that agricultural land in the urban areas or the Corporation borough areas is not getting the benefit of the same relief as are the rural areas.  The Minister may have a good case for that decision but the time has come when there should be a general review of that position.  One thing that is particularly unfair is that the employer in the urban area is not eligible for the employment allowance for paid hands or members of the family.  He is denied the employment allowance if his valuation is £20.  What he gets is about two-fifths of the average allowance on the total valuation.</P>
    <P>Where a holding is genuinely operim' <Col N="1121" /> aigne ná feirm ar a bhfuil an fear eacha a oibrítear agus iad sin nach ated as an agricultural holding that is unfair.  I could quite understand if it were limited to small holdings of land, accommodation land, fields for cattle or cows as the case might be, but in the case where the owner is primarily or mainly dependent on the land it is unfair.  In the urban areas and the Corporation boroughs there are sizeable portions of land used exclusively for agricultural purposes.  The owners of those holdings are mainly dependent on them and they should qualify to get the same employment allowance as the people in the rural areas.  I know at this stage it is impossible to do anything about it.  I suggest to the Minister that at a later stage he may have occasion to bring in amending legislation and he should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>The general impact of these additional allowances has been belittled by the Opposition.  It was suggested by a Senator who spoke a few moments ago that it works out at approximately 1/- a week.  In fact it works out at ten per cent., whether it is 1/-, £1 or 1d.  I have gone to the trouble of inquiring from farmers and various other groups and I can say that while most of them would like it to be more, generally speaking, they agree that it is a step in the right direction, and they appreciate the fact that the Government have done the best they could in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction.  It is really the first step in preparing us for the Common Market in relation to rates on agricultural land.  In point of fact, in practically all the countries in the Common Market, and in England and elsewhere, there are no rates on agricultural land such as we have here.  Consequently, this is just a step forward to bring our conditions into line with what will prevail in uniform competition if and when we get into the Common Market.  Therefore, from that point of view, it had to be a uniform step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reaching that decision and in removing the rate on agricultural land to this extent the Government should avail of the use that can be made of <Col N="1122" /> it in the next four or five years to encourage good farming practices.  I have in mind, especially, a considerable increase in the allowance for workers.  I feel that&mdash;taking this as a first step&mdash;next year the Government will obviously go another step on the road up to a 50 per cent. relief.</P>
    <P>A uniform percentage&mdash;probably 40 per cent.&mdash;would be better next year and the additional 10 per cent. might be diverted into additional incentives.  The £17 allowance for agricultural workers is now completely out of date.  It should be at least double that amount in order to bring it into line with values today. Apart from that, I think the trend is in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Rates have for long been a penal tax on agriculture.  They represent a tax that takes a far greater proportion of the total output than the corresponding tax levied on industry.  Consequently, I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary, in my opinion, as there has been a very steep increase in rates since 1956.  Our farmers at present will welcome anything that will mean a reduction in their outgoings.</P>
      <P>In 1939, the total amount of rates collected in this country was £6,271,000. In 1956, that figure increased to £17,746,000.  In 1961, the figure was £22,302,000.  That means that there was an increase of £16 million since 1939 and an increase of £6 million since 1956.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the increased allowance provided for under the Bill will have the effect of reducing the net rates payable by farmers on agricultural land in the current year to below the amounts paid by them in 1956-57.  Perhaps the Minister has the figures but I cannot understand how a sum of £2½ million will bring down the rates to £17 million or does it mean that the rest of the community are paying the other £3½ million?</P>
      <P>Last year, £22,302,000 was collected in rates.  I disagree with my colleague from Westmeath, Senator McAuliffe, that a farm of £100 valuation in Westmeath would pay no income tax.  I doubt if that is correct.  It is certainly not that easy to evade the income tax inspector.  If there are some farmers with that valuation who have got away up to this, I guarantee that they will be caught sooner or later and then they will have to pay for the past five, ten or 15 years or in respect of whatever period they may have been getting away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> We got figures for Westmeath two years ago and even for last year.  We found that 76 per cent. of the rates in Westmeath come from the land.  If the same percentage obtains throughout the rest of the country, then 75 or 76 per cent. of the £22 million collected would, roughly, represent between £16 million and £17 million.  That would mean that the farmers paid between £16 million and £17 million&mdash;and bear in mind that the total amount collected in income tax in 1961, in round figures, was £22 million.  Therefore, the farmers were paying between £16 million and £17 million by way of rates on agricultural land alone.  Included in that £22 million in respect of rates was a certain percentage from our farmers.</P>
    <P>We all know the farmer needed relief.  His income has remained more or less at the 1953 level.  The farmers were being ground down by the increases in rates, increasing costs and more or less stabilised prices.  In some cases, indeed, what they had to sell was reduced in price.  The result was that farmers were losing the incentive to produce and as statistics can prove, they have been flying from the land.  Therefore, some help was necessary.</P>
    <P>Many people disagree with the Government on this method of allocation. I agree with Senator McAuliffe and Senator Fitzpatrick on this matter.  I doubt if it is the best or the wisest method of allocation.  Any help or assistance which the Government give, whether by way of loan or grant or by relief, should be given as an incentive towards better farming and to give more employment and to increase production.  I agree with Senator Fitzpatrick who said that very little thought must have been given to this Bill.  A much better solution of the problem would have been to spend this money on the efficient farmer who gives employment rather than on the farmer who is not making an honest effort to farm his land.  It must be remembered that he is getting the same share under this Bill.  That is completely wrong and I agree with Senator McAuliffe that it would be much <Col N="1125" /> better to give, say, £50 for every man employed by a farmer.  That would help to reduce the number of unemployed and put more people to work on the land, thereby helping to increase production.</P>
    <P>The method adopted in this Bill may have been the easiest method and, in all probability, it is, but that does not mean that it is the best.  We know that in rural Ireland to-day there are shopkeepers and other business people in small towns and villages whose overheads, rates, etc., have increased since 1956 but they get no relief whatever in this Bill.  In many towns, we have young married couples who seven or eight years ago built houses for themselves.  They got a seven years' remission of rates and now they find themselves with two, three or four young children and with repayments of £2 to £3 per week on their house loans and, on top of that, they now have their full rates to pay.  For those unfortunate people, there is no relief in this Bill.  Over 75 per cent. of the holdings in Ireland are under £20 poor law valuation.  Those people are getting, on average, between £2 and £2 5s. relief per year in this Bill. That is less than 1/- per week.  The rest is going to the bigger farmer and we know that some farmers will get £200 or £300 relief per year.</P>
    <P>As I stated already, in order to encourage production, it would have been much better to give the relief to the farmer who is giving extra employment, or as Senator Fitzpatrick stated, give a subsidy of 50/- per head on every calf born.  That would work out at almost the same amount of money, £2,500,000.  If that were done, what would it mean?  The majority of small farmers with a family have four cows.  Such a small farmer would therefore get £10, while the farmer with six cows would get £15.  That would be a great help and instead of some of those small farmers having to close their doors and leave the land, they would have some incentive to stay at home and remain on the land.  By doing that, the Government would be helping to increase production which is so vital for the years that lie ahead, especially if we join the Common <Col N="1126" /> Market.  At present there are almost 200,000 fewer cattle in the country than there were a few years ago and here was an ideal way of increasing the number of cattle.  If anybody studies statistics, one thing he can be certain of is that in the years to come there will be a market for any beef we can produce and export to Europe.</P>
    <P>The present method of affording relief condones inefficiency and actually encourages it.  There is nothing in this measure, as I already pointed out, to encourage the good farmer to increase production or employ more men.  The Government had a golden opportunity to demonstrate to the small farmer, who is the backbone of the country, that they had his interests at heart, that they were prepared to encourage him to stay on the land and produce more. They had the opportunity to show him that there was a future for him and that they were prepared to see that he would not be ruthlessly wiped out through increasing rates and increasing high costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which reduces the qualifying age for the employment allowance from 17 to 16 years.  It is at that age that many young men decide whether they will remain on the land or seek employment elsewhere.  I admit that the agricultural wage is too low at present but if the Government increased that allowance to £50 or £60, I do not think any farmer would object to it.  The Government should have done something like that.</P>
    <P>We know the Minister could not see his way to having any easement in the conditions relating to those who are debarred from employing a man whose poor law valuation exceeds £5. I regard that ceiling as being too low because it precludes small farmers with an £8 or £10 valuation from getting employment with a neighbouring farmer. It should be clear to everybody that a farmer with a valuation of from £5 to £10 cannot get a living from such a miserable holding.  I would ask the Minister to avail of the first opportunity to examine that aspect of the employment allowance.  I think it should be raised to £10.  People in <Col N="1127" /> other counties might not agree&mdash;some might say it should be £8 and others might say £12 or £15&mdash;but in any event, it should be increased.</P>
    <P>I regret recognition has not been given to the female employees on the land today.  Female labour is playing an increasingly important part in agriculture.  Due to mechanisation, the work is easier.  We have many ladies driving tractors and doing other farm work.</P>

If anything, in the long run, the farmer will lose nearly £2½ million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill because, according to the Minister, it will reduce the amount of rates payable to the 1956-1957 level. I have had long experience in this matter of rates.  It is hard to place the responsibility for rising rates. There are people who come on deputations to county councils looking to have this, that and the other thing done.  It is the same with various organisations.  They meet, discuss a matter and refer it to the county council to be carried out.  If all these recommendations were adopted, the rates would be 100 per cent. higher still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should face realities: the people are demanding a higher standard in everything.  They want roads steamrolled and tarred.  I believe that in a short time we will have to accept that <Col N="1128" /> position, because that is the only way of doing roads, even the by-roads.  The people are looking for a higher standard in hospital services, poor law services and all the rest.  We all know that the great upsurge in rates began in 1939 when the war began and the £ was reduced in value.  The £ of 1939 is worth only about 7/6 today.  That should be related to the question of increased rates at present.  We have had about eight rounds of wage increases benefiting all those in the public services, local officials, road workers and so on and affecting the cost of contracts for materials, foodstuffs and all the rest.  In these circumstances the rates could hardly be kept down.  The people who have been shedding crocodile tears about the farmers are, I believe, disappointed that the Minister has introduced this Bill, because it has stolen all their thunder.  Senator McAuliffe talked about farm labourers.  I would like to know where these labourers are to be had.</P>

      <P>I suppose you would want a cow that would not milk at all on Sundays.  That would be very essential.  We must face the realities of the situation.  It is no joke.  I was reared on a farm and I employ as many as I can.  I got a farm to run at 20 years of age.  I am firmly convinced, as any reasonable man must be, that £17 on the wage for an agricultural labourer at present is no good.  I fully concede that point.  But <Col N="1129" /> this Bill is at least giving the farmers one round when all the other people in the country have been granted increases.</P>
      <P>Great play was made with the farm labourers.  Many of the people making such great play are people who advocated making money available for this, that and the other thing. That cannot be denied.  One must hold the scales fairly evenly balanced between those who pay and those who receive.  Local authorities must set a standard as reasonably good employers. If they do not do so, other sections cannot be expected to set the headline.  As a rule, local authorities have set that standard.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill, giving the farmers relief to the extent of £2½ million.  Those who criticise the Bill do so out of a sense of disappointment because the Minister has stolen their thunder.  He has brought the rates which the farmers will be asked to pay back to the level at which they were asked to pay in 1956-1957.</P>
      <P>We hear a good deal about production. I know a little about production; I know something about producing good cattle.  Farmers have been given every incentive to produce. They get £4 or £5 for a ton of manure.  If they reclaim an acre of land, they are paid for that reclamation. If they drain their land, they are paid for drainage.  Every incentive has been given to the farmers to increase production.  Those who cannot see the incentives are those who deliberately close their eyes to hard facts.  I have been in public life for 37 years.  I saw low rates and a low standard of living.  In my county, 70 per cent. of the farmers are under £20 valuation.  Today they enjoy a good standard of living.  They are reasonably well off.  That is due in large measure to the Government.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House.  I am grateful to the Minister for the very generous grant of £2½ million which he has given towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.  As a member of a public body, conversant with the striking of the rate for quite a number of years, I know that it was generally agreed this year that the rates had reached a point when to increase them any further would create a great hardship on those compelled to pay.  There seemed to be no way out of striking that excessive rate and, for that reason, no matter what criticism might be made of the Minister's gesture, it remains a very generous one. We have never had such a generous grant towards the relief of rates as the Minister is making this year.  The knowledge that it is being made has brought considerable relief to farmers, big and small.  This is a gesture the people will appreciate.</P>
      <P>Before the rate is struck next year, I should like the Minister to examine the headings under which we are now obliged to raise such excessive rates with a view to bringing about a more equitable distribution over the rate-paying public.  Such an examination might result in an adjustment that would keep the rates at a level the people could meet.</P>

      <P>The valuations in the county from which I come are mainly under £20 and, under this measure, the county will receive £31,000, a not inconsiderable sum in a county like mine.  Some speakers have decried this relief as representing 1/- or 1/6; had it been an increase of 1/6, or 1/-, I can imagine the outcry there would have been.  Some of the speakers, like the Party to which they belong, did not show very much faith in either the measure, or the farmers, when they were given an opportunity of supporting this Bill.  I feel they are now trying to justify their action in not agreeing to the measure when it was first adumbrated in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that rates this year are much higher than they <Col N="1131" /> were in any former year.  Now I am of the opinion that no pressure was brought to bear on the Minister with regard to the decision he has taken. Coming from a rural county, I believe he realised fully what the position is. He appreciated the position of local ratepayers and he decided that the time had come when the ratepayers were entitled to some relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach to this measure, even some considerable time after it was originally announced, is not very much different from what it was originally.  Rather disparaging terms were used tonight, the same rather disparaging terms as were used when these benefits were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  The arguments put forward were few.  Looking at them for what they are worth, they were, in my opinion, rather childish.  Senator Fitzpatrick talked of a relief of as little as 1/- per week or £2 12s. per year.  What he failed to bring to notice is the fact that a relief of 1/- per week or £2 12s. per year represents approximately £26 per year.  He failed to give the full picture.  If there were no relief under this Bill, the total bill in that case would be approximately £26 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relief really amounts to this. Instead of its being 1/- a week, the amount of rates now being demanded from that hypothetical case is £7 16s. <Col N="1132" /> It is a total of £7 16s. for the entire year's rates.  This is the case that is instanced in order to make this 1/- a week appear at its smallest and to create the feeling that the 1/- is of no use whatever and that while some people are getting something, these people, the small farmers in a county such as my own, are getting nothing. The fact is that instead of its being 1/- a week, the relief to be paid on the total bill for the year is £7 16s.  If that is not relief of a major character, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>Then we have Senator McAuliffe talking about £1 17s. relief on a £10 valuation, which appears to be a rate of 37/- in County Westmeath.  Again, in that case the total rate that would be demanded in a normal way is £18 10s.  The relief given is no less than £12 19s. on that £18 10s., leaving a net payment of rates of £5 11s. on that holding.</P>

      <P>Let us take it that way. The total to be paid, if it were on last year's system, would be £10 8s.  The drop from £10 8s. to £7 16s. is a drop of £2 12s. on that £10 8s. which must be regarded as a reduction of approximately 25 per cent on what would have to be paid if no change had been made. It is a matter of £2 12s. off £10 8s., leaving £7 16s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said for the benefit of those who may not have been present at the time or who, if they were, did not hear me or did not want to hear me, that, in 1956-57, the net rates levied on agricultural land was £6,812,670 and the agricultural grant, expressed as a percentage of the gross rates, was 45 per cent.  This year, I am referring to a contradiction, or what appears to be a contradiction by Senator L'Estrange, that instead of paying £6,812,670, or 45 per cent. of a rebate of the total rates leviable on agricultural land, the figure this year will be £6,300,000, or, again, expressing the rate as a percentage relief on the total rates leviable on agricultural land a rise from 45 per cent., as in 1956-57, to 57 per cent. of relief on that same gross rate, so that what I said in <Col N="1133" /> finishing the Second Reading is, in fact, quite true, that the amount of rates to be paid in this current year are now calculated to be somewhat less than the actual amount paid in the year 1956-57.</P>
    <P>If we could go back to the level of five or six years ago, I think we would all be very happy but here we have succeeded in doing it in so far as rates on agricultural land are concerned. Yet there were people who felt we have not done enough and that what we have done is niggardly and not really a very great help or incentive to anybody.</P>
    <P>We have heard the cry made that those under £20 valuation have not got all they should have got.  Let us look at it this way.  As I said in the other House at an earlier stage, the position is this.  The average payment of rates in respect of 80 per cent. of our farmers is £3 17s. per year.  That is the average in the case of 80 per cent. of the total number of farmers with £20 valuation.  Side by side with that, we have an expenditure for the very same group of £4 million in regard to health services.  They pay only £3 17s. a year.  The total amount alone in health benefits is £12 per year per head, so that in fact, it is a £12 payout per head as against an intake in rates of £3 17s.</P>
    <P>The people who might have been induced to march because of the rising rates must surely now realise and appreciate the fact that if they were marching, the march was not for what could be done for them but rather for what might be done for those who inspired it.  Their overall rate is so low that there is little for relief left. We have got to the total of 70 per cent. and that is more than making a start.  It seems to me it is well on the way to complete derating of land. There is not very much now left to be done in regard to those under £20 valuation.  I have as much regard for those, and for many reasons, too, than a great many of the people who talk so feelingly about them here and elsewhere. That is the picture in so far as these reliefs are concerned.  I think it will be appreciated by those who wish to admit it that the overall <Col N="1134" /> increase in the outpayments from the Central Fund this year towards abatement of rates on agricultural land is no mean addition to that which has already been done.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange spoke about a claim for £83 million and a benefit of only £2½ million against which he cites a minus figure of £5 million in relation to the export subsidy on cattle having ceased.  Let us take the year 1956-57.  I think the approximate figure then for agricultural subsidies directly related to the reduction of overheads and the cost of production was in the region of £17 million.  Let us take the Senator's figures up to 1961.  That figure has been increased to approximately £36 million in subsidies from the Department of Agriculture and other agencies that had the cause of the farming community at heart. Instead of taking these wildly exaggerated extremes of £83 million of a claim being made on the farming community and saying they only got £2½ million and that the £2½ million was brought to nothing because of the £5 million having ceased to be paid for in beef export subsidy, we should look at it the other way.</P>
    <P>In that same period from 1956-57 to 1961, the actual subsidy to all farmers increased from £17 million to approximately £36 million.  That surely is a fairly good effort by any Government in any five-year period in this or any other country.</P>
    <P>There were a few other relevant points raised.  It was asked why farmers, who are not farmers but fireside farmers or emigrant farmers, people who have land and do not work it or use it and have other occupations, should get the benefit.  A few figures, I think, will indicate just why it has not been possible or regarded as feasible to do much about that problem, that is, that there are approximately 420,000 agricultural holdings designated as such in this country.  To get through those to find out who is at home, when he is at home, how much work he does on the bit of land he has, what part of his livelihood he may derive from work on the land as against what he may be deriving from some other source <Col N="1135" /> such as running a shop or a public house, would in all probability cost much more in time and in money than would be saved.  I quite agree that if we could stop that it would be a saving of money.  It would be taking candy from those who really do not want it and should not get it.  However, the cost is the real explanation as to why people are drawing these benefits who should not qualify for them and who are not living from the land in any sense of the word.</P>
    <P>Senator Moloney raised the question of the period a workman must be employed continuously for the employer to qualify for the £17 employment allowance.  In regard to reducing that period to ten months, I do not see any hope that that will be done while this allowance is there for the stated purpose, that is, to encourage farmers to continue the employment of their workmen for a full 52 weeks of the year or as near as possible to that period.</P>
    <P>A few years ago in deference to many representations made to me particularly from the south of Ireland where they have some peculiar arrangement that we northerners do not understand whereby the farm labourer goes on holidays for three months of the year of his own volition and at his own cost, I did then publicly indicate that in relation to the jurisdiction of the Minister for Local Government and the auditors&mdash; and they are the principal men in this matter&mdash;we would not regard the loss of a month in the 12 months as disqualifying the farmer from the benefit. Therefore, if a farm labourer were off sick for a little while and assuming he was not being paid while he was sick and that his card was not being stamped, we decided to allow anything up to a month, emphasising first, last and all the time that the local authority in each case would be the people to decide and not the Department of Local Government.  If the local authority decided to allow eleven months employment to rank for this grant I as Minister for Local Government and the auditors of my Department would not cavil at that <Col N="1136" /> arrangement.  We felt it would not be overstraining the law and that it was reasonable in many cases that this slight elasticity should be allowed. Further than that I do not see that we can go.  To go further than that would defeat the whole purpose of the employment allowance.  However, that is a matter which, by the time we come to discuss this again, we might have another look at as to whether or not the £17, £25 or any number of pounds short of the greater proportion of what it takes to employ a man is in fact an incentive to a farmer to employ a man he does not otherwise want.  It is a big question and one on which I am sure all of us would have very definite but varied opinions.  We may look at it again and review it in that light, maybe change it, increase it or possibly delete it.  It is another day's work.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan mentioned that he would wish the Minister and his Department to examine the present trends of expenditure which of course have to do with rates.  All our problems about rates arise from the expenditure we incur in our local authorities. I can only emphasise that these trends are under continuous review and are being given continuous and detailed consideration by persons specially designated in my Department to deal with these matters and they try to be helpful where local authorities can arrest any trends which may be wasteful of public funds.  I can assure the House we shall continue to work on those lines as we have been doing in the past.  I think that is all I am called upon to reply to.  However, if there are questions on any items on which Senators would wish to have further information I shall be only too glad to give that information if I have it.</P>

      <P>I was rather surprised to learn that 80 per cent. of farmers with a valuation of under £20 pay only £3 17s. in rates per year.  I presume the 80 per cent. is numerical. Could the Minister give us the total number of farmers of valuations under £20 and then the number up to £5?</P>
