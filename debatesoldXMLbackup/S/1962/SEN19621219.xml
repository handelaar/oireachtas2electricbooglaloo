    <Title>Message from Dáil. - Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1962&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue the Exchange Control Act, 1954, for a further period of four years, that is, to 31st December, 1966.</P>
      <P>Up to September, 1939, sterling could be used freely for the purpose of making payments in any part of the world and the surplus we earned on sterling enabled us to meet our liabilities to other currency areas.  When, however, sterling ceased in September, 1939, to be freely convertible into other currencies, it became necessary for us to introduce a system of exchange control for the purpose of supervising payments to and receipts from non-sterling countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> Control was first operated under emergency legislation which continued to function on a temporary basis up to 1954 when the Exchange Control Act, 1954, was enacted.  This Act incorporated in permanent legislation the exchange restrictions which it was found necessary to retain.  The life of the Act, which was originally expressed to expire on 31st December, 1958, was extended to 31st December, 1962 by the Exchange Control (Continuance) Act, 1958.  It was hoped that by 31st December, 1962, the need for Exchange Control would have disappeared. This hope has not been realised and, accordingly, it is necessary to continue the Act for a further period of four years.</P>
    <P>In general the Act provides for the control of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  payments to and payments on behalf of persons resident outside the sterling area;</P>
    <P>(b)  dealings in gold and foreign exchange;</P>
    <P>(c)  dealings in and the export and import of foreign currency securities and unregistered securities;</P>
    <P>(d)  dealings in sterling area securities on behalf of persons resident outside the area; and</P>
    <P>(e)  the export and import of currency notes.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that goods may not be exported to a country outside the sterling area unless they are already paid for or are to be paid for within six months and in a manner appropriate to the country of import. The Act also empowers the Minister to specify foreign currencies which must be offered for sale to a bank. Since securities could be used as cover for unauthorised payments and movements of capital, special provision exists for their supervision.  The Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the compulsory deposit of foreign currency securities and unregistered sterling securities. These powers have not been used since 1954, but it is nevertheless desirable that they should be retained lest the need for them should arise again in the general context of exchange control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The Minister is empowered to give general exemptions and permissions by way of regulations.  These powers have been widely availed of to relax the restrictive nature of the controls laid down in the Act and banks, stockbrokers, solicitors and authorised travel agents may deal with many classes of applications without reference to the Department of Finance. The present position is that foreign exchange facilities are available for all current, as distinct from capital, payments.  To prevent the illegal export of capital, it is necessary to apply limits to the amount of foreign exchange a bank or travel agent may make available without reference to the Department of Finance for certain types of current transactions.</P>
    <P>For example, the limit on the foreign exchange facilities that can be made available for holiday travel outside the sterling area is £250 per journey over and above the cost of travel tickets and of any reservation of hotel accommodation.  If, in any case, this liberal allowance is considered to be inadequate, facilities in excess of that amount will be granted by the Department of Finance where there is no reason to suspect that an unauthorised transfer of capital is involved.</P>
    <P>It is still necessary, in the interests of the sterling area as a whole, to restrict transfers of capital to countries outside that area.  Even here, however, it has been possible to effect a considerable simplification of procedure by authorising banks, stockbrokers and solicitors to put through permitted transactions in securities without reference to the Department of Finance. In the field of investment, foreign exchange is made available only for direct, as distinct from portfolio, investment in approved projects which can be expected to assist materially our export trade or otherwise improve our foreign earnings, but certain capital proceeds accruing from outside the sterling area may be reinvested in non-sterling securities.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say how long it will be necessary to continue exchange control in operation in this country. The present Bill proposes a further period of four years, but I need hardly <Col N="1650" /> assure the House that, if during that period, sterling becomes fully convertible exchange control will be abolished without delay.  Membership of the European Economic Community would entail modification of the restrictions now applied to capital transactions. Any modifications necessary could, however, be effected within the framework of the 1954 Act.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as the Minister has pointed out, is a continuance measure and there is no reason why the Seanad should not accept it.  From the point of view of the ordinary citizen not trading outside the country, the matter which most concerns him is his travel allowance. That is now fairly liberal and, as the Minister has also pointed out, if people want a greater allowance, there is no difficulty in getting it.  The whole matter is consequent on our membership of the sterling area and for that reason I think the Bill ought to be accepted.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to support and finance the food processing project of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> published in November, 1958, encouraged State-sponsored concerns to extend their activities into projects related to their main spheres of operation and to test the profitability of new lines and new markets.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann responded with characteristic initiative and started planning their food processing project in 1959.  The company now have plants at Mallow, Carlow, Tuam and Thurles and their total investment up to the present in processed <Col N="1651" /> food production, including research and development, exceeds £2.3 million.  Over 750 persons &mdash; including some trainees &mdash; are employed at the various plants.  Some 120 other employees of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann are supplying services to the food division and about 250 workers are engaged in building and construction.</P>
    <P>The project is essentially aimed at export markets, only a small proportion of total output being retained for the home market.  The enthusiasm with which the company embarked on the enterprise is well exemplified in their introduction here of the new method of accelerated freeze drying and also in the new technique developed at their Tuam plant for producing &ldquo;instant potatoes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The food processing industry offers to this country a great opportunity of establishing itself in an expanding external market.  We start off with valuable advantages as regards soil, climate and labour force.  Demand for these foods is growing &mdash; and is likely to continue to grow &mdash; because of the improving standards of living and the increasing attraction of foods which can be prepared for the table quickly and with the minimum of labour.  The rewards for success in this field are very great.  The processing plants provide substantial direct and indirect employment &mdash; some of it calling for high technical and professional skills. Over and above that they give the farmer the prospect of an expanding market at guaranteed prices for the raw materials required for processing. A processing plant can, therefore, hardly fail to have a stimulating effect on the economic life of the whole area from which it gets its raw materials. Indeed, if the company's hopes are realised, farmers will have a larger outlet than ever before for horticultural produce at economic guaranteed prices.</P>
    <P>Then, of course, the food processing industry makes demands of its own which generate further activity such as the production of various kinds of packing material &mdash; boxes, cases, cartons, jute and paper sacks and polythene laminates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> The Government recognise that the opportunities offered by the food processing industry should be grasped as quickly as possible.  Competition in export markets is particularly keen and it is therefore of great importance to future expansion that we establish ourselves there as quickly as possible. That brings up immediately the question of finance.</P>
    <P>Up to now, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have financed their diversified activities without any addition to the share or debenture capital raised in earlier days.  Other than the few shares issued to subscribers to the memorandum and articles of association or as qualifying shares to directors, that capital consisted of the 500,000 ordinary shares of £1 each issued to the Minister for Finance and the public issue of 500,000 6 per cent. cumulative preference shares of £1 each.  A further £1 million was raised from the public by way of State guaranteed debentures.  I should add that a bonus issue of shares was made in 1961 to bring the nominal value of the ordinary shares rather nearer their real value.  This bonus issue brought the issued ordinary share capital to £1.5 million and the total issued share capital, preference and ordinary, up to the limit of £2 million permitted by the Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933.  The bonus issue did not, of course, increase the money actually invested in the company.</P>
    <P>The company now consider that the adequate future development of food processing will be beyond their available resources.  Indeed some of the temporarily free funds which the company invested in food processing may be required on the sugar manufacturing side of the business for certain developments which involve capital outlay.</P>
    <P>The Government have considered the outline of developments which the company deem necessary in order to exploit the potential of the food processing project and they have taken note of the directors' views that despite the keen competition which exists in this field the enterprise will pay its way.  The Government are satisfied that Exchequer assistance should be <Col N="1653" /> made available for the adequate further development of the project. The Government feel too that the importance of the enterprise calls for the setting up of a separate company which, while very closely associated with Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, should concentrate on food processing. Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have this aspect of the matter in hands.</P>
    <P>As regards the Bill itself, its main provisions may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it permits an increase of the authorised share capital of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann from £2 million to £5 million;</P>
    <P>(ii)  it empowers the Minister for Finance to acquire shares, by subscription or by purchase, to the total amount of £3.5 million in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and/or in an &ldquo;approved subsidiary company&rdquo;, that is to say, in the proposed new food processing company.  The 1933 Act limited to £500,000, nominal value, the amount of shares the Minister might acquire by subscription in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and the Bill will, therefore, enable a further £3 million to be invested by way of share capital in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann or the new food company;</P>
    <P>(iii)  it empowers the Minister for Finance to make repayable advances to the parent company or to an approved subsidiary company and to guarantee borrowings by either body, provided that the aggregate of the principal guaranteed and of the advances made does not at any one time exceed £5 million;</P>
    <P>(iv)  it will relax the provisions of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in favour of an approved subsidiary company so as to facilitate association by such a company with local co-operative societies engaged in food production or food processing where this might be economically justifiable and in the national interest;</P>
    <P>(v)  it provides that the same provisions regarding submission of accounts and presentation of <Col N="1654" /> accounts to each House of the Oireachtas shall apply to an approved subsidiary company as already apply to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and</P>
    <P>(vi)  it requires the previous approval of the Minister for Finance &mdash; given after consultation with the Ministers for Agriculture and Industry and Commerce &mdash; before any alteration can be made in the memorandum or articles of association of an approved subsidiary company.</P>
    <P>There are also some consequential provisions and modifications of existing law.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been drawn so as to provide within the stated limits the maximum flexibility as regards the financing of the food project.  It will be possible for investment to be made either directly in the new food company or indirectly through Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, or by a combination of these methods.  Under the Bill, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann might also be put in funds to finance expansion and improvement of the sugar factories, should this be found necessary.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding Exchequer assistance are, of course, enabling ones and do not at all preclude the raising of capital elsewhere, should this prove practicable.  Indeed, so far as working capital is concerned, it would be my hope that the company, backed if need be by State guarantee, would be able to obtain considerable funds from the banks and other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I would expect the present Bill to cover requirements for some years ahead.  If the project prospers in the way we hope it will, the provision of additional funds from the Exchequer may well be necessary if the full potentialities of the project are to be realised.  In that case, a further Bill will be brought before the Oireachtas. Although the Bill makes provision for only a relatively short period ahead, I can, as I said in the Dáil, promise on behalf of the Government and myself that the company may make their plans for expansion in the full confidence that a further request for <Col N="1655" /> finance will be sympathetically received and welcomed.</P>
    <P>The encouraging prospects which the processed food industry holds for us should not obscure the difficulty of the task that will face the new food company in trying to obtain an adequate share of the very highly competitive export market.  The imagination, drive and enthusiasm which has characterised the project so far, however, give us good ground for hoping that these difficulties will be overcome.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill will be welcomed by every member of the Seanad, if only for the fact that it enables us to place on record our appreciation of the work which has been done by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and particularly the enterprise which has been shown by that body within the past few years.  That organisation could well be a model not only for private industry but for many of our State-supported service organisations.</P>
      <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have used to advantage not only the raw materials of Ireland but they have also used Irish labour to a distinct advantage, through proper training of workers, through co-operation with local vocational schools in the organisation of schemes of training for technicians. By the recruitment and the proper use of Irish graduates in chemistry and engineering, the company have shown that with the proper use of Irish materials and Irish labour, well-trained for the job, enterprises in this country can achieve their objective with as high a degree of efficiency as any of their competitors.  Accordingly, it is with great willingness that we assent to the Minister's proposition that this company should be facilitated in their further expansion.  However, there is one point I should like to raise in regard to the method of expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is enabling grants to be made from the Central Fund but that he hopes that the company might finance themselves through the banks, or in other ways, and not have to draw on moneys <Col N="1656" /> from the Central Fund.  It is a pity, perhaps, that the Bill is not drafted in such a way that the company could finance their own extension in co-operation with Irish investors.  Of course, that is a matter of controversy. Some time ago, the Minister mentioned this problem as to whether we might not reach a stage in the development of our State-supported industries, private companies supported out of State funds or subsidiary bodies set up by the State, which having, as it were, grown from small infants which needed the protection of the Department of Finance into good, healthy adolescence, could move further into the atmosphere of private enterprise and private investment.</P>
    <P>I wonder if, at times like the present when the question of the proper investment of our capital is a matter of grave concern, Government capital is the proper method of financing such an organisation as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann who have certainly made their mark in their development and in managing to make advances, initially at any rate, out of their own internal funds.  Here is a case where the Minister could well have explored some alternative method of finance.  I would ask him to indicate what his attitude is towards bodies such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  I think it would be a very good thing if the small investors in this country were able to form a link with such bodies as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann which have the confidence of everyone in the country.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely good thing that some of the provisions in the Bill make it possible for the company to co-operate with local associations, and particularly with associations of a co-operative nature.  The company have done that in the past and it is a good thing that in this Bill any legal bar which might exist to full co-operation has been removed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also welcomed because of the flexibility which it introduces. While there are some objections to subsidiary companies, I think in this case it is probably a good thing in the sense that the additional operations will be carried out by a subsidiary company. It is good from the point of view <Col N="1657" /> of management and from the point of view of enterprise.  When a company such as this diversifies into another field of interests, it should be self-contained and have a sense of unity as an individual enterprise.  For those reasons, this Bill is certainly welcome. There is just the one reservation which I should like to make.  Looking at Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann as they are now, I think they have gone beyond the stage when the State should be put in the position of guaranteeing £3½ million out of the £5 million capital to the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill.  In doing so, I should like to pay tribute to the sugar company for the wonderful success that has attended their efforts in connection with beet growing, but, like Senator Dooge, I have some reservations with regard to this new effort.  However, the sugar company have certainly provided the farmers of three provinces with a lucrative and successful market for beet at home.</P>
      <P>It is a very profitable crop at the moment and if their efforts in connection with vegetables are anything near as successful, the farmers will be very pleased indeed.  While the beet growing programme has been very successful and lucrative, it has benefited principally the farmers in the better lands. For, I suppose, various reasons, the sugar company are reluctant to give a beet acreage to farmers along the western seaboard and on the western peninsulas of Cork county.  Perhaps it is because of distance from the factory; perhaps it is that they do not believe they can grow beet in any quantity to make it worthwhile.  I do not know what the principal reasons are but I feel that distance is one, at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unfair because over the years the farmers, the smallholders, the cottiers and others on the western seaboard and in all the outlying peninsulas are compelled &mdash; they have no option&mdash;to buy the produce of the good lands.  Industrious people who want to rear pigs and poultry require feeding stuffs of one kind or another.  They cannot grow them in sufficient quantities and they have no option but to <Col N="1658" /> buy the feeding stuffs put on the market from the good lands.  In other words, they are paying out all the time. They have not an opportunity of making ready cash out of wheat, barley, beet or any of those lucrative crops which grow on the good land up the country.  I think that here is a reasonably good opportunity to help out these industrious people.</P>
    <P>I would nearly go so far as to ask the sugar company, in so far as it is possible to do so, to give priority to the smallholdings and the poorer lands along the western seaboard and in the peninsulas.  I read recently in the papers of a development in Donegal. According to the prices given, there should be a very good profit on what the people associated with this development are able to produce off an acre or a half an acre of poor land.  If 75 per cent. of that return could be obtained in the areas to which I refer, it would be very welcome to them.  It would be the first opportunity the people in these areas had of earning something from this new venture of the sugar company.</P>
    <P>While it is possibly unreasonable to ask that it should be confined, still I suggest that the organisation should be extended to those areas.  The balance should be got from the good land.  The people living on the better land had their opportunity over the years, largely at the expense of the people in the areas to which I refer who had to buy the stuff afterwards.  It would be only fair that the process should be reversed now.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the sugar company to ensure that the operations under this Bill will be extended to those people.  I welcome the Bill and I wish the company every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The trade union movement has on many occasions advocated the extension of the activities of semi-State undertakings.  I have on occasion made my voice heard on the various debates in the Seanad. Here is the case of a semi-State undertaking showing us, as the Minister termed it, imagination, drive and enthusiasm.  I, therefore, very much <Col N="1659" /> welcome this Bill.  I welcome the drive and enterprise of the sugar company. Indeed, I compliment them on what they are doing and what they have done over the years.</P>
      <P>I must say that I have very little sympathy with the point of view that the activities of a public undertaking such as this, having shown enterprise, should in some way be hived off to private enterprise.  This is an example of public enterprise, with the emphasis on enterprise.  I do not see why when a public company such as this exhibit enterprise, when they might be regarded as being successful or remunerative, they should then in some way be given over to private enterprise.</P>
      <P>This is not the case of a semi-State undertaking absorbing activities previously conducted by private firms, private individuals or private enterprise. This field has been there all the time to be worked: this market has always been available.  The land has always been available but private enterprise has not been prepared to take the risk or has not had the vision to see what could be done.  I am glad that the Government have encouraged semi-State undertakings to extend their activities to engaging in enterprise and I compliment the sugar company on showing us this very good example.  I have always thought that the management and leadership of the sugar company was very forceful and successful.  Being forceful and successful naturally leads to some criticisms, but I do not think we should ever criticise people who are making the best of what is available, using the available talents, creating employment in this country and, like the sugar company, providing a good market and income for farmers, which are so important to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one note of warning I should like to sound.  I hope none of the capital which is being granted under this Bill will be utilised to build up more transport when the necessary haulage could be more usefully be performed by the nationalised public transport undertaking.  I feel that, especially with semi-State undertakings, there should be mutual co-operation, <Col N="1660" /> use of one another's facilities, and that there should not be duplication, especially in the matter of transport where we have a semi-State undertaking and have had up to now to subsidise that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I particularly noted the reference to the possibility of a subsidiary company being set up to develop further the food processing now engaged in by the sugar company.  Quite frankly, I cannot see the need for such a subsidiary company.  Listening to the Minister, I certainly got the very definite impression that this was an idea favoured by the Government but not suggested by the sugar company. It does not seem to be the idea of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  They do not seem to want a subsidiary company. I do not know whether or not they consider it desirable.  I certainly got the impression, as I have said, that it is rather an idea of the Government and certainly not an idea of the sugar company who have taken the initiative, who have taken the chance and have done this work in the food processing field.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by again complimenting the company on the good leadership and enterprise they have shown over the years.  I wish them every success in this new field in which they are engaging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to add my voice to those of the Senators who have commented on the very great satisfaction with which we have observed the progress of this industry over the years.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his concluding sentence that this company is distinguished by imagination, drive and enthusiasm and the previous speaker mentioned these words.  I should like to mention them again.  Any successful enterprise like this must exhibit drive and enthusiasm but not all of our industries here exhibit very much imagination and it is in that particular quality that this company, as far as my observation is concerned, really outstrips the others&mdash;most of the others, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Senator has mentioned the fact that this company employs Irish graduates in chemistry and engineering to forward its enterprises.  That is an <Col N="1661" /> excellent thing and one of the reasons why anybody here, who is interested in the agricultural development of this country, must get considerable satisfaction because this development is being forwarded by our own personnel, people trained in our own schools and universities.  The company do more than that, because they help to train these people.  They help to train these people by encouraging university departments, not only to degree these graduates in chemistry and engineering, whose relevance to this subject is quite apparent, but also in other subjects &mdash; and this is where the quality of imagination comes in, where the relevance is not quite so apparent.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of one particular direction, that is, genetics.  The company early on realised that there is great need for the study of genetics here and has encouraged the study of genetics by graduates and has graduates trained in this subject who will help to produce proper strains of beet for the greater production of sugar for the country.</P>
    <P>I mention this as one of the activities of this company which must have given tremendous encouragement to scientists in universities in this country and, if for no other reason than that, I would warmly support anything which tends to forward the interests of this company.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with those Senators who have complimented Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann on the great work they have been doing over a number of years.  It is right to say that their efforts have made a wonderful contribution to the country's economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to make more capital available for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and anybody who has followed their activities over the years could have no objection whatsoever to that.  Whether given through Government channels or raised by the company, money that is made available to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is, surely, money well invested. There could not be a much better investment for the people of this country and I am sure that the <Col N="1662" /> dividends that will accrue to it will be as good as any dividends that could be got from money invested in any other company, either here or outside the State.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the way in which the share capital is being made available to the company.  There has been a suggestion that it would be better for the company itself to raise this money.  In my opinion, it makes very little difference how the money is raised.  Everyone knows that it is much easier for the Government to raise money than it is for a State body but I am sure that if Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann floated a loan of their own, the money would be readily forthcoming because investors will always follow a good business and will have no hesitation in sinking their money in that business.  On the whole, we can claim that our State bodies have rendered a good account of themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan raised a point in which I am also interested, that is, the question of the undeveloped areas, as I would call them, and small farmers living in those places who, as everyone knows, find it very difficult to eke out an existence.  It is true to say that they have not benefited very much from the policy of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann. Of course nobody can blame the company for that because it is only natural that the company should concentrate on those parts of the country where the soil is suitable for the growing of beet and none of us would dream of curtailing their activities in those parts of the country.  It is their duty to grow large quantities of beet and therefore, in order to get good quality beet, they must concentrate on places where the soil is suitable.</P>
    <P>Because the establishment of a subsidiary company is envisaged in this Bill, now is the time for Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to turn their attention to the undeveloped areas.  I am aware that the managing director of the company has already gone to those areas and has consulted the people.  He has held meetings with a view to organising the small farmers to participate in a scheme.  I do not yet know exactly how the scheme will work but I believe there will be a liaison between <Col N="1663" /> the company and the small farmers in the undeveloped areas with a view to getting them into a scheme by which it will be possible for them to work their holdings much more profitably for themselves and for the nation than up to now.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with those small farmers up to now was that they did not have the necessary capital to work their land.  Now the company will be in a position to utilise capital made available under this Bill to seek the co-operation of the people along the western seaboard and other undeveloped areas to grow vegetables and so on and also, perhaps, to establish food processing plants in or near those areas.  I am aware that a certain amount has been done already and I know a part of the country where a co-operative movement has been set on foot with a view to organising the farmers so that they can utilise their land to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>As a result of that, those small farmers have been able to grow early potatoes and put them on the Dublin market in competition with County Dublin potato growers.  That is an instance of what can be done on those small holdings when the people are properly organised and have the proper financial backing.  Apart entirely from the question of beet &mdash; we all know that the primary function of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is to have beet grown for processing into sugar &mdash; now, when there is to be a subsidiary company, is the time when Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann should turn their attention to the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I can agree with Senator Murphy that there is no need for a subsidiary company.  I think there is, because the type of activity I have mentioned and to which Senator O'Sullivan referred would not have very much to do with the growing of beet, the purpose for which the company was formed the very first day. Having said those few words, I conclude by complimenting the sugar company on the great work they have done and are doing for the nation.  I think, given the proper encouragement, and having adequate funds at their disposal, we can look forward to <Col N="1664" /> greater and better efforts on their part in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the unanimous welcome to this Bill and in the unanimous congratulations to the Irish Sugar Company.  This industry was, I think, the first set up by the new Irish State here nearly 40 years ago and its history has been a success story down the years.  It has gone from success to success and certainly merits the best thanks and the best congratulations of this House and of the country as a whole.  It is gratifying to see that the company have not yet reached the peak of their services to the Irish nation and that they are contemplating branching out into other fields of activity, such as food processing.</P>
      <P>I should like to endorse the appeal made by Senator O'Sullivan and by Senator Ó Ciosáin to the company to spread out into the undeveloped areas of this country.  They spoke of the western seaboard.  I speak of counties such as Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and similar areas.  They are counties which are called on year after year, almost, to rally to the assistance of the wheat farmers when they are in danger of heavy losses due to bad seasons. These counties gain nothing from the wheat industry.  Down through the years, when the sugar industry needed assistance, in the years of its youth, the taxpayers of Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and other such counties had to pay their share and they did not begrudge it.</P>
      <P>I agree that these counties are probably not suitable for growing wheat or beet but they have contributed generously to both.  The new field of activity into which the company are about to enter is that of vegetable growing and the counties of which I have spoken are very suitable for vegetable production.  They are counties with very few industries.  The farmers there have always done their best to earn a decent living but they have no cash crops such as wheat, barley or beet.  I therefore join very strongly in the appeal to the sugar company to set up their processing plants in counties of the type I have mentioned.  On that note, I again welcome the Bill and congratulate the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to welcome the Bill.  I feel that money should readily be provided for any industrial concern that uses 100 per cent. native raw material.  I think it is true that food processing, as carried on by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, is very much in the experimental stage as yet, but it is regrettable that so many risks associated with the experiments are left more or less to the farming community.  I think the company could be a little more generous and give better prices, especially for the crops which are more delicate and more difficult to produce.  The company should realise that when farmers undertake horticultural husbandry, they are working completely in the dark and themselves experimenting.  It requires new techniques and they sometimes have to go to a great deal of expense. The prices the company have been paying over the past few years have not been sufficient to compensate farmers for the extra time, work and worry which these crops entail.</P>
      <P>Last year, the sugar company began to sell dried beet pulp in ten-stone jute sacks.  Heretofore it was sold in eight-stone sacks.  I presume it is easier for the factory to handle the ten-stone sack but it is very bulky and difficult for the farmers, who in many cases have no help.  It is very hard work for one man to load and unload these sacks alone.  The farmers should have the option of buying in half-cwt. sacks. I should be glad if the Minister would bring this small point to the notice of the company.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is right that the members of this House should avail of the opportunity to congratulate Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann on the signal success they have achieved up to the present.  When I was a youngster, we thought beet could not be grown in this country.  The effect of the work of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, so far, has been to prove to the world that we can grow and process beet and produce sugar better than any country in the world, practically. To my mind, accelerated freeze drying is a tremendous step <Col N="1666" /> forward in the processing and preservation of several articles of food.  We have seen them at the Spring Show, products other than vegetable products. I have seen meat treated under these conditions as well as other foodstuffs. At present, we are only at the beginning of a tremendous advance in what Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have initiated and I understand we are the first in the world commercially to process goods by this system.</P>
      <P>Not only is that a tribute to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann but it is a tribute also to the agricultural outlook of the country.  In a previous debate, when the House was discussing the stamping and testing of fresh eggs, I suggested that in a few years the housewives would be buying eggs in packets.  I think that is feasible and other items of food can be sold under circumstances similar to those in which these other products are being sold now.  I have experience of two, with one of which I was delighted.  I cannot say I was fascinated with the other.  The peas produced by the AFD system are sold in packets in the city at present and are an outstanding product of the company.  Potatoes have been similarly processed but they do not appeal to me so much, as I prefer to have the potato in its jacket. But I can picture what an immense opportunity is presented for every individual in the country, taxpayers, farmers big and small, by this breakthrough. That is why I want to commend Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann on this occasion for their success in the past and to express the opinion that we are at the beginning of a fascinating and tremendous future for agricultural produce in this country.</P>
      <P>Not only the beet farmers but the farmers of Donegal down to West Cork and right around to Wexford will benefit.  You can also go up the east coast, if you wish, but the places I have mentioned are the places about the success of which everybody is at present thinking.  We refer to the western seaboard but there are other seaboards with small holdings also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt, as Senator O'Sullivan mentioned, that the success of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in beet <Col N="1667" /> has been a success for the big farmer. I wonder how this breakthrough will help the small farmer, whether on the seacoast or inland.  I have been thinking more on the lines of having co-operative preparation centres rather than co-operative subsidiaries of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  A subsidiary factory I fancy, would be a pretty large undertaking but I imagine, in districts like West Cork, an area I know fairly well, and other seaboard districts, by co-operation, producers could have preparation centres where the vegetable and other products would get preparatory treatment and then in smaller, concentrated and possibly cleaner packages, be conveyed to the larger processing centres of Mallow, Thurles, Carlow and possibly Tuam.  Otherwise, the districts around Mallow, Thurles and Carlow would have a great advantage over the more distant districts in producing these various vegetables which are apparently quite capable of being processed by the AFD system.</P>
    <P>The old system of freezing during the last war was no good but I can now picture that if we had, God forbid, another war these processed products could be transported so easily that under the modern system, our goods, animal or vegetable, could be supplied from one end of the world to the other.  We have an immense opportunity to achieve a big success. The success of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in the past is the best indication we could have of the success of the new system in the future.</P>
    <P>In the West Cork village of Glandore, we can grow violets and send them to the Dublin and foreign markets. When an industry such as that can be carried out on a small scale, I can see all these maritime districts producing vegetables from their sandy soil.  That is why I look forward to a great future for the agricultural output from the farmers, especially from the small farmers, in this new venture.  At present the sugar company have a number of university graduates employed, not alone chemists or engineers but also agricultural and horticultural graduates.  These are carrying out work of an advisory nature and therefore <Col N="1668" /> no farmer developing this vegetable growing will be left without adequate professional advice as to his soil and other requirements for the successful growing of the various products.  Again, I congratulate Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann on their achievements and I hope that this important breakthrough will be very successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in welcoming this Bill which increases the share capital of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann from £1,500,000 to £5,000,000.  I should like to pay tribute to the work done by the company up to now.  It is a well deserved tribute, but in paying it, we should analyse the factors which have contributed to that success and see whether these factors cannot be employed more fully in other companies in their future development.  Many have given the outstanding characteristics of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann as their drive, imagination and enthusiasm but we must go deeper than that.  I think their outstanding characteristic is the success they have had in training and taking in technical people and ultimately giving them the responsibility of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically all of the company's present managers came in as technical people, carried out a technical job&mdash; it might have been as junior chemists in a laboratory&mdash;and progressed up to the head of the department and then into the actual field of management, becoming works managers, factory managers, and so on.  That has been the pattern of development and in paying tribute to the company, we are paying tribute to the ability shown by those men and to the fact that technical people here as much as in other countries were given the opportunity of proving first-class managers.  We should remember this lesson and we should reverse the prejudice against technical people in the field of management before it is too late.  In fact, in many circles, it is regarded as a handicap to have a technical training and it is thought that technical people should be kept in their own domain and should not be allowed intrude into the sacred field of management.  The sugar company have proved the <Col N="1669" /> reverse.  This is not to claim that all management should be confined to technical people but if we regard the problem of the future as the problem of providing scientific and efficient management for the various industries, then we cannot afford to ignore the great reservoir of management talent that lies undeveloped in our technical personnel.  State and semi-State bodies and all others should develop that management potential.</P>
    <P>Another lesson to be learned from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is their co-operative spirit and we might say that to-day its leader is the best authority we have on the ideals of Sir Horace Plunket and Father Finlay and what they hoped to do through the co-operative movement.  We find to-day, even in the format of a State company, the ideals of a co-operative being successfully employed and wedded to the concept of a State company. This reaches out first and foremost to the other partners in this great enterprise, to the farmers who are growing their beet and to their very active Beet Growers' Association, which at all times has worked in close contact and harmony with the management of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann for the development of the industry.  They have not hesitated at any time to use up-to-date methods and labour-saving devices to the mutual advantage of both themselves and the company.</P>
    <P>We might say that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have the best public relations service in the country and we can attribute the lack of criticism of the company to the success of their public relations spirit and to their fostering of co-operation.  Another lesson which we can learn is that the work of this company has not stopped in the factory, taking in the farmers' product and processing it from that on.  At a very early stage, especially since the last war and since the present manager, Lieutenant-General Costello, assumed control, they have realised the necessity for a first-class advisory service to help in the growing end and today they have a first-class service manned by agricultural and horticultural graduates.  It is a service which is second to none and it has the full confidence of the <Col N="1670" /> farming community.  They have succeeded in translating the findings of the research laboratory and its recommendations, whether on weed control, plant seeding or land manuring, into actual practice in the field.  The company have also had the courage to tackle factors that were apparently outside their domain.  On the one hand they have produced the Armour harvester and on the other, they have undertaken the parallel problem of bog development which would seem to be outside the scope of the company as first constituted, but is certainly not outside the scope of a management with the imagination and energy that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have shown.</P>
    <P>We hope that all these factors will carry over, as I know they will, to the new venture in food processing, which is far bigger that the initial venture of sugar processing.  Much more depends on it, because it has been calculated&mdash; and I do not think it is an underestimate&mdash;that in five years this could reach the dimensions of an industry worth £100,000,000, so a great deal is at stake.  We should realise that the much publicised accelerated freeze-drying process, known as AFD, is only one minor aspect of food processing, and while the company are to be congratulated on their energy in tackling it, we should sound a note of caution that it is still rather in the experimental stage, at least on the economic side.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the process is all right, but it has still to be proved that it is really economic and will be able to compete against other processes.  We should have full confidence in the company that they will be able to change processes, if necessary, and go forward with the whole problem of food processing, but we should be careful not to expect too much from one process alone.</P>
    <P>The sugar company have also shown their co-operative spirit in their approach to all the university centres. At one time or other, they have worked with all centres.  Naturally I am proud that the pioneer work in beet costing was done by a member of our dairy science faculty, Professor Murphy, of Cork.  He provided a steady basis for <Col N="1671" /> regulating the price of beet between the farmers and the factories ever since the survey was carried out in 1947. That is a record in industrial relations, that the formula and adjustments have been accepted by both sides ever since.</P>
    <P>We are providing here up to a maximum of £3½ million of State money.  This is share capital, so it may be remunerated or not, depending on how the company are doing.  If it is not remunerated, that is a certain subsidy by everybody to the company and consequently those who are a great distance from the factories are contributing to that subsidy just as those who are close to them.  But those who are close to the factories are placed in a preferential position, having such a short delivery distance.  There is therefore, in justice, a case that people 50 to 60 miles or more away should not be precluded by distance from their share of the developing market in vegetable production.  In other words, if needs be, a subsidy should be paid to equalise delivery costs of the raw materials to the factories. Otherwise, the people outside the region, having contributed as taxpayers, will yet be unable because of their physical location to partake of the advantages of this development. Very serious consideration should be given to that by the Minister if the need should arise.  I would suggest to the Beet Growers' Association and the sugar company and other organisations that may be developed that they should keep that principle in mind, and not be hesitant in seeing that travel or delivery charges are levelled out, if necessary, by a certain element of State subsidy.</P>
    <P>I should like to feel that this company in their accounts would refrain from the more glamorous type of accounts which we are treated to very much by our State companies, of focussing all attention on what is called a working surplus, with the papers then blazing forth that the company have been making so much in a year, the working surplus having been arrived at sometimes without any and often with little payment on shares&mdash;in other words, remuneration <Col N="1672" /> of the capital involved.  It would be far better if all State capital given to those companies had to be remunerated at the rate prevailing at the time, and then the accounts balanced up, with the State returning portion of its share dividend by way of subsidy to the company, if necessary.  Let us not present accounts that do not convey a true picture of the industries.</P>
    <P>We should, also, in paying tribute to those companies, realise that they are in no way in competition with private enterprise.  They play a different role in our economy.  For one thing, they are monopolies and have not got that competition from within which private enterprise must face.  On the other dividends on shares, if the workings do not justify a dividend, whereas if private companies forego payments on shares for any length of time, they know what will happen in the future. We should give credit where it is due to the two sectors, and when we come to speak of the State sector, we should seek to analyse the reasons for success, as I have tried to do in the case of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and apply those to our other developments.  If we do that, we will make the maximum use of our talent here, and develop a unique version of Plunket's ideal of co-operation emanating from a State body, and in that way will create a solid structure capable of withstanding competition in the times that lie ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in congratulating Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann on the success they have achieved. With Senator Fitzpatrick and other Senators, I should like to plead for extension of the company's activities to counties such as my own.  There has been mention of the western seaboard, and I take it that the people who mentioned it include a county such as Leitrim, because we have a coastline of about three miles between Donegal and Sligo.  We are therefore a maritime county and are very proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann could indirectly be of some benefit in the initial stages to counties such as Leitrim.  From the point of view of the <Col N="1673" /> development of the potato processing industry, Leitrim is ideal.  We had an excellent reputation for potato growing, but, like many other products that come from the land, our people got out of potato growing because of the lack of market and unsatisfactory prices. Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann could expand their activities in that sphere into County Leitrim and the counties mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick.  To get over the difficulty of transport I suggest there should be collecting centres to which the farmers could bring their produce for collection by the sugar company.</P>
    <P>Another way in which my county, and the adjoining counties of Sligo and Roscommon, could be helped is by the use of our native fuel industry.  The sugar company established a precedent in regard to that in Tuam.  That factory was adapted for the burning of native coal, particularly Arigna coal.  Arigna stretches into the three counties I have mentioned.  The sugar company could do a good deal to help that particular industry.  I do not know what the position is at the moment, but there was a time when they were using Arigna coal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to turf.  I hope they are not using oil. I ask the Minister to make representations to the company in relation to the use of the native product. Vegetable culture is apparently the coming thing.  One of the problems&mdash; it may be outside the scope of this particular measure&mdash;in this particular line of business is the absence of horticultural advisers and instructors. That is a problem facing most counties which are prepared to cash in in this development.  We know there is difficulty in getting such instructors and advisers, but the services of these people will be vital in counties where this development will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of a local development association, or group, successfully inducing a foreign firm to come in here, and develop on the same basis as the sugar company, I should like the Minister to assure the House that there will be no snags placed in the <Col N="1674" /> way of such a company and that one company will not be given a monopoly. There would be the advantage in the foreign industry coming in that they would already have established markets.  It is possible some industries might be attracted here when we enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Finally, as a nation, we need suffer no lack of confidence in entering the Community when we have such companies as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann. Any who have felt we are neither prepared nor equipped to take our place in the Community can no longer entertain any doubts when they examine the record of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody welcomes the efforts of the sugar company to further expand along their present lines.  Having made a success of the beet processing industry, they are now going into food processing.  It is only companies like Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann that have the vision and the courage to expand.  I hope that any financial assistance required will be by way of issue direct from the Exchequer.  I do not think private enterprise would be prepared to take the risks the sugar company are taking.  Quite a number, if not all, State-sponsored bodies are gradually expanding because they have the vision and courage to move forward when others might be hesitant.</P>
      <P>This development will mean a great deal to rural Ireland because it will give an opportunity to those whose land was not suitable for the cultivation of beet.  They will certainly benefit in the long run.  Any money advanced by the Minister for this project will be money well invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much I need say since there appears to be general agreement that the Bill is welcome. Certainly no one suggested that we are not proceeding along the right lines.  There are, however, some comments I should like to make on some of the speeches.  Senator Dooge said the company have been giving very good employment.  He stressed the work done in the training of technicians, some of whom reached the top at <Col N="1675" /> management level.  It may be possible that these technicians, too, may be availed of in other industries where their services might be required.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge also made the point that it is a pity we are not encouraging private investors.  The Bill does not preclude the private investor.  As a matter of fact, it was agreed, in talks I had with the Board, that the producers in particular should be encouraged to supply some of the capital. They were just as enthusiastic about that as I was.  A drive will, I think, be made.  Some of the producers will be asked to take a further interest by supplying part of the finances required, but not immediately.  There is a certain degree of urgency about putting money in immediately and it would hardly be fair to ask the private investor at this stage to put money into a project which is comparatively new in this country and in which a certain amount of risk is involved.  I think that risk should be taken by the State.</P>
      <P>The point made by Senator O'Sullivan was endorsed by Senator Ó Ciosáin, Senator Fitzpatrick and others.  Senator O'Sullivan said that we should try to give a bias in this development to the ultimate advantage of the farmer with the poorer land.  I think that will be the result of this project.  It may be true, as these Senators pointed out, that in the beet business the farmer with the good land, whether big or small, got the greater benefit from the company because he could produce a bigger crop. Especially as beet came to be somewhat mechanised, the crop suited the bigger farmer.  With the growing of fruit and vegetables, there will be a certain amount of manual labour.  A great deal of personal attention will be required.  There, I think, the small farmer will have the advantage.  He will be in a position to supply his labour and to give his attention to the production of these specialised fruits and vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan spoke about the far away farmers and said they would have to pay for it.  The way this is being organised will, I think, help <Col N="1676" /> farmers all over.  So far, to a great extent, the sugar company have been relying on co-operatives.  They are encouraging the formation of co-operative societies far away, perhaps, from the central factory.  For instance, they have been organising co-operatives in the Killorglin district of North Kerry, in West Cork and in East Cork.  The idea is to do the early processing in these co-operative concerns. Probably they will only collect for the first year or two but the idea is eventually to do some processing.</P>
    <P>In the fruit and vegetables they collect, there is 80 or 90 per cent of water. It would be a very economic way of doing things to leave two-thirds of that water behind them by having the early processing done locally by the co-operative society and then send the partially-dried product to the central factory for dry processing.  I believe that will be possible in certain cases &mdash;perhaps not in all cases.  I do not want to go too much into the technical aspect of the matter as I am not competent to do so.  I mention it to assure Senators that farmers far away from the central factory may be in an equally favourable position to produce fruit and vegetables for this project with those close at hand.</P>
    <P>To come back to the idea put forward by Senator O'Sullivan and supported by many other Senators, in 1933, when the factories were set up, the Government at that time attempted to give the same benefit to the farmers in the west as they were giving to those in the south and in the east&mdash; Carlow in the east and Mallow in the south.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It succeeded fairly well, did it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They endeavoured to give the same facility to the farmers in the west but unfortunately the farmers in Connacht were not able to supply the Tuam factory and nearly every year beet had to be brought from Leinster. I am not saying that by way of finding fault.  I say it to give the sugar company and the Government of the time credit for trying to give these farmers the same facilities.  I think they will be able to benefit better now by <Col N="1677" /> the fruit and vegetables they will be asked to supply in the time to come.</P>
      <P>For instance, the factory set up in Tuam for the production of instant potato will take a very big quantity of potatoes from the west.  So far, they have not got enough.  It is hoped the farmers of the west will supply very much bigger quantities of potatoes as the years go on.  It will probably be of more benefit to the farmers of the west than beet growing is at present.</P>
      <P>I cannot very well say much about the utilisation of this capital.  I have a fair idea of what the capital is required for.  In the first place, as I mentioned in introducing the Bill, the sugar company have already advanced about £2.3 million for the development of this food, fruit and vegetable project.  It will therefore be necessary to supply that amount of capital straight away to the new subsidiary company. Whether it is done through the sugar company or directly is a matter to be decided in discussions with the sugar company.</P>
      <P>The sugar company will probably want more capital also.  They are looking to their own industry.  They have to prepare for competition with the rest of Europe is case we all go into the same common market.  They will have to extend and renew their factories and will need capital for that purpose. Apart from that, after very careful consideration, it was calculated that we might want about £3½ million for fixed capital and about £5 million for what might be regarded as working capital. It is expected that that provision will last for at least two or three years.  If the new food, vegetable and fruit processing meets with phenomenal success, we might have to come back for more money within two years but I think it will probably last for two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Senator thought the sugar company were not giving as good prices as they might.  He thought they should be more generous in their prices.  As far as I can judge, if we go into the Common Market, I think the sugar company should rather direct their attention to trying to enable the farmer to make a profit on the present prices.  It would <Col N="1678" /> be a more useful and a surer way of conferring a benefit on the farmer than raising the price.</P>
    <P>This accelerated freeze drying, as Senator Quinlan remarked, is evidently a very good process.  It is new and was tried in this country for the first time. I think that so far it has not been tried elsewhere.  It will be a great addition to the project but, as Senator Quinlan said, it is not everything.  Other processes will have to be tried too. Probably it will not be possible to carry out the whole business under that system or it may not be profitable to carry out the whole business under that system.  It is too soon to talk about these things yet because they are largely experimental but it certainly is not experimental in the quality of the goods being produced, which is first-class.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan talked of the outstanding characteristics of the Irish Sugar Company, to which I have already referred, in developing the high technical training of men who come to the top there.  He talked also of building on the co-operative basis.  I quite agree that the sugar company, in building up this food, vegetable and fruit industry, have been relying on the co-operative idea.  They appear to have approached it in a very successful way by getting the co-operatives built up as primary units for production and, I hope, also as primary units in processing as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan put a rather difficult problem before me when he said that all capital invested in State companies should be required to pay an ordinary dividend.  That would not meet with the requirements, because, as I said already, State companies are usually set up for some purpose which would be too risky for private capital. When we started the production of peat, private capital would not take it on.  The State took it on and eventually it was successful.  It started paying dividends and has paid an ordinary dividend on the capital for some time. It was the same with the sugar company; it has also been paying a dividend on its capital.  There are others that are not paying dividends but that is inevitable.  If the State is asked to <Col N="1679" /> take on all the doubtful propositions, it is almost inevitable that some of them will not pay for a long time, if they pay at all.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Quinlan there is no danger that any State company will be asked to compete with private enterprise.  As a matter of fact, usually there is no private enterprise where a State company is set up.  If there were any danger of such competition, that would have to be looked into and private enterprise would have to be guarded.  I might also say on that matter, in answer to Senator Mooney, that if by any chance a group, say, in Leitrim or elsewhere got in touch with a foreign group who wanted to come into this business of processing vegetables and fruit, there would be no objection to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Desmond spoke of the good work the State companies are doing and of the risks they are prepared to take which private enterprise will not take.  That is the reason they were set up, because private enterprise would not undertake them, because there were too many imponderables involved. The project might be successful and it might not.  It is therefore necessary to set up a State company to try the matter out and, if the State company is successful, in all probability, there will be many other companies started by private enterprise. If that is the case, there will be no claim as far as the State companies are concerned that they have a monopoly or that they should be left the field they have developed.  The reason they are developing that field is to see whether it is good business or not.  If they prove it is good business, we shall be very glad to see private enterprise coming along.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the assurance he gave in his reply on Second Stage that nothing in the Bill will preclude the private investor from playing as full a part as he would be willing to play in the expansion of this company. He did mention perhaps that this might not occur in the very beginning but it would occur afterwards.  This is very desirable because there is a great difference between an investor investing directly in the sugar company and investing in a national loan, a portion of which the Minister then gives to the company.  I think this sense of identity and taking a thing in one step instead of two is very desirable.</P>
      <P>It is also praiseworthy that both the directors of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and the Minister had the idea of associating the company with the producers in this matter.  One of the reasons why this company has worked is the sense of identity which has been built up between the growers-suppliers and the company.  If this sense of identity is further cemented by means of an investment in the company's operations, again we shall be coming closer to the co-operative ideal and at the same time towards highly competitive efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable that this company should as far as possible, and as soon as possible, entice private investment directly into the undertaking envisaged in this measure.  While it is a good thing to see the progress that has been made and the planning for the future on the part of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the amount of private capital attracted is not sufficient to create an investment-mindedness as regards the larger, worth-while industries in this country.  That is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that State companies are used to undertake only projects which private enterprise, because of the great risk element involved, would not normally undertake. I do not fully agree with the Minister in that.  I would not take the view that there was a very high risk element in investing in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann now or in the past or <Col N="1681" /> that there would be a very high risk element in investing in the ESB.  The real reason is that unfortunately we have not in our private sector, the investment-mindedness necessary for the development of a company or corporation of the size of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the ESB or Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall obey your ruling and relate my remarks directly to the section which enables £3½ million to be given to the company.  The one risk there is in this is that because bigger undertakings are financed almost always out of public capital, one would be inclined to ask how far it syphons off savings or money available for investment, thus leaving scarce money available for investment in private undertakings.  That is very arguable.  There is the fact that capital has not, to use Senator Quinlan's phrase, to be remunerated; in other words, dividends do not necessarily have to be paid, despite the fact that the undertaking may be very successful. In the private sector, the success of the undertaking would be judged by its ability within reasonable limits to remunerate the capital invested.  That is an added reason why the Minister should encourage investment-mindedness in our people.  Some people may say it is lack of technology, but our great drawback is lack of investment-mindedness. That creates the position that private people invest in large undertakings outside this country rather than in undertakings such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  The Minister should create a position as soon as possible in which private capital will be attracted towards the development of such undertakings.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate to go into the whole question of capital here.  It must be remembered that the early sugar company was financed by private capital and was not a great success.  Then it <Col N="1682" /> was taken over and bought out in 1933 by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, a State company.  I agree with Senators to a great extent that we should, as soon as it is feasible, try to get private capital to come in, take over the capital we have in it and let us have our money for something else.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would clear up one point for me.  He has already confirmed that the addition to the capital structure of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is partly to facilitate this very laudable project in regard to food and fruit processing.  Under Section 4, the Minister has power to make advances to the company or an approved subsidiary. I take it an approved subsidiary will be any company set up with the approval of the sugar company to undertake this processing in an independent fashion and that that company will also be eligible for development grants from Foras Tionscal, the same as any ordinary commercial undertaking, in addition to any assistance they may get from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann?</P>

    <Title>Message from Dáil. - Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Bill, 1962&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that members of either House who have to stay overnight have been obliged to carry a heavier burden than those within easy reach of their work.  That has been the case for many years and I might be asked why we are dealing with it now.  I came to the conclusion that we would have to deal with it sometime, because there is no doubt that the expenses under this heading have been increasing rather substantially in recent years. Whereas it may have been a fairly easy burden 15 or 20 years ago, it has become very much more onerous now.</P>
      <P>The members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the Dáil recommended that this question should be dealt with and that there should be some recoupment of expenses for any member of either House who has to stay overnight, either before or after a meeting of either House.  This Bill provides for the payment of these expenses.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for regulations to be laid upon the Table of the House.  These regulations will lay down, first of all, a definition for Dublin, where a Deputy or Senator can stay; secondly, the distance beyond which a Deputy or Senator will be eligible for this allowance; and thirdly, the amount.  These will all appear in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter dealt with is postage. For many years, the question of free postage for a Deputy writing to his constituents has been under discussion. In fact, it has been going on for as long as I can remember.  Nobody ever objected to the proposition in principle but some objection was <Col N="1684" /> always raised to the method by which it could be implemented.  There was always a feeling that, on one side, we were too restrictive and it became rather offensive to Deputies or, on the other side, that there was too much room for abuse of the privilege.  I believe that we have now struck on a method which is not too onerous on the Deputy and which is also free from the danger of abuse.  The idea is that Deputies will hand their letters into the office here and they will be franked.  Of course, these letters will be letters written on constituency business which will be franked in the office here and sent out.</P>
    <P>The next matter dealt with is telephones. Originally, the telephone was free for a Dublin call, but not free for a trunk call.  For some time back, we have been considering the feasibility of putting dial telephones into the House.  They would be much more convenient for Deputies who could dial numbers directly and who otherwise might be held up if there were a big rush of calls.  They would also save a good deal of time and trouble for the staff of the exchange here.</P>
    <P>The difficulty arose that we did not like giving free trunk calls and we had to try to make a compromise on that question.  The dial telephones will be installed probably during the coming holidays and will be in operation early in the new year.  A Deputy or Senator will be quite free to use the dial telephone for calls to any place he can contact by dialling.  As Senators are aware, the area for dialling has been extended.  If he has to ask the exchange to intervene, however, he is then liable for payment.</P>
    <P>Those are all the points with which I wish to deal.  I am not in a position at the moment to give an estimate of what the cost will be to the State, because it is very difficult to know how many Deputies or Senators will avail of the facility of remaining overnight and claiming expenses.  I do not know yet how many letters may be presented by each Deputy for free postage to his constituents.  It will be necessary, however, to bring in a Supplementary Estimate before the end of March to cover that quarter which <Col N="1685" /> is the last quarter of the financial year and a fairly close estimate will have to be made at that time.  Then we will have a fairly good idea of what the concession will cost.</P>
    <P>Every time we have to give extra remuneration to a Deputy, Senator or Minister, it must be done by legislation so that every person in the country knows what we get.  Those who criticise us have the great advantage of being able to criticise our remuneration without telling us what they have themselves.  We are in the position that we can regulate our conditions of employment by legislation, that we can vote ourselves whatever we think right and just.  Even though we have that power, it is remarkable that, since 1923, Minister's salaries have been increased only twice and the salaries of Deputies and Senators three times so we certainly did not abuse that power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill but the Minister did not really deal with the things that are behind the Bill.  I would like to deal with them, if I may, in an objective way. The matters concerned in the Bill came within my purview when I was Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and my sympathies always lay with Deputies who had enormous correspondence but we failed to find any remedy for the situation.  The Minister has found a scheme which is really only a matter of trial and error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing the public should know about this is that the expenses of the members of the Dáil arise from a complete change in the nature of the functions which now fall to the lot of a parliamentary representative.  If a member of the Oireachtas had only to attend and legislate, it would be a very desirable thing but, in fact, members of the Oireachtas have an entirely different and much more onerous and less useful function.  My purpose is to ask the Minister whether, in consultation with members of other Parties, he could not find some method of remedying that situation.  The power of the State has increased steadily since its foundation and the social services have extended enormously. <Col N="1686" /> The result is that members of the Dáil are treated rather as intermediaries or messengers between their constituents and the State itself, the Civil Service and the various State bodies.</P>
    <P>That has increased enormously the duties of Deputies and it is, to my mind, creating an onerous and extremely expensive situation, not only for Deputies themselves but also for the State.  Many people first try a Fianna Fáil Deputy to get something for them if a Fianna Fáil Government are in office and, if not successful, they try a Fine Gael Deputy and, if there is an odd Labour Deputy knocking around, they try him.  There is a certain amount of competition between the Parties in this matter and there is also competition between members of the same Party in the same constituency. The constituent who fails to get something from AB will then go to CD in the hope of getting something on the promise of a No. 1 vote at the next election.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why, if Patrick Murphy is entitled to certain benefits from the State, he cannot get them in his own right and in a reasonable time, without requiring a Deputy or Senator to speak for him.  I would like to see that situation brought about and I am sure the Minister would be glad to bring it about.  It would save a great deal of money to the State and of labour to the members of the Dáil in particular. It would improve immeasurably the work done by both Dáil and Seanad by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a fixed notion that cannot be got out of people's heads that Deputies can get you something that you cannot get from anybody else, Deputies whose Party are in office say that the Minister is precluded from doing so and so by the statute and they get a letter from the Minister to that effect.  When these Deputies are in Opposition, they say they cannot get the Minister to do what is needed. They say: &ldquo;We have tried the Minister but this Minister, Ryan, above all, will not do it&rdquo;.  That is the position and everybody here knows it.  It goes even further than that.  Deputies are not above saying that a man in their <Col N="1687" /> own Party will not do it but that they themselves will try.</P>
    <P>The point of view held by the public about this is quite wrong.  Most Deputies will tell you that they rarely get a letter which contains all the truth. The correspondent will tell only the part that suits himself and will leave out anything against him.  Even as a Senator, I have had some experience of that.  People put things from their own point of view and do not mention anything which is likely to take from their chances.  The more experienced a public representative is, the less he is inclined to help.  When a man comes to me and tells me that his daughter is up for an examination for writing assistants, as Chairman of the Civil Service Commissioners for ten years, I know that I cannot do anything for him, that the Civil Service Commissioners will deal with the matter; but there are people who will get a letter from a Department and will send it on to the constituent who will say to himself: &ldquo;This fellow is doing his best for me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know of a Minister who went to open a golf club in his constituency on a Sunday afternoon.  On the steps of the club, he met a constituent who began to tell him a long story.  The Minister listened as politely as he could and then the constituent asked him: &ldquo;Have you not got a piece of paper and a pencil to take down the particulars?&rdquo;  He wanted the Minister to take down the particulars of his case on a Sunday afternoon on the steps of a golf club.  I suggest that all this procedure is wasteful and expensive and that is one of the reasons why Deputies find the burden so great that they want postage and telephone facilities.</P>
    <P>A Deputy has to write to his constituents and then to the Department concerned on behalf of his constituents. The Department writes back to him and, as most of us are aware, most of the Departments send out their replies with carbon copies.  The Deputy sends the carbon copy to the constituent and very often the constituent starts off again with another representative, thereby repeating the whole process.  I <Col N="1688" /> wonder whether it would be possible for the Minister, in consultation with his officials or with members of other Parties, to devise some means of restricting the number of letters and interviews, thereby lightening the burden which is being placed on members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>People often comment that the seats in the Dáil are empty.  Of course they are.  The people who should be in them and who should be dealing with legislation are going about persecuting civil servants, telling them things the civil servants already know themselves. Some of the things are not quite true, a fact which the Deputy finds out only when he is told by the civil servants. Deputies, instead of being in the Dáil, are in the Library writing piles of letters to their constituents.  I have some knowledge of this but I have an objective view of it because I have been privileged never to have had this burden imposed on me.  The Minister would help the economy of the State by devising some method which would reduce the number of letters and interviews Deputies have to deal with.  The system is open to abuse.  It is alleged at the present moment that a particular Parliamentary Secretary is using his position entirely for the benefit of his own Party.  I do not know and, in a way, I do not care, but from the point of view that such a thing could be done, it is a very bad system.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions of ombudsmen such as they have in the Scandinavian countries.  There are a small number of genuine cases where perhaps people do not understand Acts of Parliament, but my experience is that when a man is entitled to a benefit, he understands all about it. He is better than most senior counsel about what he is entitled to.  Everyone would welcome a step which would make for more attention to legislation. It would make for better Parliament and for less expense on the taxpayer, and perhaps fewer Bills of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I concur in much of what Senator Hayes has said, I do not agree with him entirely.  There are many cases in which Deputies and Senators can bring new facts to light <Col N="1689" /> which, when examined, could possibly serve the case of an applicant.  I have come across hundreds of such cases. Of course, Deputies are fair game for everyone.  That is the system.  A man goes around the country asking for votes and he promises to do his best. When a person is refused something by a Department, he writes in and says: &ldquo;Do your best now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the system at the moment and until we get some other system, I do not see how we can overcome that.  Speaking as one who was a country Deputy for many years, with some experience of all this letter writing, I think this concession is long overdue to country Deputies. I might as well admit that we were often very jealous of the Dublin Deputies who could come in here after breakfast, go home to lunch, again to tea and home to bed, safe and secure, while we had to go to some other place and may be dodge temptation on the way.</P>
      <P>As I say, this concession is only just. It is long overdue to Deputies who have to travel so far, remain overnight and pay for food and drink.  The concession in regard to the post is certainly long overdue.  I think every Deputy had to have a telephone installed in his home when he became a Deputy, and assistance in that regard is long overdue.  After all, even though Deputies are only messengers, they are hard-worked messengers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill.  It can be especially welcomed in the Seanad because the Seanad is not very much affected by it.  It is really a measure to remedy the grave hardships that have been suffered by <Col N="1690" /> country Deputies who have to spend three or four nights a week in Dublin. Deputies also have far heavier mail to cope with than Senators.  From that point of view, we can do a service in that we can get over some of the reticence and false modesty of Ministers and some Deputies in regard to their own salaries.  We can speak bluntly here.</P>
      <P>In his statement commending the Bill, the Minister said that the Dáil and Seanad have power to increase their own salaries and that they had not abused that power because it had been used only twice.  My contention is that the Dáil and Seanad have flagrantly abused that power because they did not use it to ensure a proper level of remuneration for Deputies. I do not refer to the Seanad because, with the small amount of work we are doing, our remuneration is away beyond that paid to Dáil Deputies.  Ours is definitely very much only a minor part-time occupation, whereas Deputies have a full-time occupation, and it should be a wholetime occupation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Ministers' salaries were raised only twice since 1922.  I say more shame to the Governments who have allowed that to happen, who have allowed a situation to develop where a Minister is paid less than the third rung of authority in his own Department.  Ministers have not shirked increasing the salaries of civil servants to keep them in line with the increased cost of living.  Why then is it right and proper to give the proper salaries to civil servants and not to keep Ministers' salaries at their proper level?  No one will concede that a Minister's salary of £2,000 per year, which is less than is paid to some civil servants in his Department, is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should face up to it and ensure that Ministers who are at the heads of Departments are also at the heads of Departments financially. They should at least have parity or, in fact, be a step above a secretary of a Department.  The Government may regard some African Governments with ridicule, but they might learn from the Government in Leopoldville. One of the first acts of the Adoula <Col N="1691" /> Government was to increase the number of Ministers&mdash;I am not advocating that&mdash;and to give an allowance of 10,000 dollars, or £3,500, in a country where the national income per head is about £10 or £15 per week.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that extreme is right or proper, but it shows that we are erring on the other side.  When we have Deputies with personal salaries of £500 per annum, who will contend today that any salaried worker could accept such a position?  Are we then saying that we here have so abused our powers that we have so restricted the salary of the ordinary Deputy as to confine membership of Dáil Éireann to certain classes, classes who have some other occupation such as farming or a business, something from which they can get away to serve in Dáil Éireann?  That means that the salaried classes are completely excluded.  To pay members £500 is just as effective in keeping them out as passing a law to declare that no salaried people shall be members of Dáil Éireann.  Now that we are facing the Common Market, facing the new Europe, we should establish the position that no one in any walk of life suffers a loss by going into the public service.  We are not advocating that the public service should be entered for the sake of gain, but at least standards should be maintained.</P>
    <P>In this regard, we can learn a great deal from Holland.  The allowance for Deputies there&mdash;three years ago&mdash;was £1,500, paid as a flat personal rate. Free postage and telephones were accepted as a natural concomitant to the office of Deputy.  These are allowed and were always allowed, but £1,500 was always the personal allowance.  As well as that, if a Deputy came from a salaried position in either the public or private service, he had to get leave of absence as a Deputy's work is a full-time post.  His employer was expected to make up the difference between £1,500 and what he was earning in the company, if he had been earning more.  In short, he did not lose by it.  He did not gain either, but the essential fact was established that he should not lose.</P>
    <P>Having started, the Minister should <Col N="1692" /> take his courage into his hands and ensure that Dáil Éireann will be representative in future of all classes in the community.  I am not advocating that one class should have a monopoly because all classes have a big contribution to make to public life.  Up to this, the salaried classes have been conspicuous by their absence, largely due to the fact that such people were unable to attend unless they had private incomes, which many had not got.</P>
    <P>The questions raised by Senator Hayes are very important and perhaps with the advent of television throughout the country as a whole a great deal could be done by means of educational programmes by Departments to acquaint the ordinary people with the work of Departments and disabuse them of the idea that, through intercession, they can get something they are not entitled to get.  In other words, the ordinary people could be encouraged to communicate direct with Departments and to have confidence in that channel of communication.  If something further than that is needed, a public relations officer could be appointed in every large area, in each constituency or in an area represented by six or eight Deputies.  He could be approached by people and could advise them on how to fill forms, on grants to which they were entitled and on other phases of the work which at the moment is unloaded on Deputies.  This could be done with advantage to the State, the Civil Service and the Deputies concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does take his courage in his hands and ensures that members of Dáil Éireann and Ministers are paid proper rates and given adequate salaries, he might seek to develop in the Houses a proper and effective committee system so as to ensure the maximum benefit from mixing the talents of various groups in the community. To anybody who has read anything of parliamentary procedure in more advanced countries, this is the greatest lack here, the greatest cause of frustration: that the only thing we can do is talk from the floor of the House. We cannot make a contribution to the <Col N="1693" /> committee on education which is nonexistent, to the committee on agriculture which was never heard of or to the committee on the political implications of the Common Market which was never established.  These committees should be functioning.  If they were, we in Seanad Éireann could play a very important part.  We would have fewer pangs of conscience about not discharging a worthwhile purpose.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are a pale replica of the Dáil, one that could be dispensed with.  I do feel it would be wrong to dispense with the replica rather than make it into something unique and distinctive which could make a positive contribution, through earnest committee work, to solving the problems that lie ahead.  We could meet civil servants there, not as we meet them here, behind the Minister; we would meet them in a committee where we could have a frank exchange of views and pool our ideas for the welfare and development of the country.</P>

      <P>I welcome this because, like other speakers, I think it is long overdue.  A measure of this kind should have been brought in years ago.  One has to be a member of Dáil Éireann to realise the many functions a member has to carry out.  Some were referred to here but there is one that has not been referred to: a member of Dáil Éireann or even a member of Seanad Éireann is looked upon as a kind of adviser in his own part of the country.  People come to him for advice, especially for advice in connection with legislation that passes through the Oireachtas.  Ordinary people in the country are not in a position to understand the provisions of an Act that has passed through the Oireachtas and it is one of the duties of a TD or Senator to try to explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice the TD is expected to give to his constituents or the Senator to the people among whom he lives is not confined to matters connected with legislation.  He has to meet people in every walk of life and discuss their problems with them.  He is looked upon as a man apart and as somebody who should be approached for advice. <Col N="1694" /> Taking into account the many duties of a public representative, it is not too much to expect that a measure such as this should be passed through the Oireachtas for the benefit of members.</P>
    <P>We all of course subscribe to the idea of the Utopian situation that should be occupied by members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann as presented to us by Senator Hayes.</P>

      <P>Civil servants over the years got many increases.  How many increases were given to members of Dáil Éireann?  As the Minister pointed out, there have been only three.</P>
      <P>Advertising to what Senator Hayes said, there is no doubt that a TD has to spend too much of his time making representations to Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and Departments. If some remedy could be found for that, it would not be a bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember going into a certain <Col N="1695" /> Department in my early years before I had much experience.  A certain hardened civil servant spoke to me. &ldquo;Are you a member of Parliament?&rdquo; he asked.  I said: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, my goodness,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;in my time in the British Service, if a member of parliament came into a place like this, the table would be set in front of him; he would be provided with a chair and a bottle of whiskey put on the table. There is nothing thought of you people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards catering for the people up and down the country and having regard to their votes, I remember a certain thing that happened.  An old lady came along to a friend of a TD. She told him that she wanted him to look after an old age application which had been sent in on her behalf. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he would have a good right to do it for me.  I gave him my No. 2 vote.&rdquo;  The friend of the member replied that, if it went according to votes, she would have a long wait considering that 10,000 people had given him their No. 1 vote. These are the things that happen up and down the country and, human nature being as it is, it is very difficult to control them.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with telephone and postal facilities and I am in a bit of doubt as to how the dial telephone facilities will work out.  Am I to take it that this will operate as against the long distance travelling TD's and Senators?  In other words, will it be confined to a certain area?  If it is, then the person living within a distance of 50 miles of the Houses of the Oireachtas will have an advantage over the person who lives 100, 150 or 200 miles away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this measure is justified having regard to <Col N="1696" /> the existing system of representation and the amount of work expected from members of the Oireachtas.  If we had the state of affairs envisaged by Senator Hayes, we could dispense with the measure, but even if we had that state of affairs, Senators and Deputies would still have a lot of useful work to do.  I do not think the Senator meant to convey that people should come in here, listen to the debates and then walk out and go home.  It is obvious that they would have to put a lot of work into the consideration of the measures coming before Parliament, to brief themselves and put themselves in a position to discuss these measures intelligently. We all agree that if that situation could be brought about, it would, indeed, be very desirable.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, I believe that members of the Oireachtas should be remunerated and have their expenses paid on a basis which would encourage the right type of person to enter public life.  It is popular sometimes to decry, belittle and even ridicule members of Parliament.  I think that is a dangerous practice, a practice which could eventually damage, if not destroy, democracy. I think, therefore, that anything that can be done should be done to encourage the right type of person into public life and ensure that that person is respected.</P>
      <P>It is true, as the Minister said, that any increase, whether in remuneration or expenses, given to a member of the Oireachtas must be given to him in the open and by Parliament. The Minister stated that that right had not been abused since 1922, that only on two occasions for Ministers and three for Deputies were salaries increased.  The Minister would have been entitled to go one further and say that on one occasion Ministers' salaries were even reduced by one of his colleagues-admittedly only for a very short time, but that is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with a matter touched upon by Senator Ó Ciosáin. Earlier today I, on another Bill, made an appeal for the undeveloped areas and the backward parts of this country. I always thought that these backward <Col N="1697" /> places do not get a fair crack of the whip from the Government.  Let me carry that a step further.  Even the backward parts of counties do not get a fair crack of the whip from county councils.  This Bill demonstrates that that policy is being pursued on a national level.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister informed us that members of the Oireachtas will be able to communicate by telephone with their constituencies from Leinster House, provided they can do so over the automatic exchange and provided they have not to enlist the services of the telephonist to put them through. That means that Deputies from the cities and larger towns serviced by an automatic exchange will be entitled to communicate by telephone free, gratis and for nothing, whereas members from Cavan town, Carrick-on-Shannon, Monaghan, Letterkenny and other towns throughout the country will have to pay 3/3d. for their telephone calls.  On the other hand, their colleagues from Dundalk, Limerick, Waterford, Mullingar and Cork will be able to get through for nothing. That is not fair.  It is quite unnecessary because in order to have universal communication by telephone, free, gratis and for nothing, it is required only to provide one telephonist here in Leinster House and a small office to which a member whose home area does not enjoy an automatic exchange could go, book a call and file a docket.  It is as simple as that and for the sake of uniformity, on which we had a long lesson earlier this year, I suggest very seriously that that should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with previous speakers in welcoming this measure and would do what no Senator so far has done&mdash;congratulate the Minister for having taken his courage in his hands and introduced the facilities which the Bill provides.  It is quite obvious that in the past neither Senators nor Deputies could give a really efficient service because of the lack of communication facilities.  In the matter of postage, I can appreciate why the Minister had to take certain precautions so that no abuses would <Col N="1698" /> creep in.  Whatever excuses could be given for abuses by other people, it would be a very dangerous thing if abuses were to occur in this respect. For that reason, I congratulate the Minister on ensuring that nothing of the sort will happen here.</P>
      <P>I completely agree with Senator Fitzpatrick that the trunk call facilities should be on an equal basis for all members of both Houses.  It is a fact that automatic telephone exchanges do not operate in the more remote areas of the country and because of that definite drawback, I suggest that, pending the introduction of automation throughout the country, interim arrangements should be made somewhat on the lines advocated by the Senator.  It should be possible to have a special telephonist assigned for these calls and to furnish members of either House making such calls with requisitions on which to indicate to whom and where the calls were made.  After all, it is not because there is any danger of abuses that these calls are denied, because in the case of the automatic exchange calls they can be made on business other than that of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, I submit that since the Minister has gone so far in this Bill, he should go further and provide facilities for others than those who enjoy the automatic system.  A system on the lines suggested by Senator Fitzpatrick could be easily devised. Senator Hayes, we must admit, has made a very important contribution, one which should not go without serious consideration either by the Minister and his advisers or by some competent committee, not necessarily that on Procedure and Privileges.  It is a fact that in connection with Oireachtas business quite a lot of unnecessary duplication of correspondence occurs in the case of both Senators and Deputies on matter that would come right, of their own accord, if a little time were given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes suggested the Minister might be able to devise some means to make it unnecessary for the general public to have to appeal at all times to their representatives in either House.  The suggestion I make <Col N="1699" /> to remedy that is that civil servants reply to correspondence from the ordinary man in the street more expeditiously, as business people would reply to business communications. At the moment if a person writes a simple letter to some State Department seeking information about a potential application or particulars of some scheme, it is very often several weeks before any reply is forthcoming, whereas if a member of the Oireachtas is brought in, a reply is forthcoming in a very short space of time.  The ordinary citizen should be entitled to a reply in the same space of time and I suggest this is an opportunity to remedy this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely suggesting that it has some bearing on recoupment of allowances.  There was a suggestion that if people were educated to have greater reliance on themselves, we might get somewhere.  I think that when television is more widely introduced in country areas, it might be availed of in this connection.  At the moment very often three or four Senators or Deputies, or both, might be employed doing the one job and there is a race in progress between them as to which of them will be first to get a reply to the member of the public in question.  That is quite unnecessary, but, in present circumstances, it is very hard to avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of involving Senators and Deputies in the matter of influence in connection with public posts in which, in fact, there can be no influence because nearly all appointments to these posts, about 99 per cent. of them, are made through the Local Appointments Commissioners or the Civil Service Commissioners and there is no way in which these bodies can be penetrated.  I think most people are now quite aware of that fact but in case there are people who still think otherwise, members of both Houses would do a great service <Col N="1700" /> by explaining to the public in general what the position is.  The public should be made aware that any citizen complying with certain conditions is eligible to compete for any post and that he will be considered, irrespective of his political background.</P>
    <P>On the question of the functions of members, it is quite obvious that Senators and Deputies are dissatisfied with the amount of time they can give to public business.  It is a function of a member of either House to study forthcoming legislation and to take counsel from competent organisations or authorities in regard to them. Senator Quinlan made an appeal that Senators, in particular, should be more widely employed on Committee work. I shall conclude by echoing this appeal and saying it is unfortunate that more work of that nature is not entrusted to Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of us who have any knowledge of Dáil Éireann must agree that Deputies are overworked and underpaid.  We heard this afternoon something about the overwork, and I have no very definite suggestion to offer in this respect, except that perhaps all Parties are to blame.  Possibly we have built up a belief among the general public that nobody can get his rights except by influence and some sort of appeal.  It is really alarming to see that applications for old age pensions, children's allowances and such matters are sent to Deputies and, in some cases, to Senators.  I can quite understand a Deputy coming in to appeal, to support somebody whose application has been turned down and to advance arguments as to why it should be reconsidered, but I cannot understand why an original application should have to be channelled through a Deputy.  It is all unnecessary and I do not believe it produces any good results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I can believe that any private person will get as much attention from any Department or any Minister by writing himself as he would get if he sends his application through a Deputy, be he Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  Senator Moloney said something which seems to conflict with <Col N="1701" /> that, when he suggested that a reply is far more expeditious if the application comes from a Deputy than if it comes straight away from a private individual.</P>
    <P>I have referred previously to the difficulties we have experienced in the Labour Party in trying to get suitable candidates simply because of the fact that no ordinary wage or salary earner can afford to become a Deputy.  He cannot afford to surrender his job and exist on £1,000 a year, with the greatly increased expenses he will have because of being a Deputy.  Dáil Éireann now seems to be composed of farmers, businessmen, solicitors, and a very few ordinary wage earners or salaried workers.  The proposal in this Bill to pay an overnight allowance is certainly a great help to those Deputies who reside outside Dublin and have to stay overnight in hotels here.  It does not, however, do anything in respect of the problem which must still exist for Dublin Deputies.  You still have the problem that the ordinary wage or salary earner will not be able to afford to stand for election to Dáil Éireann. It should be a full-time job.  It may be all right for farmers or business people whose business can carry on for a short time in their absence, but a man working for his living cannot afford to become a Deputy.  These allowances here do not materially affect the situation for the people who might stand for election in Dublin.  Having given that qualified approval to the Bill, I will say that it is generally welcomed and should be approved by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the speech made by Senator Hayes on the task of those in the other House, there is no doubt that some Deputies get a lot of work to do from their constituencies and others do not.  It depends on the constituency.  Some constituencies are more exacting than others, and it is not that some Deputies are more obliging than others.  I do not know what the cure can be.  I come from a constituency where there is very little unnecessary work to be done, but I do know of one county which is very far away from me and I, as Minister in charge of Finance, <Col N="1702" /> am convinced that nobody in that county ever pays income tax without asking a TD to ask me to let him off.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that as in Britain, an official should be available in every county town to receive people and do what he could for them, but I do not think that that would relieve the situation in the least here, because if the official said: &ldquo;You have no case&rdquo;, the person would then try the TD, and if he said he had not a good case, probably he would not be satisfied with that, either. In any event, there might be some case for that system in Britain where there are very big towns but it would be a different matter in our county towns.  It would be too much, I suppose, to expect local TDs to meet and make a solemn covenant that if a person has not a good case, they will tell him so.  That would save a great deal of work.  I agree with much of what Senator Quinlan said, but the Government do not take the initiative in these cases and it is perhaps a good thing that they should not.</P>
      <P>With regard to the dialing system, we were anxious, first of all, to get over that difficulty.  The position is that a Deputy or Senator who can get his call on the dialling system is covered, but if a telephone exchange has to intervene to get a trunk number, then he must pay.  That is more or less putting him in the same position as he was in before, or perhaps a little better.  We are changing the whole telephone system over to dialing and it will be possible to make any changes we want to make under these regulations in the future.  We will change over first and then see what we can do.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that it may not be appreciated how <Col N="1703" /> restricted the telephone facilities being afforded in this Bill are.  No Deputy from outside Dublin can communicate with his constituency properly over the automatic telephone system.  Even in the case of Cork, I am sure that you can communicate with Cork city, but if you go out into the county, there are many places where there are no automatic exchanges.  In Dundalk there is an automatic exchange but you cannot communicate with outlying villages on the dialling system.  This is most unfair, and I would urge the Minister&mdash; and I believe I am speaking for the great majority of the members of the House on this&mdash;to introduce regulations which will be uniform.  I am not referring to the amount of money it will cost me or to any member of the House, but the principle is bad and unsound.  It means that the Deputy who wants to communicate with a constituent in a big built-up area can do it, and is being encouraged to do it, but he is being discouraged from communicating with constituents living in more remote and more sparsely populated areas.</P>

Tá an íocaíocht sin faoi scáth mheastacháin fhorlíontaigh a thug an tAire Airgeadais ós comhair na Dála de dhruim fhoráil san gCáinfháisnéis ar ghlac an Dáil leis roimh scor an tSamhraidh.  Thosaigh an íocaíocht an chéad lá Lúnasa.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to provide statutory authority for the increases in pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1962, outlined by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement earlier this year.  The increases are already being paid on foot of a Supplementary Estimate for pensions approved by Dáil Éireann on the 18th July, 1962.  They are effective as from the 1st August, 1962, except in the case of pensions and allowances granted under the Army Pensions Act, 1962, where the effective date is the 4th August, 1962, the date on which that Act became law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill covers all categories of pensioners and allowance holders for which the Army Pensions Acts provide. In accordance with the increases approved by the Minister for Finance for State pensioners generally, officers who retired before the 2nd November, 1955, and whose pensions are related to their Army pay on retirement, have had their pensions brought up to the rates hitherto appropriate to officers of similar rank and service who retired on the 2nd November, 1955, and the pensions thus arrived at have been increased by a further 6 per cent.  The pensions of officers who retired on or after the 2nd November, 1955 and before the 16th December, <Col N="1705" /> 1959 have been increased by 6 per cent.  Pensions not related to pay, married pensions, further pensions and allowances to widows, children and other dependants have been increased by 20 per cent.  Special allowances have been dealt with by way of a flat £13 increase in each of the &ldquo;appropriate annual sums&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On current expenditure, the estimated cost for a full year of the increases for which the Bill provides is £127,000&mdash;£50,000 in respect of disability pensions and allowances other than special allowances, and a net £77,000 in respect of special allowances.</P>
    <P>When closing, I shall be glad to give any further information which Senators may require about the Bill. In form, it is similar to other increase Bills which have been before the House at various times in past years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, there is very little in this Bill on which to congratulate the Minister or the Government.  The cost of living has been increasing over a number of years and is continuing to increase at the present time.  Many of the people to whom we now propose to give increases of pension helped to fight for the freedom we have in Ireland; they helped to build up the country and many gave the best years of their lives to doing that work.  We should be very grateful to them.  They helped to put the State on firm foundations and, if they had not done so, we would not be in a position to deal with the Bill which we had before us earlier today, giving increases to Deputies and Senators.  These people are entitled to more than the crumbs from the table and that is all they seem to be getting under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose some of us must be thankful for small mercies but there is very little we can do about it now, as the increases have been paid since 1st August last.  When the judges got their increases, they were dated back to 1st November, 1961, and there was a very big difference in the amount paid to them and the amounts now being paid to these pensioners.  I disagree with the principle that a man who has a good, secure job, and who retires on <Col N="1706" /> a big pension, should get a huge increase, while the fellow at the other end of the scale, with a low wage and a miserable pension, gets a very small increase.  Some of the people with whom we are now dealing are getting as little as 3s. and 4s. a week.</P>
    <P>Judges who had £100 a week got increases of £14 a week.  A retired judge got an increase of £600 per annum in his pension, an increase of £12 a week.  Where is the justice in that?  His pension was increased from £3,200 a year to £3,800.  If we look at this Bill, we find that people who gave of their best in the past, men who lost all they had and who have suffered ill-health ever since, are getting increases of 3s. 6d. and 4s.  If we can give some people £12 a week, surely, in a Christian country, we should be in a position to give those people greater increases than the meagre allowances they are getting in the Bill?</P>
    <P>These increases are supposed to compensate them for the continued uprise in the cost of living and for the hardships caused thereby.  Many of them are incapable of working or of adding to their means in any way. They retired on pensions awarded to them when the cost of living was much lower than it is to-day.  They looked forward to security in their old age. I think they are entitled to it.  They deserve to be treated better by the State than they are being treated to-day. It cannot be denied that among those people hardship exists and in many cases, I have been informed and I believe, it is severe.</P>
    <P>Very little is being done in the Bill to give those unfortunate people security, to give them justice or in my opinion to give them even the ordinary fair play to which they are entitled. We can all criticise this Bill on the ground that the increases are meagre, especially when we compare them with increases given in this House and in the Dáil over the past year.  In the Dáil, the Taoiseach spoke on judges' salaries and said they should get a salary sufficient to put them in a position in which they would be as far as possible immune from improper influence <Col N="1707" /> of any kind.  It would have been better if the Minister for Defence and the Government in introducing this Bill had given these pensioners increases that would keep them as far as possible immune from hunger and want.  They are not getting any such increases in the Bill and, in spite of the increases they are getting, great hardship still exists among the people who did so much for the country when good men were needed.</P>
    <P>I think it was on Budget day last May that pensioners got the first indication from the Minister for Finance that it was proposed to introduce a Pensions Bill to cushion them against the increase in the cost of living.  Many increases were brought about during the year and over the past few years as a result of deliberate Government policy.</P>

      <P>If State money is allocated, I am entitled to make a comparison between what has been paid to one section of the community and what is being paid to other sections.  I claim that, if the money is there to be allocated, those on the lower rung of the ladder are entitled to a higher increase than they are getting.  High hopes were definitely raised in the breast of each and every one of those people when they saw that the Government could give an increase in pension of £600 a year to one particular man.  If that man got that increase, which brought his pension up to £73 a week, surely to God those people were entitled to say: &ldquo;At long last there seems to be plenty of money in the old kitty and this time we will get our fair share of it&rdquo;.  They were entitled to think that and I dare say they did think that but they are not getting it now.</P>

      <P>It is disgraceful to think of these meagre increases, especially when they come from a Party like Fianna Fáil who claim to represent the poor people of the country.  There is no denying they made many people poor but they did very little afterwards to help them.</P>
      <P>It might be no harm to refer to the statement made in the Dáil by the Minister on this Bill in answer to a question raised by Deputy Tully, Volume 198, No. 7:</P>
      <P>We try to be sympathetic towards the applicant but surely Deputies will recognise we must take every precaution to ensure that people who do not deserve recognition should not get it.  We know the amount of dissatisfaction caused when people who have given no service manage to get letters and representation made and probably slip through.  The knowledge that they have succeeded causes an amount of ill-feeling among those in the locality who gave good service and knew the neighbours in the area who also gave good service. If they see somebody who did not deserve it getting recognition, they think, at least, there is maladministration.</P>
      <P>The amount of snobbery associated in America with claiming descent from those who came over in the &ldquo;Mayflower,&rdquo; leads one to believe that that ship was overcrowded and when many of us see the number of recipients of military pensions in this country, we are forced to believe that the fighting units must similarly have been overcrowded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems a bit late in the day now for a Minister or any member of the Government to talk about people who do not deserve recognition getting it. Is it not a well-known fact that people who did no fighting, who never carried a gun, who never even used a blackthorn, <Col N="1709" /> got pensions, and very good pensions, all for one reason: that they were members of a certain political Party or helped to get that Party into power in 1932?</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill sincerely and heartily.  Anything that this or any other Government will do to compensate these people, I am grateful for.  I am grateful, indeed, for this increase which is, incidentally, the biggest increase we have yet got under any of the Bills.

      <P>This increase of 20 per cent is more generous than any of the others.  As I said on a few occasions before, when we had increases here, my only complaint all the time was that they were too little and that I hoped I would see the Minister come in the following year with a further increase.  These are my hopes tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am dissatisfied with other aspects of these Bills.  I am dissatisfied with the last Bill which sought to increase disability pensions for dependants who qualified under the extension of the marriage date.  I am dissatisfied with the way the percentage of disability <Col N="1711" /> was assessed to rule out persons who, I thought, should come under the Bill.  I am disappointed that persons under 50 per cent. disability did not qualify at all in the extension of the marriage date.  However, a few of those matters were raised in the other House and I am glad to see that the Minister is giving the question further consideration.  We hope to have him back here early next year when he has given that further consideration to them.</P>
    <P>I noticed that in regard to a question raised in the other House the Minister stated that it was possible for disability pensioners who had not got their final awards to get treatment in St. Bricin's Hospital.  If that is so, I think it is very unfair to persons who have got their final awards.  Persons who accepted their final awards are deprived of any further benefits.</P>
    <P>In the other House, the Minister said that St. Bricin's would be overcrowded if such pensioners went for treatment but it should be possible to devise some scheme by which the Department would accept responsibility in the local hospitals for the treatment of those men who were suffering from the effects of an old wound, disease and so on.  I think that should be within the power of the Minister and the Department.  If they cannot accept them in St. Bricin's Hospital at least responsibility should be accepted for them in their own local hospitals.</P>
    <P>I made an appeal on a former occasion for some assistance to bury some of those pensioners when they died, especially men who were in receipt of special allowances.  It would be hard for a man and his wife, who have no means whatever other than £130 a year special allowance, to save much towards burial expenses.  I advocated that some fund should be set up in the Department of Defence upon which the relatives of such persons could draw if they were unable to meet burial expenses.  If such a fund were created, I do not think there would be much of a draw on it. Still it would give people great heart and security if they knew it was there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> I have been approached, not very often I must admit, when some person dies in poor circumstances.  One does not like to tell the relatives to go to the home assistance officer.  I have been asked if there was any fund in the Department of Defence which would help to meet the bill.  There is no fund.  I think there should be a fund.  I hope very sincerely to see the Minister here again next year, as we have seen him year after year, with a further increase.</P>

I also welcome the Bill, but, before I say a few words on it, I would ask Senator O'Sullivan to bear with the youthful enthusiasm of those young men who would like to give twice as much to the Old IRA and the Army.  I have no doubt that the words of the Senator who spoke before him were ill-judged and not as well thought out as they might have been.  The point at issue here is that there is to be an increase in Army pensions and in Old IRA pensions and, as far as I am concerned, I should like to say that the 20 per cent increase in Old IRA pensions is more than I expected but not as much as I should like to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to provide a yardstick as far as the Old IRA are concerned.  In the case of the Army, you can make a comparison between pensions and pay but you cannot do that in the case of the Old IRA.  What we should try to give them is a sum commensurate with the services they gave to the State.  Not even the youngest among us can pay sufficient tribute to the Old IRA and what they have done for the State.  Every one of us who served with the Old IRA, including Senator O'Sullivan, knows that nobody ever dreamed there would be pensions when we were serving in that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> There is no doubt that when pensions were first decided on, they were very small.  Some of them could be regarded as only a bare recognition of the fact that a man had served in the forces responsible for the formation of the State.  Members of my company got pensions as low as 2/6 a week.  One family I have in mind&mdash;it would be wrong to mention names here&mdash;had a member killed in 1916 and four others fought from 1917 to 1921.  The youngest of them who, probably because he was in my company, was, in my opinion, the best, got 2/6 a week.  That has risen to about 7/6 or 8/- now.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should devise some method of finding out exactly how much an old IRA man ought to receive in compensation for services rendered to the nation 40 years ago.  I know it is difficult, but these people are a diminishing group.  I am sure there are only about one-third left of the original gallant band who fought during those years.</P>
    <P>The Old IRA pensions are being increased by 20 per cent.  Despite what Senator O'Sullivan may say about the exuberance of Senator L'Estrange, and despite what I may think myself&mdash;I do think individually on occasions&mdash;that is a tremendous fillip to the recipients of larger pensions.  But I do not think the Minister imagines the amount it will mean to a man receiving 7/6 a week.  Would the Minister therefore reconsider the whole situation with the view to awarding increases in future on a differential percentage basis&mdash; giving a higher percentage to the recipient of the lower pension and a lower percentage increase to the man receiving £10 per week?  That is merely a suggestion.</P>
    <P>The Army pensions have been increased by six per cent since 1955 and as far as my knowledge goes from my association with the consultative council, members of which met the Minister for Finance, I think the Minister did a fairly good job in the circumstances.  The Minister for Finance gave us his word on that occasion&mdash;and I always rely on the word of Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;that these <Col N="1714" /> pensions would eventually reach parity with other State pensions.</P>
    <P>To digress from the question of Army pensions for a moment, up to now we approached Ministers on these matters in sections&mdash;the teachers, the Garda and, of course, the old soldiers &mdash;and we all worked like blazes and got nowhere.  Early last year, however, a consultative body was formed, comprising all State pensioners, and these men have worked very hard.  They have sent deputations to the Minister for Finance and I am happy to say they have achieved this degree of progress along the road to parity with other State pensioners.  I hope complete parity will be achieved next year and that pensions will be far in excess of the pittances these men who fought for their country have been receiving.  We hope to see the day when a man who joins the Army can look forward to a State guarantee that he will receive sustenance in his old age.</P>
    <P>I do not like introducing clichés but somebody said once that the degree of civilisation a nation has achieved can be measured by the fashion in which old people are treated and sustained. It was the old people of today who fought to make our nation a reality. Very soon, we will be moving, I hope, into an organisation that will dispel borders and frontiers and we will measure up our old soldiers, to try to get parity with men who have freed various nations on the continent.  I had experience in London representing the old soldiers of this country with the World Veterans' Organisation and it would make most of us in this House ashamed to see how those nations in Europe treat the men who freed their countries as compared with the men who serve their countries.  All honour to the man who joins the Army or Navy of his country and is prepared to die in its defence, but those who work against the oppressor and free their country are soldiers apart and entitled to special consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not dare to apologise for the enthusiasm of Senator L'Estrange, and I understand his enthusiasm as a young man when he looks at old IRA men in his constituency.  They are probably writing to him, despite his <Col N="1715" /> youth, asking him to have things done as referred to by Senator Hayes and Senator O'Sullivan earlier tonight. There is a degree of penury existing amongst old soldiers right back to 1917 and it is our job to rectify it no matter who is in power, because there is one thing we agree on and it is that those men should be fairly treated. From 1922, we have had Governments mainly composed of IRA men and they have done little or nothing for the Old IRA, their own comrades. You cannot blame the average man for being sceptical about the past.  In my experience&mdash;and I have reasonably wide experience in the Old IRA&mdash;it is only the Old IRA who talk about the Old IRA, who erect monuments to them and say that the Old IRA were the greatest people on earth, but the people who can do them good and who know that to be true do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>One could speak for many hours on this subject.  I could bring a lot of comment to bear on it.  I will say finally that despite what others may think, this is a move in the right direction&mdash;a 20 per cent.  rise to the Old IRA is, after all, one-fifth more than what they have got.  In the lower grades, it is not something on which one could go out and have a wonderful night, but I am prepared to trust the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence.  I am prepared to believe that the Army will achieve parity with the existing rates next year.  If not, I will be more than 100 per cent. behind Senator L'Estrange in his criticisms, but I have that feeling that a lot was done for the Old IRA this time and that a fair amount was done for the old soldier.</P>
    <P>The old soldier today is a man who, from the age of 18 to the age of 41 or 42, has given the best years of his life to this nation.  Some went on, foolishly, if you wish, until they were 50, and at the age of 50, the possibility of their survival in this rat-race for survival is very small.  They gave all they had&mdash;their youth, their manhood and all they could offer&mdash;in defence of their comrades.  They were prepared to lay down their lives equally in defence of Government property.  These men are fighting reasonably hard to <Col N="1716" /> try to secure a better pension and, despite everything, I think there is a move to give them that.  It is a pity that it could not be done this year. When they were working individually, approaching their appropriate Ministers, they were getting nowhere, but now when all State pensioners have formed this consultative council to which I referred, it seems to be an instrument for getting them the parity they are looking for and deserve. Please God, they will get it.</P>
    <P>I should like in this House of the Oireachtas to pay tribute to these elderly men who are gathered at crossroads all over the country who have served the nation.  They have not got the voices that some members of the Oireachtas have to make their case. They are waiting for us to give them something beyond a pittance.  My last few words are that there is a move in that direction.  Twenty per cent increase to the Old IRA is not too bad, if we are following that up, and in the case of Army men, the 1955 standard plus six per cent also is not too bad if it is on the way to parity with existing pensions in the Army.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <P>Having said those few words in Irish, <Col N="1717" /> I do not propose to hold up the House too long.  I agree with the last speaker that those in receipt of Old IRA pensions&mdash;military service pensions, as we call them&mdash;are a diminishing number. I should like to get from the Minister some time the number of recipients now as compared with the number ten and 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like, too, to refer to the question of Old IRA pensions being assessed as means against an old age pension.  I am aware that there is a certain concession.  An applicant for an old age pension is allowed a certain percentage free of calculation.  I think, however, that the percentage should be raised or the means test should be abolished altogether.  These military service pensions have been awarded to people on merit because they served their country and it was thought desirable that they should have some reward for the services rendered. Someone said to me recently that these people should get nothing at all because they never expected to get anything. They certainly did not expect it, but that is all the more reason why they should get it.  I should like the Minister to examine this question of the means test again.  I should like the stage reached at which these pensions would not be taken into account at all.  Failing that, I think there should be an increase in the percentage free from calculation as means for old age pension purposes.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It deals with those who obtained for us the freedom we enjoy to-day.  We owe them some reward for that.  The Minister is giving an increase of 20 per cent. and bringing certain other scales up to the 1955 rate, plus six per cent. He is generous in doing that.  In a few more years, there will be no need to pay these pensions because the recipients will have passed away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to disability pension, I should like to mention one type of case. If a man in receipt of disability pension is brought to hospital and dies, a doctor, who never saw him before, may certify that he died of cardiac debility, or some other complaint, but not the one in respect of which he has a pension.  The widow is thereby <Col N="1718" /> excluded from any subsequent benefit. I know of one case in the midlands where the widow was informed that, because of the nature of the death certificate, she was not entitled to any benefit.  The number of cases in which this might happen must be very small and I appeal to the Minister to bring in some provision covering such cases in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  While we may not all agree that the increase is as generous as we should like it to be, it is nevertheless an increase, and any increase is to be welcomed. I am one of those who believe that nothing is too good for those who achieved the freedom we enjoy to-day.  Some play has been made about those who receive such pensions. I am sure everyone will agree that when those men fought, they did not do so in the hope of getting a pension.  Most of them never dreamed they would see a pension or that they would get a pension.  Most of them joined with all their lives before them. Many of them suffered heavily and for many their lives were broken.  For many the whole trend was changed. Some who might have gone to university missed out on that opportunity. Many of them, if they had never taken part in the fight for freedom, would be in very good jobs to-day instead of trying to eke out an existence, in rather dire circumstances in some cases.  We all admire these people and, as far as we can afford it, we should be generous to those of them who are still with us. But for them, we might not be enjoying the freedom of expression we now have in our own Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to disability allowances, it is fairly common experience that when medal holders and holders of certificates apply for disability allowances, there is a certain amount of investigation and a certain amount of red tape.  This is something that should not exist.  I appeal to the Minister to cut the red tape and be as generous as possible with these people.  Nothing is too good for them.  I welcome this increase and, like Senator O'Sullivan, I hope that in the very near future the Minister will be back with us <Col N="1719" /> again asking for a further increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielHoganJnr" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number of Old IRA throughout the country with special allowances.  The present system of investigation of the means of these men is most uncalled for and unfair.  The man who gets a special allowance has to satisfy the social welfare officer in the locality that his means are below a certain figure.  If he satisfies the social welfare officer to that effect, he has a yearly visit from him and if his means increase by even £5 or if the officer can see that he has improved his financial position, his special allowance is reduced immediately.  One investigation of the means of these men should be sufficient.  The yearly investigation by the social welfare officer should be discontinued and the man who is found to be entitled to the pension in one particular year should be allowed to receive it for his lifetime.</P>

    <P>I take it I am entitled to regard the first speaker as the spokesman of Fine Gael in this matter and I must say he made some egregious errors.  He spoke about how niggardly and penurious the Fianna Fáil Government are.  In fact, he wanted to bring us back to the Civil War.  I am not prepared to go back to the Civil War on a Bill of this sort, not that I cannot do it with as much conviction, seeing <Col N="1720" /> that I went through it myself, as Senator L'Estrange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I had personal experience of it.  It is true what Senator O'Sullivan said, that nobody did anything for the IRA except Fianna Fáil. I was listening to Deputy MacEoin in the Dáil last week and he made the case that everybody who was sworn in as a volunteer under Cathal Brugha as Minister for Defence&mdash;he mentioned Cathal Brugha, <i>Beannacht Dé lena anam</i>&mdash;was entitled to get a pension. But what did Deputy MacEoin's Government do in 1924?  You had to have served in the Free State Army. Service in the Volunteers was good enough as pre-Truce service but to qualify for a pension, there had to be as well active service in the Free State Army against the Republicans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not make any remark suggesting that the Minister or Dr. Ryan were not responsible.  I merely said that a number of these <Col N="1721" /> organisations were approaching their appropriate Ministers and getting nowhere; then they united themselves under a consultative council and approached the Minister for Finance and they have got this progress.  Any more I did not say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan as Minister for Finance did not require any such urging to help the Old IRA. I should like to say to Senator O'Sullivan that the matters he has mentioned here about hospital treatment, the means test and so on, are constantly under survey in the Department of Defence, but it is not possible to give free hospital treatment to all the Old IRA as there would not be sufficient bed space for the purpose. Therefore up to the present, it has been confined to people with temporary disability pensions.  Only those are eligible for treatment at St. Bricin's.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an ceart agat. What I was referring to in the Dáil was applications for medals.  Deputy Tully had referred to a particular case in which he was then interested and on which he had a Question down, and the case was not meritorious.  Is Senator L'Estrange suggesting that if the political backing is sufficiently strong, I should hand out medals?  I do not intend to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I examine very carefully every medal application that comes to me.  If the verification is reasonably good within the standards laid down, then we always try to give the benefit to the applicant.  The cases <Col N="1722" /> that have been turned down are cases without merit.  Senators will appreciate that when these medals were first issued, no pecuniary advantage went with them.  There were many people associated with the movement who did not have active service in the military sense, people who gave a good deal of service not recognised for pension purposes, and they applied for these medals as a memento of their association with the national struggle.  There was not, perhaps, as close a scrutiny of the applications as there has been since the introduction of the special allowances. When the special allowances were made applicable to medal holders, it was decided that each case would have to be re-examined and that if a person had a medal to which he was not militarily entitled, that person would not be awarded a special allowance.  These, like the military service pensions, have a close association with membership.</P>
      <P>With regard to the military service pensions and the suggestions that the lower ones should be increased, Senator Carton referred to a pension of 2/6d. a week.  I did not think there was any one as low as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was very early on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has probably been increased to much more now.  I would like Senators to realise that the amounts of these pensions are a yardstick of the service given by the pensioner. They were never intended as a contribution to livelihood and that is still so.  It is suggested that we bring up the lower ones.  How can we do that in fairness to the others if the pension is a measure of the active service these people have given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To alleviate the difficulties of a number of Old IRA men who had very small pensions or no pensions, the scheme of special allowances was brought in.  I do not know if Senator L'Estrange is claiming that as a Fine Gael achievement but it did help those with very small pensions.  Very often, it is quite a generous allowance and, being a generous allowance, it is necessary <Col N="1723" /> that the claim for it be examined closely.</P>
    <P>I say to Senator O'Sullivan that there are certain items in the means test which, perhaps, could do with overhauling. It is a uniform scheme, uniformly applied and there is no discrimination, good, bad or indifferent. I do not wish to pursue this discussion much longer.  I think I have dealt with all the points made and I do not wish to be inveigled into the same line on which Senator L'Estrange introduced the discussion.  Let me say this before I sit down&mdash;your friend can express his appreciation by praising you, your opponent can only do it by criticising you, and if I am to go by the remarks which Senator L'Estrange has made, I think the Bill I have presented to the Seanad is a good one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give me any answer to the case I raised?  The case is one of a person who has a disability pension because of illness or disease and that person, when dying, is attended by a doctor who never attended him before.  In that case, he may issue a certificate giving a different cause of death and the widow will not get a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose an Old IRA man has a disability pension based on 20 per cent. disability and lives for 40 years after he has received the wound&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The law as it stands at present is that the death must be due to the man's pensionable disability if his dependants are to get allowances.  I have no freedom of action in the matter.  I am bound by the findings of the Army Pensions Board.  It seems to me that as regards the higher degrees of disability, the matter might require further examination, but I think the Senator will have to clear his own mind in regard to the cases that should receive favourable consideration.  If a man has lived for 40 years after contracting the disability and dies of a cause different from the <Col N="1724" /> pensionable disability, it is very difficult to disagree with the doctors who did not certify that the death was due to the pensionable disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

It will, to some extent, meet the objective which Senator Hayes is also endeavouring to achieve.  My <Col N="1728" /> amendment emphasises that only where the State is responsible for the entire salary paid to a particular official is the degree of integrity which we require involved.  The House will recall that on the last occasion we had some discussion about the different types of State boards.  The officials of some boards would appear to be remunerated partly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas and partly out of funds provided in some other way, from levies, fees or otherwise. My amendment makes it clear that we intend that only a person whose remuneration comes completely and wholly from State funds will come within the ambit of the Bill I think that is a good line of demarcation.</P>

      <Col N="1729" /> Government amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P>In page 3, line 27, before &ldquo;remunerated&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;wholly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 3, Senator Quinlan asked me to apologise to the House and the Minister.  He has had to go away on university business to Manchester. He will not be available for his amendments which he hopes to put down at a later stage&mdash;a hope which is vain, I think.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, to add &ldquo;but does not include membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have read very carefully what the Minister had to say about this before. I am still convinced that the definition of &ldquo;public office,&rdquo; including the amendment which we have just agreed to in line 27, includes members of the Oireachtas.  Members of the Oireachtas were in receipt of allowances.  They were in receipt of payments and expenses which were not salary or liable to income tax.</P>
      <P>In the most recent Act dealing with the matter in 1960, a fundamental change was made in that principle, although it was not stated on the face of the Bill or, indeed, on the Bill when it became an Act.  Part of the emoluments, to use the correct word, is liable to income tax and part is not, but it seems to me quite clear that members of the Dáil and Seanad have an office or employment which is wholly remunerated out of public funds, moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  As such, they are caught by the definition in Section 2.  If the Minister does not intend they should be caught, then I think he ought to amend the words to: &ldquo;but does not include membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was very persistent in his argument that this was not remuneration because the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; is not used in the Act of 1960, under which Deputies and <Col N="1730" /> Senators get a salary at an increased figure but it does not seem to me that the term used is important.  It is the fact that is important and the fact now is that what Senators and Deputies get is assessed for income tax.  Income tax is assessed on property, profits and gains. I think, therefore, that Senators and Deputies have an office of profit, a public office, and come within the ambit of this definition.</P>
    <P>The position is that where they are holders of public office under this, they are, therefore, subject to income tax, if the Minister is not right.  If the Minister is right that they are not so subject under this, then they have an allowance and the Revenue Commissioners are wrong and should not charge income tax on any part of the income.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly. Article 15, subsection 15 states:</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas may make provision by law for the payment of allowances to the members of each House thereof in respect of their duties as public representatives and for the grant to them of free travelling and such other facilities (if any) in connection with those duties as the Oireachtas may determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This afternoon, we determined certain other facilities for members of the Oireachtas, as we are perfectly entitled to do.  I do not know what the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; particularly means here. If &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; here is to be taken as meaning sums of money and expenses, which are not subject to income tax, I am in agreement with the Minister <Col N="1731" /> that that would be an excellent definition but that is not the definition now applied to the remuneration which Deputies and Senators enjoy.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how the Minister can reconcile the statement that what they get is not remuneration with its being subject to income tax.  I do not know what legal advice the Minister has got which would attach to the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; a legal meaning.  I have been unable to find a legal meaning for it.  As a matter of fact, if a firm gives an employee a sum of money by way of an allowance, it does not save him from the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners may charge him income tax, if they are not satisfied that the money represents payment of expenses legitimately incurred in the course of his occupation.  It seems quite clear to me that this definition includes members of the Dáil and Seanad.  It is also clear that the Minister does not want them included.  Therefore, they should be excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be room for considerable doubt about this matter.  If there is, the obvious thing to do is to put it beyond doubt.  The definition seems to differentiate between an office and employment.  It says &ldquo;office or employment&rdquo;.  We all know that members of the Oireachtas might not come within the definition of employment but I think there is every reason for saying that they would be caught in the term &ldquo;office&rdquo;.  I certainly think they hold office.  I do not think it is any answer to say that in the Constitution and in the Bills, their pay is referred to as an allowance.  Certainly, whether you call them allowances or salaries, there must be a distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution clearly distinguishes between remuneration and allowances.  It speaks of remuneration in relation to judges and other office holders and of allowances in relation to Oireachtas members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take the ordinary, everyday meaning of the word, and anybody who receives <Col N="1732" /> money for services rendered is remunerated. If there is a doubt about it and the Minister honestly wishes that this rather stringent Bill should not apply to members of the Oireachtas, is it not a simple thing to add the few words suggested by Senator Hayes and put it beyond all doubt?  When we are passing a Bill through this House, it is our duty to see that there are as few loopholes in it as possible and I think we should approach it in that spirit, in the spirit of saying it can be argued that what is in the Bill is not what we want and that it should, if possible, be put beyond all doubt.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 11, before &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert: &ldquo;and that its disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is directed towards confining the certificate given by the Minister under subsection (3) of Section 2 to cases where the breach of confidence is such as to be prejudicial to the safety and preservation of the State.  My view, and that of a great many other people here, is that it is unjust and improper, to put it very mildly, that a civil servant or a member of a tribunal should be convicted on a certificate given by the Minister as conclusive evidence where there is a breach of confidence but where there is no public harm and I am seeking this amendment to provide that if there is public harm&mdash;if the safety of the State is prejudiced&mdash;the certificate may then be given.  I refrain from making any comment now on a later amendment but having this thing in a general way is quite improper and unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="1734" /> support this amendment.  It seems to me that we, as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, have a very special duty with regard to this Bill.  If one looks at the history of parliamentary government through the ages in these islands one sees all the time that Governments are trying to strengthen their powers, especially in matters of secrecy, and one of the most cherished notions of the English monarchy, particularly in Tudor times, was that of secrecy&mdash;the star chamber.  I am here referring to something in the remote historical past but I do say this House has a special duty in this Bill to see that the Government, for the best reasons in the world, will not take too strong powers in this matter.</P>
      <P>I say again it is the tendency of Governments everywhere and always to take stronger and stronger powers in controlling what they consider to be secrets of State.  The very phrase &ldquo;secrets of State&rdquo; is almost a sacred phrase among politicians throughout the world so I feel this House, in possibly the last opportunity the Parliament of our country will have for considering this, has a special duty here.  Some of us are perturbed, despite the assurances of the Minister, by the thought that an honest person, an innocent person, may under this Bill be convicted of divulging secrets prejudicial to the State on a mere certificate by the Minister.</P>
      <P>There are two safeguards against that&mdash;the safeguard of this House or the other and the safeguard of the courts.  Here, without developing the general theme I have mentioned, I still affirm my personal conviction that this Bill is too drastically drawn, that this Bill might be used against honest and innocent people.  It is on those general grounds that I support this amendment and will support others of the kind.  I would urge this House to give this Bill special attention, deliberate consideration, despite the fact that we are coming on to the holidays, to the Christmas season.  It is the duty of this House to give a Bill of this kind the greatest possible scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest sympathy with Senator Stanford's <Col N="1735" /> views but I think he should have put them forward on some other amendment. We all must be very careful, but what are we being asked to be careful about here?  Senator Hayes wants to limit this to a certain type of disclosure.  Surely this Bill goes much further than that, and very wisely so.</P>
      <P>Supposing that as a member of the public, I am summoned before a tribunal to give evidence on some matter in relation to income tax and, in the course of that, I am bound to disclose my private interests in certain matters. If this amendment were to be accepted, that type of thing would be removed altogether from the ambit of the Bill. I do not think that the disclosure of my private affairs could be prejudicial to the State and a certificate, therefore, could not be given; but it would be very prejudicial to people called on to give evidence before such a tribunal. If they knew that disclosure of what they were saying might be in some way prejudicial to the State, then they would be very careful in what they said and probably would not be of any use at all to the tribunal as witnesses. I think that Senator Hayes, with the best intention in the world, is going slightly in the wrong direction. This amendment would not protect the liberty of the individual.  It would do the very opposite, in my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheldon has said what I intended to say, that is, that for the purpose of protecting the liberty of the individual, this amendment goes the wrong way around.  For example, we are all bound by law under severe penalty, to make income tax returns every year.  Let us assume that some clerk in the office of the inspector of taxes discloses part of a return but not the whole return.  Then, if your whole file has to be produced in court and your private affairs discussed openly, a very grave injustice would be done to the citizen.  It would mean in most of these cases, that citizens, rather than tolerate that publicity, which would indeed be hundreds of times in excess of the original disclosure, if the matter came to our <Col N="1736" /> knowledge, would make no complaint whatsoever.</P>
      <P>We are in a completely different position in dealing with a civil servant from dealing with a bank, an accountant, a solicitor or anyone else, in that we need not go to such people if we do not wish to.  We can go to a different bank or a different lawyer or accountant.  With the Civil Service, we must make certain returns and have no choice of whether to make them or not, and we cannot make them to somebody else.  If this amendment in its present form were accepted, a grave injustice would be done to the citizen rather than to the State.  It is more important to protect John Citizen, who has to make a return, whether he likes it or not, and to disclose his private affairs.  It would be doing him grave injustice to put the Civil Service in the same position as a bank, an accountant or someone like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat with regard to this amendment what I have said from time to time on the Second Stage and again on Committee Stage.  I fully agree with the approach of Senators Sheldon and Nash in this regard.  They are quite right.  Whatever about the merits of later amendments, the points they made are, to my mind, conclusive in deciding that this one should be rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I conclude that we did discuss this subsection on the Committee Stage, and the Minister put up quite a number of arguments that seemed to be a fierce and vague combination of evasion and illusion. I was endeavouring to make the subsection better than it was on Committee Stage.  I, therefore, put down amendments Nos. 6 and 7.  If amendment No. 7 were agreed, namely, that the certificate, instead of being conclusive evidence, was only <i>prima facie</i> evidence, I would be quite satisfied to let amendment No. 6 go.  I merely put down amendment No. 6 to indicate my dissatisfaction with the situation in which the Minister can use his certificate without any possibility of anybody examining it or doing anything about it for the purpose of helping to <Col N="1737" /> convict an accused person.  I wanted to restrict that power to the case of disclosures which would be prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, but if the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; were deleted from this subsection, and the words <i>&ldquo;prima facie&rdquo;</i> inserted, my purpose would be accomplished better, so perhaps we could leave it at that and come to amendment No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I simply add that I think the reason we are at cross purposes is that the Minister is trying to do two partly contradictory things?  He is trying to get at the spy, the traitor to his country, and at the same time, at the harmless civil servant who gives away some information about someone's income tax, which I do not regard as in the same category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am not in order in saying this, but there has not been a case in the last 40 years as far as I remember where a person's income tax was in fact disclosed.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 11, to delete &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>prima facie&rdquo;.</i></P>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted by the Minister, it would put him in quite a good position, enabling him to prevent unsuitable disclosures and at the same time, relieving him of the accusation that he wants to exercise powers heretofore not possessed by any Minister. If he substituted for &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; the words <i>&ldquo;prima facie&rdquo;</i>, then that would suffice to make the case against the accused person, as far as I understand it, putting the onus on him to prove then that the document was not secret or confidential.  It would enable the judge, if necessary, to see the document and come to his own conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is relevant to a statement made on 20th November at Column 1533, by Senator Nash.  He was talking about the introduction of this Bill and suggesting that the rules of procedure might be introduced into <Col N="1738" /> it &ldquo;so that we would not be dependent on a statute for one part of our law and on rules of court for another part of our law.&rdquo;  He added: &ldquo;I do not know whether it would be possible at the present stage for the Minister in this Bill to throw the onus on to the accused as is done in other countries and make them prove the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment has that effect.  I may say, too, that it is simply not true to say that the powers given to the Minister by this word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; already exist.  The Minister uses this certificate as conclusive evidence for a positive purpose.  What does exist, and has always existed without any enthusiastic support from the judges, but with rather grudging support from them in England and here, is the negative power of a Minister to refrain from disclosing a particular document in any proceeding, whether civil or criminal.  That power has existed and the judges have not been enthusiastic about it but they have for the most part admitted it.  But there never has been any such power, and I have the greatest difficulty in believing that the Minister has been advised that there was a power, to use a certificate positively as part of the evidence to convict an accused person or help prove an offence.  He may refuse to disclose a document.  That is negative.  Since the last occasion, I have read the judgments in the Cammell Laird and <i>Rose Tattoo</i> cases and I find neither judgment bears out the Minister's claim.  He is deceiving either himself or the House and, as I say, I find it very difficult to believe that he was ever advised in this way.  If he accepts this amendment, it would, I think, relieve him of the attempt to look for powers that are far too great and far too vague and leave him in a position quite satisfactory from the point of view of the disclosure of official information as defined in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment very strongly. Here we have an opportunity to strengthen the other upholder of the liberty of the individual in our country, the law courts.  It has been suggested that some of the terms of this <Col N="1739" /> Bill are contrary to the Constitution. I do not think that can be sustained, but we do not want in any way to infringe the rights of the law courts to decide ultimately matters of justice, and really the kernel of the attack on this Bill, from this side of the House at any rate and, to some extent, from the other side, is this feeling that the Government are taking too great powers.  They are taking powers too great against the law courts in this matter.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of this House to fight for this amendment very strenuously and put it through, if we can.  I must say I personally was rather disappointed that the Minister did not bring in some fairly drastic amendment of this section of the Bill because it is herein the danger lies.  Senator Hayes has put forward an amendment which safeguards the right of the individual citizen and safeguards the authority of the law courts.  I hope this amendment will be pressed or else that the Minister will meet it in some way because otherwise the time may come when even the Minister himself may see that the powers given here are too strong.</P>

      <P>I do not, because then the Minister threw a few decided cases at me, cases which I had not then read but which I have read since. In my considered opinion, and in the considered opinion of a number of <Col N="1740" /> people, this subsection as it stands is unconstitutional.  It is unconstitutional because it reaches into the court and seeks to do something which, under the Constitution, a court of justice is entitled to do, namely, to consider the evidence and decide what the evidence means.  Several cases have been before the Supreme Court under various Acts in recent years.  Quite a few of them have been held unconstitutional. Even as recently as yesterday we had the Customs Consolidation Act which has been on the statute book for many years.</P>

      <P>It was challenged and part of it was held to be unconstitutional in so far as it sought to enable the Executive to decide what penalty should be imposed.  In other words, it sought to take away from the court and give to the Executive the right to say whether penalty (a) or penalty (b) should be imposed.  Every lawyer who spoke on this section in this House, even some of those behind the Minister, expressed the view that the section as at present drafted is unconstitutional. That is something of which the Minister should take heed.  It is something which he should put right before this Bill becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>This particular subsection is, as it stands, unprecedented.  There is no authority for it either statutory or in case law.  On the last occasion here, the Minister quoted to this House two cases as authority for this section.</P>

      <P>May I intervene? My whole argument is&mdash;why Senators persist in not perceiving it I just cannot imagine&mdash;that under the present law information does not have to be secret or confidential.  The offence lies as long as what has been disclosed is official information.  The Bill now provides, in addition, that the information must be secret or confidential and this certificate has regard only to proving the secret or confidential nature of it.  In effect, therefore, there is no change in the law in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My case rests on two grounds.  First of all, the Official Secrets Acts to date merely deal with official information, whether it is secret or confidential, or not, and there is nothing new therefore in what this certificate purports to do because <Col N="1742" /> at the moment there is no need at all to prove that the information is secret and confidential.  That was my first point.  The second leg of my argument has all along been that this line of cases is there as evidence of a principle which the courts have recognised, that is, that where a Minister gives his opinion that the disclosure of documents would be prejudicial to the interests of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the courts will not go beyond the Minister's word in that regard.  I quoted these cases simply in support of the existence of that principle, and there is nothing new in the courts refusing to go behind the certificate of a Minister in regard to official information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he did not quote the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> case in support of his theory that this is not new.  May I quote what the Minister said on the Committee Stage on 28th November, at column 1494 of volume 55 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Mr. Haughey: There is a very good summing up of the law in this whole matter in the judgments given in the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> case by Judge Davitt and Judge Dixon.  If any Senator really wants to carry out any scholarly investigation of the law he would do well to begin with these judgments where practically every existing authority and judgment of importance is referred to.  One of the points that emerged from both judgments is that the law in this matter, in regard to the certificate of a Minister being accepted by the Courts down through the years&mdash;and both judges have stated it&mdash;is the same in criminal and civil cases except in one respect, in regard to criminal cases.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what Senator Hayes has said, the Minister may not have been aware that when he was quoting the judgment of the President of the High Court in the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> case he was quoting a dissenting judgment, a minority judgment, which did not prove anything. The Cammell Laird case arose in regard to a submarine, the <i>Thetis,</i> which was built by Cammell Laird.  In the course of its trial trip it went down and did not come up and several men lost their lives.  The dependants of some of these men sued Cammell Laird for compensation and the plaintiff sought in that case to have produced in court the plans and specifications of the submarine, the <i>Thetis,</i> and quite rightly, the First Lord of the Admiralty directed that the plans be not produced in court, on the ground that it would have been against the public interest to do so.  There the matter ended.  The plans were not produced and they did not prove anything.  Presumably the plans were required by the plaintiff to prove either that the plans and specifications were faulty or that the submarine was not built in accordance with the plans and specifications.  If the Minister had his way in this case, a certificate would have gone in from the First Lord of the Admiralty to certify that the <i>Thetis</i> was built in accordance with the plans and specifications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the headnote to that case it is stated:</P>
      <P>A court of law should uphold an objection taken by a public department, called on to produce documents in a suit between private citizens...</P>
      <P>At the end of that there is another paragraph which says:</P>
      <P>When the Crown is a party to a suit, discovery of documents cannot be demanded by the other party as of right, although in practice, for reasons of fairness and in the interests of justice, all proper disclosure and production would be made.</P>
      <P>This section here seeks to take away that right and to destroy the right of proof in a case where the people are the prosecutors, on the one hand, and an accused on the other.  Therefore, I say the Cammell Laird case is authority for nothing only what every law student in the country knows&mdash; privilege can be claimed on behalf of the State in the production of documents. The <i>Rose Tattoo</i> case is authority for something similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two detectives went to the Pike Theatre and witnessed the <i>Rose Tattoo.</i>  A case was brought about the <i>Rose Tattoo.</i>  One detective was asked did he get instructions from his superiors before going to see the play, and he said he did.  He was asked to produce those instructions and he said that he <Col N="1745" /> would not because they were a confidential communication between himself and his superior.  On the authority of his superiors he refused to produce them and, of course, he was not compelled to produce them.  However, he had to go into the witness box and say what he thought of the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> and leave himself open to cross-examination.</P>
    <P>The other detective went into court. He also saw the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> and sat through it.  He was asked in cross-examination did he send a report to his superiors after having seen the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> and he said he did.  He was asked to produce that report and he said he would not because he said it was a communication between himself and his superior officer and it was privileged.  He was not asked to produce it and it was not taken as proof. The witness had to go into the box and give his evidence.  Again the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> is authority for nothing but privilege.  Again there is a quotation in the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> case from a case which was heard in the Federal Court of the United States of America where it says:</P>
    <P>that, in criminal causes ... the Government can invoke its evidentiary privileges only at the price of letting the defendant go free.  The <i>rationale</i> of the criminal cases is that since the Government which prosecutes an accused also has the duty to see that justice is done, it is unconscionable to allow it to undertake the prosecution and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of anything which might be material to his defence.</P>
    <P>That is a statement which would commend itself to every fair-minded Senator in this House whether he sits on this side of the House or in front of the Minister on the other side. There is no danger that any damage will be done to the State by the information being produced in court and proved in court because there is a section in this Act which has not been challenged and which has not been objected to.  I think it is Section 12 which says that if the State so requests, the case must be heard <i>in camera.</i>  Therefore if there is any <Col N="1746" /> danger about the interests of the State suffering as a result of this information being given in court, the Minister's advocate only has to go into court and ask that the case be heard <i>in camera</i> and <i>in camera</i> it must be heard, in the absence of the Press, in the absence of anybody, except those immediately concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore I support the appeals made by Senator Hayes, Senator Stanford and others that this subsection be radically revised.  I would be perfectly satisfied with amendment 7, which seeks to make the certificate <i>prima facie</i> evidence instead of conclusive evidence, because the accused has the right to question <i>prima facie</i> evidence and, if he can throw doubt upon it, the State will have to take it up.  If it is conclusive evidence that is the end of everything; one important part of the case against him has been proved before he goes into court and nothing can be done about it.  It can be done retrospectively, as the Minister admits, months or years retrospectively. This is a shocking piece of legislation which should never have been introduced and for which this House should not stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering whether we are not all arguing at sixes and sevens on this matter, without having due regard to the overall position. My personal fear is only that the subsection may be unconstitutional.  My fear is not to protect the citizen but lest someone at some stage should be involved in some crime which would amount to treason to the State.  If this evidence was produced and it was found on appeal to the Supreme Court that the subsection was unconstitutional, then that person would escape his well merited punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought it was agreed on all sides of the House that there was not the slightest danger of abuse by the Executive of the powers given to it, that it was merely a question of the constitutionality of the subsection.  Perhaps I am wrong because I am speaking only from memory but I understood Senator Hayes to say on the last occasion that he did not think, and he felt sure very few people would think, that a Minister would give a certificate that something was secret and confidential, <Col N="1747" /> if it were not, first because before such a certificate would be given, a Minister would naturally confer with his Government and if he were subconsciously actuated by a prejudice, it was most unlikely that the other members of the Government would be so actuated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Senator Hayes to say that even if a Government were agreeable to do such a thing, the Minister's officials would not stand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood from the Senator's remarks.  We have to view this matter from its historical background.  The position goes back to the 1911 Act which provided that the disclosure of anything whatsoever, by a civil servant, any information which had come to his knowledge by reason of his position, was a crime.  In plain language, that means that if I bespoke a certificate of redemption value of a Land Commission annuity, the civil servant who gave it to me would be guilty of a crime.  To protect civil servants against that provision, there was a provision in the Act that no prosecution would be instituted under it accept by the fiat of the Attorney General.  Otherwise, the thing would get into an absurd position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1911, there has been a considerable change in methods by which official information can be disclosed. There are methods which were then unthought of, such as dictaphone records of conversations and photostatic copies of documents and so on.  Therefore, in order to preserve the security of the State and the public, it became imperative on the Department of Justice <Col N="1748" /> to introduce some measure such as we now have before the House.  The problem for the Department was to do so in such a manner as to prevent a ludicrous position arising such as arose under the 1911 Act and at the same time to protect information which is secret and confidential.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Department of Justice approached that problem is that they said that every civil servant has a certain amount of commonsense and if he should disclose information which is obviously secret or confidential, it is a breach of trust.  If there is any dispute as to the question of whether information is secret or confidential, the Minister, by his sealed certificate, certifies that it is secret and confidential and that evidence is final and conclusive.  However, that is the only aspect of the whole matter that worries me.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Bill would be drawn in the form that any official information disclosed by a civil servant would be regarded, <i>prima facie</i>, as being secret and confidential thereby throwing on the civil servant who had disclosed it the onus of defending himself and of proving that the information was not secret and confidential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not what is in the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but under the subsection the Minister has first to certify that the information is secret and confidential and that is then <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  You have a precedent for that in the Road Transport Act and other Acts.  Under the Road Transport Act, if a lorry driver has not a trade plate and is found to be carrying goods, the onus is on him to prove that the goods are his own, that he is not carrying the goods of some other person for hire and reward.  I had hoped that in every case, even without any certificate from the Minister, the onus would be thrown on the civil servant to prove that the information was not secret and confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have incorporated in the Bill itself the protection of the public interest which, at the moment, is dependent on decided <Col N="1749" /> cases such as those to which Senator Fitzpatrick has referred.  If a civil servant is prosecuted, all that has to be proved is that he disclosed official information and then, <i>prima facie</i>, the information is secret and confidential.  The onus is then thrown on the civil servant to prove that it is not secret and confidential.  I had hoped that rights which at present exist in the State would have been incorporated in the Bill thereby enabling the State to refuse to produce any particular file or document if, in the opinion of the Minister, the production of that file or document is contrary to public policy.  I felt that thereby the interests of everybody would be protected.</P>
    <P>I can realise the Minister's difficulty but my opinion is that the section is unconstitutional.  If that subsection comes before the Supreme Court, there is a strong likelihood that it will be found unconstitutional and therefore there is a danger that some utter scoundrel who has done grave injustice to the State may escape his merited punishment.  The Minister is advised that it is constitutional.  That being so, he is going to act on that advice.  If a Minister of a particular Department has experts in that Department, he must accept their advice and of course in legal matters it is impossible to say who is right or who is wrong until the matter is actually decided by the court.  I agree in principle that there is not the least danger of an injustice to an individual; my principal fear would be that some scoundrel would escape.  I do, however, see a way out of that: if the Minister had any doubt he could in such a case instead of giving his certificate, send one of his officials to court who would prove that the information disclosed was of a secret and confidential nature.</P>
    <P>The whole trouble is: What is the definition of &ldquo;secret and confidential&rdquo;? Is it secret to the State, secret to the Department or secret to the individual who has given the information? In the case of income tax returns, to whom are they secret?  To the Department or to yourself?  If the civil servants were not <i>prima facie</i><Col N="1750" /> guilty, onus would unfortunately fall on the State to prove it and it would be utterly impossible.  That is how I see the matter, but I wonder if we are not arguing at sixes and sevens.  Our whole purpose is to prevent unnecessary prosecutions and at the same time to protect both the individual and the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister on one point.  He is right when he says that the courts will always support the Minister when he has given a certificate of this kind but <Col N="1752" /> where I disagree with the Minister is on the manner in which he supports his certificate.  In the Bill, he supports his certificate only with his seal but in the past the courts have supported the certificate with an affidavit.  That is the main point as I see it in the Cammell Laird judgment.  I do not want to go on to plead the amendment which Senator Dooge and I put down but the important point is that all the Minister has to do is to put on his seal and the court is not allowed to inquire behind that seal.  In the Cammell Laird case, the Minister had to bring in an affidavit in which he swears that he has personally considered a particular case or specific documents, that he himself is satisfied that it is secret or confidential and that he himself is satisfied that it is injurious to the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us in earlier discussions on the Bill that he is not trying to change existing law but is merely trying to codify the 1911 and the 1920 Acts and to bring in certain cases of law but he goes further and that is the whole constitutional point, as I see it, about this subsection. The matter is of the very greatest constitutional importance as I see it.  I am afraid that I cannot agree with Senator Nash that everybody in the House is satisfied that there is no danger from an unscrupulous Minister. I think there is an opinion there.  As I said on an earlier Stage, I am not satisfied. Senator Hayes said that he was satisfied that we need have no worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes several cases about this amendment but they are all different.  I listened this evening with great care to Senator Nash.  His memory is extremely defective.  I have the greatest difficulty finding out whether he was or was not in favour of the section. He voted for its retention in the Bill.  I never spoke about this subsection being unconstitutional.  I never said a word about that.  It was Senator Nash himself who said it was unconstitutional. I am not a bit worried about its unconstitutionality. It may very well be unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1755" /> Let me give an example of the Minister's views of the courts.  This amendment of mine is to curb the Minister's certificate.  The Minister has a particular view about judges.  He does not like them.  On the Committee Stage of the Bill, an allusion was made by me to the only case that was taken under the Official Secrets Act since 1922.  That case was a malicious case taken maliciously by the Fianna Fáil Government against a colonel in the Army whom they did not like.  The jury threw the case out.  The judge said the case should never have been taken. The Minister's comment on that in these debates was that the judge made ill-considered remarks.  That is the Minister's criticism of a judge.</P>
    <P>This evening, my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, just casually mentioned that the Constitution was something you must construe and that as late as yesterday the Supreme Court found that part of the Customs Consolidation Act, an old British Act, was unconstitutional. The Minister's comment on that this evening was that it was still good law in Great Britain.  Of course, it is good law in Great Britain but there is no constitution in Great Britain and the Minister knows that.  The Minister's statement is a reflection on the Supreme Court.  They found something to be bad law which the Minister said was good law in Great Britain. The British can pass any law they please.  We are bound by the Constitution about which the Minister and his Party are never tired of boasting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the amendment.  It discloses the Minister's view of the courts.  He wants to keep the courts out.  He made a remark which is a reflection on the Supreme Court&mdash;he must know he is wrong&mdash; that it is still good law in Great Britain but it may be, indeed is, bad law here. The Supreme Court, which is the proper court, found it was contrary to our Constitution.  The Minister is aware of the difference between the two situations.</P>
      <P>I do not understand Senator Nash's point about the constitutionality of this matter.  I am not worried about that at all.  It is arguable, of course, that the finding of a matter of fact is for the courts and not for the Minister.  If Senator Nash is worried as he says he is&mdash;I am not quite clear&mdash;then I think that with his knowledge of the historical background and practice of law, he could, perhaps, have put down an amendment himself.</P>
      <P>I never said any of the things which Senator Nash attributed to me.  What I said in the course of some remarks&mdash; it was in connection with an amendment by Senator Ross&mdash;was that this kind of thing was framed by sincere, competent and intelligent civil servants who wanted to encompass the whole world and wanted to avoid the courts because civil servants, and the Minister who know what is good for everybody, do not like judges because judges look at things from a different angle.  The civil servants want to keep them out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be acquitted.  The point in this whole matter is the Minister's evasiveness.  He has constantly misused the word &ldquo;privilege&rdquo;.  He has constantly said that the courts accept the Minister's word.  They do.  They accept it in order to keep a document out of the case.  The Minister is not going to persuade me he is so stupid that he does not know the difference between keeping a document out of a case and putting it into a case.  What he is doing is giving conclusive evidence against an accused person.  That is not the law and never was the law. It is not allowed in England and would not be allowed here.  There is some doubt as to whether, if he puts it in, he is doing something contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only conclusion I can come to is that the Minister is either deceiving himself or is engaged in the practice of deceiving the House.  He was very evasive about this whole matter.  He recommended us to read certain cases. He has told us he did not recommend us to read them for the purpose of elucidating what he had said about this subsection.  I read an extract from <Col N="1758" /> the debates which proves he did tell us that.  All any reported case suggests is that the Minister need not produce a document.  This subsection provides for the production of a certificate, which is presumably a document, which is conclusive evidence that goes to prove the guilt of an accused.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be allowed to do that.  It is not because he is unscrupulous. I do not think he is, or that he will be succeeded by an unscrupulous Minister but the Executive should not have that power over the citizen.  The courts should not be kept out of it.  The Minister is deceiving the House about it.  When we meet next time, I should like to see the Minister produce from the Attorney General an opinion that this subsection where the Minister gives a certificate which is conclusive evidence against an accused is already the law or the practice of the courts.  It is not the practice of the courts and the Minister knows it is not, but he persists in saying it is.  Senator Nash knows it is not. I do not know what the Senator meant by his last speech.  He did not put down an amendment himself; he seemed to be satisfied with this amendment but apparently he is not.  I do not think the House should be deceived on this important matter and I am therefore pressing this amendment.</P>
