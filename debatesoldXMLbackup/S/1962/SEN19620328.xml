      <P>I suppose the Minister has no remedy but subsection (5) of Section 6 is one of the choicest examples I have ever seen of the Parliamentary Draftsman's art of reference to something else.  Could it not be put in a simpler way?  It took me a quarter of an hour to make out what it meant.  The subsection is very complicated.  It refers to Section 10, Section 7 and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) (c), page 5, lines 2 and 3, to delete &ldquo;either generally or for a particular appointment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is really to subsection (3) (c) of Section 8.  Under this section the Appointments Commission are authorised to appoint a coroner and the Minister has power to make regulations which, of course, would bind <Col N="350" /> the Appointments Commission.  In subsection (3) (c) it is set out:</P>
    <P>the Minister shall, after consultation with the Local Appointments Commissioners, declare, either generally or for a particular appointment, the qualifications as to age, health and character for appointment to the office of coroner.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;either generally or for a particular appointment&rdquo;.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that there will be general qualifications as to age, health and character which shall apply to all appointments.  It is fundamentally unsound that it should be possible to prescribe different qualifications for different appointments.  I would urge that very strongly in respect of the qualification of age.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Minister considers it seriously he will come to the conclusion that he might be put in a very difficult situation if the section stands as it is now.  For example, there is a maximum age limit applicable for the appointment of rate collectors. I should hate to think what would be the position of any Minister for Local Government if he had power to vary that upper age limit. All sorts of pressure would be brought to bear on him from all sorts of people, and there would be no end to it.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think this power which the Minister is taking is unnecessary. It could be abused.  If the general qualifications were prescribed to apply to the whole country everyone would know where he stood, and no pressure would be brought to bear on the Minister from any direction. As I understand it, heretofore there was a minimum age limit for the appointment of coroners.  I think it was 30 years of age.  I do not know whether there was a maximum.  At any rate, I do not know what is the object of taking power to vary the age limit.  I think it is unsound, unnecessary and inadvisable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the provision in the Bill is quite straightforward. I regard it as necessary and desirable that we should have this <Col N="351" /> amount of flexibility.  It will, I think, on occasion be desirable to have a different standard of qualifications for different posts.  There is no doubt that the office of coroner in Dublin city and in Dún Laoghaire is much more important than the office of coroner, for instance, in one of our less thickly populated counties.  Indeed, in Dublin the office is practically full time, and the salary of course is about ten times what it is in some of the less heavily populated counties.</P>
      <P>As the Senator rightly pointed out, the minimum age limit prescribed up to now was 30 years.  I visualise that that will continue to be prescribed as the minimum age for appointment, but I can also visualise it being necessary or desirable in relation to a particular appointment, say, in Dublin city, to have a higher age limit because the office is so much more important in Dublin city.  It is also much busier, and we might want to get an older type of man with a great deal more experience.  I am not saying that this provision applies exclusively to Dublin.  I just mention that sort of situation as being one where you could justify the laying down of different conditions for different posts. The only variation that could be made in this regard is as to age. There is no scope for alteration of the conditions with regard to health or character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section we are really talking about prescribing different age limits for different districts and I think that is a reasonable amount of flexibility to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question one asks oneself is, is there any danger that it could be manipulated by an unscrupulous Minister to ensure the appointment of a particular person?  I cannot see how any such result could ever arise from this provision.  The Minister is still compelled by the section to prescribe the age generally for the particular appointment, and it would be inconceivable that a situation would ever arise in which he could so prescribe the age limit that he could, in fact, <Col N="352" /> restrict a particular job to one particular applicant.  I think that just cannot happen.  There is no danger in it. The danger that Senator Fitzpatrick seems to see just does not exist.  I do not think he can demonstrate that there is any reality in it.  Therefore, if there is no danger in it, we should let it go and leave it as it is, because, as I say, the small amount of flexibility in the provision might on occasion be useful.</P>
    <P>The matter has been fully argued in the Dáil and no one in that House was able to satisfy me that this could lead to abuses.  As I say, if it will not or cannot lead to abuses, I do not think the amendment is necessary.  Indeed, I have been thinking quite a lot about this provision and if I had to do it again I would come to the House and ask the House to let the Minister appoint the coroners.  The more I think about the office of coroner the more I realise that the qualifications which are necessary are not really technical qualifications but qualifications of common sense, balance of judgement and matters of that nature, and I am not sure that the Minister for Justice could not make as good a selection from that point of view as the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully agree with the Minister that the real point in this amendment is the question of the age.  I would have no objection at all to the Minister prescribing different qualifications for Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, and the rest of the country, but what I object to, and what I think is undesirable, is that the qualifications can be prescribed when the post has become vacant and the applicants are getting busy looking for the post. It may be that it is unlikely that the provision would be abused&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Or could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be unlikely that it would be but it certainly could be abused.  The door is wide open if the Minister were so disposed.  As I say, the one point that presents itself to me immediately is the position of the rate collector.  There might not be the same demand or the same competition for the post of coroner as for the post of rate collector, but I certainly would hate to be in the <Col N="353" /> position of the Minister for Local Government if he had power to change the qualifications for appointment of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that if he were doing it again he might come to the House and suggest that the Minister for Justice should appoint the coroners.  If he did that I would not have the slightest objection.  The appointment would be on the same basis as county registrars and State solicitors, and we would know where we stood.  That is a point of view some people might not agree with but they could violently disagree with it.</P>
      <P>If I were to talk for a week I could not say more than that I think it highly undesirable that when a position becomes vacant it is possible for the Minister to prescribe regulations which would exclude a particular person or a number of persons.  I agree that the Minister cannot prescribe regulations which would confine it to one person, but he could prescribe regulations which would exclude a number of persons.  By the process of elimination you might leave only one person in a particular county who would be interested in the job.  I cannot put it further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in asking the House to approve of this section made an appeal for a certain flexibility but I think his arguments have been in favour of allowing him to differentiate between certain types of area, between Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire and the remainder of the country.  I would ask the Minister would the section meet his wishes if he were empowered to prescribe conditions either generally or in a particular class of appointment so that we would avoid narrowing it down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this section very carefully and I must say, viewing it objectively, I am wholeheartedly in favour of the Minister's argument.  You cannot, as the last Senator said, set out now the particular areas in which you would require certain alterations and certain exceptions. The population in different towns and districts alters and it might mean you <Col N="354" /> would have to put in special rules for Cork, special rules for Limerick and then do you want special rules for Galway and for Waterford?  What places do you want them for?  In what places will the population increase and in what places will it decrease? Even if we thought so lowly of any Minister in the future that he would be dishonest&mdash;and I do not think any Minister of any Government has ever stooped to such a stage&mdash;and even if we had a dishonest Minister I cannot see how the section as it stands could allow anything improper to be done.</P>
      <P>The regulations are prepared, not by the Minister, but by the Minister in consultation with the Local Appointments Commission who approach the matter objectively.  The regulations for a particular district may require a person of more practical experience. You may need a lawyer or a doctor with more experience or perhaps a man with surgical qualifications.  Surely to raise a point of this nature is splitting hairs?  It should be left to the discretion of the Minister and the Local Appointments Commissioners where they feel special qualifications are required to decide what those qualifications are.  To suggest that those qualifications are such that you could exclude anybody in any particular county, particularly in those large populous areas, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, is not to deal with realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it has been suggested that any regulations made under this subsection would indicate one particular person for the position.  Senator Nash must surely be aware that regulations could be made under this subsection which would exclude certain people and if you exclude certain people that is a step towards including certain others. Senator Dooge's suggestion is a practical one, that is to say, that a regulation should be made either generally or for a particular area, a named area.  I know the regulations are made in consultation with the Local Appointments Commissioners but the fact is, of course, the Minister's age limit would be accepted by them.  In <Col N="355" /> the case of the Civil Service Commissioners what the Department want is accepted by the Commissioners and the regulations are nearly always made accordingly.  I think that applies to local appointments as well.  It is not a matter of very great gravity.  I agree with the Minister that it applies only to the age limit but it is true that in a particular place for a particular position a particular Minister can prescribe a certain age different from the normal age prescribed all over the country.  That could have the effect in special cases of excluding particular people.  Certainly, the notion that for a particular appointment a particular age limit could be applied could lead to the exclusion of certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is fairly well aware of the net point at issue. I am stubbornly clinging to my belief that this is, as Senator Nash put it, very well I thought, a reasonable sort of provision.  Do not forget that the selection has still to be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners and, as Senator Hayes pointed out, all an unscrupulous Minister could do if he is sufficiently unscrupulous to want to do so, would be to exclude certain persons whom he did not like. That will not enable him to appoint a pal.  So that, even at its very worst, all the unscrupulous Minister can succeed in doing is to render some person ineligible for appointment.  I do not think that is a very serious risk for us to run.  After all, if the Minister did do something outrageous he would be called on to answer for his action in the House.  That in itself is a further protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite seriously, I want to assure the House that this is a reasonable provision which is necessary.  If it were not, we would not look for it but we do think it desirable to leave this discretion in the Minister, that in regard to certain appointments he would have the authority to say to the Local Appointments Commissioners: &ldquo;In regard to this appointment we want a much older man, a more experienced person and we want you to prescribe <Col N="356" /> an age limit of 40 as distinct from the normal 30.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), line 28, to delete &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I can be very brief on this amendment. The net effect of the amendment is to provide that travelling expenses shall be paid to coroners.  The salary paid to a coroner at the moment is not very large.  Some coroners have quite large counties or areas to cover and personally I think it is reasonable that they should be allowed travelling expenses. Most other people in the employment of the State, with the possible exception of State solicitors, are paid travelling expenses.  I suggest the Minister should reconsider his decision in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a reasonable, straightforward request and one with which one would have a great deal of sympathy.  However, I cannot accept the amendment.  I should point out to the House that the coroner's salary is paid by the local authorities.  Apart from any other considerations I would not like to add an expense of this nature on to the local authorities without prior consultation with them and the Minister for Local Government.</P>
      <P>I want also to mention this aspect of the matter.  The office of coroner is to a considerable extent a prestige appointment.  There is a benefit to be derived from being appointed coroner which cannot be measured in money terms.  The salary attaching to the particular appointment is not everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Senators will realise that there is a certain amount of benefit to be gained by being a coroner in a district apart from the financial reward.  The Senator should keep that in mind when considering this matter.  It has always <Col N="357" /> been the law that the coroner's salary includes his out-of-pocket expenses, travelling and so on.  I do not feel justified in asking local authorities to make a change.  I do not think there is any real complaint from coroners themselves in regard to it.  If there were, it is always open to them to procure an increase in salary itself.  I should not like to contemplate a situation where we would get around to paying full-scale travelling and out-of-pocket expenses, with all that that means.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 9 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a point the last day we were discussing the Bill.  Is it necessary to have subsection (4) there when we already have, under subsection (2), &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister&rdquo;?  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>On a review under this section of a salary, the local authority shall, subject to the approval of the Minister, make a determination (in this section referred to as a provisional determination) that the salary shall be increased in a specified manner or that it shall be confirmed.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>Where a coroner is dissatisfied with a provisional determination, he may, within three months after being informed of the terms of the determination, appeal against it to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already approved of this scheme under subsection (2) and we have what seems an unnecessary appeal again to the Minister under subsection (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to leave that as it is.  As I see it, the object of subsection (2) is that the local authority would submit proposals to the Minister and if the Minister considers those proposals reasonable he would approve of the salary, without, of course, having heard the coroner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> Under subsection (4), if the coroner is dissatisfied he comes along to the Minister, for the first time, with his case and he says: &ldquo;I am not satisfied.&rdquo; The Minister can then look at the proposals from the coroner's point of view. It would be a mistake to interfere with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick has put it exactly as I would have put it myself.  The original function of the Minister is merely to approve the determination of the local authority.  The local authority are making the determination. In the second case, the Minister would review the situation in the light of the representations made to him by the coroner.  There is that difference.  On the second occasion, the Minister is actually determining the appeal himself.  As Senator Fitzpatrick says, the section is all right as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority may decide the amount of the salary.  They say: &ldquo;We can afford what we think is sufficient in this area, considering the work the coroner has had to do in the past two or five years.  We know what it is.  We say that £100 is quite sufficient.&rdquo;  If the coroner questions or disagrees with that he has his own remedy if he does not think it sufficient. Why should he appeal to the Minister over the head of the local authority? In these cases, an increase would probably be given by reason of an appeal. It is going over the head of the local authority who have already decided, with their local knowledge, that so much is a sufficient salary to give to the coroner.  Then the coroner can go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;I want more&rdquo; and he may get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very desirable to have that provision.  You have a situation whereby the coroner was compelled to accept the scale laid down by the local authority.  He had no means of improving it.  The only alternative was to resign.  That would probably lead to reappointments every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is plenty of precedent for this course.  The coroner is an officer of the local authority in the first instance. In the case of County Medical Officers of Health, staff officers or other officers, <Col N="359" /> there is machinery similar to what is suggested in the measure to deal with certain questions of remuneration, where the officer is dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole says the coroner is going over the head of the local authority. I do not take it that by appealing to the Minister he is going over their head.  He is appealing against the decision the local authority make and which he feels is unjust.  The issue is being referred to the Minister to make the decision in the final analysis.  We have a precedent for that in many respects in local authority employment.  I think it is good that that provision is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect is that this provision, as it is, will make for uniformity throughout the country. The Minister will know the general level of salaries paid, and so on.  You might have a case of one local authority who would have a completely distorted view of the office and what it should carry as remuneration, and so on.  It is important to have one central authority like the Minister to whom appeal can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (5), line 50, to delete &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sergeant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Second Stage, there is a fairly strict obligation placed on a number of people, including the registrar of deaths, funeral undertakers and every occupier of a house or mobile dwelling etc., where a sudden death takes place, to report that sudden death immediately to the coroner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Of course, it may be very difficult for any of these people to travel a very long distance and report the matter to the coroner but subsection (5) provides that the obligation just mentioned shall be deemed to be discharged if he, that is the person concerned, immediately notifies a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector of the facts and circumstances required to be notified under that subsection.</P>
    <P>It may not be generally appreciated that the number of inspectors of the Garda Síochána in the country is limited.  Up to recently there were only 90 inspectors altogether.  Now the maximum number has been raised to, I think, 110.  I think it is true to say that a great many of those inspectors are stationed in the city of Dublin. By and large throughout the country a great many of the people never come in contact with an inspector of the Garda Síochána at all.  There are only one or two of them stationed in most counties and they are usually stationed at district headquarters for the purpose of relieving the superintendent or work of that nature.</P>
    <P>It could be, and, indeed, it is a fact that if a person were to report a sudden death directly to an inspector of the Garda Síochána in person it might mean that he would have to travel 40 miles.  That could quite easily happen.</P>
    <P>I also stated on Second Stage that I thought the obligation imposed on the citizens by this section could be amply discharged by reporting the matter to a sergeant of the Garda Síochána. The sergeant could report it to the inspector or the coroner.  If the sergeant did not discharge his duties in this respect, surely it would be very easy to take disciplinary action against him?  It is much more likely that a person would walk to the nearest Garda station and report a sudden death to a sergeant than that he would travel 20, 30 or even 40 miles to district headquarters to report a sudden death to the inspector.</P>
    <P>I urge this amendment strongly on two grounds&mdash;the convenience of the ordinary citizen and, secondly, that it is more likely that the intention of <Col N="362" /> the section would be complied with if the obligation could be discharged by reporting the matter to the local sergeant.</P>

      <P>I should like if the Minister would be good enough to consider accepting the amendment proposed by Senator Fitzpatrick.  The section is very strong&mdash;perhaps, stronger even than it appears at first glance.  Senator Fitzpatrick referred to a sudden death but the section goes much further than that. It says: &ldquo;or from any cause other than natural illness or disease for which he had been seen and treated by a registered practitioner within one month before his death.&rdquo;  Therefore, even if a person dies from natural causes, unless that person has been seen and treated for those natural causes within one month prior to the death, it would seem to me that the section imposes an obligation to report it to the coroner or the inspector as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can visualise an old couple such as there are in most farmers' or labourers' places confined to bed for, perhaps, some years or on the bed and off the bed suffering from senile decay.  There is no point bringing in a doctor because they are completely healthy within the limit of their years.  They die from natural causes and no doctor has been to see them for a month before the death.  When the death occurs, it has to be reported to the coroner or the superintendent or the inspector has to be looked for when there is probably a Garda station in the locality.  If the matter is reported to the sergeant, he sends his report to the inspector.  The inspector asks if there are any suspicious circumstances or not surrounding the death.  He reports to the coroner.  It can be suggested that a letter will do for a report or that a letter could be written to the inspector. Let us assume that there are suspicious circumstances surrounding the death which would warrant the coroner holding a post-mortem.  The funeral would be over if the report were by letter.  As the matter appears to me at the moment, I would very respectfully suggest that Senator Fitzpatrick's <Col N="363" /> amendment is a reasonable one and I would ask the Minister to consider accepting it.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), line 17, to add at the end of the subsection the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for a period of five years&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 29, subsection (1) provides that:</P>
      <P>Every deposition or note of the names and addresses of witnesses taken at an inquest, every report of a post-mortem examination made in pursuance of this Act and every record of the verdict returned at an inquest shall be preserved by the coroner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then subsection (2) goes on to provide that, when a coroner ceases to hold office, he is to hand those documents, which are important documents, over to the county registrar.  The object of that is obvious to me.  It is the intention to preserve these documents carefully.  As far as I know, there is an arrangement whereby every so often the county registrar forwards all his public documents to the Public Record Office in Dublin where they are kept as public records.  Of course, in the meantime, in the County Registrar's Office there is a proper system of <Col N="364" /> filing, a strong room for those documents, and a proper system of indexing. As I understand it at the moment&mdash;I have the word of a coroner for this&mdash; the coroner must forward these documents to the registrar every year.</P>
    <P>If this section remains as it is, a coroner appointed to-day to hold office for the next thirty-five or forty years can accumulate all documents of record which come into his possession by virtue of his office and keep them in his own possession until he ceases to be coroner, and then it is intended that they should be handed over to the county registrar.  In a great many cases those documents would have become mislaid because the office of coroner is very much a part-time one and quite a few coroners might not have any staff.  The medical coroners especially would not be expected to have extensive office assistance or storage space or filing system.  It is very likely that the documents would become mislaid and if a coroner became careless, though not to the extent justifying the Minister in removing him from office, but about filing or writing records, I can visualise this position getting into a chaotic state.</P>
    <P>Since I put down the amendment my attention was also drawn to the fact that the Bill as drafted provides that when a coroner ceases to hold office documents preserved by him under this section shall be handed over to the county registrar, but it does not say who has to hand them over.  The documents might be in the possession of the man's next of kin.  He might have been a coroner who lived in a hotel and the documents might be left there.  Is there an obligation then on the proprietor of the hotel to hand them over?  It is not even stated in the section that his personal representative should hand them over.  In order to make this section effective not alone would I urge on the Minister to accept my amendments but I would also urge him to bring in further amendments providing that when a coroner ceases to hold office the person into whose custody the said documents passed shall forward them to the county registrar.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this section needs to be looked into again, that it is absolutely <Col N="365" /> essential that my amendment should be accepted if the section is to be effective, and that the other point that I have just raised should be borne in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering if the Minister would have a look at this section again.  The purpose of this Bill as I understand it is to ensure that for the future there will be a minimum of unregistered deaths, that in all those cases where a medical certificate has not been given, by reason of doctors not having been in attendance for a good while before, deaths can be registered. As the Bill stands in the case of everybody who has not had medical attention within a year before death, even though it was due to natural causes, the death will now have to be reported to the coroner and the coroner is bound to have reasonably large records.  He will have the name and record of each individual.</P>
      <P>What strikes me is that if the documents should not be handed over more often than every five years there may be difficulties.  The county registrar must have a proper filing system and the means of being able to put his hands immediately on any record. Having regard to the fact that natural deaths having to be reported in the average county are bound to number perhaps a hundred in a year, if all these are bundled in together to the county registrar every five years I cannot see him taking his staff off other work to put them on to filing and building up an index so that those names can be picked out quickly.</P>
      <P>All those reports of the coroner and all his records should be handed over to the county registrar's office once in each year.  Thereby you would have a proper filing system, proper indexing and everything in order, as well as everything in one office and continuity of office and building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also think that not only should there be an obligation to do that but in the event of the death of the coroner that obligation must be carried forward to somebody; and if there is to be an obligation, furthermore there should be a sanction.  You cannot impose a legal <Col N="366" /> obligation without a legal sanction or penalty.  Possibly the Minister has already applied his mind to these points and has ascertained that the solution posed in the Bill is the correct one.  If so he will no doubt explain to us, but I think there should be a regular handing over every twelve months.  There should be an obligation which, if the coroner dies or vacates or is removed from his office, should be carried forward to somebody else&mdash;the occupier of the building, the next of kin or some other person&mdash;and, thirdly, a sanction or penalty in the event of its not being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the points made by the two Senators who have just spoken.  I do not know if it would be practicable to have documents handed over once a year, because as far as I know the records a coroner is obliged to maintain are somewhat similar to those used by a registrar of births, deaths and marriages. If they are not in a loose leaf form it might not be practicable to have the documents stored as suggested once a year, but one thing that is definite is that they should be handed over at some regular intervals.  One Senator suggested every five years, another suggested every year.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the county registrar is the proper person to hold these documents.  The coroner is an officer of the local authority and we should have no fixed views as to whose custody they should be handed over to.  I feel that the superintendent registrar of births, deaths and marriages under the local authority is just as likely to be expected to hold them as the county registrar.  In any event the point made here regarding the county registrar sending the certificate records in his custody once in five years or ten years to the Public Records Office is a very important one. The entries in some of those documents at some time or other may be badly needed and some of them may be invaluable to some person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of handing over the residue of documents in the event of a coroner ceasing to carry on his office <Col N="367" /> by death, resignation or otherwise is not as clearly defined in the Bill as it might be.  I agree with Senator Nash that there should be sanction of some kind.  Alternatively, the appointment of deputy coroner is provided for under the Bill, and the deputy coroner could also have imposed on him some obligation to collect documents and certify that they have been handed over to the county registrar, or he may have to carry on the job.  I want to stress the desirability of the Minister having another look at the matter and endeavouring to have the section amended with regard to the points raised.</P>

    <Title>State Lands (Workhouses) Bill, 1961&mdash; Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to transfer the workhouse lands and buildings from the State, in which they are at present vested, to the local health authorities.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1922 the lands on which the workhouses were built&mdash;totalling some 1,700 acres&mdash;had passed to the Local Government Board for Ireland.  Under the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann, these lands became vested in the State. There was no provision in that Constitution, however, under which these lands, or indeed, any other State lands, could be sold.  However, under the State Lands (Workhouses) Act of 1930, the appropriate Minister, now the Minister for Health, was authorised to grant leases of workhouse lands for terms up to 99 years and in fact many of the lands have been so leased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 10 of Bunreacht na hÉireann, provides that &ldquo;all lands... which <Col N="368" /> belonged to Saorstát Éireann immediately before the coming into operation of this Constitution belong to the State to the same extent as they then belonged to Saorstát Éireann.&rdquo;  That Article also provided that provision may be made by law for the management of property belonging to the State by virtue of the Article and for controlling the alienation, whether temporary or permanent, of such property. The State Property Act, 1954, provides for this as respects State lands generally, but this Act does not apply to workhouse lands.  Therefore, under the present law, the position of these workhouse lands remains as it was under the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann and the 1930 Act.</P>
    <P>Under the 1930 Act, the Minister for Health, as I have mentioned, was empowered to grant leases and licences in respect of the lands for periods of up to 99 years.  The local public assistance authority, acting as the Minister's agent, may also grant licences for shorter periods.  The income from these leases and licences, whether granted by the Minister or by the local authority, is applied to offset the cost of local expenditure on health services. The receipts from the leases of the lands granted by the Minister to date amount to about £2,250 annually. Additional amounts, much smaller in aggregate, are received by the local health authorities in respect of licences for shorter periods which they have granted.</P>
    <P>While the legal position is that the Minister is the principal party in the leasing and the local authority may be his agent, from a practical point of view, I think we can nearly say that the opposite is the case.  When the Minister collects the rents he must pass them over to the local authority.  His position is in reality little more than that of an estate agent for the local authority.  The whole arrangement, imposed by the Constitution of 1922, is anomalous, cumbersome and wasteful and the limitation on the power of disposal is anachronistic and unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely wrote that sentence himself.  It is a collection of adjectives which no <Col N="369" /> one but the Minister would think of. The sentence seems to me to be anachronistic and unnecessary and it is also untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it to the judgment which students of history will eventually pass upon this transaction. The purpose of this Bill is to rationalise the administration of these lands and bring it into line with the administration of other lands held by local authorities for public purposes.</P>
      <P>As to the Bill itself, Section 1 contains the necessary definitions.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for the transfer of the lands to the local health authorities. These transfers will take effect automatically, on the commencement of the Act, without further legal formalities. The interest in any parcel of land which will pass to the health authority is the present interest of the State in the parcel, that is to say that, if the parcel is not held freehold by the State, the rights of the successors of the person who granted the lease originally for workhouse purposes are preserved.</P>
      <P>The section also provides that the benefits of any covenants or agreements, which may be contained in an existing lease or licence granted since the lands were acquired for workhouse purposes, will be transferred to the health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also provided in the section that lands which are at the present time being used by a local authority for purposes other than the health services can continue to be so used and can indeed be regarded as having been acquired for such purposes.  One important and beneficial result which should spring from this provision is that, in cases where labourers' cottages have been built on workhouse lands held by the State in fee simple, the county council concerned will be enabled to vest the ownership of such cottages in the tenants who occupy them.  Up to now this has not been possible as the county council, as housing authority, would merely have held a lease of the lands for 99 years or less, and, consequently, would not have held the kind of title to the lands <Col N="370" /> which is necessary to enable them to vest the cottages.</P>
    <P>With this exception, the lands will, under the Bill, in their future use and disposal be subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 1947.  That Act prescribes the procedure to be employed when the disposal of lands held by the health authorities is being undertaken.  It contains very full safeguards in regard to such disposals and applies the provisions of Section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1946, to all disposals for more than one year. The section in question provides that the elected members of the local authority must be supplied with very full information concerning any proposed disposal and, if they are not satisfied with every aspect of the disposal, they may veto it.  Disposal is also subject to the sanction of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the Bill, the Minister for Health will be obliged to present half-yearly reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas on disposals of workhouse lands of which he has approved.  Leases for less than 21 years will be exempted from this requirement. Similar provision as respects other State lands is contained in the State Property Act, 1954.  Though the workhouse lands will not in future be State lands, I have thought it preferable to maintain the practice whereby the Oireachtas is kept informed of important transactions concerning them.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the short title and commencement of the Bill.  I hope that it will be possible to bring it into operation at the same time for all the lands concerned but in case some unforeseen legal or other difficulty may be encountered in a particular case, the section is so framed that the coming into operation of the transfer of ownership can be deferred for particular lands if that proves necessary.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill constitute a minor but, I think, logical step in improving the statute law with which I am concerned and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Minister's last <Col N="371" /> sentence that the proposals in the Bill constitute a minor but logical step in improving the statute law in regard to workhouses and workhouse lands.  I shall not follow the Minister into what the poet called the &ldquo;old unhappy far off things and battles long ago&rdquo; in any adjectival conflict.  The Bill is necessary and desirable and the provision by which the Oireachtas will be kept informed of the proposals for disposing of land is a good one.  Therefore the Bill is one to be approved of and accepted.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a very welcome one in many ways, not the least being the provision which concerns the position of cottiers on these workhouse lands.  As the Minister explained, the Bill is for the purpose of transferring the lands and buildings of former workhouses to the local authorities.  Local authorities who had such lands will be enabled to permit the occupants of cottages on the land to be vested, which was something they were prevented from doing while they did not own the land.</P>

Now the houses can be vested in the occupiers.  I remember the old Scariff Workhouse which is a half a mile from where I live.  We established a creamery there.  We also gave leave to people to build houses.  There are about five or six more workhouses.  We had about nine and now there are about six more on hands.  Now they can be disposed of to advantage, for instance, for factories or something like that.  As I was saying, the cottages built on those workhouse lands will be able to get the benefit of vesting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that unless the Minister for Agriculture revokes the decision to end the scheme of guaranteed payments for fat cattle and carcase beef on March 31st the effect on producers of cattle might well be disastrous.</P>
      <P>The reason for this motion is that I very much fear that in the coming year the price of cattle will be such that many farmers will find themselves in a serious financial position.  I am basing this assumption on last year when there was a Government guaranteed payment, at one stage, of £2 a cwt.  If the same position prevails this summer the farmer will probably be taking in the region of £4 10s. to £5a cwt., probably nearer £4 than £5, for his cattle.  I am speaking now of beef cattle.  If that is the position, and if the Minister goes ahead and stops the guaranteed payment, the position of the farmer who is producing cattle will be very difficult.  For instance, in today's market the top price for cattle was in the region of £6 15s. a cwt. with the subsidy of 15/-. If the price drops 15/- a cwt.  in March when people have hand fed their cattle throughout the winter, they will be faced with feeding them for nothing because they will probably be taking less than what they got for their cattle last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This to me seems to be a disastrous position with which the farmers are faced.  I would not like the Minister to feel that I, as a nominee of the livestock exporters, was doing this on their initiative because that is not the case.  In fact, the livestock exporters <Col N="373" /> would prefer the guaranteed payment to be made direct to the farmers instead of to the exporters.  There have been suggestions that the exporter got most of the subsidy and that the farmer got none of it.  That is completely untrue.  If any proof is needed, I shall give a case in point.  We had a case recently where one of our biggest exporters of live cattle&mdash;in fact, I would say the biggest exporter; he ships 1,000 cattle a week&mdash;went bankrupt. If he were getting all this subsidy that could not happen.  I am just mentioning that to let the Minister know that the livestock exporter is concerned as to what way it is paid and that he would prefer that it was paid direct to the farmer.</P>
    <P>Last June or July, the guaranteed subsidy of the Department of Agriculture credit to farmers was something like £2 or £2 2s. a cwt.  There is no guarantee that the price of beef on the British market, with the importations of beef from the Argentine, Jugoslavia, Uruguay, will be any better next June or July than it was last June or July.  Under those circumstances, I feel that the farmer is facing a calamitous period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrell asked a Question in the Dáil to-day.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Finance, answering for the Minister for Agriculture, said, when Deputy Farrell pointed out that that might be the position, &ldquo;Wait and see&rdquo;.  Very well, let us wait and see but will the Minister give us an assurance that if we wait and see and if the price of beef is, as we think it will be, although we hope it will not be, as low as it was last year, he will compensate the farmer in some way so that he will not be at a complete loss?</P>
    <P>I know very well that the Minister will put up the argument that with full attestation this position will not prevail.  Unfortunately, however, more than half the country has not reached full attestation yet.  Even by the back end of next year, in my opinion, two-thirds of the country will not be attested.  You have all the south of Ireland which is not a clearance area. Take counties such as Limerick, Tipperary, parts of Cork, parts of Kerry, <Col N="374" /> parts of Clare&mdash;beef producing counties. The farmers who are not attested and who have to sell their cattle for beef may be faced with having to take anything from £4 or £5 a cwt.  For their cattle.  My worry is if that is the case then the bankruptcy courts will be very busy meeting many of these farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the matter. If the Minister has made up his mind to end the scheme on 31st March, I should like him to give me an assurance that he will devise a scheme to meet any collapse that may occur in the beef cattle trade in the coming year.  I do not worry unduly about cattle that are fully attested.  There is a good market for them for store purposes although I think that some of the attested cattle might have to go as beef because if they get too beefy they will not be accepted as stores.  Therefore, it might not be possible to sell all the attested cattle as stores and thus get the British guarantee.</P>
    <P>The British farmer, even with the scheme as it is, is getting roughly about £2 5s. a head more in guaranteed payments for cattle as compared with the Irish farmer for the same type of animal, that is, roughly about £21 or £22 extra on an average beast.  Our subsidy has been in the region of £2 5s. less.  Therefore, it should be considered how much less the Irish farmer will have to take in comparison with his counterpart in England if the Minister goes through with his decision to end this scheme on 31st March.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give the House some assurance that there will be no collapse and that he will introduce some scheme&mdash;if it is not a scheme that has hitherto been used&mdash; that will guarantee the farmer against a collapse in the price of his fat cattle.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion very strongly.  We are all only too conscious of the fact that if the Minister does not take action it can have a very serious effect.  The farmers have been on the march on the question of rising costs and reduced incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> In my view, this decision might put the tin hat on it.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to give every consideration before he takes a final stand on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion to a great extent also.  I had hoped that these payments would continue until perhaps such time as the farmers got markets elsewhere, if necessary, if prices on the British market dropped, and that possibly we would give this boost to beef production until we had secured outlets for some classes of beef on the Continent. That was my hope in the case of the guaranteed payment.  It was a great boost to attestation, I know, and I have heard of farmers outside the area who were hoping to get some benefit from this in the near future.</P>
      <P>I should also have liked to see the payment kept on at least for carcase beef.  It would have encouraged the slaughtering of cattle here and would therefore have assisted the provision of employment.  If the Minister decides: &ldquo;I cannot give it to all fat cattle to be exported but I will give it on carcase beef to be exported&rdquo; then it would be an enormous help to those large establishments started here which give a great deal of employment.  Even on that part of the beef trade alone, if we could give some extra payment to bring the price nearer the British price it would be a much-needed help.</P>
      <P>I live on the very Border.  One can hear daily of the difference in prices that my neighbours and my neighbours a few hundred yards up the road get. It seems important that we should try to bring up and steady the prices of beef cattle and hence steady the prices of cattle, shall we say, all down the line.  I should not like to see our having to revert to selling all our cattle as store cattle and not being able to produce enough to export carcase beef or beef on the hoof.  It would be of great assistance if the Minister would reconsider this matter.</P>

      <P>There are very few people who will not admit that the effect of the decision to end the scheme of guaranteed payments might well be disastrous.  There is no denying that the farmers are becoming disillusioned. They are suffering one body blow after another.  They are watching other sections of the community getting more than their share of the national income when the farmers' own share, as has been proved here and can be proved with statistics, is declining.  The farmers have to live on profit, and their profit is the difference between their cost of production and their selling prices.  From 1947 up to the middle <Col N="377" /> 1950s admittedly their costs of production were increasing but their selling prices were also increasing, with the result that they always had a reasonable margin of profit and could live on that profit reasonably well.  Since 1953, the statistics can prove that their costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that their costs are increasing and what the farmers want is a reasonable degree of stability.  These guaranteed payments that the Minister gave the farmers led to a period of stability.  They could plan ahead.  There is no greater bugbear or nightmare for farmers than uncertainty.  When this guaranteed payment is removed, as we have been told it will be on the 1st April, there is no doubt that it will lead to grave uncertainty and also, I maintain, to disastrous results for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite well aware that during part of 1961 the subsidy was as high as £2 per cwt., that is £20 on a 10 cwt. beast or £24 on a 12 cwt. beast.  If the subsidy had not operated at that time farmers would have had to take as low as £3 10s. to £3 15s. per cwt. for their cattle.  We all agree that if they had had to take that last summer it would have been disastrous for the farmers when their rates and overheads were increasing.  If the Minister removes the guaranteed payment on April 1st this year it is reasonable to assume that the same can happen next July, August or September and, if it does, the Minister must admit that it will gravely affect both the large and the small farmers of Ireland.  If the price of fat cattle is reduced it will hit all cattle down along the line and all farmers including the small farmer who sells a suck calf in Tipperary, Limerick, or Cork or any other part of the country because if the farmers in the midlands who fatten the majority of cattle get £15 or £20 less when selling they must try to pay £15 or £20 less for their stores when buying.  If we look at the figures in the Budget we will see that under all headings there are increases: wages and salaries, £5 million; health £1.5 million; defence, <Col N="378" /> £1.1 million; and it is only when we come to agriculture that we find a decrease of £7.3 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are there plain to be seen.  In 1961/62 there was £5,327,000.  In the year 1962/63, £200,000 is allocated, taking the figure in the Book of Estimates, which is a decrease of over £5 millions under that heading.  That is there in black and white.  I believe this withdrawal will definitely have a disastrous effect in the years ahead.  The majority of us agree that this year is heavy with destiny for the people of Ireland whether we decide to enter the Common Market or not.  If we are to enter and face the challenge to our ability to survive, to increase production, which we should be doing, and to hold our own in the Common Market, the farmers should get a fair crack of the whip.  We are giving incentives to industry and to other sections of the community to prepare them to enter but instead of preparing the farmers to face the challenge and the opportunities that lie ahead we are interfering with them in such a way that they will not be able to avail of the opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider his decision and at least continue this guaranteed payment for another year. In all probability the Minister will make the case that in an agricultural country we are only feeding the dog with part of his own tail when we give subsidies and he would be correct to a large extent.  Where 70 to 80 per cent of our wealth comes from the land, if we give agricultural subsidies we are only feeding the dog with part of his tail.  In Britain where 85 to 90 per cent, of their wealth comes from industry it is quite feasible and, I suppose, good economics to subsidies agriculture and they are doing that.  For the first time in the last 12 or 14 years the trend of <Col N="379" /> our cattle population is down.  According to the <i>Farmers Journal</i> of last Saturday, and I would say their figures are fairly correct, there are 214,000 fewer cattle in the country today than there were a year ago.  If those figures are correct, and I have no reason to believe they are not, then the outlook is indeed bleak for every one of us.  We are told by people we know that when we enter the Common Market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is exactly what I was going to say.  If the subsidy were maintained, instead of the cattle population being reduced it could be increased.  Instead of this reduction of £5 million, extra money should be given so that the farmers could increase the number of cattle, change the downward trend that we have to-day and be in a position to export if we enter the Common Market in the next year or two.  The removal of this subsidy will be a retrograde step which will have disastrous effects on the economy of the country.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator L'Estrange and his reference to the small farmers of Tipperary who rear a suck calf, I am reminded of the sophists of old who endeavoured logically to prove that motion was impossible. The other side did not bother to argue with them but just said: <i>Solvitur ambulando</i> or, &ldquo;Walk and you will prove it for yourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the farmers of Tipperary, or indeed the small or medium farmers in any part of the country, would be at all impressed by the arguments that have been advanced.  The Government, as such, have a responsibility first of all to keep the limits of <Col N="380" /> taxation within what the people can pay.</P>
    <P>The people are faced with a bill which we were told last week by the Senator who has just spoken was far too high.  The Government have a responsibility to see that the different sections of the community get a correct and reasonable share of the national cake which is to be divided. They have the further responsibility, when part of the national cake is being divided among a section such as the farming community, to see that it is divided equitably and properly and that the exporter, the middleman and the rancher do not take more than their due share, at the expense of the medium or small farmer, and the farmer, as Senator L'Estrange has said, who rears his own suck calves, or the farmer who keeps his own cattle up to the stage of stores.  Our exports of cattle are twofold.  We export store cattle and fat cattle.  It is the responsibility of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture to keep those two branches of our exports going side by side, and not to impose on one at the expense of the other, not to damage our store cattle trade by our fat cattle trade.</P>
    <P>This subsidy scheme for cattle was introduced for a special purpose.  It was introduced in connection with the TB Eradication Scheme.  It was intended to serve the purpose of seeing that farmers who had affected cattle did not lose as a result, because they could not afford to lose.  At that stage the Government could not discriminate between sound cattle and reactors.  They had to give the subsidy on all cattle, whether reactor or healthy.  The TB Eradication Scheme has made vast progress.  The West of Ireland is now a cleared area and the remainder of the country is a clearance area&mdash;all except six counties, five of the six counties of Munster, and Kilkenny. Clare is a cleared area.</P>

      <P>In July, 1961, the subsidy on cattle was 44/- a cwt.  In August, 1961, the subsidy was reduced to £1 per cwt.  One would imagine from that, that the Irish farmer was losing 24/- a cwt.  The price did not drop to any practical extent whatsoever.  Where was the 24/- per cwt. going in the meantime?  The Irish farmer was still getting the same price for his cattle. We have only to look at the prices quoted in our cattle marts to verify that.  We are now told that this subsidy should be maintained, that it should go to the exporters, that it should still go to the ranchers, and not on fertilisers and irrigation schemes.</P>
      <P>The Government would be failing in their responsibilities and in the duty they owe to a vast section of the community, the reasonably sized and small farmer of Ireland, if they were to pay any heed whatsoever to this motion which, I submit, has been put to the House in an almost irresponsible fashion.</P>

      <P>I am very glad you, Sir, induced some Senators to intervene because it is difficult to have to break into a deliberative Assembly like this and start off without having heard someone else speak.  Now that you have broken the ice, it makes it a wee bit easier for me.</P>
      <P>I should start off by emphasising to a somewhat greater extent the point that has just been made by Senator Nash, and that was the purpose of this scheme when introduced on the 4th July, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised, of course, at the reaction shown in some quarters to the announcement which was made recently concerning that scheme but let me say that no support scheme, for whatever purpose it was introduced, can ever be withdrawn by a Government without somebody saying &ldquo;Leave it there&rdquo;, even if the purpose for which it was introduced has been fully served. I do not misunderstand that sort of approach because I suppose it is a human approach and certainly it is an <Col N="383" /> approach one must expect in an Assembly like this.</P>
    <P>We have experimented with many schemes in our efforts to deal with the enormous problem of bovine tuberculosis. We have experimented with schemes for a while and have dropped them.  Some experiments are still on trial and they too will be dropped in due course.  When dealing with a problem like this even if you gave all the thought that you could, and had all the advice that you might receive from those with an intimate knowledge of all the difficulties of the problem, and the objectives, you would still find that the best thoughts and plans when put into operation would be found wanting.</P>
    <P>In 1960, when we introduced this scheme&mdash;it came into effect on 4th July&mdash;the British had, in March of that year, announced it as their policy not to permit unattested live stock into the country at all.  That was a serious matter for us at that time because the area in this country which was attested was so small and the availability of fully attested stores so limited, and the desirability of continuing the export of store cattle so urgent, and since that could only be effected by the export of once tested cattle we, the Minister and his officials, had to take a very serious view.  Very early on I saw what that problem would be like unless we could devise some scheme of a temporary nature to meet the position.  At that time those people who were in the export business, buying and exporting once-tested live stock came, with other interests, to discuss their problems with me.  One of their problems was one that I could understand very well indeed, and that was that since we were not branding cattle that had failed the 14-day test they were exposed to the risk and inconvenience to themselves and their business of going to the fairs and marts and purchasing unattested stock, taking them home, applying the 14-day test, then finding that a number would fail and they would have them on their hands.  They could not export them and their money would be tied up in these animals.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to imagine just how that would affect people in that important <Col N="384" /> business.  On the other hand, if they arranged to purchase their stock from farmers or feeders who had themselves applied the 14-day test, these farmers and feeders would do that work for them, but if they did not have to brand the reactors to that 14-day test these reactors would lie around the premises and they could be exposed for sale at fairs and marts and be purchased by traders in the belief that they were cattle that would have a reasonable chance of passing a test which they had in fact already failed.  The traders came to me several times and asked &ldquo;Why do you not brand these cattle?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;We have considered doing that many times but if we brand these cattle at a farmer's place, or even if they are in your custody and ownership, well then, they will carry a disfigurement that will result in the owner, whether he is a trader or feeder, having to pay some penalty because of the fact that the animal in question carries a brand that clearly shows he is a disease-stricken animal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our organisation at the time was not in a position to purchase these reactors, and treat them as we would treat animals purchased under the scheme itself.  I am dealing in this matter with the export side of the business and the importance of maintaining it pending our bringing the eradication scheme to the point where our store trade could continue.  As I say, we had not the organisation.  We had not the means of handling them and therefore a scheme had to be devised.  We had not been punching these cattle because of the reasons I have given when the scheme was introduced on the 4th July, 1960. Although it was intended to support the type of animal I have described, it would not have been possible to identify the animal because there was no brand and again, because of the urgency of this question, we said we would apply the scheme until the end of June or the 1st July, 1961 to all fats of a stated type and to all carcase meat of a certain quality up to and including the 31st July, 1961, announcing at the same time that it was our intention to review it on that date along the lines I have described, that is, of applying it to rejected cattle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> It was round about the month of July, 1961, that we came to consider this whole matter.  I shall not deal with the price factors; I shall not deal with the market fluctuations at this particular point.  I shall not deal with the catastrophe in relation to the prices that hit the trade at a time when no one would have expected it.  I am sure that all the knowledgeable people in the trade had not the faintest notion nor do they have the faintest notion as to what will happen the trade.  I shall not deal with that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>When June, 1961 arrived we did, as we undertook to do, review this scheme with a view to applying it from the 1st August to the scheme we had originally intended and that was of supporting reactor stock which were identifiable at that particular time because, since we introduced the scheme, we had been punching all the animals that had failed the tests.  Therefore, we had a year's rejects under the 14-day test. From the physical point of view it was possible then to do as we originally intended but it is like everything else in the world.  It is like all the ideas that men can have, that groups can have, that thoughtful people can have and that thoughtful members of groups can have about problems when they are looking at them from afar.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to find a solution for them.  You can have half a dozen of them but when you find yourself in close proximity to these problems with the solutions you devise when you were standing out from them, you will discover that the solutions about which you thought a lot are not just equal to the problem that has to be dealt with. So it was with us in June, 1961 and so it was with us apart altogether from any question of price fluctuations or the market conditions that prevailed at the time.</P>
    <P>We saw, for example, something that I will just briefly illustrate.  We saw that if we were to confine a subsidy in any form to reactor stock it might mean&mdash;in fact, it would in all probability mean&mdash;that we would be exporting to Britain, for slaughter of course&mdash;because no unattested stock would be allowed in except for <Col N="386" /> slaughter&mdash;a number of heifers and bullocks that failed the test here and which would be carrying the State subsidy on their backs and travelling to the same market would be that stock of bullocks and heifers which had failed no test at all and which were as sound as a bell as far as health was concerned.</P>
    <P>It occurred to our mind that it would not ring true in the ears of the British public nor would it look too sweet if the British reader were to have this served up to him in the way pressmen and correspondents can serve it up&mdash;sometimes in a helpful sense and sometimes in a destructive sense.  We always have to think, because of the importance of the business in which we are engaged, of the possibility of its being served up in a destructive sense.  We felt that if we were to do this, if we were to confine the subsidy as from July, 1961, to reactor stock only, it could mean that that stock would be more valuable and would make a higher price than similar quality beef and everything else which had a completely clean sheet as far as records were concerned.</P>
    <P>It could not be possible for any man who has not the most intimate knowledge of the workings of a scheme like this, even after a week's study, to see all the implications involved.  That is only one small aspect of this whole business.  He would not see it in the sense of being able to make a fair, objective assessment or criticism, if you like, of the problems that confront a Minister and a Department dealing with a situation such as this is.</P>
    <P>I have demonstrated that this scheme was very justifiably introduced for the purpose I have stated and that purpose was caused by the factors to which I have referred.  If Senators want the prospect of having another skirmish with the Minister and his Department, of a certainty I will be announcing in a very short time the abandonment of a scheme that applied for some years to the five Munster counties and one Leinster county. Somebody can put down a motion and say that we are withdrawing a headage payment or we are withdrawing some <Col N="387" /> other scheme that has been in operation from which some people will feel they have benefited to an extent to which they may not benefit under whatever amended proposals may be announced.</P>
    <P>We in this Department have got to examine all the problems and try to deal with them.  We have to try to devise ways and means sometimes even in a temporary fashion, as was the case here, so as to bring ourselves to the point where we will have enough elbow room and freedom to have another look at things and make whatever alterations we feel are necessary.</P>
    <P>The situation now is entirely different from what it was then.  The progress we have made has been tremendous. Even our neighbours who take a close look at us at times and who do not always regard us as a serious people&mdash;unfortunately, they do not always regard us as people who will apply ourselves to an awkward task like this as, perhaps, they would like to think their people do&mdash;are loud in their praises as to the progress we have succeeded in making since July, 1960. It is because of that fact that we can at this point now have another look at things and see where we are going.</P>
    <P>Let me just touch on the other aspect, that of prices.  That is the aspect to which those who have moved this motion would like to have this problem fitted.  Senator Prendergast is a knowledgeable man in the cattle trade, and I do not think&mdash;and I regret it as much as he and as much as any other man that it is so&mdash;that I can ever remember complete stability in the cattle trade.  Neither can any man who has been in the trade as long as Senator Prendergast or I, which is long.  I never remember an occasion when those engaged in it could look twelve months ahead and be sure of the outcome of any one year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">

      <P>Why should not there be stability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue that point now.  I am stating a fact. If the Senator were to take 1956 for example, and that is not so far back, <Col N="388" /> I do not remember beef prices being as low for many years as they were in that year when there was no support price scheme.  The fall in the price of beef and stores last May, June, July and August was really catastrophic, and in my Budget speech I referred to that fact, and I think it was the Leader of the Opposition who questioned some statement that I made in that speech expressing my doubts as to why that should be the case.  I had my suspicions as to why it was the case but suspicions are not enough.  My suspicions were sufficiently strong to warrant me referring to the fact that the price fall was catastrophic at a time when nobody expected it.</P>
      <P>The British Government have now established some sort of machinery to enquire into a number of matters including that one, that is, the mystery of the market slump and how it came about, what extent it had and who was responsible.  But apart from that we might as well face up to this: Senators who spoke on this matter have talked about export prospects for the coming year.  Of course, we all know that the exports for last year were extremely high.  The figures are there and there is no use in cantering through them, but the principal thing is not so much the number of two-year-olds or 3-year-olds that may be floating around the country, but the number of cows and in-calf heifers.  That is the fundamental thing.  If that is right then you cannot go far wrong.  That has been the case, that exports were abnormally high and according to the records there are supposed to be fewer young stock &mdash;I forget the figure&mdash;but the figure for in-calf cows and heifers has gone up and that was the very thing we wanted. The only thing I regret is that they have not gone up to a greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did anybody in this country ever think what a permanent subsidy on our store and beef trade would be like? We start with the cow, with her milk, consumed by the people to whatever extent they require liquid milk, butter, cheese, chocolate crumb and milk powder.  We follow the cow around and every commodity into which her milk is converted we support, and at considerable cost to the consumer and the <Col N="389" /> taxpayer, and rightly so.  The calf is left alongside, and we are now asked for a permanent support scheme for him.  I do not think that that is realism in the world in which we are living, and I am not afraid to say so.</P>
    <P>I was asked a question in the Dáil the other day to the effect that I should consider the advisability of subsidising artificial insemination so that the service fee would be reduced by whatever the amount of the subsidy might be. The answer to this suggestion, and the suggestion that is clearly contained in this motion, is the cow, what she produces, what you aim at when you encourage the man to keep her and support him in all his efforts to market the products that result, and not only encourage but subsidise him so as to ensure that he will feed her well.  Whatever loss befalls the store animal or the beef beast, as the lawyer said to the witness when an old lady whose name was Kitty was being prompted by the daughter in court and he objected to the prompting, &ldquo;Never mind Kitty. Kitty can paddle her own canoe&rdquo;.  So too will the bullock when he reaches that situation, and so he should.  Apart from that, let me show the unwisdom of any other course.  What is the main purpose of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme that is costing the country millions of pounds and that will cost millions more?</P>
    <P>Every Party in the House has agreed as to what the purpose is or was and that purpose which has been stated repeatedly was to preserve the store cattle trade with Britain.  Of course, there is a financial reason for such a policy and a very sound financial reason because if we send our cattle or most of them as stores to Britain, after they have been fed there for a few months they get, since 1960 anyway, the full British price support when they are sold as fats. Therefore, it is and it will be a far more attractive proposition for us to send the great bulk&mdash;they will not all go&mdash;of our cattle in that form as we used to do.  That has been the aim of all this expenditure.  Some Senator can get up and say that was foolish, that <Col N="390" /> we should not send out one beast as a store.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>He can make that statement until the cows come home, but I am telling Senators what the aim was when this scheme was introduced, in the knowledge that the taxpayers would pay millions and millions of pounds for it before the work was completed.  There should be clarity as to what the purpose was and I am stating that purpose fairly.</P>
      <P>Suppose you had at some time, as you had in 1956, a range of prices for fat cattle that were about the same as the prices for stores and assume that at that particular time you had a subsidy of 10/- per cwt.  Naturally, those in the trade would pick up £5 on a 10 cwt. animal and say: &ldquo;This animal could have gone out as a store; all right, but he is more valuable if he is sent out as beef.&rdquo;  You could in certain circumstances divert trade in a temporary way and break the continuity of supply of stores which in the knowledge of all who know anything about the business could have only a harmful result, to put it mildly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to the effect of the subsidy schemes.  I do not like and I never did like to accuse traders of sharp practice, whether they were small in number or influence.  We politicians can be terribly unfair.  Often a small section of the community may be engaged in a business that affects a very large percentage and public men may say that this small group appear to be doing something against the public interest, deliberately, to line their own pockets, and dishonestly. None of us is a saint and that is a line of approach which I never like.  It is impossible to eliminate it but it should be curbed every time it can be.  People have had many misgivings about the whereabouts of the subsidy payments, into which pockets they are getting and into whose pockets.  I do not like to carry that too far because I know that most of the people engaged in these trades, whether they are bacon curers, millers <Col N="391" /> or cattle traders, are people whom, if you met them in ordinary life and had any dealings with them, you would find straight and honest and you may take it as almost a certainty that if we are as good as they are we may not be doing too badly.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I still believe that no subsidy paid in this fashion ever went fully to the producer.  It should go to him but I doubt if it works out in that fashion.  Senator Nash very briefly pointed to something that it is almost impossible to explain.  I could not explain it.  You have a rate of subsidy of, say, 40/-, maybe a little over.  In July, 1961, at one time it was 44/-, I think.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 44/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the frightening thoughts I had when making the change was that there could be a rush to sell before July 31st, when this order would reduce the subsidy.  It meant that those who saw the subsidy at 40/-, 41/-, or 42/- said: &ldquo;out we go&rdquo;.  The markets were crammed with animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>That answers Senator Nash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  It is part of the explanation, part of it.  I concede every point without painful extraction at all.  The fact that we had that onslaught on the market, cattle tumbling in from every part that would otherwise be marketed in a more orderly fashion, would have, I am sure, the result of depressing prices, overburdening shipping facilities with the probability of stock having to be held over for a night or two, at extra cost, uncertainty, and all the rest.  At the same time, although the little shock was felt on the first market after July 31st, on the next one and the one after that prices seemed to steady back to where they were when the subsidy was twice as much.  Whatever the trade tells me and whatever may be their desires&mdash;it is all right to express such desire that the subsidy should be paid direct to producers and feeders&mdash;in making that suggestion it <Col N="392" /> is very often realised well in advance that however rosy it may look in print it is not in fact workable.  The only way we could pay it was the way we did pay it.  If we could decide the means by which we could pay it direct to the farmers that is the way we would do it.  I have tried to watch the traders not only in relation to this particular subsidy, and I have sometimes tried to defend them on a theoretical basis.  After my experience over the years I say that any time and every time I could avoid paying a subsidy of that nature I would avoid it.</P>
      <P>Such subsidy has other undesirable results.  Our neighbours in the North enjoy the British support price.  The market price for cattle there, which does not really affect the feeder or the producer because he has a guarantee behind him, is very low.  Because of our trade arrangements with Britain, as perhaps all Senators know, the movement of cattle is free between both parts of this country and Britain, but as a result of the subsidy here there was the extraordinary state of affairs that while in 1960 some 40,000 animals were imported from the Six Counties area, in 1961, 150,000 odd cattle were imported here.  That growth in imports from the Six Counties area was caused by the effect our subsidy payment was having on the market.  I am not saying they were not fully entitled to come in here.  It was their right.  They are entitled to come in here to-morrow and since they were entitled, they were welcome.</P>

      <P>That is a different question. There is no subsidy on sheep. I am talking about the effects of our subsidy.  Not only had it that effect but it had the effect of depressing our prices, and butchers in Dublin were buying Northern heifers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating facts.  I will go a little further.  In addition, <Col N="393" /> these subsidy payments of ours would not in the ordinary way be applicable to cattle that earned the British price support in the Six Counties area.  I said some time ago that we were not all saints&mdash;politicians or traders&mdash;and politicians in a very special way.  I am looking at Senator L'Estrange when I say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These cattle from the North have a hole in their ears.  We had to watch the cattle going out for export to Britain to ensure that they did not include cattle on which the British subsidy had already been paid. We had to investigate that, and some of our investigations are not yet complete. A subsidy like this is unnaturally introduced.  It is certainly unnaturally introduced in abnormal circumstances, and it would not be introduced in normal circumstances.  Having to be introduced in abnormal circumstances, it opens the way for every kind of effort to fill the hole in the animal's ear with wax or candle-grease, and then put two or three of them into a bunch of ten and think everything is as right as ninepence.  Those are some of the problems that have to be watched in subsidy payments.  In fact, there is not anything that could be said in favour of it, if one were dealing with a normal situation.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about the progress we have made, but that does not mean that we have not had our disappointments. We have reached the stage at which we have full confidence in our capacity to complete the task earlier than we originally thought.  We will, we hope, be able to deal with all of Leinster inside this year.  By the time we have reached that stage there will be an unlimited supply of good store cattle, and even as we are we are not too bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, we have now got confidence in ourselves and the farmers have had it demonstrated to them that the task can be completed.  I am looking forward to having the whole country, with the exception of those six counties, completed during this year.  I remember <Col N="394" /> all the pressures, and all the criticisms of the design and pattern of the scheme we set out for ourselves, and the efforts that were made to shake our confidence in it.  I believe, looking back now, that we certainly had the right approach.  With a full acceptance of that fact I make an appeal to the five Munster counties and the one Leinster county.  Some of them have done reasonably well and some have done badly.  I have always had the feeling that they had a conviction that they would be last no matter what they did.</P>
    <P>They had the feeling in the early days that the task could not be accomplished and were indifferent or if not indifferent they were in some cases even worse and because of their lack of confidence in our capacity or their own, they engaged in practices that would have knocked the bottom out of the whole effort.  Now we have demonstrated to them that it can be done.  The area will be small; the number of experienced people that we will have to release in the course of a few months will be much greater than it has been and I would ask public men and public bodies and the farmers in their own interests to make a serious effort because, excepting two or three counties which were reasonably good, there are a number of areas which I thought were poor.  They are not late yet and they might not be too long after the rest if they would make up their minds.  In the course of a couple of weeks we will make the final announcement which will outline the final scheme which we have in mind and our approach to the full solution of this problem for the whole country.</P>
    <P>It has cost a lot of money but it has been profitable.  The farmers and stockowners in the areas in which we have succeeded have benefited and profited.  If we can export all the stores that Britain wants from us and if these cattle earn the full British price support they should be more valuable as stores than any other form we can send.  Even if we send out a lot of them there are still a lot of cattle for the export trade and the beef and the dead meat trade also. Without being boastful I can say that this is a subject in which I have taken <Col N="395" /> a tremendously keen interest.  I am very pleased that we have done so well and when we meet people outside the country and receive their congratulations as to how well we have done, notwithstanding as I said at the outset the accusations as to our lackadaisical habits, it is very pleasing indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is a possibility no matter what, as the saying is, time may do or what king reigns, of our devising a support scheme for everything and certainly not a support scheme as far as the bullock is concerned, from conception to the plate. It just cannot be done and we shall have to face up to that.  It is better we should know it and not have people going around with the idea that from time to time the State can interfere if a dullness happens to hit the store cattle or the beef trade and then pull out again and pull in again if necessary.  That has not been the policy of any Government I know of and I do not think it ever will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt at length with the purpose of the scheme.  I am as well aware as the Minister of the purpose of the scheme. I know that originally there was only £240,000 or £250,000 set aside to meet this guaranteed payment.  But what happened this time last year and right through the summer compelled the Minister&mdash;compelled is probably the wrong word&mdash;but in sympathy with the price the farmers would have got the Minister felt compelled to make this the price they should get for all types of cattle.  I know that when the scheme was first introduced it was to be applicable only to reactor cattle. There was never any definition to that effect but the price of beef was so low that even finally fully attested cattle were being shipped to the beef market.  In that way they were qualifying for the guaranteed price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not here when I moved this motion and I doubt if Senator Nash was either because then he would not have spoken in the way he did about the exports.  I should like to point out again that the livestock <Col N="396" /> exporters would much prefer that this guarantee payment would go direct to the farmers.  In actual fact they have no sympathy with this motion of mine in so far as they do not want to be the object of any further insinuations either by Senator Nash or others outside the House.  I am glad that the Minister made certain remarks to counteract what Senator Nash said. The purpose of my motion is not so much to continue the scheme.  It does want that but the real problem is if a certain occasion arises, and it may arise within a short time.</P>
    <P>This week the price of beef was on average approximately £6 15s. Od. Possibly next week it may not drop 15/- a cwt. by virtue of the fact that there were a lot of cattle on the market to-day and beef will probably be getting scarce now until June.  Next July or August if the beef price in England is the same as it was last July and August, when 1/4d. and 1/5d. a lb. was paid in London for Irish beef, the equivalent of about £4 10s. a cwt. in Dublin for cattle, then if that occasion arises and all the cattle in this country are not yet attested it will mean that 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of the forward stores of fat cattle will just have to take about £4 10s. Od. or £5 Os. Od. a cwt.  I would ask the Minister, if he has definitely made up his mind, if he can assure the House that the farmers will not have to take this sacrifice price for their cattle.</P>

What are the unfortunate beef producing farmers in Tipperary, Limerick and part of Waterford going to do if there is a collapse in the beef trade in England such as there was last year? They will finish up getting nothing.  I hope there will not be a collapse in the beef trade but there is no reason to say that there will not be.

I would join with the Minister in his appeal for the speeding up of the bovine eradication scheme.  I agree that tremendous progress has been made and I give all credit to the Department and the Minister for the progress made in the past two or three years in connection with the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. I feel that by this time next year the country will be out of the wood and will be 90 per cent attested but until that happens the farmers <Col N="399" /> whose cattle are not attested, through no fault of their own, may find themselves in a very awkward position if the beef trade in England collapses in the same fashion as it did last year.  For that reason, I would appeal to the Minister not to drop the scheme for this year or if he intends to drop it he should give us some guarantee that there will be no collapse in regard to non-attested cattle and reactor cattle.</P>

      <P>The motion was put down last week and surely there was time enough to provide against the possibility of its being taken this week. Senators will recall that last year there were motions on the Order Paper and that from time to time the Minister was ready to take them but Senators were not.  They were postponed and postponed. Then when occasion warranted we were charged that we were cluttering up the Order Paper and making no arrangements to take the motions.  I am trying to provide against that happening now.

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 29.</P>
    <P>In subsection (1), line 17, to add at the end of the subsection the following:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of remarks made by other Senators, I of course would be quite satisfied, or <Col N="403" /> even more satisfied, if the papers were sent to the county registrars every year instead of every five years.  I was rather timid about putting down once a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Two separate matters are involved here.  There is a proposal in Senator Fitzpatrick's amendment which at first sight seems fairly reasonable but it is not so simple as it leads to two very definite problems.  In the first place this is a new provision.  At the moment there is no machinery for the handing over of these documents and if we were to accept Senator Fitzpatrick's suggestion we would, I think, put a very real and immediate strain on the storage space which county registrars have available.  There is that objection.  I think it is more desirable to introduce this over a period so that only as coroners leave office will their documents be handed over.  Otherwise we would have either now or in five years from now a sudden flood of documents descending on county registrars.  Over a period of years they can make the necessary arrangements to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Another objection is that I think I would be in serious trouble with coroners themselves if I adopted this proposal.  These records after all are to a large extent the coroners' own records and coroners would wish to keep them until they leave office and would object if they were compelled to hand them over at any stage before they retired from office.  Some of these are documents to which they must have recourse from time to time and I understand that fees accrue from the supply of copies of these documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are two very reasonable objections to Senator Fitzpatrick's proposal and sufficient to rule it out.  I am not sure that we are losing a very great deal by not accepting it.  All of us are anxious that the documents be preserved and we achieve that by the proposal in the Bill that if a coroner leaves office for any reason the documents <Col N="404" /> are handed over at that stage but not before that.</P>
    <P>The question has also been asked: who is to hand over these documents? Again I think the Bill is all right as it stands.  We do not indicate anybody in particular as being responsible for handing them over.  The Bill leaves the situation at large and merely indicates that they must be handed over.  The obligation is placed on whoever would be responsible.  If a coroner retires under the new age provisions the obligation clearly is on him to comply with subsection (2).  If the coroner dies in office then the obligation, it seems to me, devolves on his executor or administrator or on whatever person has his records in his possession. That is the right way to deal with this: to indicate in the Bill the simple obligation to hand over.  Naturally, in the normal course of events, that obligation applies itself to a particular person who for the time being has the records in his or her possession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, with all respect to the Minister, that there is any real sense in what he says about storage.  County registrars have a lot of storage space.  County registrars do send on their documents and records to the Public Records Office at given intervals, I think every twenty years. At least they keep the records in the office only for twenty years and that means that every year a certain supply goes to the Public Records Office. Furthermore, the amount of documents which Coroners would accumulate at one time would be considerable. I understand from one coroner that there is some obligation, perhaps not a legal obligation, but they do pass them on to somebody every year.  I may be wrong.  Some coroners will be glad to be rid of them and certainly a loss of revenue would not arise at all because depositions are required from coroners only within months of their being taken when they are required by a solicitor for criminal or civil proceedings which take place within a reasonable time after the depositions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still think that the amendment is a sound one.  I think that an <Col N="405" /> obligation which merely says the documents shall be handed over and does not impose that legal obligation on the legal representatives of the deceased coroner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be the coroner himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the coroner himself is alive he should hand them over but if his term of office comes to an end on his death that is where the difficulty arises.  It should be clearly stated that either his personal representative or better, the person into whose custody the documents come, should hand them over.  That would put it beyond doubt.  I am not pressing the amendment although I strongly recommend it.</P>

      <P>A coroner may at any time before or during an inquest cause to be made a post-mortem examination of the body of any person in relation to whose death an inquest is to be or is being held.</P>
      <P>I should like to pose a question. What authority has a coroner to call on a practitioner to carry out an examination? Supposing the medical practitioner in the locality, or the county surgeon, for some reason said: &ldquo;I do not want to carry out the post-mortem examination&rdquo;, has the coroner any power to call on him to do it?  Is it a term of the conditions of appointment of, say, a dispensary doctor or a county surgeon that he should carry out such post-mortem examinations as he may be called upon to carry out by the coroner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be <Col N="407" /> discussed together because amendment No. 10 was put down with the same object as amendment No. 9.  Deputy Sweetman raised this matter in the Dáil and, on consideration, I felt that I should meet his point of view. This amendment is designed to do that.  The point involved is fairly simple.  As Senators will see, Section 35 prohibits a coroner or a deputy coroner from holding an inquest if he draws up, assists in drawing up, or benefits under a will. Deputy Sweetman was anxious that where a will included a provision that a solicitor should be entitled to charge his professional fees for work done in connection with the estate, that would not be regarded as a benefit sufficient to disqualify him from carrying out the inquest.  Amendment No. 9 meets Deputy Sweetman's point in that regard.</P>

      <P>I suggested to the Minister on Second Reading that the same people should not be called too often for jury service.  I suggested that provision might be made whereby the same personnel would not be summoned to jury service more than once in every 12 months or couple of years and that jurors should be recruited from a wider variety of people.  Up to now the practice seems to have been that the same 10 or 12 people were always called.  That is undesirable.  There are many reasons why it is necessary that the scope should be widened.  In that way we would tend to get more impartial <Col N="408" /> verdicts.  Juries can have a very big influence in bringing in verdicts no matter what directions are given by the coroner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 14, line 36, to delete &ldquo;place&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;building under the control of a local authority or Department of State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 46 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Where a coroner considers it necessary to hold an inquest on, or a post-mortem examination of, the body of a deceased person, he may direct that the body be removed into a convenient mortuary or morgue or other suitable place (whether inside or outside his district) and kept therein until he otherwise directs, and he may make such arrangements for the removal of the body as he considers necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of that subsection it would <Col N="409" /> be possible for a coroner to direct that a dead body be removed to a private house nearby and kept there until such time as he makes such arrangements as he considers necessary or desirable, or until such time as the post-mortem examination was carried out or the inquest disposed of, or permission given to bury the body.  Under the law as it stands an obligation is imposed on licensed publicans to receive a dead body on the direction of a coroner.  That obligation was considered onerous and it has been removed in this Bill as I understand it, but this very wide discretion is given to the coroner to direct that the body be removed to a mortuary, morgue or other suitable place.  Human nature is human nature and sometimes coroners are not the most reasonable people whom one could wish to meet.  While by and large they may be reasonable you could meet an unreasonable coroner who would act in an unreasonable manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to press this amendment fairly strongly because it is no more than reasonable and in substitution for that very wide discretion which is given to the coroner.  I suggest that the coroner be given authority to direct that the body be removed to a convenient mortuary or morgue or other suitable building under the control of the local authority or a Department of State. Certainly, within a mile or a very short distance of where a sudden death is likely to take place, one would find a mortuary, morgue, or public building under the control of the local authority or a Department of State.  Why should one take the risk, even if it only happened once in a lifetime, of some unreasonable coroner deciding when a sudden death took place to deposit the body in an adjoining private house? That is highly undesirable and unreasonable and is an unnecessary risk which should not be run.  As I say, there are courthouses, Garda barracks, schools, dispensaries&mdash;one could give a whole litany of suitable places&mdash;where a body could be brought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the previous speaker.  He mentioned courthouses in regard to suitable places to which a dead body could be <Col N="410" /> brought.  There are places where you would travel more than a mile before coming to a courthouse.  I have villages in mind where there are no public buildings except possibly a national school.  My worry was in regard to having the body removed from the scene.  The Minister should take cognisance in this Bill of the fact that bodies should not be left lying for long periods especially after road accidents when measurements are being taken.  I know of one case where solicitors were brought in, in a case where legal proceedings were to follow, at the mid-hour of night with the body lying there.  I would urge on the Minister the necessity of having a body removed as soon as possible.  The coroner would fulfil his obligation by having seen the body without having to wait until all the arrangements were made.  It would be much easier on the people bereaved.  The body could be removed to the home of the people concerned, apart from a public building. I would urge on the Minister the necessity for having this terrible delay wiped out and for not having the body left there for everybody to gaze at.</P>

      <P>There is a point which I wish to make in regard to the removal of a body.  Although the Minister did say that with a little goodwill among a number of people, <Col N="411" /> the local authority, the coroner and possibly the Gardaí, there would be no difficulty in having a body removed after an accident, and when an inquest has been deemed necessary, I wish to inform the Minister that great confusion has occurred over that very simple matter in many counties, including my own when the local authority has a direction from the Minister for Health pointing out that the ambulance of the public authority should not be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to meet Senator Fitzpatrick on this when he bases his plea on reasonableness. However, I think I am right in rejecting his argument.  Indeed, a couple of illustrations he gave show how readily one could get into trouble in this matter.  A dispensary was mentioned. I do not think a dispensary would necessarily be a suitable place. As often as not, there would be quite a number of children in a dispensary and you might completely immobilise a dispensary by depositing a body in it.  The right thing to do is what we suggest in the Bill, to leave it to the coroner.  We cannot legislate on the basis that a coroner will be unreasonable. A coroner may on occasion act unreasonably.  We cannot help that. We must assume that coroners are reasonably sensible people, and retain the necessary latitude.  We say in the Bill that the coroner shall make arrangements to remove the body to a mortuary, morgue or other suitable place.  I think that is sufficient.  I would not regard a private house as being suitable if anywhere else were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect.  If we were to withdraw the discretion from the coroner altogether he would not be able to order the removal of the body to a private house even though the relatives would want that.  You could envisage a situation in which relatives would wish a body to be removed to some suitable private house, maybe <Col N="412" /> not their own house, and if we were to adopt Senator Fitzpatrick's amendment the coroner would not have the discretion to have that done.  So that from every point of view, it is better to leave it as it is and rely on the good sense and discretion of the coroner to decide in the normal way what public building would be availed of.  Local circumstances would be taken into account and the most suitable place decided on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <P>The section as it stands empowers coroners to direct that the body be removed but it does not specify whether he directs the local authority to remove it, and I take it the section allows the coroner to direct somebody other than the local authority to remove the body from the scene of death to a suitable place.  If expenses are involved in the coroner exercising his powers to direct somebody other than the local authority, is the coroner liable for these expenses and how can they be recovered?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whose business it is to provide the means for the removal of a body?  Is it the local authority's, the Gardaí's, the coroner's?  I do not want a continuance of this dual direction.  The local authority may have a suitable means of removing a body or they may not. I should like the Minister to define whether it is the coroner, the Gardaí or the local authority who are responsible for the removal of a body.  I saw a dead body lying on the side of the main Dublin-Limerick road for eight hours <Col N="413" /> while the coroner, the local authority and some other parties concerned were making up their mind as to which of them would remove it.  That should not be allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt as to whose job it is.  It is the coroner's job.  Section 46 says:</P>
      <P>Where a coroner considers it necessary to hold an inquest on, or a post-mortem examination of, the body of a deceased person, he may direct that the body be removed into a convenient mortuary or morgue or other suitable place...</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>By definition that includes every death arising out of a traffic accident on the road.  An inquest must be held and the responsibility for removing the body is clearly the coroner's.  Secondly, if Senators will turn to Section 57 (c) they will see clearly that the expenses payable in connection with removal or custody of a body are part of the fees and expenses which shall be prescribed by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Local Government.  Also, under Section 58 fees are to be paid. So that the answers to the questions are that the coroner is responsible and he is entitled to recoup from the local authority any expenses which he may incur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come to the question of ambulances.  There is no doubt that the normal sensible way for the body to be removed in the sort of case mentioned by Senator Hogan is in the local authority ambulance.  In that regard, I want to quote from a circular which the Department of Health has sent to each health authority and board of public assistance on 28 Meán Fómhair, 1957.  It refers to the use of ambulances in <Col N="414" /> accident cases.  The extract is as follows:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Health to enclose a copy of a statement issued to the Press in relation to the use of ambulances. The Minister does not wish health authorities to regard the circular of 11th March, 1936, as preventing them from using an ambulance to transport, immediately following an accident, a victim of such accident even though he is apparently dead. Having regard to the varied circumstances which may arise in this respect, the Minister does not wish to issue any general instructions on the use of ambulances in such cases; the decision as to such use is one for the health authority, having regard in each case to the functions of the coroner and the police authorities and, of course, to the over-riding need to have an ambulance available for the conveyance of sick persons.</P>
    <P>It is as clearly put there as it possibly can be that the local authority ambulance is available.  Indeed, there is an implication that it is available to remove or should remove the dead body following an accident.</P>

If he asks the local authority to remove the dead body and they do not do so and though it is absolutely clear that the local authority ambulance may do so, if it is not available or is refused, then the duty is on the coroner to make some alternative arrangement such as the one suggested by Senator Carton, such as to get an undertaker.

I know of a case where it took 14 hours before the body was removed.  The coroner was away at a football match in Dublin and the deputy coroner was not available.  Why should we make ourselves ridiculous?  Is it not obvious that expedition should be employed in this matter?  The Gardaí ought to be competent to decide whether the person is dead and have him taken to the morgue or a hospital. Why wait for the coroner's direction at all?</P>
