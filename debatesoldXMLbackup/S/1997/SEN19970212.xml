      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to replace the prefabri- cated classrooms at Pallaskenry national school, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to approve tenders for the interim development at University College Hospital, Galway, and approve the major hospital control plan for the construction of a proper acute hospital for the West.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to immediately reinstate his staff at Henshaws Meat Factory.  Dock Road, <Col N="2" /> Limerick, to enable them to reopen the slaughterhouse and to allow the plant function properly.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cotter of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to press ahead with the feasibility study for the Ulster Canal.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Neville's and Senator Fahey's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1, 28, motion 24, and 2.  Item 1 will be taken from now until 6 p.m. and I suggest 20 minutes per speaker. Item 28, motion 24, is Private Members' Business and item 2 will commence immediately at the end of Private Members' Business until 10.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the number of contributions we can expect on local government funding, it is appropriate that Members should be given 20 minutes to speak.  What are the Leader's intentions regarding the Education Bill?  The Irish Horse Racing Authority recently introduced a five year strategy for the industry.  Will the Leader consider making time available so that the House will have an opportunity to discuss a very important industry before final decisions are made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Members frequently mention the conditions of school building and the need for improvements.  It would be helpful, and would mark a new era of openness, if the Minister for Education would make available to Members of both Houses plans for all primary school buildings for the next calendar year; in other words, she could provide information on plans for development in each case.  This would save much time for Members and the Department of Education and the Minister would no longer come under political pressure to instigate improvements in a piecemeal fashion.  People would begin to see the obfuscation surrounding school buildings on a monthly rather than a yearly basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If people could gain access to the lists for January and June and see they were different, they could inquire about the reasons for this and I would no longer be obliged to raise such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case we are in the same position as the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Since our last debate on mandatory reporting of child abuse, the Minister has adopted a position on the matter.  It is time the House offered a view on the Minister's plans in that area.  I am unhappy with the final position.  I am not criticising the Minister or stating that I am right and she is wrong or <i>vice versa.</i>  However, this complex and complicated issue merits further discussion.  Members have received representations from various interest groups whether mandatory reporting of child abuse should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Wright's request for information on the Government's intentions regarding the recently published Education Bill.  If the Bill is brought before the Houses, what form will it take and how will it relate other legislation, such as the Equal Status Bill?  The Employment Equality Bill &mdash; which was passed in the Lower House &mdash; the Equal Status Bill and the Education Bill were published recently.  Does the Government have plans to deal with the three together? In my opinion, they are inextricably linked and difficult to separate.  I remind the Leader of his <Col N="4" /> commitment to make time available for a wider debate on education, particularly with regard to political involvement, local government representation and the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the debate already begun?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it intended to introduce legislation to give effect to the people's decision in the referendum on bail?  When will statutory provisions to support that decision be introduced?</P>
      <P>There have been calls for a debate on agriculture and the Leader indicated that he would make time available in the near future.  However, in view of the current situation, the fact that it is proving difficult for winter fatteners to make money, the serious effect of the closure of the Russian and Egyptian markets and the removal of export refunds, it is important that the House should examine these matters and that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should make a statement.</P>
      <P>The final matter I wish to raise involves coverage of proceedings on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  Are there precise regulations regarding the operation of television cameras in the Houses?  When cameras were first introduced, I recall that very restrictive provisions were to be imposed with regard to coverage of proceedings and, in terms of close-ups, the cameras were meant to change shot if the Cathaoirleach stood.  In recent weeks there has been an increasing tendency for the cameras to pan across both the Dáil and the Seanad.  I have no objection to that but have there been any contacts with the producers of the programme to ensure that coverage follows particular lines?  Recently a film clip was inserted in Oireachtas Report.  I welcome the more liberal approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Cotter could be a film star and get an Oscar.  Are there precise rules as to camera coverage of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities as soon as possible.  I raised this matter previously, there is need for coordination because the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment are both involved.  The report should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's comments on the <i>modus operandi</i> of the cameras in the House.  I served on the initial committee that dealt with this matter and a restrictive approach was adopted.  As Senator Dardis has raised the issue.  I hope those responsible for the decorum of the House will not retreat into their bunkers and that we will be dealing again with the fixed <Col N="5" /> camera.  It is a welcome diversity if those involved are more creative than was the case when the cameras were initially brought in.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to establish through the Minister, Deputy Dukes, who is responsible for transport policy, whether there has been a change in Government policy in the naming of railway stations.  The House will recall that in 1966, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Rising, the Government of the day initiated a scheme of changing the names of national railway stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sligo station, which was designated Stáisiúin Seán Mac Diarmada after the Leitrim-born signatory of the 1916 Rising, has now reverted to its Anglicised title of Sligo station, or Stáisiúin Sligeach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have asked me to raise this in a national forum because of the historic connotations. Can the Leader establish if there has been a change in Government policy in relation to the Government order of 1966 on the naming of stations after the signatories of the 1916 Rising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to nursing home fees.  There is evidence that those fees have increased beyond the rate of inflation.  Those fees are covered by the 1993 nursing homes regulations.  The criteria in the North of Ireland for determining when a person's home, for example, might be sold to pay for nursing home fees are more savage than they are here.  Are increases of 66 per cent over the last two to three years, which have reportedly taken place in Waterford, Tipperary and Meath, in line with Government thinking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a firm date on the debate on the licensing trade as this is particularly urgent.  I received a lot of support for raising this matter and I suggest it should be broadened to include the responsibility of judges who appear to issue licences without any regard for people.  They go through the process on a nod as if they were ticket collectors at a railway station, such as Kingsbridge, Connolly or Sligo station. They seem to exercise no judgment as to the consequences that will follow if these licences are granted willy nilly.  If a few licences were granted <Col N="6" /> in their back gardens in Foxrock, they might wake up a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not debating that matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past couple of days a judge, in her wisdom, chose to purport, against the Constitution in my opinion, to confine a drunken man to the north side of the city.  This is extraordinary, irresponsible behaviour by judges and it is time something was done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is fully aware that we do not discuss court judgments in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I thought I might.</P>
      <P>It might be no harm for the Leader to have a meeting with the public relations officer who is responsible for the image of this House because we need to present a more positive image.  I was amazed to hear members of the media, particularly the print media, saying that the offer of £21,000 to nurses was meagre and an insult.  I wonder if they know that Members of this House are expected to survive and to contribute on less than £20,000 a year.  They are always talking about politicians going on junkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could ask the person responsible to take this matter on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard about shooting oneself in the foot, but that is shooting oneself in the mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has probably shot himself in the foot and nothing was heard about it.</P>
      <P>A previous Member of this House, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, used to regularly mention the banking industry.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue.  I am sure the House has noted that AIB has reported record profits and that it recently bought a chain of banks in the United States for £800 million.  Perhaps we should find out when it will repay the taxpayer the money borrowed to get it out of a hole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should take that matter up with Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>He is in the Senator's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications when the independent regulator for the telecommunications sector will be appointed.  The role of this regulator is to monitor emissions of non-ionising radiation from mobile telephone base station masts and the MMDS mast.  Many communities are worried about the health risks involved.  Perhaps the Leader could also ask the <Col N="7" /> Minister if it would be possible to put a research programme in place to clarify if there are such risks because much of the research carried out is ambiguous in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on agriculture.  There are two areas which are of grave concern to the farming community and they should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry: the first is the lack of roll-on roll-off freight cargo to take cattle from this country to the Continent.  I understand ships are available but they are unsuitable as they do not have the proper facilities required by exporters and the second relates to the recent report which suggested that traces of meat and bone meal were found in 58 cases of animal feedstuff. This is a serious matter particularly in light of the debate over the past 12 months.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and for regulations to be introduced, and legislation if necessary, to ensure that meat and bone meal cannot find its way into animal feedstuffs.  Talk in both Houses about the good quality of Irish meat will have been for nought if we cannot guarantee Irish and international markets that meat and bone meal is not in the feedstuffs given to our stock.  Will the Leader raise this matter with the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Sherlock for a debate on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Some days ago I watched the return of participants in games in Canada where they won six or seven gold medals.  There was nobody to greet them from the Government or the Opposition.  I am sure it was an oversight but I genuinely believe that we should treat these victors in sport with the same degree of attention as able bodied people.  I hope that when the victors arrive home in future we will accord them the same welcome we give other athletes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator O'Toole for drawing my attention to the fact that one of the papers before the Seanad concerns the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  I brought this issue before the House during debates on, for example, the sheep premium scheme.  It is a most important paper and I would be sorry if we were to only have a short debate on it, particularly during Lent.  It is a very serious paper by the Environmental Protection Agency which shows the dreadful deterioration in the quality of water here within the last five years.  I would be grateful if the Leader would allow time for a debate within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to an ugly situation which has developed <Col N="8" /> in Spain in the past 24 hours.  A number of Irish hauliers have been caught in a French style blockade. The Spanish hauliers are in dispute with the Government about the price of fuel and have decided to call a halt to the movement of haulage traffic.  The situation worsened last night with the tyres being slashed on some of the vehicles and I understand that an element of danger is now involved.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of Minister Dukes and the Tánaiste?</P>
      <P>I also wish to ask the Leader for a debate on heritage grants.  There is a perception that some parts of the country do very well from heritage grants while others get none.  I know there is a logical explanation and who better to describe that to us than the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht?  I want a debate on the Ulster Canal as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the environment, particularly coastal erosion.  It is a big problem that is getting worse.  No positive action seems to be under way to do anything about it.  Our beautiful sand dunes are now just hills of sand that will soon be blown away.  On numerous occasions I have inquired about research into how to reproduce the marram grass that lasted for two generations and retained the sand dunes.  It will be an awful loss to the country if they disappear.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader arrange for a debate on the media?  Of late they are prejudging cases with no foundation as happened with a Member of this House recently.  A number of recent cases have had to be stopped because the media prejudged the outcome and printed photographs.  No one should be judged, except by the jury and the judge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My county enterprise board presented research information recently which indicated that county enterprise boards are creating jobs ahead of target.  However, this research also showed that most small enterprises have difficulty securing matching funds from the banks.  In the light of this fact and the massive profits recently announced by AIB, I support Senator Norris's call for a debate on the banks. Item 11 on the Order Paper is Statements on Banking.  Would the Leader indicate when this debate will be resumed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Farrell's call for a debate on the media and the libel laws.  I was disturbed by a full page advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> today which was below the belt in its portrayal of a former Minister.  The Minister was <Col N="9" /> not in my party but that is not the point.  This was a low form of advertising and it should not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also call for a debate on the banks.  AIB recently announced massive profits and the other banks will do likewise shortly.  We are living in buoyant times and the majority of the banks' profits are generated by the ordinary working person.  It is important that we send a message to the banks that they should start to reduce their charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finneran's comments on the export of live cattle.  There are difficulties exporting cattle to Europe at present as animal health regulations must be strictly adhered to.  I am glad the Minister is endeavouring to address these problems and that extra ferries will be provided over the weekend.  Would the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter?</P>
      <P>My second point relates to the charges imposed by Irish Multichannel which operates an MMDS system relaying television channels to domestic and commercial consumers.  Irish Multichannel's basic rental charge in 1995-96 was £164.45, this year the charge is £270.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this matter because this is a rip-off? Householders, pubs and hotels are being overcharged. The Competition Authority should be asked to investigate this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, call on the Leader to consider the possibility of a debate on the media, broadcasting in general, whether there should be a press council and code of ethics for journalism, which is deteriorating rapidly, and giving fair play to all political parties.  I notice that since the demise of <i>The Irish Press</i> nobody is giving the view of Fianna Fáil, which is the largest party.</P>

      <P>To add to Senator Kelly's point about a discussion on the banks, it would be wise if the Seanad debated the Credit Union Bill before discussing the banks because we would then be in a much better position to dictate to the <Col N="10" /> banks?  I ask the Leader for a debate on the Credit Union Bill?</P>

      <P>It is so long since the Order of Business began that I almost forget what was said.  Colleagues will have noticed that there were nine requests for different debates.  Clearly, there is a problem.  Many of these topics are worthy of debate and I have been giving some thought to that matter.  I propose that, starting in a few weeks, we will meet on Wednesday morning from about 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to devote time to the type of debates requested.  That means it is incumbent on those who call so persistently for these debates to make sure they are here on those particular days because Senator Wright and I have had experience in the past of people calling loudly for debates and then not being present when they took place.</P>

      <P>I would be very keen to give priority to the strategic plan for the horse racing industry, on which there is a very special vein of expertise in this House.

      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the plans for school buildings.  I suspect that would be an ideal motion for the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The question of mandatory reporting would benefit from the system of short debates to which I referred as would the Education debate, although I think the Senator has constant dialogue at the decision making level in Education. I am not sure he needs a debate in this House.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of the legislation on bail.  My understanding is that it is at an advanced stage of preparation but I will have more specific information for him tomorrow.  I agree that there is a need for a debate on agriculture.  I will try to slot it into the schedule of debates and it will be high on that agenda.  On the question raised about &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; and the cameras, my understanding is that there is a rule and it is not being obeyed.  Whether it is a good rule in the first place is another matter.  The question of liberalising coverage of the House has been exercising the broadcasting committee for some time and as soon as a decision is made I will report back to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Sherlock and others asked for a debate on disabilities, which is a priority.  There is neither a Government decision on nor Government involvement in renaming of railway stations.  I am not aware that it is happening and if so, it is a matter for CIE but to confirm that point I will contact the Department.  However, it is not something which would emanate from Government and to the best of my knowledge it has never been discussed.  Senator McAughtry raised an interesting question relating to nursing homes.  I suggest this would be a suitable matter for the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris' suggested a debate on licensing, which I hope to include in the new schedule. He also asked for a debate on banking but my memory of the last such debate is that it was seriously under-subscribed and most of the contributions did not enhance the reputation of the House.  Senator Cregan is right &mdash; the Credit Union Bill provides a good opportunity to debate banking in a wide way and I would be happier to leave it until then.</P>
      <P>I welcome the maiden contribution, not the maiden speech, of Senator Naughten.  He raised the question of the independent regulator &mdash; my understanding is that an advertisement will be placed in the next few days for that position and it is everyone's hope that it will be filled as speedily as possible.  Senator Finneran raised matters which would come under the agriculture debate but I undertake to refer the specific points to the Minister.  Senator Henry mentioned the quality of the water supply, which is another issue we should debate soon.  Senator Cotter raised the position of the Irish hauliers; I am sure the Department of Foreign Affairs is fully aware of that but if not, I will bring the matter to its attention. We could debate the heritage issue later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Farrell and Senator Cassidy raised the question of the media and I have said for some time that I would welcome a debate on aspects of that issue.  It is not a one-way street &mdash; there are areas where we as politicians should look at our performance and perceptions.  The report on the newspaper industry might provide a structure for the debate and I will see if I can make that happen soon.  Senator Lydon mentioned an advertisement which I think was no credit to either the <Col N="12" /> radio station or <i>The Irish Times.</i>  Senator Maloney raised the question of banking.  My answer to Senator Enright's question is yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be back in the House to discuss one of the most important issues which falls under my remit as Minister for the Environment. A &ldquo;hot political potato&rdquo;, a &ldquo;thorny problem&rdquo;, a &ldquo;minefield&rdquo;, &ldquo;a hornet's nest&rdquo;, a &ldquo;poisoned chalice&rdquo;&mdash; these are just some of the terms used in the last few decades to describe the issue of local government funding.  Is it any wonder that successive Governments and Ministers for the Environment have, if not altogether turned their backs on the issue, pushed it to one side?  I believe the issue, while often contentious, is too important to be ignored.  I am pleased to have Government approval for and to have published radical proposals, and of the opportunity to discuss them in this House.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to go into the history books to examine the reasons for the decline in the finances of local authorities although, given the year that is in it, such an option is not altogether unappealing to me.  Suffice it to say that over the last quarter of a century or more local authorities have seen their financial position steadily worsening with little, if any, prospect of improvement in sight.  The local authority funding base was, and is, too narrow.  There was little buoyancy.  New functions were continually transferred to local authorities without the appropriate transfer of the wherewithal, that is, the funding, to carry out those functions.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were largely at the mercy of central Government for financial resources.  They were never sure how much rate support grant they might receive from one year to the next.  The rate support grant did not always keep pace with inflation and in some years it decreased rather than increased.  Local authorities were often expected to adopt their annual estimates of expenses without knowing how much rate support grant they might be allocated from central Government.  This was untenable and it was, in truth, unreasonable of central Government to expect them to do so.  The position on local authority finances had come to such a sorry pass that by 1996 they had built up a revenue accounts deficit of about £120 million.</P>
      <P>We all know what the practical consequences of this funding shortfall are.  There has been little, if any, discretionary spending.  The level of service being provided in all areas had to be cut to the bone.  In some cases services had to be cut out or abandoned altogether.  Perhaps the most obvious and contentious example was the degeneration in the state of our county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> It was against this background that the Government undertook in its programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to commission a professional study on local government funding to see how we could introduce an improved system, &ldquo;a fair, equitable and reasonable funding system&rdquo;, as the programme put it.  Within a matter of months I had engaged KPMG to carry out that study.  At the time, of course, the sceptics and those who knew it all suggested this was nothing more than a cynical exercise on my part, a delaying tactic, an excuse for inaction and a report to add to the many others already stashed on the shelves of the Custom House library.</P>
    <P>The task set for the consultants was, in a sense, to set the agenda for change.  I asked them to look at local authorities' existing and future requirements and to evaluate the capacity of the then existing systems to meet those requirements.  The consultants carried out in-depth research, both in Ireland and internationally, into current local government practices.  The study involved extensive consultations with officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and representatives of local authorities.  An advertisement was placed in the national daily newspapers inviting submissions from interested parties.  Incidentally, such was the interest in this subject that over 60 submissions were received.</P>
    <P>The consultants examined a range of funding options, including a local property tax, a local income tax, a system based on Government grants, a system based on charges, a poll tax, the assignment of central taxes to local government and a local sales taxes.  Each of these proposals had certain advantages and disadvantages.  The study highlighted for me that there is not one obvious right formula to fund local government. There are probably as many views in this Chamber on the ideal way to finance local government as there are realistic options to be embraced.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the expenditure requirements of local authorities up to the year 2000, the consultants concluded that, if we wanted to do so, we could limp along with the existing system for a number of years by injecting some modest additional resources into it.  Once the report was published we stood at a cross-roads.  Did we stay on our existing course or did we change course? Everybody agreed that the system was not satisfactory. However, while we all agreed that there was a problem, there was little agreement, locally or nationally, on the right solution.  This is a sensitive and contentious issue.  There are no easy options.</P>
    <P>The easy thing to do, and the thing the sceptics would have expected me to do, was nothing.  Perhaps we could have commissioned a further study, to have an in-depth analysis undertaken on each of the funding options thrown out.  That would have taken more time; paralysis by analysis. Perhaps for the benefit of the optics and even the sceptics we could have made one or two small <Col N="14" /> changes while keeping the system ticking over as it was.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed to the Custom House I said that, in addition to my title and responsibility as Minister for the Environment, I also saw myself as the Minister for local government.  I committed myself to pushing ahead with local government reform and to putting local authorities on a sound financial footing, once and for all.  As such, I was not prepared to take easy options that carried little political risk and amounted to a minimalist approach.  Such a course of action would have proved the sceptics right but, even more seriously, it would have left the future of local government without scope or hope.</P>
    <P>On 19 December last, and with Government approval, I launched a new programme for the development of local government entitled <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.</i> I arranged to have the document widely circulated, including a copy for Senators.  I hope they have had a chance to read it because I believe it to be the most ambitious, wide ranging and at the same time practical and concrete political agenda for local government to have been put forward for a long time.</P>
    <P>Some Senators may think that I should be more humble about this programme.  If so, I apologise, but I believe it is one in which the Government can take pride.  It is a programme to take local government into the next millennium, with confidence and hope.  Many Senators will also be aware that my own background is in local government. I have seen at first hand the problems that befall local government.  I have also seen its potential and I believe it is the key to unlocking that local potential.</P>
    <P>The programme is based on four core principles: first, enhancing local democracy and widening participation; second, serving the customer better; third, developing efficiency in local government and, fourth, providing a proper funding system for local government to enable it fulfil its role.  Over the last few weeks, I have attended a number of regional seminars on the new programme to present and discuss it with local authority members and officials.  Before I concentrate on the funding aspect, I will briefly share with Senators some of the ideas on the overall integrated package which I have brought to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The first major plank of the programme is the enhancement of local democracy.  Democracy demands more than simply holding elections every few years.  It is about choice and empowerment, empowering people to govern themselves.  The democratic process in Irish local government has its roots in the earlier part of this century.  Unfortunately, it has not developed with the times to the extent that is demanded and required.</P>
    <P>The new programme sets out to modernise and address the shortcomings of the local democratic process through a range of measures.  For example, the Government will support constitutional <Col N="15" /> recognition for local government for the first time; Ireland will ratify the European Charter on Local Self Government and measures are being taken to do that immediately; local government will be represented on the National Economic and Social Council for the first time; the corporate position of councillors within local government will be strengthened through the establishment of strategic policy committees which will enhance their political and community leadership role and involvement in local government will be broadened through the participation of community, consumer and other interest groups and local development bodies.</P>
    <P>The programme also contains a number of specific measures to develop better links between local authorities, State agencies and Departments. Co-operation and partnership must become a feature of how we do our business if we are to succeed in improving the way our democracy works in practice.</P>
    <P>Local government is a major player in the business of modern Ireland.  It has some role to play in every acre of the country, whether that is in the planning or environmental control area, the provision of services or the development of infrastructure. It spends approximately £2 billion a year and employs 30,000 people.  Any business of this magnitude must deliver high standards of service and achieve efficiency in the delivery of that service.  The Government demands that of local government and the public expects and deserves it.  Local government exists to serve the people and that is as it should be and it must do it in a way the people want, not in a way the authority wants or management requires.</P>
    <P>Huge strides have been taken in recent years to make local government more people, more consumer and more citizen oriented.  As I acknowledged at the regional seminars, local government, councillors, management and staff all work exceptionally hard and have a commendable public service ethos and a commitment to the betterment of the communities they serve. The new programme is designed to build on that commitment and to ensure that citizens, the local government customers, are provided with efficient and user friendly services.</P>
    <P>All the measures in the programme are quality measures in the last analysis.  These include the new tier of programme managers, plus the community and consumer representatives on the strategic policy committees; the performance indicators, service standards and one stop shops which will be created; the emphasis on co-ordinated services between town and county, county and city and county to county, and within local authorities themselves between different departments; the new Local Government Management Services Board which was created on 1 January 1997 and the increased investment in training and development.  These measures are designed to improve the quality of service which is provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The initiatives in the new programme would be no more than a meaningless wish list if the necessary resources were not afforded to local authorities to provide the level and quality of service now expected of them.  The new funding arrangement I am putting in place will ensure these initiatives can and will become a reality in a well resourced and financially sound local government environment for the future.  One of the first things which must be said about the new funding system, and one of the principles which the Government accepted from the start of the process, is that there should be no major additional burden of taxation.  The new system achieves that and does not involve any new tax.  I emphasise that point for those who sometimes listen but do not always hear.  It dedicates an existing tax income completely to local government and removes it from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Under the revised arrangement, the power of local authorities to charge for domestic water and sewerage services has been abolished and the rate support grant is being terminated.  The income to be foregone from these sources is being replaced by the proceeds of motor taxation.  The KPMG study identified lack of buoyancy as one of the principal weaknesses of the existing system.  This weakness will be addressed by the new system because motor tax income has proven over the years to have considerable in-built buoyancy.  The early indications in 1997 are that car sales are again increasing at a significant rate and this is obviously good news for local authorities.  It is a buoyant source of income for the future and our analyses show that it will remain so.</P>
    <P>One of the major benefits in assigning a specific income source to local authorities is that it introduces a large degree of certainty as to the level of income an authority can expect from year to year &mdash; a characteristic lacking in the old system. An important element in any local funding system is that the local authorities should have a measure of discretion and, by extension, a measure of accountability, over the rates of tax levied.</P>
    <P>Under the new system local authorities are being empowered to vary the national rate of motor tax on cars and motorcycles up to a maximum of 6 per cent.  This is subject to a maximum of 3 per cent next year and 3 per cent the following year.  The base for motor tax will be set centrally.  Next year, each local authority can, if it chooses, vary it by 3 per cent and by a further 3 per cent the following year.  However, the tax will stay at that level unless the base is increased centrally.  The variation cannot exceed 6 per cent which will be the maximum increase allowable over the three years 1997-99.  That is a reasonable and modest projected increase given that it has been a long time since there was an increase in motor tax and given the benefits for everyone who has been paying water or sewerage charges. It will be a considerable additional source of income for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> The abolition of domestic water and sewerage charges was welcomed by many people.  I do not have a problem with the principle of paying for services.  Charges can be good; they may encourage the efficient use of resources, conservation and may be linked to environmental policy. However, I have a problem when the level of charges does not relate to the usage or the cost of provision.  Charges for electricity, gas, telephones and public transport are all related to usage. Water charges were not, with the exception of the commercial sector where the water was metered.</P>
    <P>Domestic water and sewerage charges did not bear a relationship to the cost of providing the service or to consumption.  They were seen by many as a form of local tax.  Under the charging system as it was, a luxury six bedroomed house with its own swimming pool would attract the same charge as a one bedroomed apartment accommodating one individual.  That could not be considered equitable from any perspective.</P>
    <P>Given that charges are not related to usage the Government took the view that they are, in effect, taxes and, accordingly, should be consolidated into general taxation.  Charges will remain for commercial users of water as metering is economically feasible and users can be charged in accordance with consumption.  Charges will also remain for domestic refuse collection services, which is important from an environmental protection perspective.  It is important to establish the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle and that there is a financial incentive for people to reduce the volume of refuse they generate.</P>
    <P>While all local authorities have the same general functions, different local authorities have different expenditure requirements having regard to local demographic, economic, social and other factors.  By the same token, the revenue generating potential of local authorities differs from area to area.  The amount of the motor tax collected by the different authorities will vary, in some cases significantly, from the income levels generated by the rates support grant and domestic water and sewerage charges.  Some local authorities will collect considerably more than others.  All these factors meant that a transfer of resources is, and remains, necessary in order that every local authority, urban and rural, will benefit from these changes.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed equalisation system, local authorities can retain 80 per cent of the proceeds of motor tax on cars and motorcycles and contribute all other motor tax revenues, including driver licence duties, to a newly established equalisation fund for redistribution.</P>
    <P>The resources of this fund will be used in 1997 to ensure that the income lost through the abolition of water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant is made good, in full, to each local authority.  The balance remaining will then be allocated as equitably as possible among local authorities, having regard to needs and resources. I want to stress that there will be no losers under <Col N="18" /> the system.  The size of the motor tax pool and its in-built buoyancy means that all local authorities will gain.</P>
    <P>I will be deciding on the allocation from the equalisation fund later this year.  However, it is my intention that within two or three years the Minister for the Environment and his Department will be relieved of this function.  Instead, those who ultimately own the money in the fund, that is, the local authorities, should have responsibility for managing and sharing it.  I am at present examining ways to see how this can be best achieved.  I would hope that this fund would be administered separately from the Department of the Environment by an equalisation council in order that every local authority would get its fair share and be represented in the allocation.  I hope no future Minister for Finance would view the fund as a pool of money to be dipped into.</P>
    <P>Another proposal in the programme is the introduction of a community development contribution. This is an idea which was put forward in the report of the commission on town local government <i>Towards Cohesive Local Government &mdash; Town and County</i> published last June. The idea is that local authorities will be able to sponsor, whether on their own initiative or in partnership with the local communities or other groups, discretionary development projects or programmes which could not otherwise proceed within their normal available financial resources. For example, the contribution could operate where there is a project that the community wants to develop but where the local authority cannot afford to invest it, however deserving the cause. Such projects might include children's playgrounds, particular sports facilities, etc.  For example, if somebody wants an all-weather track in their area and a local group has raised £200,000 but requires a further £250,000 towards the project, it would be possible for a partnership to be formed with the local authority which, with the agreement of the local community that would stand to benefit, would levy a charge to make up the shortfall over a number of years.  It is an idea which has worked elsewhere.  We are going to get legal power to do that.</P>
    <P>The new funding system is but one of a range of reforms proposed in this programme.  The thrust of the programme is to modernise the whole finance function in local authorities, to make it more transparent, more understandable and more accessible to the public.  As a former member of two local authorities, on one of which I served with an eminent accountant, I can say that to read local authority accounts is a demanding occupation and one that even the most competent and literate of accountants would find challenging.  We need to make them simple and understandable so that the public and the councillors understand every figure, dot and comma therein.</P>
    <P>By way of illustration, I want to give three examples of measures contained in the programme which will be implemented to achieve <Col N="19" /> the approach I have outlined.  First, the revision of the existing accounting system which is based on legislation enacted almost 50 years ago to a more modern, business oriented, full accrual, double entry system.  This will give authorities and their customers a better picture of the financial performance and true worth of their council.</P>
    <P>Second, widening the scope and application of the local government value for money unit and giving it legal status.  The idea is to move from the existing regulatory audit of local authority accounts to a more value for money approach that is the norm in business.  Local authority auditors will now be empowered to examine the three E's &mdash; economy, efficiency and effectiveness, in local authority operations.  This is, of course, similar to the enhanced role given to the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1993.</P>
    <P>Third, a range of financial performance indicators will be introduced with the aim of improving local authority efficiency and performance. These indicators will also allow local authorities to demonstrate to their customers that they are cost effective organisations, using public money in an efficient and wise manner.</P>
    <P>The document is a comprehensive one and I hope I have given Senators a flavour of where the Government is coming from, and hopes to go, on local government generally and on local government financing in particular.  I am happy that the reforms we are implementing &mdash; and I want to stress these, they are not a further discussion document &mdash; are happening now, that the Bills are being drafted and I will be back later this session with the first of the local government reform Bills.  I hope we have silenced the sceptics and that local government financing will no longer be talked about as a hot political potato or a hornet's nest.  From now on, let us think in terms of opportunity and potential and let the area of local government financing become, dare I say it, a window of opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began his speech by saying he was dealing with a hot political potato, a thorny problem, a minefield, a hornet's' nest and a poisoned chalice and he has ended up with a total débâcle.  Through his action he has created the greatest urban/rural divide in the history of the State.  No Minister or Government, even if they did it deliberately, could have created the divide that we have at the moment between urban and rural people.</P>
      <P>The country is up in arms about what the Minister has proposed.  In the final paragraph of his speech, the Minister said that he hoped the sceptics had been silenced; he has not even silenced his own Government colleagues, one of whom, at a meeting in east Galway, said that he would not let the Minister or the council within a hundred miles of any of the group schemes in his area.</P>

      <P>I have read all of it and I have underlined many points which I wish to discuss.  I have much to say about the Minister's proposal. As I said, his response was a political knee-jerk reaction to what happened in the by-election.  At that time, a no service campaigner stood for election and he frightened the wits out of the Minister, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  They ran back to the Custom House and started putting measures together that would relieve them of the responsibility of taking on the Joe Higginses and others of his ilk at the next election.  That is the bottom line as far as the Minister's response to local government finances is concerned.  He has caused more problems than he has solved with his announcement on the group water schemes. He has effectively asked the rural people, through their motor taxation, to pay for free water, free refuse and free sewerage in the cities.  This proves how out of touch he and his party are with regard to developments throughout this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister hails from a rural constituency but he has obviously lost touch with his roots while living in Dublin.</P>

      <P>He has made no commitment other than stating that he will give £5 million to the 32 or 33 local authorities to bring the water schemes servicing 70,000 households up to standard before they assume responsibility for them. From calculations made by the finance officer of my local authority and others, I understand that £5 million would not be adequate to service the schemes in County Roscommon alone.  I estimate that, with this level of finance, it will take 50 years to bring private group water schemes up to standard in order that the local authorities can assume responsibility for them.  The Minister will no longer be in Government by that time and, unless he intends to remain in the Oireachtas as a pensioner, he will also have left politics. However, someone will be obliged to deal with this issue at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the Minister's contribution closely and he was careful to state that commercial users will be obliged to pay for the water they use.  The word &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; was not mentioned because it has <Col N="21" /> bad connotations in Dublin.  The general view of the parties of the left, Labour and Democratic Left, is that the farmers are rolling in money.</P>

      <P>The Minister's election fairy tale will do him no good.  Meetings are being held throughout the country and if he reads the local newspapers or asks his party operatives to visit each county he will obtain a picture of the droch scéil.  His proposals are being criticised left, right and centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael Deputies and councillors attend the meetings to which I referred and they are doing down the Minister's proposals at every opportunity.  That is the truth.  There are knife marks on the Minister's back, put there by his colleagues in Government, of which he is not aware.  However, he will become aware of them when reports begin to issue from his party operatives. Enough of that, however, because the Minister has ways to discover what is happening throughout the country.  Not only councillors but some Deputies have distanced themselves from or voiced outright opposition to his proposals.</P>
      <P>The reality is that farmers will continue to pay for water and they may have to absorb future increases imposed by local authorities.  If such authorities are short of funds in the future, where will they obtain finance?  There are very few areas where they can increase charges.  The only available avenues are planning fees and water charges to commercial users and farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural counties, such as Roscommon, there are a limited number of commercial users.  There are some sizeable towns which are quite successful but the major input comes from the farming community.  At present, farmers are obliged to pay £150 for water for their farms and a further £110 for water used in their households &mdash; which they will not have to pay in the future unless they are members private group schemes.  However, if they are members of public schemes they will still be obliged to pay £150 for water for their farms. Local authorities must draw up their estimates in November 1997 or November 1998 and what will <Col N="22" /> happen if a county manager states that a further £100,000 must be raised to maintain the services of the county?  Consideration will have to be given to the areas, of which there are only two, where this money can be raised.  The increase will either be imposed on rates or water charges.  I am sure a balance will be achieved and the increase will be shared between both.  As a result, farmers' water charges will continue to rise to maintain services.</P>
    <P>If farmers are part of private group schemes, they will not receive anything.  They must pay for water for their houses and land.  They must also pay an increase in motor tax.  Compare that with what will happen in the city of Dublin.  A householder in Dublin does not pay domestic water, sewerage or refuse charges.  When the Minister made his announcement he neglected to mention refuse charges because people living in the city do not pay such charges.  However, each rural householder must each pay £60 in refuse charges. There is a total imbalance here because 70,000 householders in rural communities must pay for water for their houses and lands.  They must pay refuse charges and an increase in motor tax, etc. All this to get the Minister off the hook by killing off the challenge in Dublin from candidates of the left who are standing on the service charges platform. That is the bottom line as far as this exercise is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's proposal to dedicate motor tax to local authorities, I would welcome it if the money collected was invested in improving roads.  However, motorists will be obliged to pay for all local authority services while roads deteriorate.  Members of local authorities will then be forced to explain the whereabouts of this money.  The equalisation fund is the mechanism to balance finances.  I believe that, with the exception of a number of wealthy urban authorities, the majority of local authorities will seek funding under this heading.  There is nothing special in this fund for many counties.</P>
    <P>The changes in flexibility in respect of local authorities, who will set out their own priorities and spending arrangements to allow them to levy special charges, are insulting.  In areas where playgrounds, swimming pools, football pitches or any type of recreation facilities are required, local communities will be asked to invest the necessary funds and the county councils may then provide financial support.  The situation will be worse than in the past.  Until now, local authorities had a responsibility to provide amenity areas for school children, swimming pools, etc., albeit with the support of the Department of the Environment. However, the situation has deteriorated and people living in housing estates, who have already been put to the pin of their collars to provide for their families, will be asked to make a contribution to pay for the construction of a playground.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a further imposition on the people rather than a solution to local government funding.</P>
      <P>The real insult to local authority members is the Minister's proposal to demean and undermine elected representatives.  He proposes that &ldquo;Involvement in local government will be broadened through the participation of community, consumer and other interest groups and local development bodies.&rdquo;  The Minister is driving the thin end of the wedge into the local government system.  He intends to allow non-elected people, appointed by these organisations, to enter the local authority system.  In the past the county committees of agriculture were undermined and interfered with on that basis and they disappeared as a result.  This is the final blow and it is intended to kill off local government and in the future, a small Civil Service will operate local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was going to sign the EU charter on local government.  About two years ago the country heard of another charter: the farmer's charter.  One would not want to mention that in Roscommon or the midlands.  I was at a farmers' meeting recently and the last thing they wanted to hear about was that charter.  They are interested in the Minister going to Iran, Libya or elsewhere to find markets.  The pious platitude of a local government charter is no more than what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry tried to foist on farmers in a publicity stunt two years ago.  Since then he has allowed their incomes to drop by 32 or 33 per cent, putting many of them on the breadline as they are unable to pay mortgages taken out to buy stock in 1995 and 1996 while the Minister has failed to get an Irish Ferries ship to take stock to other EU countries.</P>
      <P>That is what the farmers want.  They do not want paper and talk with nothing behind them. County councillors and the public are not interested in the Minister for the Environment's charter.  They are interested in knowing if the Minister is going to provide proper services equally throughout the country and not go down the road he has gone, which has created the greatest divide in the history of the State between urban and rural people.  That divide is a disgrace and this Government will reap the rewards of it. The Fine Gael members of Government will soon be up in arms about this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because Labour and Democratic Left are not greatly represented in rural areas.  There will be an internal Government revolt on this matter because they will have to respond to what is happening nationally.  Meetings are being held nightly all over rural Ireland to start a political movement that will block what the Minister is doing.  The Fine Gael members of the Government and councillors will support that <Col N="24" /> movement before Easter; some of them have jumped ship and turned on the Minister already.</P>
      <P>One Fine Gael Deputy in the west told a public meeting attended by 700 people that he would not let the Minister or his proposals within 100 miles of the group water schemes he organised in the east Galway area.  There will be many more like him over the coming weeks, and with good cause.  I do not see why a Minister, for short-term political gain and to keep people like Joe Higgins at bay, should get rid of water charges in Dublin. He has put no mechanism in place to get rid of them in country areas, other than creating a situation where only people with a domestic water charge from a public main will get relief.  Surely that is unconstitutional.  Does the Minister not think he can implement such a scheme?  It will be challenged and the Government will pay the price.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he will allow charges to be imposed for refuse collection.  Of course he will; they are there already.  Practically all rural local authorities have refuse charges to the tune of £60 to £70 per year; that service is free in the cities. Since nobody pays refuse charges in Dublin, this measure is also anti-rural.  The reasoning is that the Minister does not want pollution in the country. The people of Dublin and other cities will have their refuse collected without having to pay but those in rural areas will pay because they are polluters and dirtier than the rest.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not think out his approach to this matter.  It was a kneejerk reaction to a political problem the Minister and the Left have in Dublin and has nothing to do with equality between urban and rural people.  I ask the Minister at this late stage to listen to what is happening around the country.  He should send people to the town halls and community centres to listen to what is being said.  Then he can go back to the Custom House and treat the people in an even handed way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am clear about what the Senator has said in his tirade and will be telling my constituents precisely that when the election comes; he should not tell other councillors in my area about his proposal.</P>
      <P>It is important that we congratulate the Minister and the Government.  It is 20 years since Fianna Fáil attempted to abolish local government. In 1977, Fianna Fáil did more to wreck local government and the standing of councillors than any other Government in the history of the State.  It has taken 20 years to redeem that situation and that is why I am positive, as are the vast majority of councillors throughout the country, about these proposals.  Of course they have to be worked on but at least now we have a coherent plan to bring local government into the next millennium, though that is no help to the performance of the Opposition when they have been in Government over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>People are cynical about politics today since much of what used to be done in local government cannot now be done because of lack of funding.  Speaking to people about the issues that affect them, they regularly say local government does not provide essential services in the community and they are frustrated by this.  We have not been able to fulfil the essential tasks over the past 20 years because of the decision taken in 1977, which most Fianna Fáil councillors, Deputies and Senators now believe was disastrous. We must cross this huge gulf.</P>
      <P>Political cynicism is directly related to the performance and effectiveness of local government. If local government could do the jobs quickly and efficiently, political cynicism might be reduced.  It is rampant because we cannot do the basic tasks properly. The Ombudsman's report shows that the greatest complaint over the past number of years was the performance of local government.  This is a central part of our body politic.  Changing local government, as proposed in the policy document, will go some way towards reducing political cynicism which is directly related to our performance as local authority councillors.</P>
      <P>I said recently in another forum that, as a member of a local authority, I had more influence in policy making decisions than I have as a Member of this House.  I have great respect for local government because it is one of the truest forms of democracy in that it responds to people. However, it has been poorly financed by all Governments until now.  This Government is beginning to address the reform of local government for the first time in decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the role of local government. Local councillors must make difficult political decisions about laneways, taxi issues, etc.  These decisions affect communities, particularly if those communities are already divided.  As a member of a local authority for the past two years, I have made more difficult decisions than I have in this House.  Local councillors do not get the recognition the democratic system demands, although <Col N="26" /> they make difficult choices.  This leads to frustration, particularly if people cannot enforce change in their communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the KPMG report which sets out the challenges local government will face over the next 20 years.  Local authorities spent £1.2 billion in 1995 and the forecast is that it will spent £1.4 billion by the year 2000.  Local government will face financial burdens in the next few decades as a result of the infrastructure which the European Union has put in place over the past ten years.  Changes in road transportation and in water and sewerage schemes and the introduction of environmental programmes to deal with our waste problem will cost huge sums of public money.  It will be difficult to find this additional money.  As the Minister said, we must find more money to increase these services or continue to rely on the present revenue base.</P>
    <P>The KPMG report made a number of proposals in relation to property tax and local service tax.  The Government is making revenue available to local authorities.  The number of cars will increase over the next ten years and this will provide additional income for local authorities.  The equalisation fund will help to overcome many of the difficulties referred to by Senator Finneran. It was rich of Senator Finneran to speak about the lack of consultation with local authorities and the knee jerk response to the Minister's proposals. This issue has been debated in local authorities for years.  At least this Government is beginning to address the decay in local government.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the KPMG report is that it sets out principles which local authorities must employ.  For example, those responsible for spending money in an administrative year should also be responsible for raising revenue.  Another aspect of any funding mechanism is that it should be easy to collect.  The money required to collect the fee should not outstrip the amount brought in.  That was not the case with water rates in my county council area.  There should also be variability.  I am a member of South Dublin County Council and two of the five most deprived areas in the country are within its administrative area.  Any funding mechanism must be acceptable.  There is no point introducing a new form of revenue if it increases general taxation. However, the Minister said it will not.  The money collected from motor taxation will outstrip the revenue raised from water charges.</P>
    <P>Since 1977 five changes have been made to local government funding, mostly to suit the political hue of central Government.  That is not good for local government because there is no certainty as to the amount of money it will have from one year to the next.  The Minister's proposals go a long way towards resolving that problem. Proposals to fund local government, as outlined in the policy document, will be acceptable to local communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy document refers to the enhancement of democracy, which is vitally <Col N="27" /> important for many councillors because their status must be recognised.  Perhaps this can be done by including in our Constitution a specific role for local government, by signing the European charter for local government or by ensuring that local authority members are represented on NESC.  All the Minister's proposals in that area are directed towards ensuring that the role of councillors in politics and local government is recognised and that their status is not forgotten. Many councillors feel they have not been given the proper status as elected officials.  That is something we are beginning to address.</P>
    <P>I am very excited by the strategic policy committees which will mirror the main functions of the local authorities.  For the first time they provide a proper interface between statutory and community groups and the local authority members.  We need to be careful about this. There is a great amount of suspicion and prejudice between councillors and members of the statutory agencies.  Many councillors feel that because members of the statutory bodies are not elected they do not share the same status. Equally, many members of the statutory groups feel that local authority members are not in touch with the problems that face their communities.  By involving the councillors, community groups and statutory agencies in the new strategic policy committees we are beginning to address a model of local government that is fair to all sides.  I welcome the corporate policy group which will introduce a sense of cabinet to local government for the first time.</P>
    <P>The report mentions initiation of area committees. We have huge problems with representation throughout local authority areas.  I live in Tallaght, the third largest conurbation in Ireland, yet it has no local authority base in terms of a town commission or urban district council compared to Balbriggan which has its own statutory area committee. We have to address the changes that have occurred in the demography of Ireland over the past 50 years.  The situation of Tallaght needs to be addressed in whatever final proposals come from this process.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of abolishing the dual mandate. I am a member of a county council and the Oireachtas but I do not believe that holding two positions is good for democracy.  However, we are all victims of the electoral system.  The only way we are going to finally rid ourselves of the dual mandate is by having a sensible electoral system which will ensure that it is not necessary to be a member of a county council to be a Member of the Oireachtas.  I hope this issue will be addressed by all Governments over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>The report looks at widening the role of local authorities.  As members of local authorities we have to do more to bring on board all statutory and community interests.  The partnership model has worked.  It has shown, particularly in urban areas, a sense of leadership and purpose.  It has included many of the groups that were hitherto <Col N="28" /> excluded from the political system and that role needs to be encompassed within the county councils.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that we are going to have statutory provision for consultation between local authorities and the local Garda.  That is to be welcomed, particularly with the huge urban crime problems which exist.  It is only proper that a response consultation unit exists between members of local authorities and the Garda.</P>
    <P>There is no reason public institutions and local authorities, like private companies, cannot get an ISO 900.  With the exceptions of Telecom Éireann and the ESB, in some of their operations, I am not aware of any publicly owned company which carries the ISO 900.  Private businesses have shown through this award that they operate from the highest standards.  We need very high standards in local authorities because there is a view in the community that the same level of response is not there for people making complaints to local authorities.</P>
    <P>There are many other items raised in the report, particularly the review of local authority areas.  The up coming electoral legislation proposes putting the new constituencies on a structured, statutory basis for European and Dáil elections. I see no reason for excluding local authorities.  Why will an independent statutory commission be examining the Dáil and Euro constituencies but not local authority areas?  There are many difficulties in terms of representation within the local authority areas because of changes in population.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Government every success with their reforms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="29" /> Coming from a county that suffered seriously as a result of recent changes, we are in a real dilemma.  We do not know where we stand.  An assessment should have been done to see what the substitution of water charges with motor taxation revenue would mean to counties in rural Ireland, not the city.  As Senator Finneran described, we now have two tiers and two types of service.  There are no water charges for the people who have footpaths, public lighting, access to shopping and lighting for churches.  The people in rural areas have none of those services and they still have to pay water charges.</P>
    <P>Donegal has 250 group water schemes and we do not have enough money to complete them and, with an average of 100 households per scheme, one can imagine the type of problems we have.  We have had no funding to develop water sources and we buy water from Northern Ireland at a cost of £1 million every year.  Removing water charges has caused major problems for local authorities because the arrears are now uncollectable.  I do not blame Fine Gael or the Labour Party, I blame Democratic Left, and this is the price to be paid for satisfying them.  This matter will not be solved quickly.  Donegal has a large road network yet we are getting only piecemeal funding.  Seventy three per cent of all funding allocated by the National Roads Authority is spent on by-passes for towns between Dublin and Belfast &mdash; only 23 per cent goes to the primary roads in rural areas.  The Minister did not mention this fact.  He called his brief a &ldquo;hot potato&rdquo; but the potato will get hotter before he gets it off his hands.</P>
    <P>Small towns in Donegal have been waiting ten years for new sewerage schemes.  The Minister announced funding for two sewerage schemes, £1.9 million in Ballybofey and Muff.  However, the funding for these schemes was provided by INTERREG, not a single penny came from the Department.  INTERREG funding is supposed to be additional, but, in this case it was substitutional. Every time Senator Maloney is under pressure he announces two sewerage schemes as if they were imminent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is called communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a long housing waiting list in Donegal.  When the Minister of State visited the county recently she was delighted with the various programmes.  However, like all ministerial visits, she did not tackle the thorny issues as recognised by the Minister in his speech today. She did not recognise that we have 19 caravan dwellers within a 12 mile radius, the condensation running down the windows has been responsible for young children's medical problems.  I am not attacking this Minister because he is the best of the crop, but he has done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is going to happen to the 250 group water schemes?  I am asking the Minister to send a message to Donegal County Council nothing that the matter was raised in this House by me and <Col N="30" /> that I want to know what he is going to do about funding following the abolition of water charges.</P>
    <P>Rather than using INTERREG as additional funding for major development in the Border counties, the Department is using it as a substitute. This is wrong.  The evaluation committee is looking at this and will report to the Government in a short time.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem in rural Ireland because of lack of funding for housing, roads, water and sewerage.  Senator Hayes is correct when he says that it was never more difficult to be a member of a local authority.  County managers and those responsible for spending are unsure what funding they will have.  The Donegal county manager is implementing a programme of decentralisation; however, we have to raise loans to fund this.  There is no funding for any development in rural Ireland and things are getting more difficult by the day.  There is total confusion since the last budget which was a disaster for local authorities.  If anyone doubts this, they should contact the rural county managers who do not know how they are going to finance developments this year.  No Government which expresses an intention to review local government funding can be happy with this situation.</P>
    <P>The role of county councillors has diminished yet their responsibilities have increased.  While we are getting money from the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and INTERREG, the Department of the Environment has failed to match this.  County managers are being called to the Department for meetings because there are serious problems.  The Minister painted a rosy picture but this gives a false impression.  He could have stopped after the first paragraph when he said that this was a &ldquo;hot potato&rdquo; and that he found himself in an impossible situation.  I hope to see the day soon when the people decide at the ballot box that things could not be any worse than they are at present.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the funding of local government because it is very important.  I welcome Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the House and compliment the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, for the way he took on this difficult issue and solved it to the satisfaction of most people.  I also compliment him and the other Ministers for the country's economic position which enables us to transfer motor tax revenue to local authorities to spend on roads.</P>
      <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without mentioning the role of the local authority.  Recently, I asked the local school to write a report on the services provided by the county council, and it is now with the county manager.  We spoke about water, housing, the disposal of waste, sewerage, etc.  Some people involved in the county council were surprised to find that it was responsible for some many things.  That is the importance of local government today, and it has always been so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> County councillors play a strong role because they are at the coalface, continually dealing with local problems and they must be respected for that.  Over the years many of their powers have been taken away by successive Governments; there was mention of their powers being whittled away by the committees of agriculture, the health advisory boards, etc.  Now, the National Roads Authority often tells the county council which road it must improve.</P>
    <P>I must disagree with my colleague, Senator Hayes, about the dual mandate because the county council is often the training ground for future politicians.  Many Members of this and the other House have served their time in a local authority and this practice will remain for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The Opposition mentioned that there was no consultation.  If they followed the Minister's speech, they would see that the KPMG report examined the facts and they were taken into account by the Minister before he put his plan into action.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a number of points which need to be repeated.  He said that enhancing local democracy and widening participation were two of the important roles of local government; next came serving the customer better and then developing efficiency in local government and providing proper funding for local government. He went on to say that the Government would support constitutional recognition of local government, ratify the European Charter on Local Self Government and have local government represented on the NESC.  All these important steps would bring local government into a national framework for the better of the areas which the local authorities represent.</P>
    <P>I also welcome that the corporate position of councillors within local government will be strengthened through the establishment of strategic policy committees which will enhance their political and community leadership role.  That will be an important function when it is developed.</P>
    <P>In addition, the involvement in local government will be broadened through the participation of community, consumer and other interest groups at local development bodies.  We are continuously dealing with people who have problems with local water supplies and want to develop their villages and rural areas, and this is what we need &mdash; local dialogue to get work done at a local level.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the Opposition's contributions. Some speakers seem to want to take two sides.  They are nearly saying reimpose service or water charges.  Do they want that?  There is no good trying to approach local government with the urban/rural divide and speak of Dublin versus the country.  That is not the right way.  We must all work together.  The 1985 local elections were fought on the issue of service charges.  If some Members of the Opposition want to bring back local charges, they should say so because they did <Col N="32" /> not want them then but later they participated in the decision to reimpose them.</P>
    <P>The SIMI and garages were glad to know there would be no increase in the car tax.  This was welcome from the point of view of sales.</P>
    <P>It was said that in future local projects, such as swimming pools and community centres, must involve local contributions, but that has been the position for as long as I have been in public life &mdash; and the contribution is often as high as 25 per cent.  I saw this in my town in 1970 when a group was formed to build a swimming pool and it had to come up with a local contribution.</P>
    <P>In the Opposition's effort to negate the excellent work of the Minister, it failed to come up with any good points.  They keep harping on a few little things.  It is important that we realise the Minister has come up with worthwhile proposals which will be good local government.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of group schemes.  The Minister has undertaken to increase the grants for group water and sewerage schemes by 100 per cent.  In addition, he told us that allowance will be made for people who are paying local authorities the equivalent of domestic charges through group schemes.  That clears the air in many situations and there is no good trying to confuse the whole package with some small points which must be rectified.</P>
    <P>I do not know why we are highlighting group schemes now because many schemes have been in trouble for many years &mdash; and I know this from my area.  We must have extra money to get out of this dilemma.  The schemes need to be checked and the local councils need help but it is wrong to state that their difficulties were caused by the abolition of water charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken it upon himself to fund local authorities from road tax.  In the meantime, some people are saying that there is no money now and the system is a shambles.  The Minister and the Cork county manager have said that the rate support grant will continue until the change-over takes place and the whole thing will be done smoothly.</P>
    <P>The equalisation fund is very important because some local authorities may have difficulty raising revenue and this will help to balance their books.  Some counties cannot raise the same level of road tax as others.  Consequently, the equalisation fund is necessary.  In giving this contribution to local authorities for free water services, for instance, unlike what happened in 1977 when rates were abolished, the Minister is not borrowing on the future of the country.  When the Opposition says what the Minister is doing is wrong, we must remember 1977.</P>
    <P>I welcome the widening of the role of local government and the close links it is hoped to forge with Leader, the enterprise boards and community groups.  We must work together for the benefit of the people in our county areas. Since some areas are peripheral and must be handled in a different way to cities or towns, we need the co-operation and spirit of people like <Col N="33" /> the enterprise boards, who are doing a terrific job, community groups and Leader groups.  The Minister has the well being of all these organisations at heart and wants them to work together for the good of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for making an effort but, as Councillor John McHugh once said to a Leitrim county manager who had given a rosy picture to the council: &ldquo;Manager, you have everything for the stirabout but the meal&rdquo;. The Minister has done the same &mdash; there is no word of how much this will cost and I have a dread of that.  When the health boards were set up, we were told they would only cost a certain amount.  Those boards were costed at the time &mdash; this scheme is not &mdash; but how many billions more do the boards cost now?  Eventually they will collapse because we will never be able to keep them financed.  We were told there would be new chief executive officers with management skills, programme managers and district managers, and that schemes would be customer friendly and customer oriented to provide greater health care. Where did it end?  It costs us billions, more people are sick, waiting lists are longer and we are worse off than ever.  That is how this scheme will end &mdash; with all the new programme managers and efficiency managers to be appointed, it will get out of hand.  Undoubtedly this will be another Frankenstein's monster.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to come down to ground level.  Labour introduced the service charges and I have always supported and voted for them, even when it was unpopular to do so. When Fianna Fáil was in opposition on Sligo County Council I supported the charges.  I always believed rates were unfair.  I was a rate collector for some years and the fellow on the side of the mountain &mdash; to be politically correct, I had better say &ldquo;the person&rdquo; on the side of the mountain in case a feminist attacks me &mdash; had to pay rates, even though he did not have a boreen or a lane to his house and had to travel through fields and gates to his house, without even proper rights of way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe one should pay for every service but if county councils ran public houses they would be expected to give pints for free &mdash; everyone expects the council to do everything for nothing. There has been much criticism of councils and many calls for greater efficiency, economy and effectiveness.  The trend of the criticism is that county councillors are a crowd of messers, but who could do more on the meagre, miserable budgets they have at present?  Look at the standard of the roads they maintain, the water schemes they run, the houses they build and maintain and all the other work they do on a shoestring budget.  Would any private organisation do the same amount of work with so little money?  It is time people stopped talking nonsense about councillors.  There are a lot of brains on every county council because it is a cross-section <Col N="34" /> of the community, elected by all the people.  Hence it includes doctors, dentists, teachers, farmers, and the unemployed &mdash; every stratum of society is represented.</P>
    <P>This is where we went wrong with the financing of local government.  Local authorities are the only real, voluntary, elected organisations in the country and they should be recognised as such by Europe but successive Governments have failed to make that point.  Much of the money given to what are known as voluntary organisations is going to <i>ad hoc</i> groups which are being set up with no mandate from the people.  Those groups are getting more money than local authorities but what level of accountability attaches to that money?  County councils always had to account for every penny they spent; what they spent was never a secret.  Do we know how or where the local organisations are spending the money they get from Europe?  Do we know about their overheads, travelling expenses and junkets?  How much money do they spend on research?  What is research but another form of junketeering? &ldquo;Research and development&rdquo; is a lovely heading which all the professionals can use but if a councillor goes somewhere to do research, it is called a junket.  It is time people gave councillors the credit to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>When the health boards started no one wanted county councillors to apply for the jobs, they wanted people from the private sector to show how the boards should be run.  In the end they were glad to have councillors and some of their best professionals and operators graduated from local authorities.  Similarly, some of our best Ministers and Deputies graduated from local authority chambers.</P>
    <P>The current buzz-words are &ldquo;consultants&rdquo; and &ldquo;studies&rdquo;.  At every council meeting the top table is full of professionals with slide projectors and maps, speaking for hours on end about how things should be done and costing a fortune.  To give an example, the historic Drumcliffe Bridge in Sligo was designed by two junior engineers under the supervision of a county engineer.  The bridge is still there and is sound.  When a smaller bridge had to be designed for my village of Grange, over a far narrower river than the one in Drumcliffe, consultants had to be hired.  The same two engineers are now senior engineers with Sligo County Council but they were not capable of designing a bridge 20 years later.  If much of the money being given to consultants and studies went to local authorities, there would be work and money.</P>
    <P>I do not know where this will end but another burden will be placed on the business community. They are providing most of our jobs in the cheapest and most efficient way possible, because they have competition.  They will now be charged for water and they still have to pay rates.  How can this be fair, if it will penalise some people more than others, particularly the business sector?  Has this Government any respect for that community? When will it give them a break and stop piling <Col N="35" /> the expenses on them?  If everyone else is entitled to free water and other services, so should business people.  A charge for sanitary services is included in the rates they pay and water comes under that heading.  They are being charged on the double.  Sligo County Council implemented the service charge from the beginning but we never charged business people for water because they were already paying for it through the rates. Business people should be given a chance to make a living.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the motor tax proposal because nobody has told us how much money it will raise and how much will be siphoned off.  We know how much it is costing the council at present, but we do not know what we are going to get.</P>
    <P>How much will the committees cost?  We will have local, regional and national committees with local, regional and national chairmen.  Where will the pyramid end?  We all know what happens when a simple service is started.  An officer is appointed who then wants a clerk typist.  An assistant, a chief assistant, two clerk typists, a senior clerk typist and an administrator are then required.  I congratulate the Minister for taking the bull by the horns but he will build a monster which cannot be fed.</P>
    <P>Many families in rural Ireland have two or three cars.  They will have to pay through the nose when it comes to this car tax.  The Minister spoke about an additional 3 or 6 per cent.  However, when councils impose that extra percentage many new cars will be registered in Dublin &mdash; one can register one's car in any county if one gives an address in that county.  People will register their cars wherever the rate is cheapest.  There will always be a cheap rate in Dublin because the volume of cars there means that a surplus charge will never have to be imposed.  That will drive another wedge between rural and urban Ireland.</P>
    <P>The group water schemes saved the Government millions of pounds over the last 20 years because people provided their own water schemes.  However, water was provided free to people in cities.  Now all of those in group water schemes want free water also, and rightly so.  It would cost £20 million to provide water to all the group water scheme in my county and it would take at least five years to do it, working flat out with every available contractor capable of doing the job.  When will this be done throughout the country?  I believe it will take at least 25 years.</P>
    <P>It was stated that the Minister will increase the group water and sewerage schemes by 100 per cent.  However, increasing 1p by 100 per cent gives 2p.  An expert once came to a little village in north Leitrim and called in all the farmers who had been looking for an agricultural instructor for a long time to tell them how good their year had been &mdash; this was in the days when the slogan was &ldquo;One more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough&rdquo;.  He said he was very pleased to say that, in the time he had been in the village, <Col N="36" /> he had increased the sow population by 100 per cent.  Everyone wondered where all the pigs were. When he was questioned he admitted that old Paddy so-and-so at the bottom of the village had had one sow the previous year but had two that year.  Instead of talking about percentages the Minister should talk about what the ordinary countryman understands &mdash; actual cash.  One hundred per cent of nothing is nothing.</P>
    <P>Where will the Minister get the money to fund all these schemes which will have to be brought in over a five year period?  People in my county have been paying £170 a year to group water schemes, and they were quite happy to pay. However, they have now been told they are fools for paying that money so they are going to stop paying it.  There will then be turmoil because the system will break down.  If there were meters on every water supply &mdash; as there is on the electricity supply &mdash; there would be fewer leaks and less wastage and it would cost local authorities much less.  However, councils would never get enough money from the Department to meter everything.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about changing the system of accountancy.  The eight programmes which local authorities have to go through are nonsensical.  One year in Kerry the council decided to go ahead with its business but that was overturned by the High Court because the council had not gone through each programme individually. That is a waste of time.  The health boards have a fairer system because they can spend their budget on whatever services they want.  Local authorities should be given a budget rather than being given separate amounts for main roads, county roads, water and sewerage and so on, which is a waste of money.</P>
    <P>Another area in which money was wasted, and which I do not think will be improved under this system, is where a county engineer decided what work needed to be done on roads.  The Department had to then send another engineer &mdash; who wasted time driving from Dublin to Sligo, Kerry or Cork &mdash; to spend two or three days going around the area with the county engineer.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  He did not have better qualifications than the county engineer, perhaps he had less.  The Department should have accepted the professional judgment of the county engineer.</P>
      <P>The local engineers in Sligo wanted to build a roundabout but the departmental engineer said there was no need for it.  That led to a farce of a crossing when one tried to turn from the N15 into Rosses Point.  After several accidents and hundreds of thousands of pounds of damages, they installed traffic lights.  However, a simple roundabout would have solved the problem from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick of people saying county councils are inefficient.  They are very efficient and doing a <Col N="37" /> good job.  The Minister and the brass hats in Dublin have been spending the money and it will be no different under the new system.</P>

      <P>The more this debate continues the more cynical I become.  Senator Farrell, a good friend of mine from the Yeats county of Sligo which I visit regularly, said that nothing has been said about the costing of the various programmes. He gave the impression that Fianna Fáil position on this debate was to oppose the Government on everything on the basis that the Minister has gone too far.  The figures referred to by Senator Farrell are outlined in the programme entitled <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.</i></P>

      <P>The Minister has made a commitment regarding the allocation of motor tax revenue.  It is unfair, therefore, to throw unsubstantiated figures and attacks on a Government that has finally moved on local government reform.  Irish local authorities currently spend £1,250 million per year, which represents approximately 10 per cent of national public expenditure. The impact of local authority spending is seldom recognised as being the major force it is in the national economy.</P>
      <P>For many years, the financing of local authorities was reasonably stable thanks to the effectiveness of the old rates system, when rates were paid by householders, farmers and business people.  However, a combination of political decisions and legal challenges between 1977 and 1983 made huge inroads into the income from rates, leaving commercial rates as the only source of local income from property.</P>
      <P>Many reports on local authority financing have been produced by bodies and organisations such as NESC, KPMG and members of the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members' Association and it is important that definitive proposals be made on the future adequate financing of local authorities.  While the Minister has grasped the nettle, he must ensure that the there is no shortfall for the county councils.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing two years ago the ten year roads restoration programme.  Its completion should significantly improve the standard of county and regional roads.  I also pay tribute to him for the huge increase in funding for national and secondary roads.  He has launched an attack on the dreaded potholes, the bane of every rural councillor's life.</P>

      <P>While welcoming this huge increase in funding for national and county roads, I appeal to the Minister to look at national secondary road, which have hitherto been the poor relation of the roads network.  While I am thankful that funding is now available for these roads, not enough is forthcoming.  For example, the N63 is the main thoroughfare from Galway to Belfast via Roscommon.  For the first time in 25 years an allocation of £200,000 was made for that road for improvement works.  I welcome this, but in the context of the frightening statistics for this road, it is only a drop in the ocean.  On a three mile stretch, leading from the village of Lackagh in Turloughmore to Annacross, which leads on to the village of Corrofin towards Tuam, 18 lives have been lost; five have been lost in the last two years and two in the past three months, one of them in the last five days.</P>
      <P>This road was not built for the traffic it now takes.  Unless further adequate funding is provided, not only for this three mile killer stretch but for the entire N63, more lives will be lost. There is a huge volume of traffic now using the road which leads to the city of Galway and where more factories are being opened, where the population is increasing and where increasing numbers are travelling from the hinterland to work in the city.  It is time for the Minister to consider increasing the status of this road from national secondary to national primary.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Government to provide resources to the NRA, which is the funding body for national primary and national secondary roads.  The Minister should also examine national secondary roads in the context of local authority funding with a view to implementing a programme of remedial action to prevent further carnage, especially on the N63 which, according to the relevant Garda authority, has the worst road statistics in the country.</P>
      <P>I appeal to motorists using the national primary routes and the N63 to remember that they are not highways for speeding.  It is impossible to travel at speed on the regional and county roads and while it is possible to travel at a certain speed on the national primary roads, it is impossible on the national secondary roads because of the huge volume of traffic from business and new houses now using them.  Drivers using national primary routes must slow down and exercise caution and care. Perhaps people could make a Lenten resolution that they will slow down, take it easy and help to save lives on those routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to bring all group water schemes up to a proper standard with funding on a phased basis.  However, I live in a rural part of the west where there is a group water scheme and there are problems and disappointments. The people in such areas feel they are being discriminated against.  I will not chide the Minister or cast aspersions, but if householders in Dublin are not required to pay for water, members of group water schemes in the west should be in the same category.  It is difficult <Col N="39" /> to explain because it does not make sense.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done much and he has passed the torch to a new generation of local authorities and councillors.  He has gone further than any Minister in the history of the State in terms of helping the local authority system and introducing meaningful proposals.  It is obvious that the Opposition parties which have called over the years for changes in the system of local authority funding, etc., are clutching at straws.  They have latched on to the issue of private group water schemes and some say that that may be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  However, that is not the case because I have confidence in the Minister for the Environment and the Government. Nevertheless, there is much bitterness and acrimony regarding those schemes and I appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider this matter.  There must be a solution to this growing problem in rural Ireland and I am confident it will be found.</P>
    <P>Senators who are members of local authorities are familiar with local improvement schemes which provide grants for roads leading to land, etc.  Marvellous work has been done under the schemes over the years and great facilities have been provided for people in rural areas.  They are valuable schemes but the amount of money made available to local authorities for them is minimal. For example, £240,000 has been provided to my local authority this year but, given the number of applications already submitted to the council, it would take six years to complete the programme of works under local authority schemes.  The council in Galway is currently dealing with the 1991 applications.  I appeal to the Minister in the context of local authority funding to give consideration to substantially increasing the allocations to Galway County Council and other councils as a once off gesture to ensure local improvement schemes are brought up to date and roads leading to farms and land are completed. This is an important matter and such a move by the Minister would be welcomed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Regarding the funding proposals, local authorities will, for the first time, be able to make use of locally collected motor tax money.  I referred earlier to the amounts authorities collected in the past but sent directly to the Exchequer.  The motor tax collection and enforcement machinery is well understood and established.  However, a negative aspect is that local authorities will, have little or no independence under the new régime. They will be limited to a maximum increase of 3 per cent in 1998 and a further maximum increase of 3 per cent in 1999.  There is no provision for increases after 1999 and local authorities will have to depend on the Government to set the basic national rate of tax.</P>
    <P>How will the equalisation fund work?  What criteria will be used to establish the levels of compensation <Col N="40" /> the various counties will receive from the central equalisation fund?  Who will operate the fund?  Is there a case for an independent agency at arm's length from the Department of the Environment?  The demands facing local authorities are huge.  They currently spend £1,250 million and it is estimated that, by the year 2000, they will need another £250 million at current monetary values to cope with increasingly stringent EU standards.  This is the funding gap which the 34 city and county councils will face in the next five years.  The funding system must be able to bridge that gap while also giving local authorities a degree of independence in terms of how they do their business.  Public acceptability and efficiency of collection are also major factors.</P>
    <P>There is a famous historical phrase, &ldquo;Remember Fontenoy&rdquo; but, for me, it is &ldquo;Remember Wexford&rdquo;.  I recall the Taoiseach speaking to a gathering of councillors from round the country at a General Council of County Councils annual general meeting in Wexford and being applauded when he said his party in Government would tackle the system of funding for local authorities. He said a streamlined system would be introduced. The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government have moved to restore confidence in the local authority system.  For the first time there is real initiative and an effort to undo the wrong of the decimation of the local authority system which has been ongoing since 1977 following the abolition of domestic rates.  That was a cynical vote buying exercise by the then Fianna Fáil group to win a general election but it was at huge cost to householders.</P>
    <P>The Government is on the right track and I look forward to the growth in stature of the local authorities system.  I hope it will gain further momentum under the Government over the next four to five years.  However, during that period of great Government to which we can look forward and which will bring us into the new millennium, the priority must be the national secondary routes which are killer roads at present.  I appeal to the Minister to apply himself, his team and the Government to eliminating deaths on national secondary roads, such as the N63 from Galway to Roscommon.  I highlighted the dreadful statistics which show the number of people who have died.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister and the Government to reconsider the group water schemes.  The Minister has gone a long way in that regard and I am sure he can find a solution which will bring everybody on board.  The Minister should provide sufficient funds on a once-off basis to clear the backlog of local improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>These matters are important in the context of local authority funding.  There is great interest in the debate on local authority funding.  As a result of these initiatives, the local authority system will grow because the Minister and the Government have acted in the interests of the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Local government funding has concentrated the minds of many Ministers for the <Col N="41" /> Environment, although not always to a sufficient extent.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, told us he has grasped the nettle with his initiatives to reform the funding of local government, as he would have it.  The greatest issue of concern to local authorities has been the level of funding and the difficulty of meeting an ever increasing demand for service with limited funds.</P>
      <P>The removal of domestic rates in 1977 was a great mistake.  Since then local authorities have paid the price.  Many of problems faced by local authorities stem from the abolition of rates &mdash; a bad decision which was subsequently regretted.  I do not accept that the abolition of service charges is a reform of local government funding as is suggested. Nobody would like to pay for a service if payment is avoidable.  However, it is realised that the only way many services can be provided is if they are paid for.  Whether they are paid for by taxation or by individuals who can afford it is a matter for decision.</P>
      <P>I was involved in canvassing in last year's by-election in Dublin West.  The decision to remove service charges was made because of the fright the left wing parties received after that by-election. They were terrified that an anti-water charges candidate almost won the seat and if that trend had been repeated in other constituencies in a general election, it would have had a damaging effect on the left wing parties.  During the canvass I was astounded to discover that the owners of substantial houses with numerous cars in the drive would vote for a candidate whose main platform was the removal of water charges.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, Laoighis-Offaly, I am sure most people would prefer not to pay service charges but they have accepted the payment of water charges over the years.  There is a high compliance rate in the two county council areas because most people believe they get a good service from the local authorities.  I am sure that is also the case in many other rural areas.  These are areas which would not have third level institutions, a range of public transport services or many of the other services that people in Dublin or other cities enjoy.  Yet, the people in the rural areas were willing to pay for a service which they valued.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that people in Dublin's affluent suburbs would object to paying about £2 a week for an unlimited supply of water when they will pay the equivalent of £30 a gallon to buy bottled water in their local pub.  It seems clear that if there is enough pressure against payment of a particular charge and a candidate runs in an election on that one issue, a Government can make changes.  We need to stand up to such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to abolish water charges has created discrimination between urban and rural areas.  The Minister seems unaware of the existence of group water schemes.  How else can he explain the removal of water charges for urban dwellers while leaving them in place for those in rural areas?  It would not be acceptable if the <Col N="42" /> Minister for Finance decided to cut the basic rate of income tax for urban dwellers and not for those living in rural areas.  The Minister's decision is not sustainable &mdash; he must abolish water charges for everybody or nobody.  The battle lines have already been drawn on the issue and the issue will intensify because this is an election year.</P>
    <P>Rural dwellers feel discriminated against.  The water charges will be replaced by motor tax as a revenue source for the local authorities.  People in rural areas are more reliant on their cars because they do not have widespread public transport services and they feel they will have to pick up the bill for any increased charges.  While I accept the Minister's statement that the funding of local authorities has been a difficult issue to tackle, the abolition of water charges will not help local authorities.</P>
    <P>A sum of about £3 billion will be needed to improve our water and sewerage infrastructure over the next ten to 15 years.  Where will the funds for these necessary improvements come from?  In the greater Dublin area about 40 per cent of the total water supply is lost through leaky and defective pipes.  It is ridiculous that parts of County Kildare, for example, experience water shortages in order to supply Dublin when almost half of that supply is lost through leakage.  How will the investment in the system be funded if the main source of revenue in the form of local government charges is abolished?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to decentralisation and the adoption of a different attitude to local authorities. Local authorities have been and continue to be seen as providing local administration rather than local government.  No genuine moves are being made towards reforming the system of local government.  We live in one of the most centralised states in Europe.  Virtually all the power is concentrated in Dublin.  The local authorities have little or no influence on how their areas are run.  There is local administration but not local democracy.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that moving a section of a Department from Dublin to another area constitutes decentralisation.  I disagree; that is relocation. While people in many areas are glad of the relocation of sections of Departments, it does not constitute decentralisation.  A section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is located in Portlaoise and a section of the Department of Education is based in Tullamore, both in my constituency.  We are glad that the offices have been located there but we cannot claim that it constitutes decentralisation.  Decentralisation would involve the transfer of the executive functions from the centralised bureaucracy in Dublin to democratically elected councils around the country.  Decentralisation will only be totally effective if we firstly reform the way in which local government itself is organised.</P>
    <P>Unlike most other countries in the developed world, the Irish system is unique in that at local government level we concentrate the power in <Col N="43" /> the hands of unelected officials rather than elected politicians.  This has to change.  The European norm is for a city or district council to be headed up directly by politicians.  This does not happen in Ireland.  I do not think that what the Minister has outlined here today gives us any indication that we are going to see that sort of change here.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we have a system where every local representative in every town and county is continually beating a trail to Dublin in the hope of acquiring what are known as &ldquo;resources&rdquo; for some local venture.  This system, under which all largesse is doled out from the powers that be in Dublin to the deserving natives scattered around the country, smacks of the kind of colonialism to which this country was subject for generations under British rule.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to trust people to run their own affairs.  All of us are aware of the tremendous spirit of communities throughout Ireland.  It is this sort of spirit that gets sports fields developed, youth centres built and employment schemes underway.  Through our attitude to local government, we are not harnessing that spirit fully.  The potential for local development is not being realised.  As long as we insist that &ldquo;Dublin knows best&rdquo;, local communities will continue to suffer and rural populations will continue to decline.</P>
    <P>I think it is remarkable that in the five years since the last local elections approximately half of the rural districts in Ireland have suffered a population decline.  If rural populations are falling during a period of the most rapid economic growth in the history of the State, what is going to happen when the economic cycle slows down, as it inevitably will?  We need to move away from centralism, which is stifling local initiatives in this country, and we need to commit ourselves to real devolution of power from Dublin to the regions. We need to recognise that where local decisions are concerned, local people do know best.  When Dublin decides that it cannot accept water charges then the rest of the country has to suffer the consequences.  The creation of an inequality in rural Ireland through the abolition of the water charges is unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to speak on this important subject.  Most of us in this House have served, or are serving, on local authorities.  I have been a member of Longford County Council for the past 18 years. The main theme on local authorities is that everybody wants more powers.  When it comes to the crunch of getting finance however, there is always a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long way down the road on this issue although he has not reached the end of the road, no Minister ever did with any particular reform.  There is always something more for the next Minister to do.  This Minister and this Government have made a major adjustment <Col N="44" /> to the system.  I do not think any local authority or any local authority member was able to see the logic of collecting car tax, sending it up to central Government in Dublin and getting that money back again.  That did not make sense.</P>
    <P>Let us make an effort to streamline the proposal we now have.  It is natural that there will be problems and that politics will be played.  When any Government makes decisions it is the duty of the Opposition, in whatever way they can, to cause mischief and to undermine the efforts which have been made.  I, as a local authority member and everyone else here who has served on a local authority over the past 20 years, know the neglect which rural areas suffered.  We only have to mention the county roads which were impassable; in the last two years there has been a marked improvement in this area.  These are constructive moves afoot and the people living in the rural areas are now able to see, for the first time in 20 years, a major move being made to improve the conditions of the roads.</P>
    <P>In 1977 and its aftermath, when there was to be no car tax, the car tax returned and there was less and less money being developed from Dublin for roads.  The condition of our county road system collapsed and people were paying increased car taxes to travel on inferior roads.  This year the local authorities are retaining the car tax and the roads have improved.  They will be further improved as long as this Government stays in office.  Local people have expressed their desire to me that this Government would stay in office in order that the roads would continue to be improved.  That is the message I am receiving.  I compliment the Minister on his work in this area. We do not want to return to the days where we talked about potholes and how to get rid of them. No action was taken on improving the roads until the past two years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the group water schemes, we know that there is a certain disapproval about these.  It has been said here today and in the national media that these proposals favour urban areas over rural ones.  That is not true.  There are many people in rural areas who are connected to public water schemes.  We have to be definite about this.  While it may be glib, quick and political to say that this is anti-rural and pro-urban, it is not true.  Some people may feel that they have, to a certain extent, supplied their own water schemes with the aid of Government grants and may be aggrieved about that.  There must be growing pains in everything and a major change has been made.  I am confident that with a common sense approach, this matter will be resolved. Most rural areas I am aware of are on public schemes and where schemes are private, people are getting water from the county council mains. I wish the Minister well and I hope he will take the points I made into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Belton for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Most people would agree that local <Col N="45" /> democracy in Ireland has been a shambles for some time and I do not know whether we will return to the situation which existed in the past. The basic ingredient of a democracy is to raise taxes and obtain money to spend on services and other necessities.  However, some of the ingredients that make up a good local democracy are missing.</P>
      <P>One sometimes wonders about the public's awareness of what democracy should be.  For example, I have been inundated with comments about the regional education boards.  There seems to be a suggestion that these boards should not be established because they are an unnecessary intrusion.  I do not believe this to be the case.  The establishment of regional education boards will mean a small additional cost but they will improve local democracy to a certain degree. They will have some, though not all, of the ingredients necessary in this regard.  I welcome their establishment for that reason.  The vocational education committees do not have to worry because their position is guaranteed under the 1930 Act.</P>
      <P>If we do not have good local democracy we will have the opposite &mdash; irresponsible local democracy &mdash; of which there is an ample amount.  I joined my local county council in 1985 and I soon discovered that its members were simple supplicants for the people of the county we represented. We spent our time screaming at central Government for funds which were becoming scarce at that stage.  We slowly became aware that there was a difficulty with public finances and we would not be able to obtain the usual scoop of funds each year.  The fact that it took some time for this message to get through to us impeded the general public's awareness of the difficulties involved with public finances.  This, in turn, made government very difficult.</P>
      <P>We must seek a good system of local government but it is difficult to do so in view of the 1977 debacle.  That event is part of history but it has set us back enormously.  What is the meaning of a local election?  It means that one knocks on people's doors, states that one is a good candidate and answers no questions other than those concerning the filling of potholes and the supply of clean water.  One answers such questions by stating that one will batter the Government until it provides the necessary funds.  A person seeking election to local government does not need to state his or her policy because they are not concerned with raising taxes or spending the people's money.</P>
      <P>If I knock on a door during a general election campaign I might be asked questions about someone's income tax, PRSI, their children's education or other matters over which this House has some control.  Local government has no such control. We merely shout and scream at central Government which is an aimless exercise and a sham.  I do not know how we will return to the situation that existed in the past because most Members were not in politics at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> I am amazed when I visit other countries and people say it is strange that there are no rates on private houses.  They informed me that there has never been a movement in their countries to remove rates from private houses.  The Irish are considered peculiar for this and destroying local democracy in one fell swoop.  There is much to do to restore responsibility and meaning to local democracy.  Were I to continue with the logic I used at the outset, my political opponents would have a field day and accuse me of being an ogre who wanted to reintroduce rates and other charges.  Therefore, it would be better were I do proceed to other issues.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's actions in respect of water charges, which when introduced were merely a temporary, stop-gap measure.  Opposition Members will recognise that fact, because at the time they opposed water charges but supported them on the understanding that they were temporary.  Now that they have been withdrawn, there are suggestions from that quarter that the Minister should be damned.  Previous speakers highlighted the dilemma in respect of local authority clients who receive free water&mdash;it is not free because it must be paid for in some way. Local authority clients will not be charged for the cost involved in supplying water but private householders on group water schemes in rural areas are still forced to pay.  This dilemma involves basic equity and fairness, which are required in any system.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister's predicament, but I am confident that while he may encounter difficulties, he will find a solution.  As Senator Belton stated, the Government has shown a great commitment to rural Ireland and county roads are being repaired.  This is the first time I have witnessed such an outstanding commitment since entering the House.  I believe the Minister will find a solution to the dilemma in respect of water charges and I will put forward ideas as to how that should be achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate but I believe the Minister's proposals represent the greatest piece of three card trickery I ever witnessed.  He is trying to fool the people with his policy of &ldquo;Now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Government is frightened because the share of the vote of one of the parties in power dropped to 3 per cent in the two by-elections in Dublin.  Members referred to the abolition of rates in 1977, which for those living <Col N="47" /> in rural areas and poor people was a tremendous development.  It was also stated that water charges were reintroduced in 1984 as a stop-gap measure, which lasted 15 years.  These charges were abolished as a result of the major scare the Government received.</P>
      <P>There are now two parts to this country: the Pale and the area outside it.  I firmly believe that people should be paid to live in rural Ireland because they do not have access to the same facilities as their counterparts in major towns and cities, particularly Dublin.  People living in Dublin have access to transport, trains, good roads, etc.</P>

      <P>What have people in rural Ireland gained from the Minister's new system to reform local government?  They have been given back 80 per cent of car tax collected in their counties. I will be parochial and refer to my county, which collected £9 million in water and sewerage charges.  Kerry was one of the first counties to introduce a sewerage charge.  We were not getting enough from this Government or the last one so we introduced charges before they were made compulsory in 1984 because we wanted to run the services in our county efficiently.  Now we are to be given autonomy through the car taxes.  We must send the £9 million to central Government and get £7 million back from the equalisation fund.  That is taking £9 million out of the economy. If the water charges were left in place and we in Kerry got that £9 million, in one year all the roads which in Kerry are falling apart would be brought up to the proper standard, but the Government did not have the guts to do that.  We are told about the reform and financing of local government but I have yet to see how the Minister will finance local authorities.</P>
      <P>He wants to force a situation where the structure of local authorities falls down and they are forced to introduce new charges to maintain services. This Bill is the greatest load of codswallop I have ever seen.  Kerry depends on tourism as its biggest source of revenue.  People land at Shannon Airport and use cars registered in Clare or Dublin to drive around Kerry, using the roads and services.</P>

      <P>In 1987 the grant for house reconstruction was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Boland.  It was a very good grant as it brought many properties up to the proper standard. His Government left office immediately afterwards and were replaced by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  When they looked for money there was none to be spent and £210 million had to be paid to those who had applied for reconstruction grants.  Cutbacks had to be made because of that blunder.  Now another Minister is announcing ten and 15 year programmes. We must live now and we should budget as one does for a house.</P>
      <P>This debate should be extended to a couple of days and I will be asking the Leader to do so.  I have yet to hear a Member on the Government side suggest how local authorities are to be financed other than moving money from one pocket to another.  The infrastructure will disintegrate and there will be no development.  We will all have to move into the Pale and get free services there.  Rural Ireland will wither and we will have to look at photographs of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister for the Environment.  He is courageous to tackle this issue because when I was in Government I had two very heavy documents on the reorganisation of local government.  No decisions were taken on that issue because it was too big a job and kept getting deferred to the next meeting.  Those documents are probably still in the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to deal with local authority finances unless one tackles the fundamental issue of the reorganisation of local government itself. The Minister asked consultants for a report, which I read carefully.  That report gave historical data and information on other jurisdictions but gave the Minister no clear choices or options. Tonight the Minister referred to doing another study.  It would not be worthwhile because it is necessary to have the first study evaluated and then options could be debated and acted upon. Without that, one will find the system Senator Dan Kiely has spoken of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We collected £6 million in car tax last year in Clare, which may include revenue from licences. With the 80 per cent clawback we would have £4.5 million.  However, approximately £3 million <Col N="49" /> in water charges was collected last year in Clare. Therefore, in spite of the reorganisation of the motor taxation fund, the councils will not be any better or worse off.  This has been mentioned by a Government speaker.  Limits for manoeuvrability will be further eroded and the councils will be very confined.  The Minister is talking about abolishing the rate support grant but, under the new mechanism he proposes to introduce, he is setting up another one.  It would be better if the Minister kept the rate support grant and used it as a mechanism to remedy imbalances in any area.  In a local authority like Dublin, which has huge revenue from car taxes, how would this be managed so that the smaller local authorities, with much less income, can survive?</P>
    <P>In so far as the Minister is attempting to tackle the problem, he is to be supported but I am not certain what he proposes is the most effective way to do it.  He should think again, perhaps consulting members of the Government and the Opposition.  We should form a joint committee to deal with this matter, as was suggested.  The current proposal will prove to be as unsatisfactory as the present system.</P>
    <P>This is being borne out by what is happening with the group water schemes.  I was at a meeting in the West County Hotel in Ennis last Monday which was attended by 400 people representing 200 group schemes from all over Clare.  Most of them had provided water for themselves at minimal or no cost to the State.  Unless some action is taken through subvention, the people who have contributed, and who still contribute, to the funding of these schemes will not continue to pay.  There is a danger that many of the rural group water schemes will collapse before this summer is out and huge areas will be left without a proper water supply.</P>
    <P>A federation of group water schemes has been set up in the west.  I suggest that the Minister meets it as soon as possible to find a formula to maintain and support the voluntary effort which was instrumental in providing water in many areas.  A mechanism must be found to subvent the group water schemes currently threatened with financial disintegration.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its decision to cancel the previous administration's prison building programme; deplores the fact that dangerous criminals are given full temporary release on the sole criterion that there is an insufficiency of prison places; questions the reason provision has not been made for improved security in the transportation of prisoners; and calls upon the Government to provide a sufficiency of prison places, to end the indiscriminate use of the <Col N="50" /> temporary release programme to provide prison places for newly sentenced convicts, and to implement measures which will minimise the possibility of prisoners escaping whilst being transported.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Justice will accept that the siege in Mountjoy Prison, when prison officers were held and their safety threatened, was an unhappy start to the year.  I want to put on record our gratitude and admiration for all those involved in bringing that siege to a peaceful conclusion. However, we cannot close our eyes to the serious shortcomings of the Government's penal policy.

      <P>I hope the Minister is gracious enough to accept that there is a serious problem and that no amount of press releases and public relations work can hide it under the carpet.  An article by Dr. Paul O'Mahony in <i>The Irish Times</i> at the time of the siege states:</P>
      <P>Mountjoy Prison itself is an obsolete Victorian institution totally unsuited to modern requirements.  It is grossly overcrowded, with many cells designed for single occupancy currently holding two prisoners.  It lacks basic sanitation facilities, still relying on the slopping out of night buckets, and has a very inadequate infrastructure for educational and occupational activities.  The majority of prisoners have little or no purposeful activity to fill the long hours and most are locked in their cells for 18 or more hours a day.</P>
      <P>That quotation would be more apt for a general discussion on Mountjoy Prison, but I could not let this debate on the Government's general handling of the prison situation go by without saying that a major question mark hangs over the future of Mountjoy Prison as a corrective facility. It has been demonstrated by numerous visiting committee reports and in a recent television documentary that Mountjoy Prison is an institution which has outlived its usefulness.  A prison should be a place of punishment and correction for people who have done wrong and which protects the public from criminals.  However, there is no excuse for inhumanity on anyone's part.  Many of the conditions in Mountjoy Prison &mdash; the experts bear this out &mdash; are inhumane.  Were it not for the fact that the last Government's prison building programme was pulled from under the Minister by elements of the present Government, we could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to stimulate the Minister to take action in relation to prison places and early releases.  In a press release of 2 July 1996 the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice also obtained Cabinet approval for the capital funding so that the construction of the women's prison in the Mountjoy complex which will provide 60 extra prison places can begin no later than January 1997.</P>
      <P>Has that construction begun?  The construction has not begun.  The press release also said:</P>
      <P>The Government approved the Minister for Justice's proposal to build a new remand prison capable of holding 400 prisoners on the site available at Wheatfield.  Planning for this project will commence immediately.  The estimated cost of this prison project is £40 million.</P>
      <P>We still have no remand prison at Wheatfield. The Minister will recall that this was her panic statement issued only days after the dreadful murders of Veronica Guerin and Detective Jerry McCabe.  All of a sudden after a meeting between the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Justice, etc., Democratic Left and the Labour Party found some kind of interest in the law and order question and in the total inadequacy in prison places.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  The problem of prison places has been a major one in this country for many years.  It was an equally serious problem three years ago as it is today.  The creation of extra places as described in the amendment is not sufficient.  Given the budgetary situation the only way we can provide sufficient prison places over the next 12 months or two years is by providing a prison designed, financed and run by the private sector.  This idea has to be taken and considered seriously.  There is no doubt that what is happening at the moment is a farce.</P>
      <P>I have a list of 12 very serious habitual criminals from the city of Galway with the list of crimes they have committed over the past five or six years.  It is an absolute joke that these people are able to go in and out of prison at will.  In some cases they have been back in Galway before the gardaí who took them to Mountjoy.  It is time an end was put to this.  Habitual criminals who are in time and again for serious crimes should be given more punitive sentences when they are returning to jail.  A young fellow in Galway on early release having spent nine months in jail committed 14 or 15 very serious robberies over Christmas with bodily harm done to those 14 or 15 people.  He was back again in Mountjoy for two days before being transferred to Loughan House.  He is 19 years old and it is his fifth time in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several thousand young people between the ages of ten and 15 in the criminal school.  They are young children with major social problems and problems of deprivation.  They are psychologically homeless and in need of serious therapeutic support.  They should never have to go to prison, but unless we provide the necessary preventative care and intervention they are going to be the several thousand criminals of tomorrow. These young kids belong to no one except their delinquent peer group.  They have experienced profound deprivation prior to their delinquency and are the most disadvantaged and forgotten people in this State.  Even at ten, 11 and 12 years of age they are today's young criminals who will be tomorrow's godfathers.  While there are numerous good proposals in the Children Bill to deal with this matter, the reality is that no Government or party has faced up to the fact that there is a fundamental and radical change needed in the way we deal with these young kids.  Whatever way we as politicians come together, we <Col N="55" /> must do so for their sakes.  We must put in place preventative and therapeutic measures and facilities which are robust but humane enough to ensure that they get a home because, even though they are under a roof, they are psychologically homeless.</P>
    <P>We have put a lot of money into the Department of Education's miserable effort where we have five units catering for 150 kids.  We must come up with a more fundamental and radical proposal.  The Army is a wonderful resource for education and training and it must be brought in. I am not suggesting that we do anything other than give the Defence Forces a proper status; however, we have numerous army barracks around the country which are under utilised. There is an opportunity for us to take a radical step forward because we do not have the money to create new facilities.  We must look at the existing institutions of the State, and the Army has a major new role to play.  I hope these proposals will receive serious consideration from the Minister when I bring them forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;commends the Government for its decision of July, 1996 to implement an accelerated prisons building programme which will provide over 800 additional prison places by the end of 1998 thereby curtailing the use of temporary release as a means of alleviating overcrowding; and for the measures taken to improve security in the escort of prisoners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and would like to contrast the two previous contributions and congratulate Senator Fahey on his well thought out comments.  The Opposition claims that the decision to cancel the previous administration's prison building programme was deplorable, but I am unaware of any previous building programme other than the Castlereagh prison which has now been completed. No adequate prison programme was in place until this Minister reviewed the situation and proposed the programme which she has commenced.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the fact that the crime trends for last year showed a fall.  There was a 4 per cent drop outside Dublin; unfortunately, the crime levels in the capital remained static due to the drugs problem.  This issue must be tackled and the Minister will have everyone's support in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has commenced her prison building programme in an open and transparent way.  I especially welcome her decision to open the prisons to the media and the public.  One can hear interesting contributions from Joe Duffy on RTÉ every evening on the changes and contrasting facilities in the various prisons.  This is very enlightening as it exposes the problems, and rightly so.  Pressure must be put on <Col N="56" /> politicians to tackle these problems but we must also be factual.  The Minister's programme will create an additional 800 prison places&mdash;a 25 per cent increase on current levels.  This may not be enough but it is a genuine approach to increasing the number of places.</P>
    <P>For Senator Mulcahy's information, up to the end of last year, 161 new places had been created &mdash;more than were created in the previous seven years.  Work was completed in February 1996 in St. Patrick's Institution creating 30 places. Another 38 places were created in the health care unit in Mountjoy.  The Castlereagh special unit was completed in October 1996 with 25 places and 68 places were provided in the Curragh Prison inaugurated on 25 November.  This is real progress.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the question of the new women's prison.  I understand that the proposal is going to tender, the local government planning procedures have been completed and work will commence on the site in April or May 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>A plan is a plan and circumstances change.  If we do not have planning then we have nothing, but 161 new places with a further 640 planned before the end of 1998 is more progress than we have had since the foundation of this State.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fahey that creating additional prison places is not the only way to tackle the problem.  We must try to ensure that people do not go to prison and the Senator made an excellent point about the ten to 15 year olds who are deprived and likely to become criminals. We have seen this in all our cities.  Some pilot projects have attempted to address this problem but not enough has been done and every Government must share the blame for this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to look at the management structures in the prisons and I wish the expert group well.  Dan McAuley of IBEC is the chairman of this group and I have enormous admiration for him.  I have every confidence that a comprehensive and progressive report will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The Minister has endeavoured to address the drugs problem in prisons and some of the provisions she has introduced have been successful. However, this problem will not be resolved until the wider drugs problem has been tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> I want to refer briefly to my concern about the prison suicide level because we should when we are discussing the prisons.  Since 1990 there have been 25 suicides in Irish prisons, over 60 per cent of which have occurred in Mountjoy Prison, which houses 28 per cent of the prison population. I appreciate that the prison authorities have taken steps to introduce a suicide prevention committee in the middle of last year.  If the Minister is in a position to respond to any developments which have taken place or recommendations from that committee, I would welcome information on that.  There has been an unusually high level of attempted suicide, and one suicide last year, in the women's section of that prison.  I know there is much discussion about suicide among women prisoners in Mountjoy so I ask the Minister to refer to that in her contribution?</P>

I think the Minister is in that sort of situation because if all she does is provide more prison places only solely to satisfy Senator Mulcahy, it certainly will not satisfy me, and I am glad to see that it will not satisfy Senator Fahey or Senator Neville.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Just increasing the prison population will not reduce the level of crime, and all the debates on crime concentrate on the number of prison places.  Of course we must deal with overcrowding but at present, apart from keeping those involved in crime out of circulation for a while, there is little to show that those in prison are any more improved when they are released than they were when they were incarcerated. Many of them are worse off because when they are released they have become drug addicts and they become involved in more crime to feed their habit.  This puts even greater pressure on the prison service.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that we do not need prisons, of course we do.  There are many dangerous men in prison who have committed vicious crimes, but perhaps we could deal with many of those in prison in an alternative manner by imposing alternative sanctions.  I can vouch for the fact that Castlerea Prison is now open because I was interested to see that a person who was fined £39,000 for possession and use of angledust opted for a month in Castlerea rather than pay the fine. That is quite a useful way of avoiding the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a large number of petty criminals <Col N="58" /> who are involved in larceny and burglary and, in the main, they are drug addicts.  While we are not addressing the problem of drug addition either inside or outside the prisons more aggressively, we really cannot say that spending £45,000 a year on keeping these people in prison is in any way useful economically, whatever it may do for them socially.  Even victims are virtually no better off from this because they are well aware that when the prisoner is released they will be in much the same situation as when they were imprisoned and only too ready to go back to their old lifestyle. There is the difficulty, of course, either within or outside prison that those who are on drugs must want to give them up.</P>
    <P>As a patron of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, I welcome the proposed new prisons' board and it is vital that it is seen to be truly independent.  The lack of management within prisons has been lamentable for decades and nobody, least of all the Governor of Mountjoy, wants to see the system of unstructured temporary release carry on as it is, nor do we want to see people being transported around the country in prison vans. However, we must reach a situation where there is a management structure and, as Senator Neville said, planning within the service so that there is some notion of where we stand.  The board should be accountable only to the Minister; but it must be in a position, through a chief executive officer and a management team, to run the prison service from day to day, and I await with interest the result of the deliberations of the expert group on this.  The need to strengthen the visiting committees is as essential and, as I have asked in this House before, there is a need for an inspector for the whole service.</P>
    <P>Prison overcrowding undoubtedly exists.  Apart from those who could be dealt with by the Probation Service, what about the 60-70 people in Mountjoy Prison who, it is recognised, have psychiatric disease.  These people should not be in prison.  That is not an institution for treating people with psychiatric disease even though psychiatrists do visit the prisons and it is recognised that the amount of psychiatric care there is inadequate. These people would probably not have run into trouble with the law or broken it if they had been receiving adequate psychiatric care. While we all naturally applaud the opening of the psychiatric hospitals so that there is more treatment within the community, I would be grateful if the Minister for Justice would talk to the Minister for Health about expanding the amount of money which is being given to the psychiatric community services, because a very large number of people are not receiving adequate care and they need an enormous amount of supervision.  It is certainly more expensive than locking people up in prison; and if the two Ministers cannot manage to run the treatment of psychiatric patients outside psychiatric hospital, it would be better to return them to hospital.  Why are these patients not being transferred to the Central Mental Hospital?  That is where they should have been <Col N="59" /> sent in the first place.  They should not be in prison.</P>
    <P>When I was a member of the Eastern Health Board about ten years ago a new facility was built at the Central Mental Hospital.  As far as I can see, all that has gone on over the years is a discussion as to whether it should be used as a women's prison or a place for drug addicts.  The last I heard of it, mattresses where being stored in this very beautiful little building.  Is this still the case because I do not think that should be happening?</P>
    <P>Another thing the board tried to do when I was a member was to transfer some of those patients who are no longer a danger to their communities back to psychiatric hospitals in their localities where at least they would be in contact with their relations and friends.  The Minister for Justice should ask the Minister for Health to look into that also.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville, who has always taken such an interest in prison suicide, has raised this matter and I want to speak briefly about it.  The incidence of suicide in young men is rising in the community and this is something we must watch because we cannot but expect that what happens in prison will reflect what happens in society in general.  The fact that remand prisoners appear to be particularly at risk has always been of great concern to me and I would ask the Minister to note that carefully.</P>
    <P>Especially in view of what Senator Fahey said and put so splendidly, I am glad that the Children Bill is before the Dáil today because most prisoners admit that they first became involved in crime when they were children.  I received a letter at Christmas from an 80 year old women and it was really quite appalling.  She spoke about break-ins in the sheltered housing area where she lives and she said it was really dreadful to see children between the ages of six and eight so out of control.  We must give more support to programmes like the Minister for Education's &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;.  The vast majority of people in Mountjoy Prison have not completed primary education.  Nobody should have to go to prison to complete primary education.  Most criminals come from large families so there should be support for their families and liaison between the school and the various organisations. Therefore, I ask the Minister to address more than just the building of prison accommodation when addressing crime.</P>

      <P>In seconding the Government amendment to the motion, I will address myself briefly to the contents of the Fianna Fáil motion. I read it with some dismay as it appeared again to be old hat.  The motion refers to the cancellation of the Government's previous prison building programme &mdash; which programme is that?  It seems to refer to Castlerea but that is up and running. Fianna Fáil would do well to bring up to date motions before the House and not waste our time with something which has been dealt with effectively.</P>
      <P>I am even more surprised that the issue is before us at all.  The Government is doing so many things so well that Fianna Fáil Senators had to scratch their heads to come up with a motion. The economy is booming, school are being built, the social welfare improvements are unprecedented and there is marvellous new family law and social legislation.  The Opposition had to come up with this old hat motion in the form of prison spaces.  Senator Mulcahy is like a broken record, cackling like a little hen on the same old myth about who is hard and who is soft on crime. The real question now is, who is soft in the head?</P>

      <P>Crime figures have gone down for the first time since 1989.  That fact speaks for itself.  Need we say more?  For the first time there has been a substantial increase in prison places, with 800 new places being provided.  Much tougher legislation to tackle criminals is now in force.  The gardaí have more powers to arrest, detain, search, etc.  The Minister has introduced court reforms to speed up the system and a cost review group has been set up.  The problem of drugs in prison has been tackled &mdash; over 490 seizures were made last year and new drug treatment facilities have been provided.  A prison authority has also been set up.  All this has happened in the small number of years since the Minister has been in charge of the Department.  Fianna Fáil was in charge of the Department for years without ever taking the bull by the horns, so it takes some nerve for them to bring up the issue again.</P>
      <P>The real issue is not prison places.  As Senator Henry said, we must tackle the drug problem at source through education and health policy.  We must look at other ways of punishing crime.  On RTÉ's recent programmes about our prisons, all the governors made the same point, that prisons were not working and we should look at other ways of rehabilitating criminals.  Today's <i>Evening Herald</i> features an 11 year old child who has been addicted to heroin since she was eight.  The Labour Party's policy in this area was farsighted.  For many years we held that one must tackle the source of the problem and not merely lock people up and throw away the key.  For Fianna Fáil to talk nonsense is an insult to the country and the problems it must tackle.  Prison places are not the panacea to all our ills and we cannot continue blatantly to ignore the silent screams of children who know no other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a tough job and, as I said before, if she had not been thwarted when she came into power we would have less crime today.  Whether we like it or not, the reality is that the prison scheme which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Fianna Fáil had put in place was stopped.</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons for crime.  First, for over two decades we had a liberal society in which it was wrong to criticise or say a bad word to anyone &mdash; they all had to be patted on the back.  We heard all about rehabilitation, education, how criminals came from poor homes, etc. There seems to be no system to ensure children go to school.  There were as many people in Ireland when I was growing up as there are now. Everyone had to go to school until he or she was 14.  The gardaí came to the school every month, if a child was missing for four days in the month he was warned, and if he was missing for six days he and his parents were summonsed.  What happened to that legislation?  The problem was the big schools.  Some bureaucrat, with one of the first computers, worked out that it would be cheaper to have a big school with all the children under one roof.  The fallout and social cost have been that we have destroyed society and it will be a mighty job to put it back on an even keel.</P>
      <P>Second, crime is glorified on television and in other media.  The best criminals get the best headlines. We also glorified drugs for a long time and did nothing about it.  The people of Ballymun and other areas had to police their own housing estates before the drug barons were put behind bars.  It took the murder of Veronica Guerin to wake up the powers that be to go after criminals. That was made possible by the implementation of Fianna Fáil Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One day I gave a man I knew a lift from south Donegal.  He told me he had been fined £40 but because he could not pay the fine he was brought to Mountjoy Prison.  They immediately told him he could go because they had no place for him. He told them he could not go anywhere because he had no money so they ordered a taxi to the <Col N="64" /> station and paid his train fare to Sligo.  I then gave him a lift home from the station.  That was a waste of Garda time and money because that person was claiming social welfare.</P>
    <P>Every person today has money because, if they are not working, they get almost as much as if they were &mdash; and more in some cases &mdash; in social welfare payments.  Unpaid fines should be deducted from social welfare payments, a very simple procedure, rather than wasting Garda time.  Courts impose fines for very small offences which there is no hope of collecting.  Bringing people to and from Mountjoy Prison is a terrible waste of Garda time and costs more than the fine. If such a system was put in place it would free up a great deal of space in our jails.</P>
    <P>Another 2,000 criminals could be housed in Spike Island at very little cost.  I heard on radio the other day that the governor there has drawn up an architectural plan for old buildings which could be converted into modern prison spaces at very little cost.</P>

      <P>Today we have a drug problem, in which two classes of people are involved.  The first are the drug barons who do not take drugs but take the lolly, and the second are the innocents who take the drugs and get caught.  They need treatment and I do not see why we cannot build a special, secure place for them.  The only places we had for mentally retarded children in the 1960s were in mental hospitals, which is not where they belonged.  However, we then built proper units for them where they could be treated as human beings.  Why can we not build places for drug addicts who need attention rather than putting them with criminals?  If they did not co-operate with the system in such places and showed no progress they could then be given a long sentence in Mountjoy Prison without the softly, softly approach.</P>

The Garda should give them more power and help instead of prosecuting them.  They have done a good job of clearing drugs from their areas.  Our biggest problem today is the abuse of drugs, which is the cause of much of our crime.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to build, as part of her programme, proper treatment units for young drug offenders, particularly those under the age of 18 years who might be got off drugs.  The chances are much slimmer for hardened drug addicts.  I would not allow their visitors to touch them until they were detoxified and it was safe for them to talk to people because there are many systems for getting drugs into prisons.  The only way to stop that is to put a solid barrier between them and their visitors.  It is their hard luck if they have to talk to their visitors by telephone behind solid bulletproof glass.  The only way to get them off drugs is with medical treatment and the preventing drugs being smuggled into prisons. They will only make up their minds to co-operate with the system when they know it is impossible for them to get drugs.</P>

I am tired of hearing that crime is going to be an issue in the next election, as if we will forget about crime until the election, solve all crime during the campaign and then forget about it.  That ludicrous idea is being peddled around the country.  Crime is an ongoing problem in every country which has to be dealt with &mdash; and is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>How and when did the drug barons become known as &ldquo;the untouchables&rdquo;?  Who did not touch them over the years?  This Government has set out to tackle the major crime lords.  However, tonight the largest political party has tabled a motion condemning the Minister for dealing with crime. This motion would be unbelievable if it did not come from Fianna Fáil.  Any party which would table such a motion is totally out of touch.</P>

The prison <Col N="66" /> was not altered because the hospital and patients were not removed until the middle of last year when the Department of Justice created 25 places from the available accommodation.  It also progressed in its plans for the prison.  Nobody need think they can fool me that the prison was put on the shelf.  I know, because, like the Minister, I was there.  Fianna Fáil sanctioned the building of the wall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is bizarre because the Government is in the process of providing an additional 800 prison places.  More importantly, it is committed to a root and branch review of the way in which the prisons are managed.  The Minister is probably aware of the good work being done on Spike Island, including the potential to renovate and convert two derelict blocks.  Matters could be helped by expanding the space available at Fort Mitchell, Cobh, in my own constituency.</P>
      <P>Attempts at political point scoring are understandable in an election year.  However, Fianna Fáil's simplistic analysis of the problems facing the criminal justice system is depressing.  The provision of extra prison places will accomplish little unless it takes place in the context of a reform of the prison system and sentencing policy.  This is why the Government is committed to the establishment of an independent prison agency and courts service.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that convicted wealthy people take a jail sentence when presented with the option of paying a hefty fine or spending one month in jail. It should not be available to them.  It is also appalling that, as frequently happens, people do not consider it a problem to be sent to jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative framework in which our prisons operate dates back to 1826.  Progress has been piecemeal, with successive Administrations making changes as necessary.  In 1985 the Whitaker inquiry into the penal system produced a comprehensive report which was promptly consigned to the dustbin in the Department of Justice.  It was also neglected by successive Fianna Fáil Administrations until the Government resurrected its central recommendation and decided last year to establish an independent prisons agency.  An expert group under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan McAuley is considering the best way to establish the agency and I understand that a report to the Government is expected shortly.  The establishment <Col N="67" /> of such an agency is at least as important to the future of our prison system as the provision of more prison spaces.</P>
    <P>Recent debate on crime has focused on ways of preventing criminal activity and securing convictions, which is important.  However, there should be an equal focus on what we do with offenders after conviction.  While there is a notorious lack of statistics regarding the criminal justice system, we know that approximately 50 per cent of prisoners have previously served at least one prison sentence.  That does not say much for the effectiveness of the prison system.  Fianna Fáil's view of the system is simply one of containment.</P>

      <P>Its focus should switch to sentencing, management and rehabilitation.  The Government should place more emphasis on implementing the five year programme for the management of offenders and on adult literacy. Spike Island is heavily involved in this, and also in skills provisioning and integration facilities following release.</P>
      <P>The motion &ldquo;...deplores the fact that dangerous criminals are given full temporary release on the sole criterion that there is an insufficiency of prison places;...&rdquo;.  While I deplore the <i>ad hoc</i> manner in which prisoners who may only have served a few days of their sentence are released into the community to make way for the latest intake from the courts, the problem will not be solved simply by providing more prison places. The establishment of an independent parole board is required to ensure that early and temporary releases are fully monitored and that the conditions of release are tailored to the history and needs of individual prisoners.  It is vital to ensure that when space is needed, prisoners are not dumped on the streets in conditions which may encourage them to reoffend.</P>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the concept of temporary release as such.  It can be a valuable addition to the rehabilitation process.  The problem is with the way it is administered.  It is surprising that when the question of prison places is debated, there is little mention of alternative non custodial sanctions.  The sanctions imposed by society on those who violate its laws must serve two fundamental aims: to protect society and to rehabilitate and reintegrate the offender.  In addition, sanctions must reinforce the notions of community and responsibility when possible.  The offender must make recompense for the harm he or she has occasioned to the individual and the community.  If possible, therefore, the sanction should in some way be connected to the offence. Viewed from this perspective, the present range of sanctions, especially the manner in which they are frequently imposed, is largely ineffective.</P>

    <P>In 1992, 1,655 people were imprisoned for civil debt and non payment of fines.  Such imprisonment <Col N="68" /> makes neither financial nor social sense. The cost of keeping a prisoner for a week is £840. Imprisonment does not enable the individual to pay the money owed; on the contrary, it may result in the loss of employment, thus making it more difficult to pay a fine or debt.</P>
    <P>The motion is an inadequate response to the problem facing the criminal justice system.  By contrast, the Government is developing and implementing a coherent and long-term response to crime, which includes the provision of an extra 800 prison places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a comprehensive overhaul of our prison system, which as it currently operates is not doing the job.  The country is not well served by it.  There are too few prison places with the result that prisoners are being released having served only a fraction of their sentences.  Every year approximately 4,000 prisoners are released early and the Department of Justice does not know what proportion of sentences are not being served as a result of temporary release.  Every day 50 prisoners are released to create space in the prisons.  Drugs are freely available in prisons and people who enter the system drugs free can leave it addicted to hard drugs.  The cost of imprisonment in Ireland is high by international standards. It costs £900 a week to keep an average prisoner in jail in Ireland compared to approximately half that figure in Britain.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party introduced a Private Members' Prisons Bill in the other House last night.  The key proposals in the Bill are that the management of prisons should be transferred to a prison service executive, headed by a director of prisons appointed by the Government; the appointment of an inspector of prisons; that there should be a duty on the Minister for Justice to provide adequate prison spaces to meet the needs of prisoners sentenced by the courts, and that there should be a register of temporary release.</P>
      <P>The prison system is being grossly mismanaged and, as a result, everybody is losing out.  Prisoners lose out because they are kept in substandard accommodation without appropriate rehabilitation facilities.  The public loses out because prisoners convicted of serious crimes are released onto the streets without serving their full sentences. Prison officers lose out because they are exposed to unnecessary dangers in what should be secure institutions.  An example is the recent siege in Mountjoy Jail.  It is totally unacceptable that prison officers should be subjected to attacks from prisoners wielding blood filled syringes and that some of them must then spend anxious months off work awaiting the results of AIDS tests in the wake of such attacks.  This problem must be sorted out quickly and a fresh start is required.  Control of the prisons must be taken from the Department of Justice and, as the Bill in the other House last night suggested, entrusted to an independent executive agency.</P>

      <P>I did not say that.  The Department of Justice has consistently demonstrated that it is incapable of managing the prisons system in an efficient and effective manner.  The first objective of the new agency should be the provision of extra prison accommodation from the current figure of 2,300 places to approximately 3,500 places within the lifetime of the next Government.  This increase is necessary to stop the current revolving door system and end the scandal of uncontrolled temporary release once and for all.</P>
      <P>An increase in prison spaces is also required if we are to cope with the increase in demand which will arise from the introduction of restrictions on access to bail once the necessary legislation is passed.  New accommodation will obviously be needed and the quickest and cheapest way of bringing a new prison on stream is to build it within the walls of an existing secure institution. In addition to the new remand centre promised for the secure site at Wheatfield, a new 600 unit prison should be built without delay at Portlaoise, where a site is already available for this purpose within the secure perimeter of the existing prison and where plans have been made for the building of a prison for over a decade.  New prisons must be of modern design and, in the interest of speed and efficiency, they should be built by the private sector and leased back to the State.  If we must wait for the Department of Justice to build them, we will have to wait too long.</P>

      <P>Last June the Minister for Justice promised in the other House in the wake of the murder of Veronica Guerin that a new remand prison would be built at Wheatfield to cater for 400 prisoners.  However, almost nine months later, nothing has happened and not a sod has been turned on the Wheatfield site.  The project has not even been put out to tender.  If past experience is anything to go by, it will take several years before the Department of Justice is able to bring the new remand facility on stream.</P>
      <P>There is a huge outcry among the public about this issue.  I talk to people daily and many elderly people are furious that young individuals who break into their homes are arrested by the Garda, charged and committed to prison are back on the streets within weeks.  They are losing respect for politicians and the institutions of the State and change must be brought about.  I do not suggest the only way the crime problem can be solved is to take all the people involved off the streets, lock them up in jail and throw away the key.  Many other social issues need to be addressed through education and health initiatives; a two pronged approach is necessary.  However, the Minister for Justice and the Department are responsible for the prison system and there are not enough spaces at present for people sentenced by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Convicted criminals have lost all respect for the justice system.  They are not scared of committing <Col N="70" /> crimes or of being caught and convicted because they know they will be back on the streets after a couple of weeks in Mountjoy Jail or another prison.  It is damaging for the victims of crimes when they see the culprits back on the streets.  It is also demoralising for gardaí who bring people before the courts, secure a conviction and then see them laughing at them as they walk down the streets of towns and villages within weeks.  I appreciate the Minister has a difficult task and that she is making efforts.  She has brought prison places on stream in the Curragh and in Castlerea. However, the huge problem which exists must be addressed quickly and it will take too long for the Department of Justice to bring the new facilities on stream.  This is why I urge the Minister to consider some of my party's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest anybody is accused of being an idiot, that means I have six minutes.  I welcome the Minister to the House, but the same points are being repeated.  The reason we continue to table motions is to bring the ineffectiveness of the prison regime to attention.  Although the <Col N="71" /> Castlerea and Wheatfield projects may go ahead, the prison system is failing the country.  It fails to protect citizens and rehabilitate prisoners, and whatever Minister comes to the House to defend the record of the prison service will have difficulty doing so.  This is not the fault of prisoner officers or governors because the prisons are archaic, underfunded and ineffectual.</P>
      <P>The recent documentaries on Mountjoy Jail pinpoint the reality of the prison system.  Some prisoners know Mountjoy Jail inside out because they have spent half their criminal lives there, either on drugs or trying to come off them. However, when they hit the streets of Dublin or Cork, they return to criminal circles.  One is guaranteed that they will be back before the courts and return to prison.  If there are not enough prison places, it will not be possible to control the problem or provide the facilities which prisoners need for rehabilitation.  Many prisoners would like to take part in education programmes and undergo rehabilitation to stay off drugs.  The Minister claims to be on top of the prison brief and she is aware that it is a disgrace to put people in some of the existing prisons.  The Minister should visit Spike Island and take it as an example of what modern prisons should be. The prisoners and the prison officers are in a relaxed and controlled atmosphere and they have the space to take part in education and drug rehabilitation programmes.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not hide behind a charade of saying there are sufficient prison spaces and that she has done enough.  She has not.  In the wake of the murder of Veronica Guerin the Minister announced that following meetings with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Social Welfare, Finance and the Environment, the prison project would proceed in January 1997 at the latest.  That is a delay in anybody's language. The Government has been in office for over two years and it has delayed the implementation of this prison project.</P>
      <P>The Minister should acknowledge that the Castlerea project was delayed and should ensure it is now expedited.  The public must have faith in the Prison Service to detain people and to ensure that prisoners are not out on temporary release or escape from custody while in transit.  How many prisoners have escaped from custody while being transferred to a court or to other prisons?  The Minister has announced time and again that she is reviewing that process and I would like to know what the review has shown up.  What procedures are in place to ensure that convicts being moved within the prison system do not escape due to inadequate security during transportation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it is important that the safe keeping of prisoners is ensured, there is a more fundamental problem in society.  Young people are getting involved in crime at an early age to feed their drug habits or that of a parent or guardian. Governments have done little to ensure that this cycle of crime is broken.  In Blackpool in England <Col N="72" /> a heroin addict appeared before a court recently who was only nine years old and we are not too far away from that.</P>
    <P>Drug addicts plunder society to feed their habits and when they are caught they are sent to prison. However, they are simply being put in places without proper monitoring facilities, education or drug rehabilitation programmes.  I stress the need for proper programmes, not token programmes that look good when the Minister announces them.  The prison system is overcrowded, underfunded and badly managed as has been proved by recent happenings in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>We will continue to table motions condemning the Government until concrete action is taken. Nothing has been done so far and no action is visible, apart from a wall at Castlerea and a couple of photographs of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious issue and it gives us no pleasure to have to talk about the problems in the prison system.  In Clonmel last week a District Justice told a man who was released from prison to sue the State.  This man committed serious offences and was sentenced to three months in jail, yet he was back in Clonmel after only 36 hours.  On his return he broke into the house of the family to whom he had caused trouble and assaulted them.  He was arrested and the Garda sergeant in Clonmel rang Limerick Prison and was told that even if he brought the man to the prison gates he would not be let in.</P>
      <P>Many prison spaces are taken up by people who have committed petty crimes, such as not paying bus fares, and this points up a fault in the system.  I am delighted to see the numbers of gardaí on the beat in Dublin who were brought in to police &ldquo;Operation Freeflow&rdquo;.  I have been calling for many years for gardaí to be brought out on the beat and they should be more visible in rural towns.  This is a step in the right direction and may make people feel more secure.</P>
      <P>The Minister should speed up the provision of the badly needed prison accommodation so that prisoners who have committed serious offences are not released after short periods.</P>

      <P>I want to put to lie a couple of myths that keep recurring in these Houses.  Let me clarify the first of those about this so-called prison plan that I inherited.  In November 1994, when the Labour Party were driven out of Government by disgraceful actions on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party, Fianna Fáil had about a month on their own in Government while a new Government was being formed.  Fianna Fáil cobbled together a budget which they knew would never be passed because they did not have a majority.  They just wrote up this budget and they stuck in all kinds of projects, including a £4.5 million line in the budget for this so-called Castlerea Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> This was at a time when the Castlerea building was filled with patients that needed to be moved by the Department of Health.  They knew that this budget was never going to see the light of day; but it has proved a certain benefit to them because they can keep saying, in case people do not know the detail, that they provided the money.  They did not provide any money whatsoever for Castlerea.</P>

      <P>You can criticise me all you like when I am finished.  I want to get this absolutely clear.  We had this funny budget of a month's duration which never saw the light of day, with a line in it that said that Fianna Fáil were going to spend £4.5 million in 1995 on building a prison in Castlerea.  This was a place in which patients still lived.  There was not a single line drawn on a map, or on an architect's or quantity surveyor's plan to say how this building was going to be built.  Not a single tender had gone out, not a single contractor had been approached, not a single ounce of mortar or cement had been bought.  Yet the Fianna Fáil Party have pedalled this line for the last two years in the hope that some unsuspecting members of the public will think that they had a plan.  They did not have a plan.  I inherited zilch when I took over in the Department of Justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The other myth I want to get rid of is this nonsense of saying that the Labour Party and Democratic Left have somehow tied my hands and stopped me doing things.  There was never better co-operation between the Democratic Left, Labour and Fine Gael Parties and it is the combined experiences of those three parties that have benefited this country in bringing to bear the kind of policies that we have brought about; policies which have been carefully and properly considered and not just rushed at for the sake of saying that we have done something about it.</P>

      <P>The Castlerea project would not have taken a single step forward unless, with the help of Minister Quinn, we had reviewed how that prison would be built, how we could phase it to get it up and running as quickly as possible.  In the course of consideration, in the months that Minister Quinn gave me to review the whole prison building, I was able to put together a much larger programme which was then funded by Minister Quinn and the Government in order to ensure that we had an ongoing provision of prison places.  I have to remind the Senators on the opposite side of the House that the last prison that was built in this country was commenced and got on its feet when Fine Gael and Labour were last in Government.  Between 1986-7 no new prison project was built and we all know that the Castlerea idea came from a particular political problem in that county because the then Taoiseach decided that it would make a good press statement for <i>The Longford Leader</i> or <i>The Roscommon Herald</i> or any of the other newspapers in that area.</P>

      <P>There is no budget from Europe. There may be budgets for building dance halls or bars but there is no budget for building prisons. What we have now is a comprehensive prison building programme.  Senator Fahey and Senator Farrell made very constructive contributions as did all the people on the Government side. Senator Henry also made a very constructive contribution.</P>

      <P>The widening of the debate about how we deal with criminals and potential criminals in this country is a worthy and necessary one. I want to pick up on a few points that were made because it is not by prison places alone that I, or any Minister for Justice will tackle the crime problem.  It is a much wider problem.  I get the dregs of people when they are ready to go into prison.  I am like the sticking plaster after the wound has been created.  It is time that all of us recognise that we will have to spend money and give resources to tackle the problem at its roots, where young people are in dysfunctional families or in wealthy families where there is not enough parental control.  All of these issues, proper school attendance and so forth, have to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the new Children Bill, which is going through the Dáil today and whose preparation I supervised over the last year and a half, together with my colleague, Minister Austin Currie, will represent the most radical overhaul since 1908 in relation to the justice system in respect of <Col N="76" /> minors.  The system is waiting to be modernised since then.  The Bill will have real resources and make real progress in beginning to tackle the issue where it needs to be tackled.  There is no doubt that ten and 11 year olds in our society today are only waiting their time, there is practically a name on a bed in Mountjoy for some of those children.  Our responsibility is to try to break that inexorable link between that young child starting a life of petty crime and ending up being an inmate of Mountjoy or other prisons.  I hope that the Children Bill, when it is passed, will play a very significant role in improving the situation in order to tackle the problem at the most basic level.</P>
    <P>This Government has a plan for 800 prison places and I hope that the next Government, of which I hope I will be a member, will continue to recognise that that will not be enough.  There is a point at which we must ensure there is a sufficient number of prison places.  Allied to providing prison places, we must also look at other measures such as the improvement of the rehabilitation services inside and outside of the prisons and improving links between the Prison Service and the health boards for giving drug treatment when people come out of prisons.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics amazed me.  It is estimated that if the UK was to keep abreast of the number of prison places they require, they would have to build a new prison every three weeks.  In the USA they would have to build a new prison every three days.  They are startling figures and there is no point pretending that we, as a developed, modern society, are not facing into some of the problems that more established democracies have begun to face.</P>
    <P>There have been major increases in drug abuse and the allied criminality that accompanies it, sexual crimes and the exploitation of women and children, fiscal crime, tax evasion and the abuse of the Internet.  These are new types of crime and, whether we like it or not, certain problems accompany improvements in the economy and society.</P>
    <P>I do not know the number of places that would be required for prisoners were we to keep abreast of the figures involved.  However, for the past ten years, we have not made the necessary incremental improvements to the prison system.  If we had, there would now be a better management structure in place for the prison system.  Senator Honan was extremely and unfairly critical of prison management and people in the upper echelons of the Department of Justice.  There are 49 people employed in the prisons section of the Department who constitute the headquarters staff of the prison system.  This group has suggested reform initiatives in the past but resources have not been forthcoming.  It gave full support to the concept of a new prisons agency because the officials concerned have firsthand knowledge of the difficulties involved.  They know what is required each week to release people in order to make spaces available and are aware of the pressures <Col N="77" /> that accompany threatened suicide in our prisons.  They are also aware of the difficulties involved with mixing remand and convicted prisoners.</P>
    <P>Members might be interested to note that the Northern Ireland Prison Service employs 250 people in this capacity.  The reason that only 49 people are employed in the Irish Prison Service is not because the Department of Justice did not seek the necessary resources; it is due to the fact that during the past eight to nine years successive Governments did not provide additional resources to ensure the staff can manage prisons. If adequate spaces are provided, a prison can be managed quite well.  However, what action do Senators want us to take?  There are difficulties because there are not enough spaces available. As I inquired yesterday, do they want us to stack prisoners like firewood in their cells?  At present, cells are already overcrowded.</P>
    <P>There is an immediate problem with overcrowding in prisons.  However, it must also be recognised that the number of people entering prison exceeds the number being released. Judgments must be made in respect of those considered eligible for early release.  Approximately 30 prisoners are released each day, not all of whom are set at liberty because of problems with space.  They might be released because they obtained a job, a place on a training course or are returning to school.  As Senator Sherlock correctly stated, since 1960 there has been a system of statutory early and temporary release in the State which successive Ministers for Justice utilised. Efforts by the Opposition Members to pretend that I invented the idea of temporary or early release are without foundation and they are barking up the wrong tree.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the new facility in the Central Mental Hospital. That facility is open but a ward in the hospital has been closed down.  I would like to see this ward reopened and I am involved in discussions with the Department of Health about this matter. There is a great deal of truth in Senator Henry's comments about psychiatric cases in prisons. There are people in prison who are psychiactrically ill and should not be there.  They should be in psychiatric detention in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The downside of the policy of releasing people from psychiatric hospitals into a community environment is that because of the nature of their illnesses, a number of them commit crimes and receive prison sentences.  They cannot cope with living in society or being imprisoned and they require psychiatric treatment.  This is a matter of concern and I am in continuous communication with the Department of Health about it.  I am also concerned that people who complete sentences in <Col N="78" /> the Central Mental Hospital should be referred to the psychiatric hospitals in their communities. I regret that this does not happen as often as it should.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville and others raised the issue of suicide and he referred to the National Suicide Prevention Group which is currently in operation. I recently arranged for the visiting committee to have access to that group on a twice yearly basis to inform it about the issues raised with the committee by prisoners.  The advantages of this have already become apparent because modifications will be built into the new prison programme to ensure that cells will not provide people with the opportunity to commit suicide.  It is extremely sad and tragic that some people find themselves forced to commit suicide while in prison.  Unfortunately, as Senator Henry stated, this mirrors the increase in suicides of young men in a particular age group.  There is a greater than normal preponderance of men of that age group in our prisons who are often involved in drug abuse before entering prison, come from bad family backgrounds and fall into the corresponding category of males in normal society.  I hope the Suicide Prevention Group will help to reduce the numbers of those committing suicide.</P>
    <P>Members referred to a number of prisons.  I announced that I hoped work would commence on Mountjoy Prison in January of this year. However, like other citizens, I am bound by the planning regulations.  It is virtually impossible, when making an estimate of the desired time regarding the commencement of work on a prison, to copperfasten what might be approved under the planning process.  I am sure Senator Mulcahy would not want me to ignore the planning regulations but there were 125 representations from local residents about the women's prison at Mountjoy.  We had to deal with the objections and queries raised by these people and meet with Dublin Corporation to discover the modifications that could be made to alleviate their concerns.  These people are living in the vicinity of a dense prison complex.  They are entitled to have an input into future developments and I wanted to accommodate them as far as possible.</P>

      <P>Senator Sherlock raised the issue of Spike Island and referred to the two derelict buildings on the site.  When reviewing where we might build prisons fast, we looked at Spike Island, as we did with the Curragh and Limerick. We opted for renovating the Curragh and building a new wing in Limerick prison where there were already walls.  Those jobs had to be done fast and one downside of building on Spike Island is that the costs involved are greatly increased.  It costs about 30 per cent more to bring material to the island; I am not saying that at some time in the future we will not look again at Spike Island.</P>
      <P>Portlaoise was not in the first programme I announced but in the last week I announced that a new segregation unit will be built in the Portlaoise complex.  This programme is not the end.  I intend to visit Spike soon and it may come under the microscope again but there is the downside of travelling to it by boat, carrying every builder over to it and problems if a riot occurs there. When Spike was opened, because it was rushed through as the kind of emergency measure the Opposition feel is a panacea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Farrell and others raised the issue of drug addicts getting prison sentences.  The Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, which was administered by the Department of Health and not the Department of Justice, allowed the former Department to build a secure drug treatment facility to which the courts would have access.  Instead of getting a month or year in Mountjoy, a person would be sentenced to this drug treatment centre and serve the sentence in a lockup system there.  We do not have such a facility in this country and it must be considered.  It was not considered by previous Governments but it was raised in Minister of State Rabbitte's report and will be examined.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has doubled the number of detoxification spaces in Dublin hospitals.  It has units in Beaumont and Cherry Orchard, outpatient spaces have almost doubled in the Dublin area in the past year and extra medical staff are also available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confused about the Progressive Democrats' role in this debate.  Deputy O'Donnell says she will save £15,000 per prisoner.  How is that to be reconciled with Senator Honan's contribution? I am not an economist or the Minister for Finance but if we build the prison with 600 places in Portlaoise <Col N="81" /> that Senator Honan advocated, that will not save £15,000 per prison space.  It will cost money and the Senator should have the honesty to say so.  If the Progressive Democrats were not looking both ways at the same time they might make some sense.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 37 to 40 and in page 6, to delete lines 1 to 3.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see that many of the concerns expressed on Committee Stage have been taken on board.  The original intention of the amendment was that local authorities and health boards would not have three years before complying with the Bill.  That is too much time.  The Minister has reduced the period from three years to 18 months, and that is a step in the right direction. However, 18 months is too long.  If it is appropriate that Departments should be given only a year, the same should apply to local authorities and health boards.  Unless we impose a definite time limit nothing will be done.  It will not take them as long as one might think to get their affairs in order and nothing will be done until they are confronted by the deadline.  The arguments made on Committee Stage are still valid and, while I accept that the Minister has come a considerable way towards meeting the requirement, it would be better to delete the paragraph and to have all parts of the public service and local authorities comply with the legislation within one year of the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has exercised considerable flexibility by accepting many amendments from this side of the House.  She has behaved in a way that is uncharacteristic of Ministers, irrespective of ministerial political views, and I compliment her for that.  Together we improved what was a very interesting and good draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no good or compelling reason for excluding local authorities or health boards for a <Col N="85" /> minute longer than the Civil Service.  The arguments in favour of encompassing the local authorities and health boards in the Freedom of Information Bill are more potent than those for the central administration.  The health boards and local authorities increasingly impact upon the lives, well being and interests of the citizen.  Our public representatives at local level have been dealing in an unequal struggle.</P>
    <P>There is a serious need to balance local government between the powers and authority of the managers and the diminishing role the councillors have had to play.  I highlighted this issue by drawing attention to the fact that a Labour councillor in Wicklow had to take the council to the High Court to get information.  That is wrong and it should never happen.  No councillor should have to put their limited assets on the line to get information from a county council.  There are arguments for and against in that case but the situation is illustrated by the Glending Wood action. It is intriguing that, even in the last week, we have begun to get further information about that court action.  None of these secrets would have existed if councillors had the right of access to all files.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the novelty of seeing the law officers of councils in the council chamber.  If I recall correctly, the novelty was so great in the case of the Minister's counsel that the law officer passed out and had to be resuscitated.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that a part of public administration where significant decisions are made has denied public access to its dealings.  That is absolutely wrong and we cannot defend it.  I am pleased the Minister has reduced the waiting period from three years to 18 months.  It should only be one year but a great deal of good will be done by allowing the Freedom of Information Bill to apply to local authorities, in particular.  The Bill will have a major impact on debates about the rezoning of land, planning and all the issues which have created such tension.  I, and the majority of our council colleagues from all parties, wish that local authorities were subject to it from day one.</P>
    <P>I am not going to press this amendment to a vote but will the Minister ensure that every county manager is put on a state of preparedness because, as Senator Dardis said, we have a tradition of long fingering everything?  Unless there is a strong ministerial hand driving this issue some local authorities will drag their heels and will have to be brought kicking and screaming into the information era.  None of us who served on a council has any reason to fear public access to information.  The only people who are recalcitrant are a small but powerful minority of public officials and this should never be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there is now only a six month difference between ourselves and the Minister on the issue of the waiting period but she has still not put forward a compelling argument to explain that six months.  However, I know she would have <Col N="86" /> preferred 12 months and if we cannot have the best then we can have the second best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the points made by Senators Dardis and Roche and welcome the substantial improvements in the amendments on records.  This is a fair compromise.  Did the Minister look into the possibility of identifying certain categories of records which it might be possible to release earlier than the 18 months cut-off period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in the waiting period.  Three years was too long and 18 months is still too long.  We are encouraging local communities to become involved in local authorities and in matters which are of interest to them and the failure to get information may inhibit that progress.</P>
      <P>With others I have fought for years for people to have access to information regarding planning permission.  That was granted under the planning laws and if one goes into a local authority office one can see people looking at the files.  This gives them great satisfaction.</P>
      <P>Waste disposal is now a major issue.  However, the Minister has made an amendment which I welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State and the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very good debate on this point on Committee Stage and I conveyed the strong views expressed by Senators to my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Health.  I asked them to examine the practicalities and I am pleased that we are able to move forward by 18 months which is an important advance and a tribute to the points made in this House.</P>
      <P>There are practical problems in gearing up organisations who are not in the first round of consultations and who, unlike central Government, have not been in preparation mode over the last 18 months.  There could be difficulties about moving on all categories of information earlier than 18 months but it may be possible to take up Senator Lee's point and designate certain categories which would be available sooner than 18 months.</P>
      <P>Eighteen months is an outside limit and the clock starts ticking for all public bodies the day the President signs this Bill into law.  I look forward to the day when local authorities and health boards, with central Government and other public bodies, move from a culture of secrecy to one of openness and volunteering information first, to their own members, and second, and most importantly, to members of the public.  We all agree that good government is best delivered through openness, whether that be at central or local level.  I have gone a substantial way to meet the concerns expressed by Senators and I thank them for the high quality of debate we had on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister accepts that there is a shared determination on all sides to ensure that information is freely accessible to the public and that no impediments are put in the way.  Whatever loopholes exist for creative officials to avoid providing information must be sealed off.</P>
      <P>I accept that it is more onerous for a local authority to comply within a specified period than it is for central Government, even though a Department's files would be more extensive.  It is also important that the provisions of the Bill will come into operation not later than 18 months and that the Minister has the discretion to ensure that it comes in earlier.  I hope there will be a determination on the Minister's and the Government's part to ensure that the files could be scrutinised earlier.</P>
      <P>I do not want to reopen a debate we had on Committee Stage or to point particularly to a narrow area, but there are more than 2,000 tonnes of toxic waste in County Kildare and a simple question &mdash; where and by whom was it disposed? &mdash; was asked at the local authority.  We still have not received answers and these are the sort of questions to which we should get answers.  If members of local authorities have such difficulty in getting information from the county council officials, how much more difficult is it for the citizen to gain access to the type of information to which he or she is entitled?  However, in the spirit of the general tone in which the Minister has dealt with it on Committee Stage and come back to us now, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is in response to amendments Nos. 19, 23, 24 and 28 which were tabled on Committee Stage by Senator Lee, where he sought that the forms would be such as might be reasonably sought by the requester.  So as to avoid wholesale amendments throughout the Bill, we have decided in this amendment to propose to amend the term &ldquo;determined&rdquo; in the definitions so that right throughout the Bill the needs of requesters will <Col N="88" /> be taken into account in looking at the form in which applications or any of the paperwork will be handled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 36, to delete &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;specified condition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, this is something which we debated at some length on Committee Stage.  It has to do with the information being held by a public body on the understanding that it would be treated by it as confidential.  The question arose as to the vagueness of the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; and the capacity it would generate for an official to decide that something was confidential.  The amendment seeks to replace &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; by saying it is a &ldquo;specified condition&rdquo;.  In other words, it is only confidential when it is specified to be such.  The problem I have with the Bill as it is drafted is that it gives this faceless official far too much leeway to decide that something is confidential when, in fact, it may or should not be confidential, and that is the difficulty I have with the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment because I can see the point Senator Dardis is making.  The word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; is a very strong word and &ldquo;specified condition&rdquo; seems to me to be more specific.  It certainly limits the opportunity for a public official who would wish to be less than open to be creative with his or her interpretation of the Act.  It seems there is a great deal of benefit in the amendment of Senator Dardis and Senator Honan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the concerns expressed by Senator Dardis on Committee Stage, I received further legal advice on the meaning of the term &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;.  My legal advice is that it means an understanding by both parties and it would not be open to only one person <Col N="89" /> to have an understanding that it be treated as confidential.  Whether it is implicit or explicit that it be treated as confidential, an understanding by one party only could not be regarded as an understanding of confidence.</P>
      <P>The amendment as proposed by Senator Dardis could have undesirable side affects.  First, public bodies hold a great deal of sensitive information on people &mdash; medical records, circumstances and the financial position of families, etc. &mdash; and if the Senator's amendment was accepted, there would have to be an explicit statement that these were confidential and there could be a risk that this kind of sensitive and intrinsically private information would come into the public domain when it would not be legitimate for it to come into the public domain to third parties.</P>
      <P>Second, there is already much information which public bodies hold which will come into the public domain under the Bill, either immediately or as we engage in the rolling back process until it meets the National Archives Act, 1986, information which was supplied without an explicit understanding of confidence but with an implicit understanding on both sides that it was confidential information and should be treated in confidence. Again, this would consist of existing personal records and files and there could be a legal doubt about it.  After the Bill is enacted, people will declare that new information is or is not confidential, but there must be a system for dealing with existing information.  My legal advice is that the way it is put in the Bill protects against these kinds of dangers.  In any event, if there were to be any abuse of this understanding of confidence in situations where it would be unwarranted, one could always appeal to the Information Commissioner.</P>
      <P>We have had to and must be careful in enacting legislation to ensure the legitimate right to personal privacy of individuals with regard to personal affairs in which there is no legitimate or overriding public interest.  In opening the books and files on general matters and matters which ought to be in the public domain and on which there is a legitimate public interest, it is incumbent on us to ensure that we do not trespass into the individual's right to privacy, which is one of the unenumerated constitutional rights of people which Members of this House on all sides would want to see respected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that it is difficult to make it so that it is not too confined.  I accept the point, for instance, that if there is information on an individual which comes before a housing meeting of a local authority, it would be entirely inappropriate that some of the personal information on those files would be made generally available.  I am somewhat reassured by the fact that the Minister said it would be the understanding of both parties and not just of some council official.  In those circumstances, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, Senator O'Sullivan raised an interesting point concerning the possibility of a loophole if a freedom of information request was addressed to an official as distinct from the head of a public body. This set of amendments addresses a potential loophole which may arise in this area and I welcome the point made by Senator O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 is a technical amendment to ensure that any freedom of information request addressed to any member of staff of a public body would also be acceptable under the Act, so if one applies to the chief planning officer it is the same as if one applies to the county manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate on section 6(4) I undertook to the House that I would come back with mechanisms to improve access to past records.  The effect <Col N="91" /> of the deletion proposed in amendment No. 8 is to make it considerably easier to make regulations for retrospection &mdash; in other words, they will be passive rather than active regulations.  A positive resolution of the Houses will not be required, so a lazy Minister for Finance will not have an excuse to do this in the simple way.  This amendment is linked to amendment No. 10 on retrospection.</P>
      <P>It is our intention that access to past records should be provided on a rolling basis.  Access would apply initially to all personal information of the requester, all current files subject to the security, etc., exemptions and any related historical records needed to understand current files. Access to past records would then be provided on a rolling back basis &mdash; first two years, then four years, then six years, etc.  I now propose that where there is interest in past records on a particular subject matter, regulations can be made enabling access to these records regardless of how far the rolling back process has generally taken place.  For instance, if we have rolled back ten years but someone is interested in 15 year old records on a particular subject, there will be a facility to roll back the period for those records if the general rolling back process has not reached that point.  Similarly, if records of a particular period are of special interest &mdash; that is, people wish to read 15 year old records but the rolling back process has only reached five years &mdash; it might be feasible to allow that in this way as well.</P>
      <P>This allows greater flexibility and will improve the rolling back process.  Students of administration, archivists and historians can be facilitated in accessing key material; or if there is material in which there is general public interest and the rolling back process has not reached it, particular records can be designated and singled out.  That will improve access to past records and I hope it will not be too long before this process meets the 30 year rule under the National Archives Act, so that we will have full access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lee's amendment No. 11 is a retabling of his Committee Stage amendment No. 10.  The wording of this amendment could cause difficulty as it might be construed as unnecessarily broad. It provides that the records referred to in this section are &ldquo;any records relevant to an application made by a requester&rdquo;.  Theoretically this could result in truckloads full of documents becoming available if all those records are brought in and the requester might not be interested in all of them.  It could also impose a substantial and onerous legal responsibility to look for any related records.  As the provision is currently worded, if a person wishes to look at a current file, all cognate material needed to understand the file comes under the Bill.  If there were related files in other Departments &mdash; for example, a memorandum for Government would be circulated to 15 Ministers and there would be a copy in each Department &mdash; a trawl for such files could be cumbersome.  It could also be counter-productive <Col N="92" /> in terms of what we are trying to do, which is to make access to information quick, speedy and efficient, something which goes with the grain of public administration rather than leading to bureaucrats deciding it is a terrible nuisance which they will oppose tooth and nail.</P>
    <P>Also, section 6(2) of the Bill imposes a requirement on public bodies to help requesters with their requests.  I believe this requirement &mdash; coupled with Senator Lee's amendment to section 10, which we have re-tabled as amendment No. 19, prohibiting a public body from easily rejecting an unfocused request &mdash; will ensure that the interest of requesters will be well protected. I think we have taken on board the spirit of the Senator's other amendments on this topic; and if my amendments are accepted, the net position will substantially meet his concerns in a way which will leave the Bill readily operable by public bodies.</P>

I still like my wording but I will not detain the House for it.  Is there any way the Minister can indicate the possible timetable of the rolling back?  Will there be a built in periodisation?  After how long will we have gone back &mdash; two years, four years or six years?  I appreciate that will vary between different types of record, but when the Bill goes to the other House it would be helpful it were possible to have an indication of the timescales the Minister envisages for major categories of material.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, what is the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;was created more than three years prior to the commencement of the Act&rdquo; in section 6 (6) (b)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Sherlock's query, that provision relates to personnel records.  A civil servant may look for his or her personnel file and if there is anything on the file which has obstructed his or her promotion, he or she can see the full file, otherwise the files go back three years.  This was included at the request of Government Departments for the purposes of managing personnel files created before thought was given to freedom of information.  If there was anything on the file which might be inappropriately used, the whole file becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Senator Lee's query on how quickly we can roll back, the Minister for Finance is the relevant Minister.  If I am Minister for Finance in a future Administration it will take place quite quickly, or if I have another portfolio in a future Administration I will put pressure on the Minister for Finance of the day to roll it back quickly.  As the Senator understands and as we <Col N="93" /> discussed on Committee Stage, this has been devised in this way because, based on the experience of the introduction of freedom of information in other jurisdictions, the first task faced by public bodies is to get their current and future record keeping systems right as those are the records sought by most inquirers.  When that is done, the rolling back process will commence.  I hope that it gets moving reasonably fast because that is what has happened in other countries.  It is a question of putting filing systems and access in order.  The first priority is to look at the present and the future, the second priority is to clean up the past.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete line 13.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the necessity to state that the request is made under the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 14 and 19 are Government amendments and I am prepared to concede that they are an improvement, particularly amendment No. 14, which goes quite a long way towards dealing with some of the problems we addressed on Committee Stage.  The problem was that failure to state that the application was made under the Bill would be grounds for refusal.</P>
      <P>Rather than requiring the person to state that they are making the request under the Bill, it should be made part of the application form.  It would be better not to have the specification at all, but if it has to be there it should be possible to fulfil the requirement by having it as part of the application form.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred on Committee Stage to the New Zealand experience in this area and the difficulties which the deletion of the paragraph might pose.  I will wait to hear what she has to say before we decide what to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to look up some references to the implementation of the New Zealand legislation but I still cannot understand why we need this paragraph.  If we were creating a real freedom of information culture it would not be necessary for a citizen to cite the Act.  However, the Minister of State has tabled a number of amendments, which we are discussing with this one, which, in a sense, put the onus on the Department to draw to the person's attention that they have a right to access under this Bill.  The Information Commissioner should monitor this very closely because if there was a failure to draw citizens' attention to their right under the legislation it should be made an absolute right.  However, given that the Minister of State has made some significant changes, the Bill is better in this regard than it was originally.</P>
      <P>We will have an opportunity to revisit some of this territory when we debate the administrative procedures legislation which we both have in mind.  At that stage, the issues of access and the responsibility of public servants to guide citizens so that can fulfil their rights will be incorporated in that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Minister of State has probably gone as far as she can on this occasion because it is not the done thing for Ministers to capitulate on points.  To be fair to the Minister of State and her advisers, she put forward a very spirited defence of the paragraph.  I am not sure I am entirely convinced by that defence but it seems to have been based on some interpretation of what was happening in the Antipodes.  Perhaps <Col N="95" /> that was because they spend their time hanging on as they live in an upside down part of the world.  I am not terribly convinced but, as I said, the Minister of State's amendments have made a big improvement and we are satisfied that we made our point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>

      <P>In relation to amendment No. 12, as I said on Committee Stage, we have concerns that deleting the paragraph could remove from citizens the protection of the Freedom of Information Bill if they just made a general request and could debar them from accessing the Information Commissioner.  As Senator Roche said, that caused problems in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 14 we are taking on board the spirit of the discussion on Committee Stage.  If somebody makes a request for information which would in the normal course be refused as an over the counter request but would be granted under this legislation, there is an obligation on the staff of the public body concerned to inform them of their right to apply for access under this legislation. It is intended to have standard freedom of information request forms.  People might not know of the existence of the legislation or might make a mess of their request.  In both situations there is an onus on the staff to help people to request access to the maximum possible amount of information.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 is essentially the amendment No. 34 which Senator Lee tabled on Committee Stage.  Its effect is that public bodies must assist, or offer to assist, a requester to make a request before ruling it out on the grounds that it does not involve due particularity.  This also replaces the Committee Stage amendment No. 18 tabled by Senator Roche.  We have endeavoured to meet the concerns expressed by Senators on Committee Stage.</P>

We referred on the last occasion to electronic transfers of information and so on.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 was tabled on Committee Stage by Senator Dardis as amendment No. 37.  It amends section 12(1)(b) to allow public bodies provide a transcript in writing of information sought.  Amendment No. 37 is a technical amendment to change the position of a comma.</P>

A deletion from section 2 with regard to copy was agreed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I realise the practical difficulty this imposes. We do not want people to receive lorry loads of information and to have the kind of pressure this entails put on the public body.  However, it is a significant improvement to have it as a transcript rather than a statement in writing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 28, to delete lines 15 to 20 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  if the record relates to proposals, drafts, opinions, and other similar preparatory working papers, explanatory notes or reports which the public institution itself prepares for purely internal use in its preliminary or preparatory work on a case or policy and where publication of the document in isolation may mislead or provide an inaccurate view of the matter contained therein.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section I propose to be substituted for the existing section aims to ensure that with regard to preliminary drafts and texts which circulate of necessity among and within Government Departments, and which can give a misleading view if they are taken in isolation, it should be possible to exclude information which would, in itself and if given in isolation, cause confusion and be misleading.</P>
      <P>There are similar provisions in other freedom of information legislation.  The attempt in those cases, and in the wording attempted to be inserted into the Bill by this amendment, is to prevent the publication of material which would in itself, because of its partial nature, have a contrary effect.  Far from giving freedom of information, it would allow for confusion.  The amendment would have a similar effect to that proposed in the original draft, but it is more specific in terms of the exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to protect documents of a public body with regard to drafts or preliminary documents provided two conditions are satisfied: that they are for internal preparatory use on case or policy work and publication could mislead or give an inaccurate view. The spirit and intent of the amendment is close to the Government's amendments No. 27 and 28, which are concerned with changes to a specific section.  Both seek a level of protection for deliberation of public bodies at preparatory stage in case work or policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this amendment could have unintentional side effects.  These were illustrated with regard to access to information on environmental <Col N="100" /> regulations, and situations reported to the Office of the Ombudsman in 1995 in connection with difficulties encountered by people seeking documents on which no work had been done for ten or 15 years and which the local authority concerned said were incomplete.  Since no definition or description is provided with regard to what constitutes preliminary or preparatory work, a hostile public body could seek to hide material behind this wording.  Many public bodies could argue that virtually everything fell within that category, which is not the intention of the amendment. However, we must be careful in the wording of these provisions.</P>
    <P>The option of refusing such information on the grounds that publication could mislead or give an inaccurate view is similarly uncertain and it could be open to misuse in the hands of the kind of local authorities described by Senator Roche and who are intrinsically not in favour of giving information to the public.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that the amendment could indefinitely protect preliminary documents. Such protection would be open ended and not time bound.  I am sure that as a historian, Senator Lee would be upset if he could not ever access this kind of information.</P>
    <P>By contrast, the Government's amendments essentially require the publication of all such documents once a decision has been taken.  They do not permit the withholding of documents because they are or were drafts or because they might mislead; they permit withholding only where damage to the public interest is certain to arise.</P>
    <P>The point was well made by Senators, especially Senators Dardis and Lee, that the existing wording of section 20 lacks clarity.  The rewording of it proposed by amendments Nos. 27 and 28 makes it sharper and makes the intent clearer. The essential purpose of the section is to protect the deliberations of public bodies where disclosure might lead to premature knowledge of a pending decision of importance.  There may otherwise be exceptional circumstances where such information should be protected in the public interest.  In such cases the public body is required to demonstrate the virtue of certainty that damage to the public interest would arise.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee made the point on Committee Stage that much material could be blocked under this provision and that volumes could be sent to the Information Commissioner, clogging up the system further up the line.  However, that has not been the experience of freedom of information mechanisms abroad where the appeals system has a mandate to work informally and flexibly.  The appeals system in Ireland will have that mandate under section 37(5), section 34(3) and sections 36 and 39 and will work well and in the interest of requesters.  It will narrow the focus of what can be protected and the timeliness of when material is released rather than protect information of a particular nature indefinitely, which may be the <Col N="101" /> unintentional effect of Senator Roche's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">

      <P>The Minister put her finger on the matter.  This issue was discussed on Committee Stage when we debated what was meant by documents relating to the deliberative process, which is itself indistinct.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to contain that further.  When I drafted my amendment I was not aware of the Minister's amendments and she is accurate.  The spirit of my intention is probably more correctly captured in her amendments.  She has, after all, had a belly full of the parliamentary draftsman.  I will not press my amendment because I am happy the spirit of the matter is more properly captured in the Minister's amendments, which I support.</P>

It narrows the focus and scope of where ministerial certificates can be issued.</P>

      <P>We have probably all arrived at the same point and it may be that my amendments have been taken on board in the Minister's amendments.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly the Seanad, have a genuine interest in this matter.  I hope to serve in a different House next time round, but one never knows and one wants to keep all one's options open in this uncertain world.  The Minister has accepted my basic point that there is a tremendous interest in freedom of information in the Seanad.  There are real, beneficial and pragmatic reasons both Houses should be involved in the future work through a joint committee.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we can draw people with talent from both Houses who are genuinely committed and interested in freedom of information.  Some people serving in the Upper House may never be mad enough to seek a position in the Lower House and it would be sad if they could not put themselves forward.  That would have been the position under the original legislation.

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 43, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Prior to a resolution pursuant to subsection (3) being moved in either House of the Oireachtas the matter of the resolution shall be the subject of a Consultation Conference between the leaders of the political parties in Dáil Éireann.  The consultation process shall take place not less than 7 days before the resolution is moved in either House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate I had difficulty trying to formulate a way in which there could be some form of consensus with regard to the ultimate appointment of an Information Commissioner.  It will not arise initially because the Ombudsman will be the commissioner. However, ultimately, we are putting together legislation for the future.  I can foresee a circumstance in the years ahead where there will be an Ombudsman with a wider remit than the current Ombudsman and a separate office of an Information Commissioner filled by a separate personality. This is a good idea.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the legislation relating to the Ombudsman there was a view that there should be political consensus, or as much political consensus as possible, with regard to the nominee. It should be above partisan politics and it would be unfortunate if there was a vote and arguments for and against an individual going forward for that office.  Those views also apply to this legislation; there is a deficiency in the Ombudsman legislation because no process is included in the Act for consultation with the major political leaders of the State.  It is a good idea to include a specific provision in this Bill for a consultation conference between the leaders of the main political parties to ensure there are no unseemly arguments in either House where <i>force majeure</i> will push through a nomination for the Office of the Ombudsman or the office of Information Commissioner.</P>
      <P>It was accepted previously on an informal basis that there would be a consultation process. However, I do not agree there should be secret agreements about informal consultation processes. That is not good and we should include in legislation the matters we want put into effect.  In this case we should try to create a procedure where there would be as little partisan political or public acrimony as possible about the appointment of a high level public official.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because a formal process of consultation is desirable.  I specified a period of seven days because I am aware that in the case of the appointment of the Ombudsman the telephone call was made within hours of the press release being made.  That is not proper consultation process and leads to unnecessary friction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> We have been lucky with the two holders of the office of Ombudsman and I am sure we will be equally lucky with the holders of the office of Information Commissioner.  However, such high level appointments should not be perceived to be in any way tainted by partisanship.  This amendment seeks to achieve a process which would allow a nomination that would receive unanimous support in the Oireachtas.  It is hard to capture that idea in words but I have done so in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  The fact that the first two Ombudsmen have emerged so satisfactorily from a process does not mean that process will always work well.  Anything which enhances the public profile of the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner and draws attention to the roles of those offices is worthwhile.  Spreading information and understanding about those offices is a public good in itself.  This would be a way of attracting media attention which would help to spread understanding of the functions of the offices.  It is not the only way that could be done but it would add an extra dimension to the public perception of the significance of those offices.  Their potential significance cannot be exaggerated if full use is made of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points made by the Senators about the importance of ensuring that these offices are seen to be above party politics. That is why we have provided in the Bill for a vote in both Houses of the Oireachtas and that appointment will be made by the President.  This will afford a status to the office.</P>
      <P>As Senator Roche has acknowledged, this issue applies to other constitutional officers such as the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It may not be appropriate to deal with the matter in a prescriptive way in one Bill for one office.  Perhaps each House would consider amending its Standing Orders to provide a flexible mechanism to deal with consultation.  Senator Roche refers to a seven day period; I appreciate that it is important to give Opposition parties time to consider nominations.  However, it could be damaging to individuals if their names were bandied about in public and they proved unacceptable to a minority.</P>
      <P>We should reflect carefully on how a process of consultation might take place and how it might be adapted in the light of experience.  While accepting the intention of the amendment to copperfasten the independence of the offices concerned, it may be more appropriate to pursue the matter through amendments to the Standing Orders of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe this is appropriate to the Houses' Standing Orders.  There are deficiencies in a number of Acts dealing with the appointment of people to high offices.  I accept <Col N="106" /> there might be a little difficulty if the names of candidates were bandied about.  However, it would be no harm if the merits of the individuals could be discussed.  These people will be appointed to fulfil important public responsibilities. They will operate as an adjunct to the overseeing function of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a pity the Ombudsman Acts do not include a statement that the office itself is attached to the Oireachtas and effectively fulfils a responsibility of the Oireachtas to oversee the Executive.</P>
      <P>I would have no concern about public debates on the merits or demerits of people gong forward for high public office.  It would be healthy and would have the additional benefit of creating more public interest in the office.  This may not be the perfect approach but we need to incorporate in this and in other legislation a procedure to try to create a sense of political consensus about the possible candidates.  I cannot believe that there would not have been political consensus on the appointment of the two Ombudsmen. However, it would be better to include a requirement in the legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 53, line 16, after &ldquo;courts&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or a record concerning the elapse of time in bringing a case to the Courts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I referred to problems I have with the way our courts operate.  Obviously, I was not referring to the way the judges themselves reach their judgments &mdash; that is not a matter which the Houses of the Oireachtas or a Member thereof should be second guessing.  There is an extraordinary amount of damage being done to individuals in our courts because of the archaic way in which the courts are operated.  I think it is appropriate that records concerning the elapse of time in bringing a case to the courts should be accessible.  It seems to me, having looked at several cases&mdash;I am not going to make specific reference to any individual case currently before the courts &mdash; that judges and those who administer the courts seem to be absolutely careless of the fact that a court case which drags on for a number of years wears and grinds down the individual concerned and exhausts their energy.  A long and drawn out case also drains their physical and financial resources and at the end of the day, even if the judgment is in their favour, the judgment has been destroyed because of the elapse of time.</P>
      <P>We have a situation currently in Ireland where we have a whole series of judges being removed from their judicial responsibilities to serve on tribunals. These judges are very good people.  While it is good that they are giving their time to these tribunals, we have to be aware that sometimes where a judge leaves a case half way through, it can result in that case just lying idle for years.  The effect of that on a private individual is horrific.  It may be that the greater public good is being served by judges who are dealing with a tribunal as opposed to completing a case which is before them.  However, it strikes me that the public good should also take into account the impact that these delays have on individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that we have the constitutional right to try to second guess the courts in any of their judicial functions but there <Col N="109" /> are extraordinary, barbarous and intolerable delays in our judicial system.  An individual should be able to question delays in the system. The information relating to those delays should be accessible to the public.  As it stands it is not. I am sure that the Minister has some cogent reason why this amendment cannot be accepted; she knows that my concerns are very real and I think many Members of both Houses share these concerns.  What I am looking for is access to information, similar to what we are looking for in other areas of public policy, to apply also within the court system.  It may be that we have created such complexities in law and have become such a litigious State that delays in court cases are inevitable. There is an old adage that &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; and I am fearful that the complications in our current system are creating a great deal of denial of justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long way to dealing with my personal concerns.  She has encompassed in the Act some of the bodies that hover around the edges of justice &mdash; for example, the Law Society and the Bar Council, in so far as they fulfil any statutory functions which we have given to them under Acts of the Oireachtas.  Something needs to be done to open the courts and to make them more responsive to the citizens and to make it clear, if there are delays, why these have occurred.  We need to have access to records relating to the way the courts do their business. There is one compelling reason why this should be the case and it is that we currently have no analysis of the delays that occur.  There may be a case which goes on for years &mdash; I am thinking of a specific case &mdash; because powerful authorities will not bother to put together their defences. They will seek further delays while they put together response on various points and they use archaic language to create delays which are unacceptable.  Members of the legal profession play this game extremely well.  I suggest to the Minister or to any Member of the House that if you want to see the abuse in this regard, you can look at any case which is taken by a private citizen against a solicitor, against the Bar Council or against the Law Society.  Extraordinary delays occur before the matters reach a conclusion.  This problem does not affect the majority of citizens, but it does affect a small minority and I think it is tragic there is no control over this.  The reason I suggest that we should have access to records concerning the elapse of time in bringing cases before the courts is that if we were more aware of what was happening in the courts, I think we would be less tolerant of what is intolerable, injustice.</P>

Delays are actually occurring within the courts because of the way the courts themselves order cases, because of the burden of additional duties and responsibilities which are sometimes visited on judges.  It is a delay within the court system which I am trying to address, not the delays between plaintiff and defence.  For example, where a defence is delaying proceedings, the judge can intervene.</P>

I appreciate his comments and I think we would all share his concerns.  However, we are bound by the constitutional constraints under Article 35 (2) &mdash; the constitutional independence of judges &mdash; and we need to be very careful about how we word anything in this area.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> This section of the Bill, which is concerned with fees and costs, was not adequately discussed on Committee Stage because we were nearing the end of the debate.  It is very important, because if the costs are pitched in such a way as to be prohibitive, poorer people in the community who might benefit most from the effective implementation of the Bill may be discouraged.  They may also be discouraged because of lack of familiarity with official processes and procedures and a lack of information on the functions of the Bill, but they will be further discouraged if the costs involved are not made clear.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are provisions to waive fees and take circumstances into account, but these must be tightened considerably.  For example, section 47(7) states that where, in the opinion of the head concerned, the estimated cost, as determined by the head is likely to exceed £40, a deposit must be paid.  That may be reasonable in certain cases but there may be people who believe that such a payment is prohibitive. Section 47(2)(b) states:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section the amount of a fee shall be equal to the&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  the estimated cost of any copy of the record made by the public body concerned for the requester concerned,</P>
    <P>as requested by the head concerned.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, Senator Gallagher stated that photocopies made by Cavan County Council cost £1 per page.  Who decides the estimated cost of a record?  Is it done at the whim and pleasure of county council officials or are there standard charges?  How does the Minister anticipate this provision will operate?  In that context, if there are officials who will not be wildly enthusiastic about this legislation, will they discover ways to be unhelpful?</P>
    <P>I am sure that the phraseology used in the amendment can be improved but it attempts to take cognisance of the variables that may arise in this matter.  The section is very important and has not been adequately discussed.  I hope the Minister will take appropriate account of the points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I agree that this section was not adequately discussed on Committee Stage.  A Senator on the other side of the House made the point that a local or public authority could impose additional overheads on to the cost involved and justify them in accountancy terms, but not within those of the Bill.  If a person was informed that it could cost between £100 and £150 to obtain information, they might be scared off and might not be willing to invest their money in that way.  In so far as possible, information should be free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I made the point that fees should only be charged in respect of the direct costs and not indirect costs, such as administrative <Col N="112" /> overheads, which would push the cost above £1 per page.  The fee should be limited to the direct cost involved in producing a record. There should be an absolute freedom for the commissioner to state that no fee or cost should be charged in the circumstances of an individual case.  In general, a citizen attempting to support an argument or case they are making should not be obliged to pay.  Public officials who have access to information, which belongs to the citizens of the State, are using it to vindicate their viewpoint and there should not be a charge on individuals who are trying to respond to the arguments put forward.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with charging a reasonable fee which relates to and is calculated on the basis of direct costs to people such as myself, who are involved in research, or journalists.  Senator Lee made the point that a rigid formula is required to provide that the cost of the fee cannot be used as a means to defeat the purpose of the Bill or discourage people from seeking access to information. At the very maximum, the fee involved should be reasonable and relate to the direct cost and should not take account of overheads or administrative considerations.  The widest discretion possible should be given to waive the fee.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by other Members.  Everyone wants to ensure that people would not be denied information because they did not have adequate money to obtain it, particularly if a large volume was required which would cost a great deal. However, I am not sure that the wording in the amendment is precise enough to achieve what is required.  A subjective value judgment is needed to decide what is a reasonable fee, particularly in respect of the financial and other relevant circumstances of the requester.</P>
      <P>As Senator Lee stated, there are various riders to the point about fees.  For example, these can be waived or reduced if the issue is of national importance.  However, I agree with what the proposers of the amendment are trying to achieve.  I do not know whether it will be possible to reconsider the matter before the Bill returns to the Dáil to see if a wording can be found to take account of the intention behind the amendment. However, I am not sure whether the wording of the amendment will achieve the desired effect.</P>

      <P>There are many subsections in section 47.  For example subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this section the amount of a fee shall be equal to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the estimated cost of the search for and retrieval of the record concerned, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the estimated cost of any copy of the record made by the public body concerned for the requester concerned,</P>
      <P>as determined by the head concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" /> That provision is too flexible.  I am not sure but I believe criteria are laid down by the courts regarding requests for information.  Perhaps these could be used to tie down the provision which, as it stands, does not seem to be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that we sped through the debate on this section on Committee Stage and did not discuss it in detail.  It is an important section and the intention lies very much on the lines of the amendment tabled by Senators Dardis and Lee.  For example, charges may be waived in respect of personal information where, having regard to the means of the requester, such charges would not be reasonable. In cases where such information is being sought, fees are normally charged in respect of photocopying only.  For example, it is not reasonable for a person to pay such a fee to see their old age pension file.</P>
      <P>There is an important constraint in subsection (6) which stipulates that a fee shall not be charged where the cost of collecting and accounting for the fee would exceed the amount of the fee.  It is intended that fees will only arise in respect of photocopying or limited searches.  However, if a large volume of material or material that is difficult to find in a well organised office is being sought, the customer should pay because their request would disrupt the daily business of that office.  This is not the case if the information is in the public interest or is required for some other good reason.  In general, it is not envisaged that anything other than photocopying fees should be charged.  The Minister for Finance will issue guidelines regarding what is a reasonable hourly charge.</P>
      <P>This section is designed as a fail safe provision in the event that a person might seek a truckload of material or information that would cause major disruption to the work of the public body concerned.  It is not envisaged that fees over and above those for photocopying will apply in the generality of cases.  Fees can also be waived where the information required would be of particular assistance to the understanding of an issue of national importance.  The fees are subject to an appeal to the Information Commissioner who has a general review function in respect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The question of guiding instructions was raised. These instructions are set out in the long title to the Bill, which states that the purpose of the Bill is to promote information to the maximum possible extent consistent with the public interest and the right to personal privacy.  They are the instructions given to heads of Departments and the Information Commissioner in determining how this will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No charges will apply in relation to location of records in respect of personal information except where there is a huge number of records involved.  We came across a situation in Australia where an individual was trying to avoid paying a tax bill so he sent in a huge number of freedom <Col N="114" /> of information requests, hoping the date would pass and that he would enjoy an amnesty.  That is a precautionary tale about the disruptive search for personal records but generally there will be photocopying only for personal records.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-personal information, if someone is making a lot of money out of their requests or if the search requires a public official to put a day aside for it, a charge would be reasonable.  However, the fee section states that one can only be charged, first, as prescribed by the Minister for Finance and, second, if the records are in order, one cannot be charged for the time taken to find inefficiently filed records. Those are the protections in place.</P>
    <P>There was much thought on devising the charging regime and it is not meant to be punitive. The Bill is to free up information, not to make it difficult for people to get it, but there must be safeguards against abuse of access.  In most cases it is reasonable that people be charged for photocopying.  We were guided by what has actually happened.  There was a case of people looking for information on the environment called Earthwatch.  In one case they wanted photocopies of eight volumes of planning material.  It takes a lot of time for a staff member to stand over a photocopier and copy such material.  Arising out of that it might be reasonable to give the information on a computer disk or via the Internet.  These provisions are there to ensure this measure works smoothly.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the points.  We will examine this before bringing the Bill to the Dáil.  The intention is to make this legislation user friendly in the interests of the person making the request but also in the interests of good administration.  Freedom of information must go with the grain of how public bodies do their day-to-day job and giving information must be built into the way public officials work.  If there is tension between doing the day-to-day job and providing information, it will be difficult to practise freedom of information. It is important to devise systems that ensure that the provision of information goes with the grain of how public business is done.  I recognise the concerns of Senators and they are substantially addressed in the provisions as they stand.  One can appeal if charges are unreasonable but if there are further amendments or adjustments to be done, we will consider them in the Dáil, and they will be reported back to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister of State says on building in safeguards.  If people have problems and appeal, they can get trapped in the Byzantine minutiae and it becomes another discouragement.  Since this should be kept as simple and clear as possible, the guidelines will be very important.  Those guidelines will become the criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred facetiously to amendment No. 39 and thanked the Minister of State for it but it could be made explicitly part of the commissioner's <Col N="115" /> review of the financial aspects.  The Minister of State might consider that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to staff time spent photocopying volumes.  Why can the applicant not be given the material, shown the photocopier and told to do it?  It need not then impinge to that extent on valuable staff time.  There are ways of achieving the the Minister of State's objective which we all share.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for a very good debate on Committee and Report Stages.  We have teased out the Bill in great detail and made significant improvements through agreement on all sides.  It shows the value of an Upper Chamber which, in a very reflective and co-operative mood, can attend to legislation.  I am pleased at the non-partisan and constructive debate.  With that kind of support across the House, we can show the public and the public service that there is a strong wish for freedom of information and a strong will in this democracy to open the books.  That opening should be interpreted in the most generous way possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being so generous in accepting so many amendments. We have reached an extraordinary point in the history of the State because secrecy has been the hallmark of public administration since April Fools' Day, 1922, when the Irish Civil Service officially came into operation.  Secrecy has been one of the biggest disservices to public administration in this State because we have a fine public administration that operates to the highest standards.  That administration will gain most from freedom of information.  It will show citizens the quality of thinking, service and work behind the closed doors of our public service bodies. I am grateful to the Minister of State for accepting a number of amendments, particularly in extending freedom of information to certain agencies which fulfil statutory functions.  That will have a tremendous impact, not least on the way those agencies interface with members of the public who come into contact with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State has reduced the time delay in bringing in health boards and local authorities because that is very important. The Bill is rather more complex than such a Bill should be.  Ease of comprehension should be the first thing one finds in a Freedom of Information Bill and, though I have struggled through it, there are still some incomprehensible parts.  Hopefully, <Col N="116" /> when the Bill becomes an Act and freedom of information becomes a reality, we will have a short, concise, well written, user friendly guide that will be available to every citizen.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office should have a budget that will enable it to inform the public of the existence of this Bill and should also have sufficient staff to take the message of freedom of information around the country.  I hope this issue is discussed in every council chamber and health board and that public meetings are held so that the people and those who represent the people are fully aware of the impact of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is good legislation.  If nothing else were done in the past couple of years in this House, the fact we have finally pushed through the Freedom of Information Bill will be a fine monument not just to the Minister but to Seanad Éireann.  Since the time when Deputy Eoin Ryan was a Senator, this House has striven in a non-partisan way to achieve freedom of information, which we have achieved tonight.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through Dáil Éireann and that the debate will be as well informed as it has been here.  I hope it will not be partisan as that would defeat our aim to open up all the secret files to the people and to show them they are not full of horrors, but that what is being done in their name and on their behalf is good.</P>

She said the debate was non-partisan, which is true.  This was partly due to the personalities of the Senators who participated and to the Minister's personality and her willingness to enter into the spirit of constructive co-operative debate.  I also extend that to the officials behind her.  I hope that someday, when freedom of information fully reigns, we will know the identities of the officials because the invisible barrier between politicians and officials seems to have reached a point where it is becoming counterproductive for legislation.  This has been a co-operative endeavour between the Civil Service, the Minister and this House.  I echo Senator Roche's conclusion that the public service will be a major beneficiary from this legislation and that it will enhance its reputation in the eyes of the public.</P>

It is a reasonable attempt to erode the culture of secrecy which has existed for so long.  I hope the legislation will ensure that those who do not want to release information will be compelled to do so, which is the Minister's intention.

The level of secrecy which dominated the Civil Service was reduced in recent years but not eliminated.  As I said on Second Stage, it is not so long ago that the Government Information Service ensured that people knew nothing and that secrecy rather than freedom of information prevailed.  We have moved a little, but not far enough since then.  This Bill is a watershed which will move us into another era and serve the public service well.</P>

When the Bill is passed in both Houses, it will be important to make as much information as possible available to the public because this legislation will only be as good as its use by the public.  It is important that people know their rights under this legislation.  I thank the Minister for taking on board my concerns and those of Senator Gallagher and others in relation to bringing the health boards and the local authorities in more quickly than was originally envisaged.

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Fitzgerald, for taking this Adjournment matter on the urgent need to provide proper facilities at Pallaskenry school in County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to construct four classrooms as well as extra toilets, cloakroom and a store room. A proposal has been with the Department of Education for over 12 months, therefore something <Col N="118" /> must be done as a matter of urgency.  At present, 70 pupils are catered for in two classrooms which are situated in a totally unsuitable prefabricated building.  A remedial teacher also works in this building, which is 19 years old. It was in use as a school for 11 years and was in service for eight years prior to that as another school.  Everyone accepts that prefabricated buildings are totally unsuitable in 1997 and it is unacceptable to allow school children to use such facilities.</P>
    <P>Teachers cannot do their work properly because of the conditions in which they are working. The building is in an extremely bad state of repair.  While some moneys were provided for work last year, it is a holding operation which does not improve the situation.  I visited the school last year and my foot went through the floor.  The external walls of the building are rotting and there is dry rot in the floors of the classrooms.  The Office of Public Works has informed the school management that there is an urgent need for work to be done.  It is of the view that the building is beyond repair.</P>
    <P>The building is cold in winter and warm in summer. In 1995 the classes were obliged to move outdoors because of the extremely hot weather. There is no insulation and no toilet attached to the building.  Children are obliged to cross the main school yard to reach the toilet, which creates enormous difficulties during wet weather. Pupils must cross from the permanent structure to the prefabricated classrooms under similar conditions to receive remedial teaching.  The Minister will agree that this is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Pallaskenry is a growing town.  It is a satellite of Limerick city and the student population has expanded over the years and will continue to expand.  The population has quadrupled in the past 20 years.  There are council housing estates, building developments initiated by Aughinish Alumina and private development.  It is a very attractive area with a great demand for sites. More and more families will move into the area.</P>
    <P>The present situation is totally unsatisfactory. We should pay tribute to the teachers who work under these conditions.  There are demonstrations outside this House from time to time.  I hope we can look at all situations objectively.  A delegation met officials in mid 1996.  We understand the procedure that is necessary but we are asking the Minister to move this school to the first stage of construction.  Then we will be in a position to progress it as quickly as possible.  We have been talking about this for more then 12 months and this is my second time raising it in the Seanad.  We are very anxious that progress is made on the matter. I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity of replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and to outline to the House the current <Col N="119" /> position regarding Pallaskenry National School, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>The school has a current staffing level of a principal and seven assistant teachers, one of whom is a shared remedial teacher, and an enrolment of 194.  The accommodation of the school consists of five permanent classrooms and a three classroom prefabricated structure.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the school wrote to the Department of Education seeking approval for the replacement of the three prefabricated classrooms.  The Department's planning section undertook a full review of enrolment trends at the school and following this review it was considered that the school's medium to long term accommodation requirements were six permanent classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation.  In August 1996 the Department advised the school's board of management that it considered the provision of an additional classroom, a general purpose facility and ancillary accommodation would satisfy the accommodation needs of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school was further advised that it was not possible to indicate when the project would proceed due to the level of contractual commitments. Therefore, the only option immediately available was to carry out repairs to the existing prefabricated <Col N="120" /> accommodation.  A grant of £17,000 was sanctioned to allow the work to be undertaken.  I understand that the repair works are to be undertaken shortly.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the proposed extension was fully explained to the school at a meeting with officials on 5 November 1996.  The position is that funding for the proposed extension at Pallaskenry school must be looked at in the light of existing contractual commitments for 1997, other urgent projects and the funding which will be available this year.  These matters are under consideration and I expect the process to be completed shortly.  The building unit of the Department will be in contact with the school management as soon as these matters have been finalised.</P>
    <P>The Senator can be assured of the Minister for Education's desire to see further improvements in conditions at the school and I thank him again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the position.</P>
