      <P>Tá orm a chur in iúl don Teach go bhfuarthas litir dar dáta 9 Deireadh Fómhair 1997 ó Rúnaí an Rialtais maidir le Comhalta an Rialtais a éirí as a oifig, Comhalta an Rialtais a cheapadh agus sannadh Ranna Stáit.

      <P>I have to inform the House that a letter dated 9 October, 1997 has been received from the Secretary to the Government regarding the resignation of a Member of the Government, the appointment of Members of the Government and the allocation of Government Departments.  The letter will be set out in the usual manner in the Journal of the House and, consequent on this announcement, it will also be printed in the Official Report of Debates.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to sanction immediately the application by Tipperary South Riding County Council for £704,000 for flood relief in the Clonoulty/Rossmore, Cappawhite and Hollyford areas of County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I have also notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the nation to take its full part in the celebration tomorrow of World Food Day.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and item 6, motion 8.  Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are to be taken without debate.  As Members are aware, debate on the Second Stage of the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill commenced before the general <Col N="239" /> election.  I suggest that the time limit for Second Stage should not exceed 15 minutes for spokespersons and ten minutes for other speakers. Members may share time.</P>
      <P>Motion No. 8 dealing with the National Roads Authority will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. I propose ten minutes for spokespersons, seven minutes for other speakers and Members may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business as proposed is agreed.  However, as there will not be many contributions from my party on the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, will the Leader arrange for 15 minutes per speaker?  I believe only two members of my party, the second of whom has strong views on the issue, wish to contribute.</P>
      <P>Last week the Leader outlined the programme of legislation for the coming months and indicated that 90 pieces of legislation would be taken. Will he take a short-term view and inform the House of the specific legislation he proposes to deal with during the next three to four weeks?  It is important that spokespersons be afforded an opportunity to carry out research and prepare properly.</P>
      <P>The disgraceful way in which a large number of refugees were treated on Friday last outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was raised in the Lower House yesterday. I believe Members in this House also feel strongly about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The scenes which occurred outside the Department were reminiscent of Ellis Island at its worst.  This is no way for a civilised country to behave.  Promises have been made that it will not happen again.  We must ensure that such scenes are not repeated and that the people involved are treated in a humane way.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister for Finance come before the House tomorrow during the debate on economic and monetary union to explain Government policy on the future of corporation tax?  Will the tax be reduced to the 10 per cent target promised in the Fianna Fáil manifesto or will it be set at 12.5 per cent as stated earlier in the week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct that item 3, which is being taken without debate, will restore the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill to the Order Paper and the debate on it will continue this afternoon?  As I was in possession on the last occasion on which the Bill was debated, I presume I remain in possession and will be the first speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely seeking parity of esteem.  As I was in possession during the previous <Col N="240" /> debate, I presume that will remain the case. I hope I can depend on my former colleagues on this side of the House who moved to the Government benches following the election.  I trust they will not try any tricks.  I presume there will be no ministerial speech and that Second Stage will resume with my contribution.  I look forward to the Cathaoirleach's confirmation of that fact.</P>

      <P>I hope the Government does not make a U-turn on the Loran C mast at Loop Head.  Before the election my colleagues opposite and I raised the importance of the need to introduce mandatory reporting.  There was a clear commitment by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to introduce mandatory reporting through legislation.  It is disgraceful that this has not happened.  I do not wish to enter a debate on the matter at present, but will the Leader arrange for the relevant Minister to come before this House to explain the matter?  Many of us do not understand how a protocol can be made mandatory. We understood that for something to be mandatory a legislative basis is required.  This is an unacceptable U-turn.  I have no problem with U-turns if they are in the right direction but this one is regressive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on the reopening of the live export trade.  He successfully acquired £1 million to ensure the trade will re-open. It is good news that a ship sailed from Ringaskiddy for France last night with nine lorry loads of cattle on board.  It has resulted in an increase in the price of weanlings which is good news for farmers.  This is in contrast to the previous Minister's achievements.  He could only try to get Michael Keating and Peter Bolger, who were in the news for the wrong reasons recently, to try to organise a sailing to Gambia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Manning in deploring the appalling scenes outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is intolerable that people should be treated in this manner. Several thousand people were left waiting for four hours in the pouring rain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange for a Government spokesman to clarify for the House the Government's attitude to the people from County Louth who are taking legal action against BNFL's reprocessing plant?  The matter requires further clarification. <Col N="241" /> The Government appeared to be trying to get off the hook for a sum of £200,000 as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  However, as a result of a debate in the other House yesterday the situation appears to be more open.  The Minister has declined to meet the people involved.  Because of the interest of the House in the matter it would be useful if it were clarified by a Government spokesperson.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for organising a debate on EMU tomorrow. Hopefully, Members who have an interest in the matter will have the opportunity to contribute.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the major variation that has arisen in house prices in the last 12 months.  Prices increased by 14 per cent in Dublin as against 3 per cent in the north.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government is carrying out research at present in this regard.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on this issue?  As representatives elected by local authority members we are in a position to offer a national perspective on the matter.  Perhaps the Leader would consult with the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Finance and arrange for a debate.  If the present trend continues young married couples in Dublin will not be able to build or buy a house unless they have very high incomes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify for the House that the Leader intended item 4 to be the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Manning and Senator Norris, I was appalled by the scenes I witnessed outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform last Saturday.  I hope they will not be repeated.  Will the Leader indicate the status of the Employment Equality Bill, in which we took a great deal of interest and which was declared partly unconstitutional?  Will it be reintroduced with the section on disability rephrased? It is very important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Kiely in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his achievement which resulted in the provision of a boat which will sail from Cork.  The boat is of the highest quality and will provide transport for 25,000 cattle between now and Christmas.  The quality of the boat is one thing but the benefit to the farming community is another.  Unfortunately there was some criticism of the Minister and the Government here recently, but congratulations are now in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speaker's comments on the export of live cattle.  I missed the debate on the subject last week.  I do not think congratulations to the Minister are in order yet.  I would ask the Leader to inquire when the live export of cattle to Egypt will reopen.  That is our <Col N="242" /> most important market where there is a potential to sell at least 100,000 cattle.</P>
      <P>As regards wildlife legislation, a new wildlife Bill or amendments to the existing Wildlife Act that would give statutory authority to the creation of special areas of conservation, SACs, and also areas of natural importance in terms of wildlife has been promised for a long time and I wish to know when it will be introduced in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the reopening of the live cattle trade to the Continent and the establishment of the ferry service with Purbeck.  I would point out to Senator Connor that there is no need to re-open the Egyptian live cattle trade because in a press release on 6 June, which was read into the record of the House last week, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, announced the trade had been re-opened. Even though Deputy Yates said on that occasion that he had re-opened the trade, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, is making every effort to re-open it.  It is intended to have a trial shipment and the veterinary officials from the Department of Agriculture are going to Egypt to iron out the technical difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, for the information of Members, that mobile phones should not be used in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who said it is intolerable that so many people should have had to queue outside the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Because of the vigorous economic growth we are experiencing, it is expected that we may have immigration into this country in the very near future.  It will be interesting to see how we will deal with that phenomenon given the way we have been welcomed in countries around the world.</P>
      <P>I welcome what has taken place in Northern Ireland and hope that there is rapid progress towards an agreed settlement.  Last week there were suggestions that the matter be debated here. I was pleased to see during the week that Senator Manning made the observation that the meeting with Sinn Féin and Mr. Blair was not in any way similar to the meeting which took place some 70 years ago between Lloyd George and the then leaders of Sinn Féin, which is not the same Sinn Féin we have today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the attention of Members of the House to the fact that a piece of algebra that was rejected by several academic journals in 1973 yesterday won the Nobel Prize. It is a reminder to us of the need to invest in education.  I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Minister for Education and Science into this House in the near future, particularly in view of the fact that many of the jobs created in recent years were as a result of the high standard of our <Col N="243" /> education.  We are now becoming short of manpower with the necessary ability and skills, particularly in high tech areas.  I know the Minister is aware of this and I would welcome an opportunity to have him come into this House in the near future to talk about his objectives in this area.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána on their recent success in the fight against crime.  We can all rest a little easier in our beds as a result of some of the steps that were taken recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to review the disabled person's grant?  We have recently come across terrible cases of hardship where people in private houses are literally reduced to carrying loved ones around the house. There is a need for such a review of people on very low fixed incomes.  The fact that they are in private housing as distinct from public housing should not prevent the best possible care being afforded to the disabled.  It is time for somebody to make a quick decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully agree with the sentiments expressed about what happened in St. Stephen's Green last weekend, it is also imperative for this House to acknowledge that many Irish citizens are still queuing outside immigration centres and social welfare offices abroad.  Will the Leader initiate a debate on emigrant matters, as has been the tradition in this House over the last number of years?  I compliment the former Leader, Senator Manning, who facilitated such a debate in the last Seanad.</P>
      <P>One of the last official acts of the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Deputy Ray Burke, was to visit a number of Irish immigration centres in New York and Boston.  He announced an increase in the financial allocation to these centres, which largely went unreported here like many emigrant issues, I am sad to say.  While I do not wish to be seen as a crusading light on emigrant issues specifically, as a former emigrant I try to spend as much time as I can keeping in contact with Irish emigrants in various countries. Such a debate would be welcomed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the current talks in Northern Ireland? It is now safe for the House to debate the progress that has been made.  It is so important to the southern Border counties that have suffered serious deprivation as a result of over 25 years of violence.  We would like an opportunity to encourage those involved to reach an understanding so that we can live in peace.  Peace on this island is the number one priority.  It has to be said loud and clear from every platform that all of us are anxious to see progress and, ultimately, a settlement of the troubles in the North of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, Dublin Corporation announced plans for the refurbishment of O'Connell Street to make it a thoroughfare worthy of a capital city.  I call on the Leader to request the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to make necessary funds available to carry out this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the fact that great concern is being expressed about the level of grants available to disabled persons?  In order to get the £8,000 grant, disabled persons must find one third of the money available themselves.  That is creating exceptional demands on them because most disabled people are unemployed and are, therefore, not in a position to have the extra downstairs bathroom provided.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, ought at the first opportunity to explain the Government's position on the case taken against Sellafield by the Dundalk residents. It is a matter of great concern to everyone in County Louth that funding should be provided for this legal action.</P>
      <P>We should not treat immigrants any differently from the way we expect our emigrants to be treated on the streets of New York or London.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's request for a time allocation of 15 minutes per speaker.  Last week I announced 21 pieces of proposed legislation, although it might have sounded like 90 it took so long to read it aloud.  I will come into the House at the earliest opportunity over the next sitting day or two and let the Senator know the business intended for the next four or five weeks.</P>
      <P>I totally concur with all those who spoke about the problems experienced by the refugees we saw on television last week.  Nobody in their right mind could condone what happened.  I will also bear in mind the views of Senator Mooney who is vastly experienced in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked that the Minister for Finance come into the House to clarify the Government's long-term proposals on corporation tax and taxation in general.  I understand the Minister was in Brussels and I do not know whether he will be back tomorrow, but I will try to have that point clarified.  Maybe we can take statements on tax matters or have a debate on it at a future date.</P>
      <P>Senators Dardis and McGowan want a debate on Northern Ireland; I do not have any difficulty with that.  I will discuss this with the leaders over the next day or two to see if we can facilitate the Members who want to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn wants a debate on education; I have no objection to that either.  Tomorrow I will be only too pleased to facilitate the Senator with statements on EMU, one of the most important <Col N="245" /> challenges the country will face over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>There was a call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to clarify various points; this does not pose a difficulty.  Senator O'Toole made various points about the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill.  I know you clarified this, a Chathaoirligh, and that the Senator will concur with the Chair's ruling on this matter, as I do.  The Senator always has a great gift for being mischievous toward the Leader on the Order of Business, and I take his comments as such.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris and O'Dowd referred to the debate in the Dáil on the Government's attitude to the residents from County Louth who are taking legal action against BNFL.  For the information of the new Senators, the previous Seanad took a lead in that regard.  We can all be proud of our actions, the way we voted and where our hearts lay in relation to this major problem.  The people of the island of Ireland are concerned about this but in particular it seems to have most affected the people from County Louth and those living along the east coast.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed.  The debate is continuing in the Dáil tonight when the matter will be clarified further.  Politicians in general must take the lead and the Civil Service must recognise and accept that a serious situation exists.  We gave the lead when the matter last came before this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about the employment equality Bill.  I hope it will be before the House in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor asked about the wildlife Bill which is at an advanced stage.  I will come back to the House next week and let the Senator know exactly when it is proposed to take it.</P>
    <P>Senators Ridge and O'Dowd raised various points regarding the disabled.  I will facilitate statements on the disabled at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle wanted the support of the House to the proposal, which will be before Dublin Corporation this week, for the refurbishment of O'Connell Street.  I concur with the Senator's request and will convey the House's views to the Minister. These improvements to the principal street in Ireland are long overdue and I welcome the corporation's findings yesterday.</P>

      <P>Senators will probably be aware that this Bill was passed by Dáil Éireann on 18 February last and was subsequently introduced in Seanad Éireann.  Second Stage was not completed on that occasion, however, and the Bill subsequently lapsed as it did not return to the House before the Seanad General Election in August. Senator O'Toole was in possession at the time, which was 1 p.m. on 27 February &mdash; I understand there has been discussion on this point.  This Bill is important because of the urgent need to provide a statutory basis for the existing radio navigational aids which are currently operated by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  These are essential to ensure the safety of vessels and their passengers and crews at sea.</P>
      <P>The need for this Bill arose from a legal challenge to the Commissioners of Irish Lights' powers to proceed with the erection and operation of a Loran C radio navigation system at Loop Head, County Clare.  These proceedings culminated in a Supreme Court decision to the effect that the powers given to the commissioners under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 could not be interpreted to cover the proposed Loran C radio mast and, by implication, the existing radio-based aids to marine navigation which are currently provided by the commissioners.  Given that all modern navigation systems are based on the transmission and reception of radio waves, it is essential that the lacuna in the commissioners' legal powers in respect of the provision of radio aids is rectified.  This is the primary purpose of this Bill, which also makes further necessary provision in relation to the functions of the commissioners. The overall aim of the legislation is to ensure that the activities of the commissioners, which are essential to safe maritime navigation around our shores, are carried out within a secure legislative framework.</P>
      <P>I understand that when this Bill was first introduced in this House on 27 February there was general support for its objective of remedying the legislative deficiency uncovered by the courts in relation to the current operation by the commissioners of radio aids in general.  There was, however, considerable disquiet that the passing of the legislation as introduced would empower the commissioners to proceed with the Loran C long range navigation project.  Before dealing with the Bill, I would like to outline the manner in which I propose to address this particular issue and the concerns previously voiced in this House.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that Ireland is committed, by way of an international agreement approved by Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992, to the provision of a Loran C radio mast and ancillary facilities in the west of Ireland as an integral part of a north-west European Loran C system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> Norway, the Netherlands, France, Denmark and Germany are our partners in the agreement, the purpose of which is to ensure the availability of an independent land based civilian system as an alternative to the United States military satellite Global Positioning System.  The availability of this complementary land based system was seen to significantly improve the safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment in north-west European waters.</P>
    <P>The proposed site at Loop Head, County Clare, was chosen following a detailed site selection study undertaken by the Commissioners of Irish Lights with the assistance of a firm of consulting engineers, the University of Wales and the head of the North West European Loran C Programme Management Office.  On 4 November 1994 the commissioners obtained planning permission, on appeal to An Bord Pleanála, to erect the Loran C mast at Loop Head.  The planning appeal took the form of a nine day oral hearing held in Ennis and the resultant permission was subject to a number of conditions, some of which were in the interests of public health and safety. The House will be aware the commissioners have been unable to proceed with the project over the last three years due to protracted legal proceedings. In addition to the litigation concerning the commissioners' legal powers, the scope of the powers under which An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the development has been challenged and a Supreme Court appeal has been lodged in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am aware concerns have been expressed that the Loran C system poses a threat to health and represents a damaging environmental intrusion.  I am also aware it may be considered to be already obsolete.  The physical appearance and visual impact of the proposed radio mast has been the subject of particular attention in the media.  I recently took the opportunity to go and see a Loran C mast at first hand.  I visited the nearest mast in the Loran C chain, which is located at Lessay in north-west France and is of the same dimensions as the one proposed for Loop Head. I was anxious to familiarise myself with such an installation prior to addressing public concerns on the issue.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the provision of a Loran C mast in the west of Ireland arises out of a solemn commitment by the Government and endorsed by Dáil Éireann in the context of a formal international agreement.  That being said, I fully recognise that there are concerns about this project, particularly in relation to its siting at Loop Head.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, wish to inform the House that I will carry out a fundamental review of the project. To that end, I intend to engage in a process of wide-ranging and extensive consultation involving interested parties, with a view to ensuring that all the relevant issues and information on this project are brought to my attention and into the open.  I assure the House that this consultative process will allow for all issues to be aired comprehensively, <Col N="249" /> authoritatively and openly.  I am also most keen that I remain personally involved.</P>
    <P>I intend, as part of the wide ranging consultation I envisage, that expert opinion on radio navigation and maritime safety in general be obtained.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights have expertise in this field and I will be seeking their advice concerning current navigational technology. I am also interested in hearing the expert opinion of international authoritative bodies responsible for worldwide navigation, such as the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities and the International Maritime Organisation. The advice of the EU Commission will also be solicited.  These consultations will attempt to elicit the international view on current needs in the maritime safety area, medium to long-term developments and requirements in the area of radio based navigational aids and, especially in that context, the case for a land based complement to support a spacebased system.  The views and concerns of the people of the Kilbaha area in Loop Head, and people in general concerned with such installations, will be given no less a hearing.  The local people are, after all, those most affected by the proposed Loran C development.  To facilitate them in voicing their views, I propose to visit the area and meet with the local people and public representatives.</P>
    <P>I also wish to inform the House that I have directed that no further work on the Loran C project should occur pending the consultations I have outlined.  To put this direction on a firm legislative footing I have decided to table a significant amendment on Committee Stage.  The terms of the proposed amendment require that the powers conferred on the commissioners under section 3 &mdash; to develop and operate radio and navigation systems &mdash; cannot be activated in respect of the Loran C system unless an appropriate order is made by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  Most importantly, the proposed amendment also provides that any draft ministerial order made in this regard must be approved by each House of the Oireachtas.  This will ensure that, in effect, the project will not proceed unless further legislation is adopted by the Dáil and the Seanad.  Thus, Deputies and Senators will have an opportunity to debate and decide on any proposal which the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources might bring forward in the future to empower the commissioners to proceed with the Loran C project.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to facilitate the Bill's passage into law as early as possible in order to legally authorise the Commissioners of Irish Lights to operate and maintain existing radio navigation aids.  It will also provide reassurance to all those wishing to be involved in the consultation process and allow them to contribute fully in the knowledge that the Loran C project cannot progress without the approval of both the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was first introduced in this House certain Senators expressed the intention of <Col N="250" /> tabling an amendment the effect of which would be to remove definitively from the new powers of the commissioners legislative authority to erect a Loran C mast.  The Attorney General's Office has since advised that to purport to exclude the Loran C system from the scope of the powers conferred on the commissioners to develop and operate radio and navigation systems could be interpreted to be at variance with our obligations under the International Agreement on Loran C which Ireland entered into in good faith.  Furthermore, the Department of Foreign Affairs has advised that a legislative amendment along these lines could damage our international standing.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will appreciate that I could not accept a legislative proposal which could be detrimental to our international reputation and have other potentially serious consequences.  That being said, I reiterate that the mechanism I intend to adopt in my proposed amendment will have the effect of ensuring that this House and Dáil Éireann will determine finally how the Loran C project is to be dealt with having regard to international obligations.</P>
    <P>I understand that when the Bill was last before the House Senators raised important questions on Article 18 of the International Agreement, which deals with denunciation.  It would be useful to clarify the position in this regard.  Article 18 provides that after the expiry of ten years from the date of entry into force of the agreement, any party may denounce the agreement within the first six months of the eleventh year.  It further provides that such denunciation shall take effect at the end of the following year.</P>
    <P>While the agreement was signed on 6 August 1992, I am advised that it did not actually enter into force until 2 April 1994, following ratification by the last State party, the Netherlands.  This means it would not be possible for any party to denounce the agreement until April 2004 and this would not have effect until the end of 2005.  Both the Attorney General's Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs have advised that withdrawal from the agreement before that date could only realistically be effected with the consent of our partners in the agreement.  This would obviously be a very serious step which would involve protracted negotiations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the combination of my proposed amendment to the Bill and the consultation process in relation to Loran C will have a twofold effect.  First, it will enable the hiatus in the commissioners' legal framework to be speedily addressed.  This is important to people at sea. Second, it will ensure that no action can or will be taken in relation to the Loran C project pending comprehensive consultations on all the issues involved and that informed decisions can be taken on foot of these consultations by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and, ultimately, by each House of the Oireachtas as to the future of the project.  This approach, which involves any future amendment coming before both Houses of the Oireachtas for debate, will <Col N="251" /> meet the concerns of all interests to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the main provisions in the Bill but before doing so, I wish to outline the statutory background of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and elaborate on their current legal position. The activities of the commissioners have their legal origin in an Act passed by the Irish Parliament in 1786 and their current constitution is effectively the same as provided for in that Act. The Commissioners of Irish Lights started out as a &ldquo;corporation for preserving and improving Dublin Port&rdquo; and did not acquire their present title until 1867 when the Dublin Port Act established them as a separate entity from the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order, 1935, legitimised the functions of the commissioners in the Irish State.</P>
    <P>The source of the current powers of the commissioners is the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act. This Act vests the superintendence and management of all lighthouses, buoys and beacons in Britain and Ireland in three general lighthouse authorities.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights is the general lighthouse authority responsible for providing and maintaining aids to navigation throughout Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands.  The fact that their remit covers the 32 counties of Ireland makes the commissioners a unique body.  Trinity House is the lighthouse authority responsible for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses serve Scotland and the Isle of Man.  The special nature of the commissioners as a statutory body carrying out its essential functions on an all Ireland basis render it particularly important that we work to ensure that it has an appropriate and modern legislative base for its operations.</P>
    <P>The 1894 Act empowers the Commissioners of Irish Lights to erect or place any lighthouse, buoy or beacon and allows them to purchase any land which may be necessary for the exercise of their powers.  It also vests in the commissioners the overall control of local lighthouses, buoys or beacons provided by individual harbour authorities. Under the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, the commissioners also have powers in relation to the marking and removal of wrecks which are a danger to navigation.</P>
    <P>The courts have taken a particular view of the commissioners' powers under the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act.  In October 1995 the High Court held that these powers must be defined by reference to precise equipment, that is, lighthouses, buoys and beacons and not by reference to navigational aids in general terms.  The court ruled that the definitions of &ldquo;lighthouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;beacons&rdquo; in the 1894 Act could not be interpreted to include aids to navigation designed to facilitate the transmission of electro-magnetic waves or pulses as such aids were unknown at that time. The subsequent Supreme Court majority <Col N="252" /> judgment delivered in July 1996 held that the proposed Loran C mast is not a beacon within the meaning of the 1894 Act by virtue of two factors: first, because of its extremely long range, and, second, because it provides aid to navigation based on the transmission and reception of radio signals rather than by visual or aural means.</P>
    <P>The decision by the courts to effectively restrict the scope of the legislative power in relation to beacons to what was comprehended in 1894 casts serious doubts on the <i>vires</i> of even the most basic radio navigation aids operated by the commissioners. The Attorney General's Office, therefore, advised that there was a need for this Bill to modernise the commissioners' powers to ensure that they can continue to provide valuable radio aids in the interest of maritime safety.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that the commissioners have voiced considerable and justified concern about the position in which they have found themselves.  They have indicated that their legal advice suggests that each commissioner is potentially liable for any claims or expenses arising out of the current operation of radio aids to navigation. This advice placed the commissioners in a serious predicament, so much so that their chairman indicated that they had no option but to terminate the provision of such aids unless the required legislation was passed.  The commissioners subsequently agreed, however, not to proceed with this course of action on the understanding that the necessary legislation would be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is important not to underestimate the role of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  They are charged under the law with responsibility to take specific measures aimed at accident prevention, pollution avoidance and, most significantly, the safety of life at sea.  The commissioners have statutory responsibility for protecting the safety of mariners in the often hazardous waters around our extensive coastline.  Ireland's geographic position at the hub of transatlantic shipping means that aids to navigation provided by the commissioners are not only used by vessels plying to and from Irish ports but also a significant volume of passing traffic.</P>
    <P>The nature and quality of aids to navigation are improving in line with rapid advances in technology &mdash; hence the need for the legislative changes before the House today.  The traditional visual aids, such as lighthouses and buoys, which remain an important part of the marine safety infrastructure, are being modernised.  All lighthouses are now automated and all buoys have been converted to solar power.  In the modern world of shipping, in which vessels travel faster, traffic is denser and the risk of accidents and pollution is consequently greater, there is a need for enhanced position-fixing accuracy for all types of vessels.  Modern radio navigation systems fulfil this requirement.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights have always endeavoured to keep abreast of navigational technology and have provided radio based aids to <Col N="253" /> navigation from as far back as 1931.  At present they operate such aids at locations around the coast of Ireland.  These modern electronic aids enable vessels to determine their position by interpreting radio signals from shore based transmitters. The four types of radio navigation systems provided by the commissioners are radio beacons, radar beacons, which are known as racons, radar target enhancers and the Differential Global Positioning System known as DGPS. However, as I have already explained, the courts have effectively ruled that these systems are <i>ultra vires</i> the powers given to the commissioners under the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act.  The UK amended that Act in 1979 to provide a legislative basis for the inclusion of radio aids to navigation in the powers of general lighthouse authorities in their jurisdiction.  As I mentioned earlier, I am sure Senators will agree it is incumbent upon us to ensure that a North-South, all-Ireland body such as the Commissioners of Irish Lights, is as equipped with an appropriate legislative framework to carry out its vital role in the Republic of Ireland as it is in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Before outlining the main provisions in the Bill I would like to deal with a technical point in relation to one of the definitions in the legislation. The Minister referred to in the Bill is defined therein as the Minister for the Marine rather than the current title of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  This is due to the fact that the title of the Minister has been changed by Government order since the Bill was published following its passage through the Dáil. The parliamentary draftsman has advised that it is, therefore, necessary to table a minor technical amendment in this regard and I propose to do so on Committee Stage.  I mention this matter mainly by way of clarification because, in dealing now with the main provisions in the Bill, I propose, in order to avoid any confusion, to refer to the current title of Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources rather than the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, the Bill addresses the legal deficiencies highlighted by the courts by conferring on the commissioners, in relation to maritime navigation, powers to erect, operate and maintain radio navigation systems.  It also enables them to purchase land necessary to exercise these powers. The commissioners provided radio navigation systems in the past in the interests of maritime safety and the Bill seeks to validate such provision. Due provision has also been made to ensure that the constitutional rights of any person are not affected by the powers conferred on the commissioners in relation to radio aids to navigation.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act vested the superintendence and management of all lighthouses, buoys and beacons, including those provided by harbour authorities, in the commissioners.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to extend this power to embrace the superintendence and management of all maritime radio <Col N="254" /> navigation systems, thus putting the commissioners' powers in relation to these aids on a secure footing throughout the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, co-operate with other agencies, including a competent authority of another jurisdiction or an international organisation, in relation to the provision or operation of radio navigation systems and any services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution or related matters.</P>
    <P>International co-operation is of great importance in the provision of aids to navigation and in relation to maritime navigation generally.  This provision ensures that there is a legal basis for such co-operation on the part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The commissioners are represented on the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, and this organisation promotes co-operation between lighthouse authorities and the co-ordination of worldwide standards on aids to navigation matters.  At a more local level, the commissioners, as one of the three general authorities for Britain and Ireland, co-operate closely with Trinity House and the commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, which between them serve England, Scotland and Wales.  This provision also permits the commissioners to co-operate with other bodies in relation to the provision of services relating to wreck, pollution or related matters.  The need for such co-operation arises particularly in emergencies and, where necessary, the commissioners light tender ship can provide assistance to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources or other competent authorities.  In the past, the Irish Lights vessel has aided the Department in search and rescue work.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill empowers the commissioners to make financial contributions towards the funding of international organisations or bodies concerned with maritime navigational assistance.  The exercise of this power requires the consent of both the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and the Minister for Finance.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights currently make financial contributions to the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities in respect of their membership of that body and the Bill seeks to place these payments on a solid legislative footing.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision which allows the commissioners, for gain or otherwise, to enter into agreements and contracts with the permission of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, for the provision of maritime navigation systems and the performance of services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution and related matters on behalf of harbour authorities and other third parties. The requirement for this provision stems from legal advice received by the former UK Department of Transport to the effect that the maintenance of a third party's buoys is <i>ultra vires</i><Col N="255" /> the powers of Trinity House, the general lighthouse authority throughout England and Wales. This advice also applies to the Commissioners of Irish Lights with regard to the provision of such services to third parties such as harbour authorities. A number of lights and buoys within harbour limits are currently maintained by the commissioners. The Bill validates services provided by the commissioners to harbour authorities to date and extends the scope for the commissioners in relation to contracting services to third parties. The UK has already taken legislative action in this regard.  The Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Act, which was introduced earlier this year, contains a similar provision which permits general lighthouse authorities in the UK to enter into contracts with third parties.</P>
    <P>On the same general theme, it is considered prudent to cater for future developments in technology and practices.  Accordingly, the Bill also incorporates a provision enabling the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to confer on the commissioners appropriate additional functions in relation to maritime navigational matters. Any order made in this regard must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and can be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>On the basis that this legislation is vital to enable the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide modern navigational aids for the safety of mariners, and having regard to the firm commitments which I have given on the Loran C project I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The last time it appeared was February and my opposition to the content of the Bill at that time is clearly on the record.  I continue to take the same position on a particular section of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be appreciated that the Bill before the House has emerged because the people of west Clare took a High Court case which succeeded. That case was appealed by the Commissioners for Irish Lights to the Supreme Court which still found in favour of the people of west Clare.  I also understand a bill of costs was awarded to the people of west Clare which was sent to the Commissioners of Irish Lights and then sent to the Department of the Marine, but somehow that Department has not addressed that issue yet. Would it not at least have been decent to deal <Col N="256" /> with outstanding financial obligations and legal commitments before proceeding to reintroduce this Bill in Seanad Éireann?  One must question why this Bill was brought back here without first dealing with these outstanding issues.  Maybe the Minister will address that issue before the conclusion of the debate.</P>
    <P>The people of west Clare have been very concerned about the proposal to build the Loran C mast.  We must realise this system did not start today or yesterday.  Discussions go back prior to the early 1990s and an international agreement was concluded by the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government in 1992.  That agreement was signed by an official from the Department on behalf of Ireland along with other member states who signed the agreement.  I will not go into the details of the agreement, as I outlined them when this issue was debated previously. I am delighted the Minister has clarified one issue I raised at that time in relation to the denunciation article in the agreement, article 18. He has clarified here today that we would have to wait until 2004 to denounce, which is unacceptable.  It is not a satisfactory conclusion and cannot be used successfully to allay the fears of the people of west Clare.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources that it is not just the people of the Loop Head and the Kilbaha areas who are concerned but those people from Loop Head to Milltown Malbay to Kildysert.  There is serious concern in that entire area about this proposal. I am not sure the Minister realises this is a natural heritage area.  It would be sacrilegious for any organisation, Commissioners of Irish Lights as agent for the Minister, or anybody else, to propose to erect such a monstrosity in a natural heritage area.  It is unacceptable to erect a steel mast the height of the Eiffel Tower in a very beautiful peninsula, unique in bird life, in its environment, history and tradition, particularly its marine life and topography.  There are many beautiful features, such as arches and bridges, which are a tourist attraction in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister coming here with this Bill is unusual, particularly as he is coming from a party which in February in Dáil Éireann vehemently opposed this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil spokesperson at the time, now Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, is on the record as saying on 18 February 1997:</P>
    <P>This Bill is draconian, it is a panic measure which does not conform to the planning laws and it loses sight of many advances which have taken place, and will take place, in marine navigation.</P>
    <P>Here is a member of the present Government who said this just six months ago.  He with other Government colleagues voted against it &mdash; Deputies Dermot Ahern, de Valera, Harney, Killeen, Martin, Molloy, O'Donnell, Ó Cuív, O'Donoghue, O'Malley and Walsh.  I am sure the Chair appreciates my amazement at seeing this Bill on <Col N="257" /> the Order of Business for this week.  We have had a number of U-turns.  Is this a U-turn on a U-turn? Are we going full circle?  Will we have another U-turn?  The combinations and permutations become increasingly interesting as time goes on.  I appreciate that the Minister will give serious consideration to this matter.  He attempted, after a fashion, to address certain concerns during his contribution.</P>
    <P>Following the debate on this Bill in the Seanad six months ago, I entered into intense discussions with the then Minister, Deputy Barrett, and other members of the previous Government.  I informed them that the proposals in the Bill were unacceptable.  The proposals outlined earlier by the current Minister were put to me in the past and they are not sufficient to allay people's concerns. He indicated his intention to table an amendment to section 3.  My party also intends to table amendments to that section, which we will promote in a forceful manner, on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The terms of the proposed amendment require that the powers conferred on the commissioners under section 3 &mdash; to develop and operate radio and navigation systems &mdash; cannot be activated in respect of the Loran C system unless an appropriate order is made by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  Most importantly, the proposed amendment also provides that any draft ministerial order made in this regard must be approved by each House of the Oireachtas. This will ensure that, in effect, the project will not proceed unless further legislation is adopted by the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I first heard this suggestion six months ago during discussions with the Minister's predecessor.  Being somewhat cynical, and having seen the system in operation, I explained at the time that I found it unacceptable.  Under the scenario in question an order can come before either House of the Oireachtas and be passed on the Order of Business before people know what is happening.  If a Member of this House or the Lower House who is concerned about this facet of the Loran C system was not in attendance to object to the passage of such an order, the Commissioners for Irish Lights might become empowered to erect a Loran C mast on Loop Head.  The Minister must give consideration to introducing an amendment other than the one he intends to table.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Attorney General's Office gave the advice to which the Minister referred. However, that office should be asked to explore the possibility of drafting other amendments which would not cause difficulties for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources on the international stage but which would prohibit the Commissioners for Irish Lights from being empowered to erect the Loran C mast.  There are ways and methods to address this matter which would not cause Ireland to become the subject of <Col N="258" /> international concern or scorn.  If the Minister is prepared to accept a number of the amendments we propose to table, I believe he will not be caused any legal or international difficulties.</P>
    <P>One message which must be clearly delivered to the Minister is that a Loran C mast will never be erected on Loop Head.  While he has agreed to meet people and public representatives from the area, it would have been more courteous to meet them prior to the Bill's reintroduction.  The Minister should have engaged in discussions with the people involved and heard their concerns firsthand.  He need only read remarks made by his party colleagues in the Dáil last February and those of a former Member of this House, Deputy Daly, to become aware of those concerns.  The Minister's contribution did not take account of the concerns expressed by the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that we must be concerned about our international standing.  It is important for him, and may be in his political interest, to be concerned about his Government's national standing because we could have a decade of the Rosary on the number of U-turns made by the current Administration.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for addressing the issue of Article 18 because he answered the questions I raised six months ago in this regard.  During the previous debate on this Bill, the Minister's predecessor agreed to establish a forum to address a number of issues of concern.  He also gave a commitment that the Loran C system would not proceed. He stated that if it was to proceed it would be subject to a new planning process and fresh investigation.  When consideration was given to erecting the Loran C mast a number of years ago, 40 sites were examined and it was decided that Loop Head was most suitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to the various radio navigation systems such as GPS, DECCA and Loran C. It is widely accepted that the Loran C system is obsolete.  The Americans propose to discontinue its use in the year 2000 and the British have already done so.  I suggest that the Minister raise this matter with his European colleagues at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.  He should ask them to address the question of using the GPS system throughout Europe and banning the Loran C system because it serves no useful purpose.  The facilities offered by Loran C can be provided by the GPS and DECCA support systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department must address this matter.  I am disappointed that he has reintroduced this Bill, which should have been left on the shelf to gather dust for eternity.</P>

      <P>Ós rud é gurb é seo an chéad uair dom abhairt sa Seanad agus go dtagaim as an Ghaeltacht, ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i mo theanga dhúchais.  Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a déanamh leat as ucht tú bheith tofa mar Leas-Chathaoirleach agus leis an Chathaoirleach as a toghadh.  Tá a fhios agam go dtabharfaídh sibh cothrom na Féinne do gach <Col N="259" /> duine sa Seanad mar a thug tú nuair a bhí tú mar Chathaoirleach sa Seanad atá imithe.  Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire ar an chéad uair dó sa Seanad mar Aire Mara agus Acmhainí Nádúrtha.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis ag a chuid oibre agus go mbeidh sé ann le fada.</P>
      <P>As this is my maiden speech, I take the opportunity to congratulate Senators Mullooly and Cosgrave on their election as Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I know they will afford all Members equal standing and fair play as their predecessors did during the lifetime of the previous Seanad.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Woods on his appointment as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  I apologise that I was not able to meet him on his recent visit to my county but he is aware that he is held in high regard by members of the fishing industry in County Donegal.  I understand that he is the longest serving Fianna Fáil Minister in the Government.  I congratulate him and wish him long service.  I take this opportunity to wish him well in the negotiations in which he will be obliged to engage in the near future.  With the renegotiation of the common fisheries policy in 2002 the Minister will face a difficult task but we, in the fishing industry in Donegal, would like him to prepare well to ensure we get a fair deal.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell on the Loran C issue. I do not know whether it was foresight on my part, but in his fairmindedness, the Minister will propose an amendment in that regard on Committee Stage.  I will concentrate on the safety aspects of the services provided by the Commissioners for Irish Lights.  I am confused by Senator Quinn's reference to U-turns.  Having read the previous debates on this matter, I noticed that Deputy Michael Smith proposed an amendment in the Dáil in February which was not accepted by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854 and the Dublin Port Act, 1867, established the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The Acts vested in the commissioners the superintendence and management of the lighthouses, buoys and beacons in the maritime area of Ireland.  The commissioners are unique in that their remit covers the entire island. In this historic week in which talks on the future of the island are taking place in the North, it is worth recalling that as far back as the last century it was possible to agree to and set up a body which could act for all of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this Bill arises due to a High Court decision, upheld subsequently by the Supreme Court in July 1996.  The effect of the court's decision was that the commissioners' powers under the 1894 Act could not be interpreted to include the provision of radio based aids to marine navigation, which were unknown at the time of the enactment of the legislation.  This is not the first time that old laws have been deemed to have been overtaken by events and new technology. <Col N="260" /> The purpose of the Bill is to empower the commissioners to continue to provide such modern technological aids in the interests of maritime safety and to make further provisions in relation to their functions.  The Bill will enable the commissioners to continue to provide services to the maritime community and to adjust to new technical developments which may arise in the future.  I am sure the Minister's amendment will ensure this is the case.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the onerous task with which the commissioners have been charged. They are responsible for aiding the safe passage of all mariners and seafarers in and around the coastline of Ireland.  In the last debate in the House on this issue the coastline was referred to as &ldquo;inhospitable&rdquo; and Senator O'Toole took objection to that on the basis that he had not found any hostility in Irish waters.  Senator O'Toole must not be a fisherman because if he were he would know how hostile those waters can be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole is a most accomplished fisherman, particularly of compliments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the inshore sea traffic using Irish ports, aids to navigation provided in Irish waters are used by most of the vessels using the world shipping lanes between North America and Europe.  We appreciate the professionalism of the job done by the commissioners and we must enact this Bill as quickly as possible to remove any threat that they could be held liable in the event of an accident at sea if the radio based aids continue to be used without supporting legislation.  The commissioners continued to provide this service for the eight months after the Bill was first introduced in the Dáil in February.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide them with the power to provide navigational assistance which is essential for the maintenance of maritime safety, reducing the risk of accidents and collisions at sea which often result in pollution and loss of life, the safe passage of traffic at sea and the maintenance of a high level of maritime safety.</P>
      <P>I admire the professionalism and expertise of the commissioners in carrying out their functions. Given Ireland's heavy dependence on maritime transport, maritime traffic has become more dense because of the increase in economic activity.  More than 75 per cent of our exports and imports rely on our sea routes and the commissioners are responsible for the protection of this vital lifeline with the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternative technological systems which command the support of the fishing industry, the community and the public must be put in place to take account of the fact that all lighthouses are unmanned.  The traditional visual aids of lighthouse beacons and buoys which have been modernised in line with technological advances still play an important part in maritime safety by identifying hidden and underwater dangers.  In the <Col N="261" /> future they will become more of a hazard warning and will be replaced by radio navigational systems which will enhance the position fixing accuracy required by modern shipping.</P>
    <P>When enacted the Bill will update the powers given to the commissioners under the 1854 Act and allow them to continue to provide modern technological aids to navigation to enable ships, fishing trawlers and other craft to sail safely.  The commissioners have a distinguished record in the provision of these services.  We must pass this legislation as speedily as possible so that the safety of all seafarers is ensured.</P>
    <P>As a representative of the people of south-west Donegal I know and understand the risks they take in pursuing their livelihoods.  Fishing is a dangerous occupation and the community I represent has suffered greatly from fishing tragedies. In the past 25 years four trawlers have foundered off our coast.  I knew the crews of three of the trawlers, the <i>Evelyn Marie,</i> the <i>Carraig Una</i> and the <i>Skiford,</i> who came from my local port of Burtonport. The most recent tragedy was in 1995 with the loss of the <i>Carrickatine,</i> which was also owned by a Burtonport fisherman.  It remains the most unexplained of these tragedies, regardless of the modern navigational aids which are available. I support measures which enhance the safety of fishermen and which command the support of the fishermen's organisations.  I encourage Senators to support the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having referred to the four trawlers which foundered I wish to stress the importance of the fishing industry to south-west Donegal.  It is the biggest job creator in west Donegal providing approximately 3,000 jobs during the season, of which 1,200 are full-time.  We also have between 250 and 300 full-time fishermen on our trawlers. The exports from Killybegs and Burtonport alone amounted to about £100 million in the year to 31 March 1997.  Many other jobs are created in related service and other industries.  I have been fortunate to benefit from fishing as an accountant working in the industry.</P>
    <P>The industry is mainly carried out from the three towns of Killybegs, Burtonport and Kincaslough. While exports and profits are important, the safety of the fishermen who sail night after night in the worst of weather is uppermost in my mind.  That is why I would like to see this Bill passed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>On behalf of these fishermen, I thank the Minister for his efforts during his term as Minister for Social Welfare to regularise the PRSI system and I thank the Commissioners of Irish Lights for their efforts in ensuring the fishermen's safety.  I also thank the RNLI for the service they provide to seafaring people, especially those members based at the local station in Aranmore Island. However, I regret that the RNLI had to shelve plans to base a new lifeboat at its purpose-built facility on Aranmore Island due to the approach channel to Burtonport harbour being unable to facilitate this boat.  The problem was not due to <Col N="262" /> the Commissioners of Irish Lights or any navigational aids but to insufficient draught in the channel.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will visit Burtonport in the near future to examine and discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to mention the Loran C problem, but I appreciate the difficulties with which the people of County Clare are faced.  Nobody understands this problem better than I. I stood as a Fianna Fáil candidate in Donegal South-West in the general election.  I lost what was supposed to be the safest seat in Ireland.  This was due to bad legislation introduced by a previous Minister on the granting of MMDS licences.  I do not need to be lectured on the problem in County Clare.  I commend all Senators and Deputies from County Clare who supported their constituents on this issue.  The Minister is now prepared to listen and amend the legislation on Committee Stage.  Like Clare, Donegal is a beautiful county.  It was only last week that the people of Donegal stood up against ESAT to ensure that a vice was not erected on a local Garda station and that another installation by ESAT was removed.  This was due to the power of the people, and that is why the people of Clare have succeeded.  I hope that an acceptable solution to the problem will be found before Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Nobody objects to the basic purpose of the Bill which is to update the legislation governing marine navigation and to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to modernise their operation.  As far as I understand, the only problem that arose in both the Dáil and Seanad was the question of the Loran C mast at Loop Head.  The Commissioners have served the country extremely well over the years.  Many fishermen owe their lives to the service provided by the Commissioners.  Why should this be put at risk?  I ask Senators to support the Bill and ensure the legislation is quickly enacted.</P>
    <P>The legislation is intended to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide the navigational assistance they currently provide to mariners around the coast.  This legislation is necessary because the legislation of the last century, under which the Commissioners of Irish Lights have been operating, did not anticipate the present changes in navigational technology.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is enacted as speedily as possible. The safety of everybody at sea is my priority and I encourage Senators to support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>You took the words out of my mouth, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  It was a very fine speech by the Senator.  It was clearly delivered and well thought-out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share some of Senator Bonner's concerns.  It is not just in Dingle or Donegal that there is a substantial fishing interest.  This is also true of Howth and we have the problem of marine traffic <Col N="263" /> in Dublin Bay.  Everybody accepts and understands the necessity for proper policing of greatly increased traffic in Dublin Bay.  After the tragedy of the sinking of the <i>Kilkenny</i> in 1991, the Dublin port authorities carried out an extensive investigation with the object of improving safety in Dublin Bay.  Traffic has more than doubled in the past four years.  This is an extraordinarily rapid development and two principal conclusions were reached.  First of all, it was hoped to introduce a vessel traffic system using radar assistance under which there would be a traffic separation system around the bay.  I corresponded with the Dublin port authorities suggesting that without the passage of this or a similar Bill, this would not be possible.  Certain elements of this Bill are very welcome.</P>
    <P>There was concern previously about the attitude of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  They seemed to be playing a very strong hand and using the big stick.  It was suggested and confirmed in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 March 1997 that a letter had been exchanged between the commissioners and the Minister indicating that if the Bill was not passed they would switch off navigational aids.  This seemed to be a most extraordinary threat.  It was put in a slightly different context subsequently by the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  In the context of the last discussion on this matter, it is worth remembering that, at that point, the Seanad was in the fortunate position of being, to some extent at least, under the sway of the five Independent Members, because we held the balance of power.  I think I am correct in saying that we had the assistance of Fianna Fáil Senators on this.  I remember in particular the speeches of Senators Brendan Daly and Tom Fitzgerald on this issue.  Independent Members had a crucial impact on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The erection of a mast of this kind is a very disturbing.  I was interested that the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I visited the nearest mast in the Loran C chain which is located in Lessay in north west France and is the same dimensions as the one proposed for Loop Head.  I was anxious to familiarise myself with such an installation prior to addressing public concerns on the issue.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not treat us to a description of this remarkable feature of the landscape?  Why did he not give us any reaction whatever?  Was it a thing of beauty, was it something that added to the landscape or did it disturb visually?  I am surprised that the Minister stopped there.  He went to the trouble of visiting it so that he could discuss it in public and then says nothing about it.  That worries me.  It must be a considerable distortion in terms of visual amenity.  There is also the question of the concerns raised by the already existing environmental impact study commissioned by the Commissioners of Irish Lights which stated that there was a risk of radiation burns from unearthed buildings and fences in the vicinity of the mast.  That causes considerable <Col N="264" /> concern.  I would like to see further indications of this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>I want to put something else on the record which I consider to be particularly important and that is the coyness with which we are all skating round the potential military implications of this material.  The French are not notably generous to this country so why are they helping to pay for this mast?  Is it because it fits in well with their military submarine communications network?  I am not sure we want to be involved in this with our European partners.  If one looks at the qualities of leadership in some of our European neighbours &mdash; this is supposed to be a European project &mdash; I recall a dispute I had with Alain Juppé when he was Foreign Minister about East Timor and the supply of French armaments to the Indonesians for the purpose of genocide.  His response was that the European Union was not a human rights association.</P>
    <P>Another European colleague, Mr. Alan Clarke, distinguished himself in recent years with his vicious attitudes on the questions of East Timor and genocide while simultaneously holding a senior position in the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which must have struck some people as a little ironic.  A few days ago he said the Northern Ireland problem could be solved by murdering 600 people.</P>
    <P>Any military implication should be right out in the open and I am not clear that is the case.  Later, I will point out the parts of the Minister's speech where I think this possibility is left completely open.  While I welcome everything to do with the safety of fishermen and merchant shipping in Dublin bay and other coastal waters, I strongly suspect the involvement of military interests in the Loran C project.  I also think there are considerable environmental problems with it.  I am surprised at the Minister's coyness in not sharing with the House his view of this particular kind of radio mast.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister indicates he will deal with the Loran C system by &ldquo;an appropriate order&rdquo; after an investigation.  That is welcome movement but I am not sure it is sufficient.  I will wait to hear what amendments emerge from this side of the House and will listen with interest to the rest of the discussion but I am not sure it is sufficient, particularly in the light of concerns expressed that this kind of instrument can so easily be slipped in without anybody realising it.</P>
    <P>I requested a previous Government to alert me to some European directives concerning copyright, particularly in relation to the works of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf.  I was given an undertaking that I would be told about them, but the Minister blithely signed them into existence without realising what had happened and the House was never informed about it.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister says</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's Office has since advised that to purport to exclude the Loran C system from the scope of the powers conferred on the commissioners to develop and operate <Col N="265" /> radio navigation systems could be interpreted to be at variance with our obligations under the International Agreement on Loran C, which Ireland entered into in good faith.  Furthermore, the Department of Foreign Affairs has advised that a legislative amendment along these lines could damage our international standing.</P>
    <P>That may well be true, but what are the implications of this for the investigation the Minister has promised?  If the investigation does not support Loran C, according to the advice received from the Attorney General, we might be in some kind of legal bind, and according to the advice received from the Department of Foreign Affairs, it might damage our international standing.  Does that mean that we are not to take seriously the consultative examination the Minister has promised? I would like the Minister to be clear on that because there seems to be some kind of conflict.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to comment on their lordships' and ladyships' wisdom in the Supreme Court, but I am rather surprised a majority found that a beacon could not be the kind of material concerned in the Loran C mast.  For many years the phrase &ldquo;radio beacon&rdquo; has been widely current in common English usage.  Perhaps the judges were unaware of this, but it goes back a long way.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister will table a small amendment.  Under his new title of Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources it behoves him to make sure the environment is not damaged in any way by the erection of this kind of mast.</P>
    <P>I return to my concern about the military application of this mast.  The Minister clearly seems to be laying this possibility open when he says:</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, co-operate with other agencies, including a competent authority of another jurisdiction or an international organisation, in relation to the provision or operation of radio navigation systems and any services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution or related matters.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that the apparently vague phrase &ldquo;other agencies, including a competent authority of another jurisdiction or an international organisation&rdquo; covers a series of military alliances, either with other European countries &mdash; a number of which I am deeply suspicious of because of the past actions and characters of some of their senior Ministers &mdash; or with NATO. I am not happy that we should be involved in this kind of area.</P>
    <P>I welcome those sections of the Bill which genuinely provide for the safety of fishermen and those involved in the merchant navy, as well as for the better regulation of marine traffic in our coastal waters.  I am still strongly suspicious, however, of the whole Loran C mast situation for the following reasons: its impact on the visual <Col N="266" /> amenity of a beautiful part of our country, the possible dangers from different kinds of radiation emitted, which are admitted by the Commissioners for Irish Lights, and most particularly because I see this as a way of sneaking us into a degree of co-operation with military alliances for which the Irish people have absolutely no relish.</P>
    <P>The military aspect is the most worrying of all, particularly because of the secrecy involved in the way it was approached originally.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights secretly tried to obtain land without disclosing the purpose and tried to get planning permission in a sly and roundabout way.  If there was nothing to which they felt people might object, why were they so extraordinarily discreet in pursuing their objectives?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leat féin agus arís comhghairdeas a ghabháil le hAire na Mara agus Acmhainní Nádúrtha, agus céad míle fáilte a chur roimh an Aire chuig an Teach.</P>
      <P>It is hard to know where to start in relation to this matter because, even though I did not speak on the Bill the last time, I was involved throughout its passage and I undertook much research on it.  Senator Taylor-Quinn said, rightly, that she opposed the Bill at that time.  Senator Norris said the Bill would not have passed at that time simply because the combined Opposition would have defeated the Government side.  If it had not been for that threat, the then Minister would have proceeded and the Bill would have been passed. There is a big difference in the Bill coming before the House on this occasion because the Government side has a huge majority.  They could, if they wished, refuse to listen to anyone and force the Bill through.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion there was a threat to the former Minister because the feeling in the House was that the Bill would undoubtedly be defeated. While very few Members were opposed to the entire Bill, they were opposed to one aspect of it &mdash; the Loran C mast in County Clare.  Naturally I am also opposed to that mast because if it was not erected in Clare I would be afraid the Department or the commissioners might put it in Kerry and the problem would then be outside my own door.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not made a U-turn, but he has made definite changes to the Bill and has put them in writing for the House.  We all heard the Minister say that the views and concerns of the people of the Kilbaha area on Loop Head, and of those generally concerned, would be given the same hearing as everyone else.  He said that there is no way that a Loran C or any other mast can be erected in any part of Ireland unless an appropriate order is made by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and this order must have the prior approval of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that our trouble started in 1992. It amazes me, if Senator Taylor-Quinn is correct, that some civil servant signed an agreement with four or five states without first consulting everybody <Col N="267" /> concerned.  That day is gone.  One must first consult with the people.  It is no good signing an agreement just because other countries are doing so.  We must ensure in future that agreements are examined at home first and that there is full consultation and co-operation.  We must ensure it is done in a proper manner and that proper planning permission is received.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who are trying to put in place a proper navigation system.  When Irish fishermen first set off about ten years ago to fish 200 miles from the coast at the continental shelf, it was a new venture. They had not gone on fishing trips of up to 14 days before.  I recall having a pint with a couple of old fishermen one night in Dingle, County Kerry.  One said that he had been out there 30 years ago.  The other said: &ldquo;You were, but you did not know it&rdquo;, which was correct because he had no way of navigating at that time other than through the use of a compass.  However, with modern navigational aids a person can be guided across mountains or seas and be told exactly where he or she is with the use of a screen and the navigational satellite.</P>
    <P>I am worried about an aspect of this matter to which Senator Norris referred.  It is obvious from reading the newspapers that there are military implications.  Why do we want a second navigation system?  We want one &mdash; I am all in favour of it &mdash; as a proper back up in the event of things going wrong.  We are told that during the Gulf War the United States was able to deliberately disorientate the enemy by changing the navigational satellite slightly.  The system can be interfered with and that it a problem.  It can be accurate but it is in the control of a powerful State &mdash; the United States Air Force, as far as I know &mdash; and it can be altered in times of war.  We do not want to be drawn into wars.</P>
    <P>The Loran C system has proved to be a successful navigation system and it is a good back up system.  The only problem is that, as far as I know, is not compatible with DECCA.  If fishermen changed to the Loran C system, the installation of the necessary equipment would impose a huge cost on them.</P>
    <P>I do not know which navigation system is appropriate but we need a back up system and a second system to check that both systems in use are giving the same readings.</P>
    <P>My knowledge in this area is limited.  To give Senators an idea of what I am talking about, from the time a fishing boat leaves the pier a tape inside the Sat Nav records where it is going. When it has gone 50 or 60 miles, the crew start fishing.  If the fishing is good, the captain will be delighted and will want to return to the identical spot the next day.  If that is the case, all he need do is insert the tape in the Sat Nav the following day and the boat will automatically steer the same course to the same spot.</P>
    <P>We are talking about this Bill in something of a flippant way but it is of vital importance.  It is <Col N="268" /> unfortunate that the Commissioners of Irish Lights find themselves in a situation like this where all the navigation aids are basically illegal. Many of the navigation aids are within harbours which are under the control of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  If there were a dreadful accident tomorrow morning and the owners of a big ship or fishing boat sued the Commissioners of Irish Lights on a personal level, the commissioners would find themselves in deep water.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to pass the Bill and accept the Minister's word.  It is the same Bill as that introduced earlier this year, but the attitude of the Minister towards the Bill is totally different to that which pertained when the Bill was before the House some months ago.  Senator Taylor-Quinn is correct.  I was to speak next on the Bill on that occasion.  I was going to oppose a section of the Bill with regard to Loran C and go along with the rest of it, in the same way as Senator Taylor-Quinn is now talking about tabling an amendment, which we must wait and see.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on this in his reply.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, if the Bill as amended is passed, the people of County Clare need have no worries because I know the Minister of old.  He is a Minister who nearly goes to too much trouble at times.  I could see him talking to the people of west County Clare, consulting and doing everything in his power to make sure that this mast is not erected against their will.</P>
    <P>The threat of defeat stopped the passage of the Bill on the last occasion.  On this occasion the Government has a big majority and it could steamroll the Bill through the House.  The Government is not doing that because the Minister has stated clearly that there will be consultation.  That seems to be the biggest problem.  Although he has been clear about that, I urge him to elaborate on that matter in his reply.  I have received a number of letters from people concerned about this Bill and the problem that has arisen.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned beacons and lights used by harbour authorities.  When the new Harbours Act was first initiated, it included substantial fines and penalties for people who broke laws within harbours.  However, if I may be parochial, the fines under the Harbours Act, 1946, which we operate in Dingle harbour, are minimal.  An offence in Cork harbour may incur fines of £1,000 or £1,500 with a threat of jail, whereas, under the 1946 Act the same offence committed in Dingle and other harbours may incur a fine of £10 to £50. This should be brought into line and the penalties examined.</P>
    <P>I urge the House to accept the Minister's word in this case.  I sympathise with the people in Clare and support their efforts.  The Minister will do as he says &mdash; he has said before witnesses in this House and it is on the record that no mast will be erected in Clare without further legislation coming before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I am not as familiar <Col N="269" /> as other Senators with the Bill &mdash; if they will pardon the pun, I am navigating in unchartered waters. I only realised half an hour ago that the Bill had been debated here before.  It is unfortunate that the Commissioners of Irish Lights have been entangled in the technological and legal warfare that has arisen from this legislation.  The commissioners are trying to do their statutory duty under an 1894 Act which made no provision for modern navigation methods.  The importance of the Bill in giving the necessary statutory power to the commissioners to install and equip a modern marine navigation system cannot be over-emphasised. We must recognise the tremendous statutory responsibility on the commissioners to aid the safe passage around our shores of our seafarers and fishermen.  It is hard to believe that they were operating under an outdated law. Roughly 90 per cent of our imports and exports are transported by sea.  The commissioners are responsible for ensuring the safe passage of all who travel around our coasts and they have not failed in that duty.  The degree of safety with which our fleet can travel the coast is vitally important.</P>
      <P>The Dáil debate on the Bill featured a great deal of hypocrisy.  The heat it generated was far greater than the heat Loran C will generate, if it is ever built.  I have sympathy with the people of Clare and it is unfortunate that the two sides debating the Bill have so divided public opinion. On one hand, it is necessary to update our navigation systems; on the other, we must prove that the system to be installed will be safe for public health.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the Government should consider setting up a statutory scientific body with overall responsibility for determining the health implications of these masts, which are proliferating throughout the country.  The IPA has certain responsibilities in that area but they are not regarded as a scientific body with the knowledge and expertise necessary to give a definitive answer.  Currently, amateur physicists in every parish are deciding what amount of low level radiation is safe.  Many of them do not have the capacity or qualifications to make a guess on the matter.  I may call for a debate on this issue at a later stage, to ask the Government to set up a scientific body, equivalent to An Bord Pleanála, which would make the final decision on these matters.  The people have rights and democracy must be seen to work.  However, if we are to introduce legislation which involves parish committees making decisions, we will have problems for many years.  We need a body which can give a definitive and knowledgeable scientific answer which will be accepted by the people.  They do not accept the amateur pronouncements on these matters being made at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Loran C mast is erected, and there will undoubtedly be much consultation on that matter, we will be moving into a new area.  This problem has only arisen in the last few years.  In my area I attend one meeting every week about the <Col N="270" /> erection of masts.  Objections are mostly made on health grounds, yet there is no scientific body of opinion which can give a definitive answer.</P>
    <P>I await the amendments to the Bill and will do further research.  I hope the Minister's consultations will result in a compromise.  Feelings on these matters can be quite intense but they are not always based on authoritative judgments and may therefore be faulty.  It is time to rectify that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  In commending this Bill, we should take cognisance of the very serious situation which exists as a result of the legal challenge.  I am not in any way condemning the people in the Loop Head area for their objections to the Loran C mast. However, that successful challenge in the Supreme Court has resulted in a legal dilemma, particularly for the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to pay the highest compliments to the commissioners and to people such as lighthouse keepers, who have served our coastline very well over the years.  I come from an area in west Cork with a very rugged coastline. The busiest shipping lines pass quite close to the west Cork and Kerry coastline.</P>
      <P>It is essential that proper navigational systems with the most modern technology be made available to ensure the safety of sailors and fishermen. The present position has resulted in a vacuum which must be rectified and the Bill is a step in that direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister clearly recognises the dilemma facing the people in Loop Head in Clare.  He is proposing to introduce an amendment to the legislation which will protect the people of Loop Head.  The essence of what he is saying, which is crucially different from what was said during the last Seanad debate on this Bill, is that no mast, whether in Loop Head, Mizen Head or elsewhere, will be erected without further consultation and the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That amendment protects the rights of the objectors, pending full investigation.</P>
      <P>I know from previous experiences with the Minister, Deputy Woods, in other ministries that he is fully committed to exploring all the pros and cons of this mast.  He has already visited a similar mast in north-west France.  He will leave no stone unturned in undertaking the most open and detailed investigation to ensure that whenever a mast is erected, it will be done so with the highest regard for any objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke in the Seanad on the situation of the west coast some years ago.  Apart from the safety of human life at sea, there are also problems with pollution.  There were the famous incidents of the <i>Kowloon Bridge,</i> and a ship which was washed up on the Kerry shoreline and another which came into Bantry Bay and eventually left after successful repairs.  There is another famous wreck partly submerged between Bere Island and the mainland. Whether it is off the west coasts of Cork, <Col N="271" /> Kerry, Clare or Donegal, the most advanced navigational technology should be made available to this country to ensure the safety of our sailors, the prevention of pollution and the proper monitoring of some of the busiest shipping lanes off our coastline.</P>
    <P>While the modernisation of the lighthouses might have been regarded as necessary, it was sad because lighthouse keepers have served us well over the years.  Until recently, all our lighthouses were manned by people who spent their lives in the service of operating them.  They provided an excellent service over the years.  It is a reflection of modern times that technology has meant the service provided by lighthouse keepers is no longer necessary as lighthouses are now fully automated.</P>
    <P>I read the previous debates in this and the other House on the Bill and it seems there is a general concern throughout the country about masts.  Anywhere masts are erected local people seem to express concerns about radiation and so on.  It is an ongoing debate.  However, masts for telecommunications, mobile telephones and television signals are not nearly as important as the provision of a proper navigational service around our coastline.  It is essential that this be recognised.</P>
    <P>It is totally unfair that the Commissioners of Irish Lights may, in their current situation, be held personally responsible in the event of any catastrophe.  They should not have to carry such an ongoing risk.  If they were to take other advice they might decide not to take such a risk.  We have a duty to ensure this risk is obviated at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  I hope, in light of the concern expressed in the House some months ago and what the Minister has committed himself to do under this Bill, that the controversial Loran C mast for Loop Head will not be proceeded with without further debate.  This Bill must be enacted as soon as possible to ensure the current legal limbo is not allowed continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate, although I am somewhat surprised to see the Bill before us in its present form.  This Bill was debated by the previous Seanad and I usually read the Official Report of any previous debate on a Bill to get a flavour of how the debate proceeded. I was surprised by the bitterness of that debate, although I was aware the issue was regarded as a very serious one for the people of Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers posed by radiowaves, microwaves and electromagnetic radiation are a serious source of public worry.  Whenever human kind makes a huge advance, drawbacks and reservations seem to crop up.  There is nothing wrong with that, provided we are objective about it.  In recent times, the erection of masts to facilitate the two mobile telephone networks currently on offer has been a source of concern to people all over <Col N="272" /> the country, both urban and rural.  However, there seems to be no decrease in the number of people who are prepared to use mobile telephones and who demand an even greater and clearer service.</P>
    <P>Further clarification is required from the Government regarding the safety aspect of mobile telephone masts.  We must convince people by providing them with information which shows they are safe.  The directive from the relevant Department that these masts would be erected on Garda stations is a cause of concern, especially in urban areas.  Each case must be examined on its merits.  In my constituency it was proposed to erect a mast in Rush on a Garda station located beside a school, which was unacceptable.  Further thought and clarification is required on this issue.</P>
    <P>This Bill is similar to that passed by the previous Government in the Dáil last February.  I am surprised at its introduction here, especially in view of the venom with which Fianna Fáil opposed it on that occasion.  At the time, we were approaching a general election which created a unique atmosphere.  It was not to be expected, therefore, that the Bill in its present form would be one of the first to be presented to the House. However, the Government has displayed a remarkable aptitude for the art of the U-turn.  It has lately been doing U-turns on its U-turns.  In view of this, my surprise is perhaps naive.</P>
    <P>As a public representative living beside the Irish coast I am concerned at the public perception of the Government, given that it is only a little over 100 days in office.  The public is concerned that it has abandoned the campaign of opposition to Sellafield and to the nuclear issue in general.  The Government has failed to reconstitute the ministerial committee on Sellafield and related nuclear issues, which was established by the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  It has also failed to reconstitute the interdepartmental expert group which was established by the ministerial committee.  I understood that there was cross-party support in both Houses with regard to Sellafield.  However, on the basis of the performance of the Government to date, the public is losing confidence on the issue. The relevant Minister must take responsibly for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is necessary.  The Supreme Court judgment means many existing services provided by the Commissioners of Irish Lights are <i>ultra vires</i> that organisation.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  The commissioners have a long and proud history of service to the Irish seafaring community.  They are also one of the few bodies that operate on a cross-Border basis.  It is unacceptable that they are placed in this invidious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> With regard to Loran C, the Government is obliged to proceed with implementing the system following international agreements entered into freely and endorsed by the Oireachtas.  It would be a bad precedent for this House to renege on agreements entered into by previous Governments.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the argument that the Loran C system represents an infringement of our neutrality.  The same argument could have been made about lighthouses, which have aided the passage of military vessels in the past.  There is little point in attributing blame to specific systems which can only rightly be attributed to how humans use them.</P>
    <P>I have always opposed nuclear powered submarines using the Irish Sea and our coastlines.  In addition, the recent NASA launch of a rocket containing plutonium is also a cause for concern. I have been equally displeased with the Government's handling of the Sellafield issue.  We must look at the use of our coastlines by the major powers and their nuclear powered submarines.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary because the Supreme Court, on foot of an appeal from the High Court, adjudicated that the powers conferred on the Commissioners of Irish Lights by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, are insufficient to take account of changes in technology.  However, there are other aspects of that Act which have not been adequately addressed in this legislation.  For example, it contains provisions empowering the captains of ships to restrict and, in some cases, detain seamen who fail to rejoin their ship or carry out orders.  These have not been repealed by this legislation despite the fact that they belong to a different age and despite commitments given by Irish representatives in Europe. Will the Minister advise on the present position?</P>
    <P>The Minister is considering an amendment to the Bill which would provide for the possible removal of the mast at Loop Head.  I am not in a position to comment on whether the mast is appropriately positioned, although I note that the decision is being put through the rigours of the planning process. In terms of the international commitments we gave, if the mast is not erected at this location it must be erected elsewhere.  This aspect must be considered and I am pleased the Minister gave a commitment that it would be examined and a report prepared.  However, it should be noted by the Government that unless it reneges on its international commitments, the mast will have to be sited elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The main issue is the location of the mast.  This concerns the people in the area in terms of the environment and safety.  The remainder of the Bill, by and large, has the support of the Labour Party and other groups in the House.  However, more thought and consideration must be given to elements of the Bill relating to the mast.  I look forward to the amendments the Minister intends to introduce.  My group will not make a final decision until they are published and if they are <Col N="274" /> not satisfactory we will consider tabling other amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I contributed to the previous debate on the Bill before the proceedings of the House were rudely interrupted by an election and a change of Government.  At that point I was uncomfortable about voting against the Bill because I thought it was progressive and dealt with many important aspects.  However, I could not live with the Bill being used to facilitate the erection of a Loran C mast at Loop Head and I intended to table the following amendment:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the powers or provisions conferred on the Commissioners or the Minister by the Act, nothing in it shall be used to give effect to the operation of a Loran C navigation system.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on and thank him for the commitment he gave today.  In common with Senator Ryan, I await the precise wording of the amendments but it would be churlish not to note that viewpoints have been considered and a productive response has been made.  This is heartening and encouraging in the political system.  This development will be well received by the people of west Clare and others.</P>
      <P>I have huge reservations about this matter.  I listened to many of the contributions to this debate and although it would be inappropriate to deal in detail with all the points made, I wish to query an issue raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn. She said the agreement was signed by a civil servant but I understood the original agreement was signed by the then Minister, Deputy David Andrews.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this aspect in his response.</P>
      <P>In the last Seanad, we on this side had the numbers to block the Bill's progress through the House.  That was most positive and I am sure the Fine Gael Party Senators who were uncomfortable with the Bill when they were on the other side of the House are happy matters have worked out in this manner.  Although I risk the ire of the Acting Chairman by broaching another subject, it is also significant to note that the intervention of the Independent group carried the vote regarding the court case being taken by the County Louth residents against British Nuclear Fuels.  It is interesting that happened today.  It is good to have a mix of party and Independent Members who can come together and convince each other of the merit of certain issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important to note that the local people in County Clare took on the system on this issue.  They managed to hold back the tide and effectively achieved a result.  They deserve credit for much work on this matter and I am sure that people in the Acting Chairman's county, which is close to County Clare, are happy this matter is working out properly.  It is a tribute to people power.  In common with other speakers, I have grave reservations about people who line up to object every time a spade is stuck in the ground <Col N="275" /> or somebody wants to erect a mast.  In this day and age we and the natural environment must make concessions to ensure safety, adequate communications, etc.  These matters are important.</P>
    <P>However, my arguments against the Loran C site were, first, it was unnecessary, second, it should not be located in such a beautiful area and third, it was outdated.  If it is necessary to construct a mast somewhere it should be erected on Rockall.  There cannot be any argument between the UK and Ireland about who owns the mast and we could share the cost, the rock and the output from it.  Before the Minister receives a note from his advisers about this suggestion in terms of how it would be powered and if it would be necessary to use a long distance cable from north Donegal, I point out there is plenty of wave and air power there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also solar power to keep it going; it would not require huge output.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal.  The people who suggested siting the mast in west Clare felt it could be erected there and that suited them. However, I suggest it should be on Rockall.  If that it not suitable, we should float it out to sea. There are many imaginative ways to approach this matter which do not require the spoiling of Loop Head, one of the most beautiful parts of the country.  The Loran C site is unnecessary because events have overtaken it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the row about masts for communications systems for ESAT and Eircell, I argued the point with ESAT's Mr. Denis O'Brien and people in Eircell that they would be unnecessary if all mobile telephones worked from satellites. The masts are necessary for the current system but the other way would be cheaper and would not spoil the environment.  There would be a clear line of sight in all areas and reception would be much improved.  The masts for the telephone systems about which there are all the rows will be as useful as copper wire on poles in ten years.  It is similar to computers where we are forced to move along generation by generation.  The consumer policies of large global producers ensure we do not skip a generation.  We saw people reporting from the Iran-Iraq war with satellite communication telephones which had to be carried in suitcases.  However, nowadays the same type of satellite equipment is used but a telephone fits in one's pocket.  I ask the Minister to bear this aspect in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department said at one point that the cost of putting in place a navigational system based on satellite instead of Loran C would be £60 billion. I do not believe that figure and I will not believe it until somebody shows me a balance sheet.  I suspect whoever formulated that figure cleverly <Col N="276" /> included the cost of launching satellites.  There is enough hardware in space at present to send separate television signals to every house in the country never mind operate a navigation system. However, I recognise and accept the point made by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the Minister's advisers that there should be two systems.</P>
    <P>We need a backup system, particularly for safety at sea.  Current safety standards require that boats working on the Loran C system also have a DECCA system &mdash; a dual system with two or three aerials.  Such a system would cost approximately £900 or £1,000.  There is no reason there should not be a dual satellite system.  Before somebody tells me the cost of that, I am aware there are at least two huge global concerns putting in place a system of geo-stationary satellites around the globe to ensure mobile telephone systems will work from satellites in a short time. There is no reason that these satellites could not also be used to give navigational and locational aid to ships.  Since we last discussed this matter we witnessed an extraordinary episode in the South Pacific where Frank Bullimore was lost at sea for two or three days.  He was located through a navigational rather than a Loran C system as it is far more specific and accurate.</P>
    <P>The Loran C mast is 720 or 730 feet in height while the Tara mast in County Meath, which caused considerable aggravation when erected and is a blot on the landscape, is over 800 feet. There is an 80 or 90 foot difference between the two masts.  I presume that is necessary because they are outputting on different wavelengths.  I was able to receive Radio Tara on the west coast of France.  Will the output from the Loran C mast which the Minister looked at in north-west France cover the west coast of Ireland?  It should and I would like to hear his view on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner asked what fishermen knew. Even if I was the worst fisherman that ever lived, I would go to organisations such as the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and ask it its view on the Loran C mast.  I would also ask its counterpart in France for its view.  Both groups are on the record as being opposed to this.  Even if I had a different view, I would differ to them and I suggest that is not a bad policy to take.  Donegal people tend to get it right in such matters.</P>
    <P>I could speak at length on this issue but it would dilute the import of what I have to say.  We set out to prove a point about Loran C and I am delighted the Minister has come to the House today and is ready to meet our needs.  I am also glad that he will hold a position on it.  Will the Minister get the present and future costs of navigational systems which are satellite based and not only current ones?  The GPS system is the main satellite system at present while DECCA is also useful.  Both system will meet the needs of people at sea.  A satellite system, however, would be better because it would reach further out to sea than DECCA or Loran C and could be a global system. While I do not know enough about Loran <Col N="277" /> C, I suspect it does not work in the middle of the north Atlantic and that it is difficult to hook-up with anything which is land based even with a long wave output.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the people in west Clare who took this issue through the system, and the Minister. People must recognise that the unholy alliance between Independent Members and Members of political parties can hold back negative proposals.  It has been a good day in this House in relation to Loran C and in the other House as regards the case against British Nuclear Fuels.  I ask the Minister to ensure he does what he promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to an extensive debate during which a number of issues were raised.  Senator Taylor-Quinn asked about the legal costs.  As I understand, the legal process is not complete in that the appeal is still in progress.  This is a matter for the Taxing Master and the Attorney General.  The Senator will know that the Attorney General deals with such matters rather than Departments.  I will, however, inquire about the costs.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also referred to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, who tabled a somewhat similar amendment in the Dáil which the Government at the time did not accept.  There is no point going over the rows and arguments which took place.  What we are doing now is consistent with what was said by Members on our side of the House at the time.  I did not want to rehash the debate and gave credit to Senator O'Toole who was in possession at 1 p.m. on 27 February.  We should leave that discussion behind and deal with the new situation resulting from the change in Government.</P>
      <P>This Bill must give the Commissioners of Irish Lights the powers they need and leave it at that or give them those powers while specifically stating that this issue must be treated differently, which is what we are doing.  We have said the Loran C issue must come back to the Minister in the first instance and be debated in the Dáil and the Seanad.  That is a legislative process to which the Minister will be bound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that this matter could be brought forward in the Dáil but Members may be asleep at the time.  There would have to be a major conspiracy of silence which would not occur in this case.  This is an affirmative and positive amendment. We could have an amendment whereby the Minister must sign an order or an order must be laid before the House and to which one could object within 21 days.  At another level, we could also introduce legislation.  The order must come before the Minister who will decide, with the permission of the Government, whether to bring forward an amendment for debate in the Dáil and Seanad.  The controls cannot be any tighter than that.  It is a very satisfactory way of dealing with this issue because it allows urgent legislation to be introduced.  I understand that several Senators <Col N="278" /> have asked why the issue should be returned so soon to the Seanad.  It is an urgent matter and must be dealt with quickly.  Also, the Leader of the Opposition asked for it to be a priority, and rightly so.</P>

      <P>That is my understanding.  Senators have suggested that I should have entered into the consultative process before today.  Since we are putting the issue aside for the present, that is unnecessary because we can have all the consultation required later.</P>
      <P>Táim an-bhuíoch don Seanadóir Bonner thar cheann a fhocail fáilte dom inniu.  I thank Senator Bonner for his welcome today and I congratulate him on his maiden speech.  He is from one of the biggest fishing areas in the country, Killybegs, and Senator Fitzgerald represents another in Dingle. Senator Bonner concentrated on the importance of the Bill and the urgent need for this legislation. I appreciate that, as do most Members, and we are proceeding in that manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris welcomed much of the Bill as it deals with the safety of seafarers.  He mentioned a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> that suggested the Commissioners of Irish Lights might switch off the system.  I doubted that would happen, but they are in a difficult situation which will have to be remedied.  Senator Norris also asked why I did not describe the mast and its effects at length.  I see no need to do that because the matter is being put aside and can be discussed later.  Several Senators asked about the height of the mast.  It will be about 700 feet tall, as Senator O'Toole said.  It has been described in some newspapers as being like the Eiffel Tower.  It is nothing like that, being very thin by comparison.  However, it is 700 feet and has all the stays that go with such a height.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris was also concerned about the military nature of the system, and Senators have mentioned the fact that the American system is controlled by military bases there.  Nobody wants to have a military system, and considerable thought is being given in America as to how the system could be applied to the commercial world. That will be relevant to subsequent debate here. Senator Norris also wondered if an order was sufficient, asking if, like an EU Directive, it could be slipped through.  I have explained that it cannot; it will have to be approved or otherwise by the Dáil and Seanad.  I am dealing with legislation for 20 years and this method will deal well with this issue legislatively.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and do the same thing on this issue, then that would happen in other areas also. I do not envisage that ever happening here, although it might happen in other countries.</P>
      <P>On co-operation with other agencies, whenever one introduces legislation one is open to all sorts of suggestions.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights cannot co-operate, in law, with other agencies in relation to the maintenance of buoys.  There are buoys nearer to other agencies than to ours, and they could maintain ours if we maintain theirs; we co-operate with Britain and other countries on marine safety in areas near those countries. There is no creeping militarism about this.  If that was suggested, we would have heard about it earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the need to get a clear fix when ships are so close at sea.  The need for a land-based fix on what is happening at sea that is separate from the excellent satellite system gave rise to this issue.  Senator Fitzgerald gave examples where no navigational aids were available. There are enormous benefits in having those essential aids available.  He also referred to the Desert Storm period, when America altered the positioning of the DGPS, and I am told it can be altered for other reasons for very short periods. That is one reason for having a separate, land-based system.  If policy in this area changes, the situation will be different and we will examine the new circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the fact that major commercial harbours operate under the Harbours Act, 1946, but other harbours have minimal fines.  The Department informs me that a Bill is in preparation that will deal with this issue.  Much work must be done on updating legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Caffrey said he had not known about this Bill.  Perhaps he was fortunate, as this meant he could approach it with a fresh perspective.  He emphasised the volume of our imports and exports that travel by sea and the importance of safety at sea.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights have not fallen down in this area, although laws must be updated to maintain their position. Senator Caffrey introduced an interesting point when he suggested the Government should give a definitive view on the health implications of these masts.  The Senator referred to gifted amateurs in local communities who are trying to learn all they can to support their points of view.  A body such as the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the principal one in this area.  Nevertheless it may well be worthwhile to have a co-ordination of views so that a definitive view on any of these issues can be given.  There are other European bodies which also express views but the problem <Col N="280" /> is that people do not accept them even when they are expressed by bodies such as the RPII.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan talked about the legal dilemma that needs to be resolved, the busy shipping lanes and the importance of dealing with the vacuum in relation to safety.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Ryan talked about the need to deal with all the different kinds of masts and related problems.  He then mentioned Sellafield. Living as he does on the east coast, I understand his concern and anxiety.  All of us on the east coast are very concerned.  I assure him that the Government has made available the money which was promised before the election, and it will be working with the committee to proceed further with that.  The Government accepted the Opposition motion so we are as one in that area.</P>

If the Senator can find an island in that area the Government would be interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question that the DECCA system might be the more modern but that even this system might become obsolete.  That is something everybody must consider. He also raised the question of getting a different satellite and having a different positioning from that point of view.  I understand Europe is planning another system that would cost millions of pounds, but cost would not be as big a problem for Europe as it would be for Ireland.  Russia and the USA have the satellites and that raises another possibility.  However, the objective here was to have a land based approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> The Senator asked if the output from the mast will cover the west of Ireland.  It will.  Output from the French mast will extend well into the Atlantic and output from the Irish post will extend even further.  The whole system is based on triangulation.</P>
    <P>By introducing legislation in the manner I planned, I am securing the continued operation of essential marine navigation aids.  Everybody agrees with that.  I am also addressing concerns about the proposed Loran C mast by introducing an amendment to the legislation which will ensure that the erection of the mast cannot proceed unless a new order is made by the Minister and approved and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  European regulations do not come before the Houses, but I emphasise this must come before the Houses for debate.</P>
    <P>The commissioners currently provide a wide range of radio based aids to marine navigation, including radio beacons, radar beacons, radar enhancers and the global positioning system.  The primary purpose of this new legislation is to enable the commissioners to continue to provide these radio navigation systems in the interests of maritime safety.  It is essential the necessary legislative framework is in place to allow the commissioners to provide these vital radio based aids to navigation to seafarers.  The amendment the Government is proposing will ensure that the Loran C project will not proceed unless the new order is made and passed by both Houses before it comes into effect.  I am ensuring, therefore, the Loran C project will not proceed unless new legislation is adopted by the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>I intend to carry out a fundamental review of all aspects of the Loran C issue, many of which the Senators have mentioned.  This will allow me to hear at first hand the views of all the interested parties, particularly those living in the Loop Head area.  The proposed amendment would ensure that interested parties can contribute to the wide-ranging consultation process in the secure knowledge that no action can be taken in the meantime to progress this project.  The amendment will state the section which gives these powers to the commissioners shall not apply to the radio and navigation system known as Loran C until such date as the Minister may appoint by order, subject to any restrictions or conditions the Minister may specify in an order, and following on from that, where an order is proposed to be made under subsection 3 of the section, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made unless a resolution approving the draft is passed by each such House.  It is an affirmative order which is legislation, and it must come back to the House for that purpose.  That is what we propose.  It is consistent with the concerns that were expressed earlier.</P>
    <P>There was the question about the NHA status. My Department has been informed by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands that the Loran C site is not included in <Col N="282" /> the sites proposed for NHA status on the Loop Head peninsula.  It appears that the UK may join the group negotiating for the land-based system to replace DECCA as the terrestrial support framework for the GPS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to urgently review the necessity for the National Roads Authority and the effectiveness of that organisation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House.  I am grateful for his presence.  I have been trying to raise this motion in the House for six years so the Minister will appreciate the importance I attach to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> If the Minister does not mind I will speak in stronger terms than those of the motion.  I do not intend to be critical of him.  I want him to consider disbanding the NRA on the grounds that it has focused on certain areas of the country at the expense of others, including my county and other areas of the west.  We are almost at the end of 1997 but the NRA has not published its report for 1996.  Its 1995 annual report is the latest available; this is a clear indication of its inefficiency.</P>
    <P>I read a statement recently by the chairman of the NRA, Mr. Liam Connellan, in which he indicated that over £0.25 billion is to be invested in the national primary and secondary roads this year.  It was his opinion that this level of investment was vital to underpin economic development, to improve the prospects of social cohesion, to reduce transport costs and to improve safety and security.  He is right to claim that the NRA has made a major contribution to certain areas but it has been at the expense of certain rural areas which are lagging behind in their potential for development.</P>
    <P>It is unfair and undemocratic for a few fat cats to take the glory at the opening of major by-passes. There is a major bottleneck at Ballybofey and Stranorlar in County Donegal and all the traffic from the North going west must pass through Ballybofey and Stranorlar.  We have sought a modest sum to relieve traffic congestion in the area but we have been offered a by-pass in six years time at a cost of £30 million, although at that stage it may cost twice as much.  That is not a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider allocating money on the basis of consultations between senior inspectors in the Department and the engineers in county councils so that counties such as Donegal might get their fair share.  That would be the proper way to proceed.  The present allocations are selective.  About 73 per cent of all funding is being spent in Dublin and Cork.  I do not question the need to spend money in those cities. However, if I drive to Stillorgan there are cut stone walls on either side of the dual carriageway and a central reservation planted with flowers, yet towns and villages in the west need lights.  That is unfair and I ask the Minister to review the system.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to accept funding for the fortunate few.  If the NRA decides to by-pass a town, roads, bridges and overpasses will be built. County Donegal gets £3,215,000 overall; £950,000 goes to the construction of the Donegal by-pass and £200,000 for the design &mdash; small fractions of the total cost.  However, the county spends 29 per cent of funds on general road maintenance and 42 per cent on pothole repairs.  Obviously, these amounts limit the amount of road development we can carry out.  We can spend nothing on road marking which is vital for road safety and hedge cutting has almost stopped.</P>
    <P>Ireland will shortly face reductions in receipts from EU funds.  A recent newspaper article indicated <Col N="284" /> that, according to a new report, Ireland's days as a top aid recipient are drawing to a close. The study which reviews EU grant aid programmes points out that Ireland has by far the highest aid allocation per head of population. Unfortunately, this is true.  It will be believed that Ireland is no longer in need of EU aid.  What has happened to rural Ireland and the regions that have not benefited?  This is of major concern to everyone living in rural Ireland.  This is not a political motion.  I have tried unsuccessfully in the past to table such a motion and I would be surprised if there is not unanimity on this issue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider disbanding the National Roads Authority.  The authority distributes money unfairly, at the expense of many parts of rural Ireland.  The Minister's reply will be of major interest to those of us who are members of local authorities in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on Senator Walsh to second the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the emphasis he has placed on efficiency and cost-effectiveness in our various public institutions.  That criterion should apply to all public services.</P>
      <P>Regarding the motion before us, we must remember that the National Roads Authority is charged specifically with the improvement of our national routes.  That is a very important function. Roads are the arteries of our transport infrastructure, and when one considers that transport is the lifeblood of the economy generally, improvement of our roads is very important.  Some 90 per cent of goods are carried on national primary or secondary routes.  When one considers the impact that the roads network has on costs generally in our economy, including the costs of trucks, spare parts, fuel, tyres and so on, anything that goes towards reducing those costs is in the national interest.</P>
      <P>To some extent the National Roads Authority is another layer of bureaucracy imposed between councils and the Department.  While I would not be over-critical of its performance, I admit, as do many others who are charged at local authority level with administering road improvements, that the fact that we have a national roads authority has not made any difference.  This begs the question as to why this layer of bureaucracy was imposed.  There is a general trend in that direction. I know the Minister will have the courage of his convictions and take responsibility in this area.  There was a tendency on the part of the Minister's predecessors, and others, to put some of these decisions at arm's length.  That is not what we are elected to do.  An example of that would be the new arrangements regarding urban renewal where there is now a proposal to set up a national body that will adjudicate on applications from the various local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Urban renewal has operated very effectively over the past decade or more.  I see no good <Col N="285" /> reason it should be changed.  This is another example of duplicating staff and technical expertise. The question is whether we are achieving value for money which is a criterion laid down by the Minister's Department.  The motion asks that we look again at the necessity for having a body like the National Roads Authority.  I have had complaints regarding the schemes put forward where one ends up dealing with technical people from the local authority.  They in turn speak with their counterparts in the National Roads Authority, and in some instances have had to call on technical expertise from the Department.  It is almost symptomatic of the system of local authority housing where local engineers look at design schemes, one must then go to the NBA or another consultant and eventually the Department engineers become involved.  I know of nobody who would consider building a house if they had to engage three separate groupings of that type of expertise.  The system needs to be simplified and the motion before us is a step in that direction.</P>
    <P>I welcome examination of the management system within the NRA.  A fundamental review of the body is most important.  This should be done in an objective way and I would be surprised if it did not illustrate that reverting to the system of the Department dealing directly with the local authority is a better solution to improving our road networking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have the matter regarding the motion clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to urgently review the necessity for the NRA and the effectiveness of that organisation.  Senator Walsh clearly outlined the fact that he wished to have the review and the necessity for it and Senator McGowan wants it to be disbanded.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say on this matter because I am a little bemused and mystified.  We are talking about 1994-99 which is the five year programme within which the NRA would be working.  It is not very long ago since Fianna Fáil, in Government, established the National Roads Authority.  I am surprised the motion asks for the axing of the National Roads Authority because in fairness to any authority or organisation it is extremely important that there be a review.  The effectiveness of the organisation should be assessed.  The call for the axing of it has taken me aback.  If it is to be axed, what will replace it?  The National Roads Authority was set up specifically to ensure that primary and secondary routes would be improved to give value for money.  When it was set up I thought it would remove funding for roads from what had been seen as the largesse of the Minister for the Environment. That system worked to the distinct disadvantage of anyone living outside the region the Minister of the day lived in.  The former Minister, Mr. Flynn, was always complimented on the <Col N="286" /> exceptional network of roads that were built in the north west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Smith was Minister for the Environment, I selfishly expected the same attention to be paid to the mid west, but sadly we did not get that funding.  It would be easy to be parochial and say that if somehow we got rid of the National Roads Authority, anything and everything would be given to each one of us in our respective areas.  Would it revert, however, to the old system of a Minister reigning supreme over national roads funding?</P>
      <P>The responsibilities of the National Roads Authority do not just relate to funding &mdash; they are tied in with the operational programme for transport.  I wonder whether the Minister could take that power within the 1994-99 period, considering that funding and structure were hammered out with the European Commission.  When we question the NRA about funding we are specifically told that it is tied in with agreements hammered out between the Commission and the Government to ensure funds are prioritised during the 1994-99 period.  Perhaps Senator McGowan has the post-1999 period in mind for axing the NRA or maybe he wants to do it immediately, but I am not sure whether legally that can be done.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to look at the National Road Authority's remit from a national perspective. Our national routes account for 6 per cent of total road mileage, yet carry 38 per cent of traffic.  That figure is not broken down between freight and passengers but freight accounts for over 90 per cent of road traffic, which is greater than in any other EU country.  It is the biggest problem we have in this regard.</P>
      <P>We must address the issue of whether we should have turned our back on a good rail network. Apart from LUAS, or whatever else will be in the Dublin area, we should revitalise the railways.  Recently, I was waiting for a speaker to attend a trades council meeting.  She was travelling from Dublin to Limerick by train and eventually turned up at the station half an hour later than scheduled.  In seeking greater funding for the railways, I hope they will be able to deliver their passengers on time.  I am glad to say that travelling by Iarnród Éireann this morning from Limerick I arrived at 10.30 a.m. to the second, something one would associate with the punctuality of Japanese railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NRA's functions also include maintenance, traffic design and research.  We cannot accuse its 14 board members, including the chairperson, of bias.  As ministerial appointees they are selected.  I find that interesting as far as axing the authority is concerned because it is more or less saying that one does not have much trust in the Minister's appointees to the National Roads Authority.  Is the Minister happy with the representation of the 13 board members and the <Col N="287" /> chairperson, Mr. Liam Connellan?  If he is not happy, he should tell us.</P>
    <P>While there is not an exact gender balance on the authority, there are at least some women who have a practical expertise of transport, although I may be accused of sexism for saying so.  They represent a good cross-section of life, including those whom I hope have a major understanding of transport problems.</P>
    <P>If the National Roads Authority is to continue I would like to see more transparency and consultation with local councillors who have much to say about the consultative process of which they are not a part.  We should not have to beg the authority to come to our areas.</P>
    <P>What has happened to a city like Limerick when last Thursday it took me an hour and 40 minutes to travel two miles from the University of Limerick to attend a meeting of Limerick County Council in the city centre?  We do not have funding for the southern ring road.  When I moved to Castletroy in 1973 we were ready to roll, but we are now told it will not be completed until well into the next century.  At the end of this debate the Minister may well tell me that the funding will be forthcoming and that I will be able to get from Castletroy to Limerick in ten minutes.  Then I would be quite happy with the National Roads Authority.  All we want is value for money and the efficient delivery of services so that people can go about their daily work.  The money should be spent fruitfully, effectively and efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome my first opportunity as Minister for the Environment and Local Government to address Seanad Éireann.  I wish to advise Senators in advance that I am due to leave the House at 7 o'clock to attend a European Council meeting in Luxembourg.  I have arranged for the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to cover for me.  I apologise to Members but it is due to circumstances outside my control.</P>
      <P>In responding to the motion, I would like first to acknowledge the right and duty of the Oireachtas to review the adequacy of public service institutional arrangements under whatever Department is involved.  This Government is strongly committed to the strategic management initiative.  At its core, that initiative is about supporting a process which will make public bodies more critical and more ambitious in relation to their performance, and more responsive to the needs of their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> As Minister, I am determined to promote and intensify these principles of quality service in my Department and among local authorities and other bodies within my remit.  I hold no brief for complacency about institutional arrangements or performance and in that spirit I welcome debates of the kind in which we are now engaged.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty coming to the Seanad to listen to, and take note of, the concerns, views and constructive criticism which I know will come from this House for either my Department or the bodies under my remit.  I have no difficulty with this type of motion.  I am surprised, having regard with what Senator McGowan said, that it has taken six years for a Minister to appear in the House to address a motion in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific focus of the present motion, I will recall very briefly the background to the setting up of the National Roads Authority and the reasons for its establishment.  There were two broad aspects to this.  On the domestic front, there was a perceived need to provide for better co-ordination of the national roads programme which, from the foundation of the State, had been implemented through local road authorities. These arrangements had served the country well, but there was consensus that the time had come for a new structure and associated mechanisms which would facilitate better arrangements for planning and constructing national roads, greater concentration of effort and the most efficient use of resources.</P>
    <P>In addition to that perceived internal need, external factors also supported this approach. The European Commission, and the contributory member states, were looking to the member states who were benefiting substantially from EU structural resources to adopt a new approach to the management of the co-financed public investment programmes.  This focus involved the establishment of clear priorities for programmes, taking account of factors of community as well as national importance, the making of multi-annual funding commitments, both nationally and at EU level and the putting in place of appropriate arrangements for implementation, monitoring and review.</P>
    <P>In line with these EU guidelines, the focus of the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99, is on four key corridors to which at least 70 per cent of total expenditure on national primary roads must be devoted.  When Senator McGowan made that point and said 73 per cent of the money was being sent on two different areas, he was not quite accurate, but the thrust his argument in this regard is accurate.  That is a stricture which is imposed on us by the EU rather than a decision specifically made by the NRA to deprive any particular area of funding, and it should be seen against that background.</P>
    <P>The EU concern for action in priority areas requires that all Cohesion Fund aided roads expenditure be on routes that are part of the designated trans-European road network as determined at EU level.  To a certain extent, the problem <Col N="289" /> arises because of European strictures rather than decisions of the NRA.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these various factors, the NRA was given overall responsibility for planning and supervising the construction and maintenance of national roads.  The intention always was, however, that it would work in partnership with local authorities which would continue to carry out their traditional functions &mdash; acquiring land, designing roads and entering into and overseeing contracts.</P>
    <P>In mobilising the NRA, a great deal of effort was put into achieving a balance between its role and that of individual local authorities.  This local input would ensure that the resources, skills and experience of local authorities continued to be applied to the national road programme, in addition to their important and continuing work on their individual non-national roads programmes. I would encourage as much interaction between the local authorities and the NRA because that local input is vitally important.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman referred to the composition of the board of the NRA and it also reflects this concept of partnership about which we are talking. The Roads Act, 1993, required members of the NRA board to have wide experience and competence in relation to roads, transport, industrial, commercial, financial or environmental matters, local government and the organisation of workers or administration.  This requirement was designed to ensure a balanced approach to complex issues of national road planning and construction.</P>
    <P>In establishing the NRA on a statutory basis in 1994, the Oireachtas entrusted it with the general duty of securing the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  Good progress has been made in relation to both these objectives.  Although the overall level of accidents on our roads is still unacceptably high, the work of the NRA has improved the safety of our roads. For example, it is generally recognised that the &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; programme instituted by the NRA in 1994 has helped prevent more accidents and the associated injuries and loss of life on our roads.  Under this programme, action is taken to improve the safety of individual roads in areas such as signage, road markings and alignment.</P>
    <P>The 1997 programme allows for expenditure of £1 million on 95 projects in 15 counties.  Even with that programme in place, it is indisputable that the number of people killed and injured on the roads is increasing.  While we cannot take comfort in the statistics which show that there more cars and more miles being travelled, it is only fair to give credit to the NRA and say that those figures, unacceptable as they are, would be much higher if such programmes were not in place.  It is clear, and everybody in this House would agree, that that work needs to be stepped up and we need to look at our road safety programmes. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who sought a particular responsibility in <Col N="290" /> that area, will have an opportunity to address this with the House at a later date.</P>
    <P>The national road network has become more efficient.  Research carried out by the NRA has demonstrated the savings in journey times, and the reduced uncertainty about journey times, which improvements to the network have brought about.  For example, average time savings of 32 minutes have been achieved on the N4 Dublin-Sligo road following the completion of three major projects.  I am sure that, as Senator Jackman said, when they get down to Limerick it will take her ten minutes to travel from Castletroy to Limerick rather than an hour and a half as at present.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99, agreed between the Government and the European Commission, set the NRA the task of achieving completion of 53 per cent of the national primary road network, included in the four key corridors, by 1999 and of commencing work on a further 11 per cent.  Good progress is being made towards meeting these targets.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year, the NRA will have allocated since its establishment about £800 million for improvement works on national roads and a further £95 million for maintaining the network. Every Member will be familiar with some of the flagship projects resulting from that investment, but smaller scale projects have been implemented too, bringing welcome benefits to particular areas.</P>
    <P>In considering this motion it is right that we should acknowledge the achievements of the NRA in getting the organisation up and running and in working with local authorities and others to develop the national road network.  However, I agree with Senators McGowan, Walsh and Jackman that it is also timely to take stock.  The creation of a new public service organisation, such as the NRA, inevitably brings with it difficulties in terms of new relationships and new ways of doing business.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted in recent times that aspects of the management systems in operation in the NRA need to be reviewed and improvements made in certain areas.  I am pleased to tell the House that the board and management of the NRA have recognised this and taken appropriate action.  Last August the authority appointed management consultants to examine its internal management structure and to report with recommendations for improvement.  I understand this report is near conclusion and when ready it will be considered by the NRA board.</P>
    <P>There is also a wider issue.  This Government, like its predecessor, is committed to public service reform and renewal.  Central to this is the belief that all public service organisations must engage in a continuous process of self-evaluation, constantly searching for better ways to do things.  A particular focus of this approach is the need to ensure all public service organisations are alive to the concerns of their customers and are responsive to their needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The customers of the NRA include Members of the Oireachtas, local authority elected members and officials, local people affected by particular projects, the European Commission, Government Departments and the construction industry.  It is not easy to strike the right balance all the time, especially when, as in the case of the national roads programme, difficult choices have to be made, sometimes between bona fide local concerns and broader national policy objectives. However, all public service organisations have a particular duty to listen to and take account of the views of their customers, especially the views of those who are elected by the people to represent their interests.  If the message from this House tonight is that the NRA may have lost sight of the genuine needs of some of its customers, I am sure that is something the authority will take note of and act upon, as will I.</P>
    <P>When I was in Opposition, I criticised the lack of response to representations and queries made by public representatives to the NRA and I expressed that directly to the authority.  I understand the NRA is putting arrangements in place to ensure that the genuine concerns and queries of public representatives about various projects are met and given an adequate response.  If I am informed that this is not happening, I will take the matter up with the authority.</P>
    <P>My priority as Minister for the Environment and Local Government is the development of the national road network in accordance with the needs of the economy and of the people we are all here to serve.  This is the crucial yardstick which must guide all our decisions and actions in this area.  I have a general responsibility to promote sound organisational arrangements in the areas of public service activity for which I am responsible and for that reason I regard the debate tonight as particularly valuable.  Senators may be assured that their views and concerns will not go unheeded as we work to build up and complete the national road network so essential for Ireland in the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to contribute to the debate.  I have criticisms of the NRA but I do not think the House should call for its abolition.  In the last Dáil the Minister and I were Members of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and one person who gave evidence to that committee was Mr. Michael Tobin, the chief executive of the NRA.  He told us the authority operated under the 1993 Act, which was first introduced to the Dáil in 1991, and that he was fully answerable to the Minister and the Government. In effect, he carries out Government policy on transport and road matters.  The NRA is not over-staffed &mdash; it has no more than 50 employees, most of whom are technical staff, and the Minister has outlined what they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> The problem with our roads policy is that while we are spending a lot of money &mdash; some £2 billion is to be spent under the current programme relating to peripherality, which runs until 1999 &mdash; we do not have enough.  In recent years we spent a great deal of money on road improvements and increasing the capacity of the major national routes and arteries.  However, road traffic has increased by about 30 per cent in the last three to four years.  As anyone travelling to our capital city on a weekly basis can testify, the additional capacity, good as it may be, is being swallowed by this huge amount of additional traffic.</P>
    <P>I come from the west and the best access road into Dublin is the new motorway by-passing Maynooth, Kilcock and Leixlip, where there used to be terrible bottlenecks.  That road is built to the best international standards but beyond it, from Kilcock through Enfield as far as Kinnegad, there is a stretch of sub-standard national primary road which is positively dangerous.  It was the subject of much recent publicity because while it meets the width standards of approximately 8 metres per carriageway, it does not meet standards of sight distance for overtaking freight traffic &mdash; motor car traffic naturally moves faster than freight traffic and overtaking is a great hazard because of the hills and bends in this area.  Some 90 per cent of our freight travels on our roads. Two-thirds of traffic on our national primary is work-related and the other third is recreational and other traffic, which shows how important this is.</P>
    <P>We are unique in Europe in that less than 10 per cent of our freight traffic goes by rail, despite our railway network still being among the best in Europe.  In the early part of the century ours was the most dense railway network in Europe but now the tracks to the more remote areas have gone.  Our railways are totally under-used.  Our culture of road dependence means that while improvements have been made to our railways, these have not been anything like enough.  We need a culture change to direct freight transport away from roads and on to railways.  In every other developed country a huge amount of freight traffic is carried by railways, which are much cheaper to maintain than roads.</P>
    <P>The country is doing well at present and in the next budget the Minister should fight for a greater amount of our own resources to be devoted to road development.  No major national road project enjoys EU grants of less than 60 to 70 per cent.  Because of the problems created by our success, we need to spend far more of our resources on our national primary and secondary roads, especially the latter.  The Cathaoirleach and I live on a national primary route, the N5, which runs from Longford to Westport.  There are about 30 miles of it in County Roscommon.  It is the worst stretch of national primary road in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>No other stretch of national road of that length is as deficient.  As Senator Jackman said, I do not want this matter to revert to ministerial largesse.  My county suffered more than most when it was within the power of the Minister for the Environment to allocate road funding.</P>
      <P>When Padraig Flynn was Minister for the Environment in the 1980s, at a time when much additional funding was available, he gave more to his own constituency.  He lived on the N5, which is a magnificent highway in County Mayo.  The five miles of it in County Longford are a fine highway but the part in County Roscommon, where there was insufficient political clout, is the most deficient in the country.  People may smile at that but it is a fact.  When he was asked to justify giving extra funding to Mayo and disadvantaging Roscommon, he replied that a man has to christen his own child first.  He made no apology for that.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan and I fully respect the National Roads Authority's commonsense and wisdom in these matters and we would be very reluctant to ask for it to be axed.  We should be very reluctant to return this funding to the gift of the Minister.  I say that, bearing in mind the fact that I might be supporting a future Minister in this or the other House.</P>
      <P>We need to spend more of our own resources on road improvement.  More of the extra wealth which has been generated by taxpayers needs to be spent on roads, such as the stretch of road between Kilcock and Kinnegad, some of which is in the Minister's constituency.  As far as I know, there are no plans in this programme to build a bypass at Enfield or Kinnegad or to continue on to Mullingar.  These programmes must be started as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Yes.  When I was a Member of the other House I tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to have a debate on the national roads programme, as the Minister, whose presence I welcome, will testify.  It is highly ironic that I had to lose my seat in order to say anything about the National Roads Authority in either House.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new under the sun.  I remember the frustration of trying to frame parliamentary questions to the Minister of the day on matters relating to the National Roads Authority, only to be told that those matters were for the authority and were not a ministerial responsibility. I note the new Minister has given us the same answer this evening.  I feel frustrated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> I find it frustrating to deal with bodies, such as the National Roads Authority and the Arts Council, which are held at arm's length.  Although they spend huge amounts of public money, we are precluded from asking any questions about what priorities determine how those moneys are spent. However, that is a wider issue which perhaps we can revisit.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible for me to discuss any road related matter without commenting on the appalling number of road deaths week after week, month after month, year after year.  I must express my outrage at our failure to effect any significant reduction in the number of road deaths, despite the good efforts of this Government since last July.  We are not yet half way through the tenth month of this year and already 352 people have been killed on our roads.  I fear we have been far too complacent about that outrageous figure.  Will the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, immediately establish an executive agency to put in place a comprehensive, integrated plan to tackle the whole area of road accidents and deaths?</P>
    <P>Such a plan will have to be based on the three E's.  First, the rigid, relentless enforcement of existing laws by the Garda.  Second, we need better education of drivers and to alter drivers' attitudes to the responsibility they take when they handle the wheel of a moving vehicle.  Third, engineering, by which I do not just mean better road surfaces but also better signposting and road marking.  Our directional signposting has been the subject of music hall jokes, and not without reason.</P>
    <P>Chief Superintendent John O'Brien said today that the main factor in road deaths is the driver behind the wheel.  However, as that is not exactly what we are talking about in this debate, I will confine my comments to the engineering aspects.</P>
    <P>All progressive countries now make extensive use of photo radar equipment.  In 1989, 400 permanent cameras were installed on the M25, which is the ring road around London.  Since then, there has been a 41 per cent reduction in the number of fatal accidents.  Australia has had enormously good results from a similar programme based on radar equipment.</P>

      <P>We have spent billions of pounds on upgrading our national primary roads and I cannot understand why road safety is not given sufficient priority.  I do not understand why we did not simultaneously build the infrastructure which would have enabled the Garda to implement that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national roads programme has been patchy, at best.  There are too many very black spots. For example, the road from Cork to Dublin is as <Col N="295" /> bad as ever.  The problem with that road, which I travel more than any other Member, is that after a very good stretch of road one is funnelled into a mid 17th century road.  That is very bad overall planning.  I hope we can revisit this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I need to be parochial in regard to this issue.  The town of Carlow is an incredible bottleneck and badly needs a bypass.  It is a main artery servicing Kilkenny, south Tipperary and the port of Waterford.  The volume of traffic through Carlow each day is in the region of 25,000 vehicles, a very high proportion of which are heavy goods vehicles.</P>
      <P>The safety aspect is very important because a large number of schoolchildren must cross that road a number of times every day.  The sugar beet campaign, which runs for four months of the year, means there is an unsafe level of heavy goods vehicles on the road.  The expected capacity of the road will double over the next ten years, and we will then have a crisis.  We need action at this stage to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>The proposed eastern bypass needs money, which should be immediately released by the National Roads Authority to complete its design and planning phase. In the words of the former Minister for the Environment, Mr. Flynn, &ldquo;it is now time to christen Carlow&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister has attended the House to debate this issue.  The motion calls for a review of the necessity for the National Roads Authority and its effectiveness as an organisation.  While it is important to critically examines such bodies, we must be clear about its replacement should it be abolished.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, there is a legal agreement between the Irish and EU authorities for a £1.1 billion programme of investment in transport infrastructure.  This is being assisted by EU Structural Funds.  The investment must be made in a co-ordinated way.  For too long the quality of the roads network depended on the efficiency of local authorities and the constituency of the Minister for the Environment.  This meant that often on either side of county boundaries some stretches of road were good while others were bad.</P>
      <P>The accountability of the National Roads Authority is important.  Councillors complain that the authority is almost a mystical body with which it is difficult to communicate.</P>
      <P>There are 2,700 kilometres of national primary roads, 2,700 kilometres of national secondary roads and 89,452 kilometres of non-national roads.  This represents a substantial roads network which must be maintained at a specific standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that improvements to the roads would reduce the annual carnage on them. However, there were 404 deaths in 1994; 437 in 1995; 453 in 1996 and 358 to date this year.  We <Col N="296" /> should reflect on the position of the surviving spouses and families.</P>
    <P>While we should not stop improving the roads network because of this carnage we must endeavour to change the attitude of the public, especially motorists, to safe driving and speeding.  For example, on one stretch of the airport bypass there are four different speed zones ranging from 70 miles per hour down to 40 miles per hour.  In the interest of conveying the message on speeding I have endeavoured to adhere to these limits and have been hooted at by motorists who, in addition to flashing their lights, drive carelessly onto the outer lanes to overtake at speeds faster than the permitted limit.  Until there is a change in attitude by motorists these difficulties on the roads will continue, regardless of their state of maintenance.</P>
    <P>More money should be provided for public transport.  In my constituency it is impossible to get a seat on trains travelling on the Balbriggan to city centre line at peak times.  In addition, some of the trains have safety problems.  We know from the investment made in the DART system that if a comprehensive and reliable service is provided people will leave their cars at home and use public transport.  I am delighted that under the current EU programme much more finance is made available for public transport.  More trains should be provided, especially in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years I have been in contact with the National Roads Authority regarding a stretch on the N1 from Balrothery village to Balbriggan. There are no public lights, despite the growth of a new community in the area.  Children must travel to and from school in darkness.  It is a dangerous stretch of road yet we are unable to get the authority to provide funding for public lighting.  Will the Minister take up this matter?  In recent correspondence with Mr. Tobin I advised that this year's programme provided for the dualing of the N1 from the Coachman's Inn to Swords at a cost of £1 million.  That is not being proceeded with and Fingal County Council could easily divert the money to looking after the safety of the people of Balrothery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. The Minister's contribution was excellent, demonstrating that he will keep an open mind on this debate which is concerned with a review of the National Roads Authority and its effectiveness. As I knew nothing about the NRA, I rang the Department and asked for the booklet on the authority.  I would not know whether it was effective until I knew what it did.  The authority provides money for and manages the national road network.  It also ensures that the national road network is safe and reliable.  Another important aspect is that the authority must make the roads environmentally acceptable.  However, I wonder what that means because I deal with the public and nobody mentions it in relation to the NRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities deal with roads so is the NRA effective?  It must be because it liaises with local <Col N="297" /> authorities and deals with them in terms of the money available for the construction and maintenance of roads, identifying the location of accident black spots and providing lighting, markings and signs.  However, I also learned that the NRA deals with traffic management in that it monitors the time it takes to make certain journeys.  On that basis, I decided the authority was ineffective.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a parochial point, although I am aware parochialism may not be the solution to matters raised in the Chamber.  However, as a politician once said, all politics is local.  If all Members carried out their business in a local manner, nationally we would be most effective. There is a problem in relation to traffic management in south Dublin.  I receive many telephone calls about the length of time it takes to get off the M50.  People say they start their journeys on that road at 7 a.m. but still are not at their desks by 9.30 a.m. I do not know if the NRA has a role in that matter or if it is up to the local authority to solve the problem.  However, people telephone their representatives on local authorities because they operate at the grassroots.  They must deal with the complaints.  I cannot tell the public to contact the NRA although it provides the money for the maintenance of such routes and supervises traffic management.  There is something wrong with the current position.</P>
    <P>The southern cross route which is an extension of the M50 is being built in my area.  Councillors seek a new concept for the free flow of traffic which would involve the Garda Síochána, the local authority, local schools and public representatives. The idea is that all these groups could collectively and effectively in conjunction with the NRA, which has a role in such matters, introduce a traffic management plan to ensure that people can get off the M50 in time for work in the morning. Is the National Roads Authority effective?  It may do a great job in a national sense but I do not know if it is sensitive to the needs of my local authority.  Is it sensitive to the needs of all local authorities?  Ultimately, the public does not know what the NRA does.</P>
    <P>I understand the authority has researchers and specialists dealing with the texture of roads, new machinery and equipment for remedial works on deteriorating surfaces.  That is welcome and I hope they work with the specialists employed by local authorities.  People want to be able to get up in the morning, travel from one place to another safely and reach their offices in time.  That is not happening at present in south Dublin because people have problems getting off the M50.  This is a national route which is about to be extended through the southern cross link.  However, no preparations have been made in terms of traffic management and I do not think the NRA is effective in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a review of the authority.  I am sure it has done good work and that it has a relationship with local authorities.  However, I do not know much about the NRA.  When I attend council meetings and discuss road issues, I am not <Col N="298" /> aware of the role of the NRA.  Perhaps I should not know about it because it is a cog in a machine in which I have no involvement.  However, I must deal with the public and explain the NRA is involved in road matters, though it will not be available to take telephone calls from disgruntled motorists in the frost and snow on a morning in January.  Local representatives must take the calls, pass on the complaints to the local authority and ask what they should do next.</P>
    <P>I wish power was given to local representatives because they are the local pulse and reflect the needs of the locality.  I agree there should be a monitoring body but power should be returned to local authorities and public representatives.  A review of the future role of the National Roads Authority is necessary in terms of how best it can complement local authorities.  It should not be a distant body about which people know nothing.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy for the National Roads Authority because it has been overtaken to some extent by the increased number of new cars on our roads as a result of the Celtic tiger. The M50 was designed to cater for developments in the new millennium but it is already suffering traffic congestion.  The NRA must work with the transport authorities with regard to how roads are used because the congestion to which Senator Ormonde referred is extremely frustrating.  While one cannot excuse road rage, one can appreciate why it happens when one sees signs on relief roads around the city that people should expect a delay of 20 minutes at peak periods.  Sensible people leave the city before 4 p.m. if possible to avoid delays but I have noticed in the last year travelling on the M50 from Palmerstown to Tallaght that the traffic starts to build up from 3.30 p.m. I would not accuse the NRA of not preparing well but many people realised that increased prosperity would bring increased car ownership and that this would create problems for the authority.</P>
      <P>It is nice to have new roads through local authority areas but maintenance and the lighting required create another problem for the local body.  The NRA should consider a new direction at this stage and take on board the concerns of Senators and members of local authorities in terms of looking after the needs of constituents. The lack of consultation with local authorities is amazing on simple issues such as the famous proposal to toll the M50 at 14 different intersections. Any sane person could have told the authority instantly that people would use the first exit and travel through housing estates.  I do not object to tolling <i>per se.</i>  It is sensible and could raise revenue. However, the NRA has not kept to its brief in seeking to toll some routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the conditions for receiving Cohesion Funds is that projects cannot be revenue raising; perhaps tolls are not regarded as such.  The lack <Col N="299" /> of local authority membership on such bodies is clear from the obvious breakdown in communication over simple matters, such as lighting, to which Senator Ryan referred.  At one time the former Dublin County Council could not use the lights on the motorway because it did not have any money.</P>
    <P>The NRA must take on board our concerns which are illustrated by long tailbacks and the problem with lights.  It is incredible that we do not have a proper lighting problem.  Maintenance should not be the responsibility of the local authority. Tolling, if handled properly, could work to everybody's advantage.  Without having control over cars with one passenger taking up four lanes on the N50, we will face permanent traffic jams and relief roads will provide anything but relief. I deplore the fact the NRA is an unelected body and its accountability must be queried in that regard.  By and large, I sympathise with the NRA. Local authority members with experience of problems in their areas would be happy to assist it.</P>

      <P>County Louth has the highest incidence of road traffic deaths in the country.  I welcome the significant amount of money which the National Roads Authority has and will spend in the county up to the year 2000.  I welcome in particular the NRA's commitment to the Drogheda by-pass.  There have been difficulties with by-passes in terms of environmental impact studies.  When the Drogheda by-pass was proposed I raised the question of the impact the by-pass would have on the town of Drogheda in the context of the new approach roads which would be used with the local authority.  I was told that matter could not be addressed by the NRA or the consultants.  By-passes, while they are excellent in that they improve the economic corridor and make it more efficient to travel between two locations, impact on towns, particularly where roads, which were not previously main roads, become such.</P>
      <P>Having travelled around the country in recent months, I found the roads fantastic, particularly the rural roads.  I did not see too much evidence of potholes, etc., but I am concerned that major urban centres like Drogheda are losing out because they are not getting the funding from the NRA.  Traffic calming measures, which are essential in towns, are absent in Drogheda and on the approach roads.  If we pass a resolution to have traffic lights at particular estates because they are at major intersections, we are told that it is a matter for the NRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to tighten up the situation and make clear the connection between the local authorities and the NRA.  The wishes of the people of a town must be paramount and if they need traffic lights on a major national primary route for safety purposes, they must have them.  By saying it is a matter for the NRA, we are washing our hands of <Col N="300" /> this problem.  We cannot spend enough money on our roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years I have spoken about the role of the NRA, of which I have been critical.  That criticism stems from my belief that there was no need to set up the NRA.  This evening the Minister suggested it was set up because of lack of co-ordination between local authorities and counties.  In the past that may have been a reasonable argument.  However, anybody could feed a computer with the various routes which could be taken to avoid obstruction. A single shot from a satellite could identify houses, land and water and could co-ordinate the work of local authorities for which the NRA was set up.  I will not suggest the Minister of the day made a mistake but if the technology which is now available had been used at the time, there would have been no need to set up the NRA. Co-ordination between the Department and local authorities, using today's technology, would have been sufficient and there would have been no need to add another level of bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>When travelling to Dublin, one sees a plethora of new roads.  The M50 is clogged at certain exits and will soon be like the M25, which was supposed to be a lung for London &mdash; there was a nine hour back up on the M25 out of London the other day.  At present there is gridlock on the road between Kilkenny and Waterford which is of concern to those travelling to work in Waterford and trying to get goods in and out of Waterford or from the west to Waterford but the NRA does not seem to give two hoots.</P>
      <P>Belview, which has the potential to become the largest port in Ireland over the next four or five years, is located in County Kilkenny, although many people believe it does not have a port.  No further land is available in Ringaskiddy where heavy industry is located, and the port has reached the maximum potential for development. Mulhuddart has also reached its full potential for development.  The IDA, Forbairt and others have acknowledged that the only place available for development is the port of Belview, which is called the port of Waterford but is located in County Kilkenny.  I read reports which state that access from that port, around which industries are developing, is superb.  Access to the port from New Ross and areas further up the coast is good. However, there is no co-ordination among bodies if we want to develop the port to transport goods from Sligo or to Portlaoise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be a new mine in Senator Hayes' constituency and it is likely that extractions from it will have to be transported through County Kilkenny to get to the port of New Ross or the port of Waterford.  The Arcon mine is located in County Kilkenny on the border with County Laois and a decision was made that it could not use secondary roads to get to the ports, in other words, it had to use primary roads.  Unfortunately, secondary roads are being used because the primary roads are blocked.  When I had a two-cylinder <Col N="301" /> Prinz II in 1957 I could get to Waterford in half an hour.  Now I have a two litre car but it takes me at least an hour to get to Waterford.  If one wants to get to a hospital in Waterford, there is one bridge and no road network.  The NRA has ignored the fact that Waterford is a premier port. Approximately £56 million has been invested in Belview by local authorities and the Government, and new industries have been set up there, but one cannot get to the port.  The NRA seems to think that putting roundabouts in Dublin will solve problems in every county.  It is no good pretending that Ireland is an organisation linked to Dublin.  If a Minister puts pressure on the NRA, a roundabout may be erected in a small town in the west, but the entire south-east is totally neglected by the NRA.  One aerial photograph would tell them where gridlocks occur.</P>
    <P>There are plans for a bypass in Thomastown, which is fine, but if one gets off that bypass it will still take an hour to get to Waterford.  The airport in Waterford is on the wrong side of the river given the road infrastructure and rail links, and one bridge connects Wexford, Waterford and south Tipperary.  The NRA has not yet grasped the nettle and put a proper road infrastructure in place.  A major road has been made into a bottleneck which is like a pippette that water might pass through, but not traffic.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny City is one of the nicest places in the world to live, but because of the lack of co-ordination in the NRA it is totally gridlocked.  There is no roundabout there.  The NRA has been successful in certain areas, but it has been atrociously advised in regard to others.</P>
    <P>Mr. Liam Connellan has spoken of the money the NRA is spending.  Huge amounts of money have been thrown at health boards, but the best service is still not being provided to people.  An increasing amount of money is being thrown at the NRA but we still do not have the roads necessary to transport goods across Ireland and into ports.  We are getting roundabouts and &ldquo;spaghetti junctions&rdquo; in Dublin where people are going nowhere.  How long has it taken the Minister of State to get a tunnel under the river Lee for access to west Cork?  There are more roads in Dublin than there are people to travel them. There is no co-ordination.  The Minister of State should approach the NRA so that, with the Department of the Environment and the county councils, a satellite photograph can be taken to show where new roads are needed.  I have been fighting for this for many years.</P>
    <P>I do not want the NRA abolished, but it must realise that it will not solve problems by throwing money at areas where problems do not exist.  The south-east should be given a reasonable amount of the moneys available for the real, and not perceived, needs of the area.  The Minister of State should propose proper co-ordination of local authorities, the Government and the NRA to <Col N="302" /> provide the infrastructure necessary for industry and commerce.</P>

      <P>Debate on the NRA is welcome. All of us have different suggestions for that organisation, and many Senators may feel that it has not been accountable.  Many questions have been diverted, redirected or answered by a statement to the effect that the relevant Minister has little authority in the matter.  Senators McGowan and Lanigan have requested a debate on the NRA and related matters for a long time.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the damage the southern cross route and south-eastern motorway may do to Leopardstown Racecourse.  Those proposals may sound the death knell of racing at that venue, although I hope not.  Two routes were proposed, and various consultants recommended that a route near a power station and dump would be the desired one.  That seemed reasonable while allowing that it would affect certain areas. However, other consultants recommended a route that would go through the straight on the six furlong Leopardstown course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Flat racing in Leopardstown may not be the great dream of many people, but this route and its resulting works would cause many problems. It will have to be looked at before a possibly retrograde decision is made.  Leopardstown, along with the Curragh, has been the showcase of Irish racing for many years and the Minister of State should seek the opinion of the NRA on this matter. <Col N="303" /> One set of consultants offered a definitive opinion on one route but some years later another set of consultants produced an equally definitive report recommending another route. The danger is that if this latter route is pursued without due consideration, racing at Leopardstown may be under threat.</P>
    <P>I also welcome this debate because there seems to be great carnage on the roads.  The NRA must further the investigation into the growing number of deaths on the roads.  Obviously speed is a main contributory factor, but people get on to new roads which are very well built and then forget when they leave them that they are travelling on an ordinary road which may be narrower or have bends on it.</P>
    <P>The transportation of goods by road must also be examined, with particular reference to roads that take freight traffic and villages through which juggernauts pass.  We should also examine the issue of putting roads through residential areas which is not desirable.</P>

      <P>I join with Members in welcoming this debate.  As public representatives we deal with road problems in our councils daily.  I have been a council member since 1991 and much time has been given to discussing the National Roads Authority but despite many requests, we have failed to get a member of the National Roads Authority to address our meetings and tell us what is its role.  Our council has been discussing what is probably one the biggest decisions we will ever have to take, the imminent by-pass of Cashel.  The need for it is probably greater than the need in any other town, but the town is divided on whether to by-pass it on the east or west. As the debate progresses, the division widens.  We as a council have to take that decision, yet the National Roads Authority will not come to our meetings and will not express an opinion on the matter.  It is ludicrous that an authority such as that will not come and join us in making such a huge decision which will have an impact for generations to come and is something that not only the council and its executive but the people of the county take very seriously.  It is a hard decision to take.  I utterly condemn the authority because it will not come and discuss an issue which is so vital for the people of our area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak for the first time in Seanad Éireann but make no apologies for being parochial when I talk about the N2, the Dublin to Derry route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monaghan town is my home town and, like every other town, it has had severe traffic problems over the past number of years.  In recent years, however, this has gone out of all proportion. The problems used to be just at peak times but now they are all day, even in the evening.  The N2 is the main route for traffic coming from Donegal and Derry.  A journey from Donegal to Dublin used to take four hours, it now <Col N="304" /> takes five hours.  This is due to inordinate delays in Monaghan town, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and, to a lesser extent, Ardee.  There are a number of reasons for the huge influx of traffic, among them the increase in car ownership.  In my town it is also related to urban renewal, which has resulted in numerous new, large stores in the town centre.  We have had increase in traffic of 25 per cent through Monaghan town following the peace in Northern Ireland, which I was delighted to see.  Studies done over the years on our traffic problems concluded that it is a main priority to have bypasses for each of our towns: Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan town.  However, it does not seem as if money will be allocated to this in the foreseeable future although it is the long term solution to the problem. Our biggest problem is that we need an inner relief road through Monaghan town.  Monaghan County Council has submitted plans for this inner relief road and it will cost around £3 million.  In 1995 the council met the National Roads Authority but it did not show any interest in relief roads.</P>
    <P>If the council were dealing directly with the Department of the Environment and Local Government money would be allocated for this case which is so urgent.  We are lucky that the necessary land for the relief road is owned by Monaghan County Council and the IDA.  I call on the Minister to use his influence with the National Roads Authority to give the go ahead for a by-pass but, if that is not forthcoming, to at least allocate a modest sum of money to provide some form of relief to the area.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator McGowan because his views are the same as mine.  As far as I can see, areas north of the Dublin to Galway route have been neglected over the last number of years.  Not one of the towns on the Derry to Dublin route has been by-passed.  Only a few small stretches on the Louth road and in County Monaghan have been realigned.  I am from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency where numerous pothole candidates have been elected.  This area has been neglected and it does not appear as if there will be greater interest in us at this stage.</P>
    <P>The fact that only 10 per cent of traffic is carried by rail was mentioned.  At least some areas are fortunate enough to have a rail system.  Monaghan lost its rail system in 1958 and is totally dependent on the road network.  We are being let down.  In Monaghan the main industries are agribusiness &mdash; poultry and mushrooms &mdash; and furniture.  These industries depend on an efficient road system.  Presently these businesses are being damaged and we are being held to ransom.  The journey to Dublin used to take two hours but it now takes half an hour just to get through Monaghan town.  That is totally unnecessary in this day and age.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority took over the national routes in 1994.  Since then there has been a 25 per cent increase in traffic through the main towns in the area.  There has been a great amount <Col N="305" /> of correspondence with the National Roads Authority involving various organisations and the county council, all to no avail.  The counties north of the Border have also been pressing the National Roads Authority to provide an increase in funding to aid the roads network in our area.</P>
    <P>I do not know who are the members of the National Roads Authority.  As far as I am concerned, a number of faceless people run the authority. If the Minister had greater control, the buck would stop with him.  Who does one contact when communicating with the NRA?  Correspondence is fine but anyone can issue a standard letter. Every meeting I attended in my constituency during recent years has been given over to discussion of the roads network.</P>
    <P>In the long term, each town in my county and the town of Ardee in County Louth should be bypassed.  In the interim, a ring road or relief road is needed, particularly in the case of Monaghan town.  Representatives from the National Roads Authority should visit my constituency as a matter of urgency to investigate the problem.  In the two years that we have corresponded with the authority, such a visit has not been forthcoming. They need only travel through the town at any time of the day to witness the situation for themselves. As yet, however, no representatives have appeared and no decision has been reached.  It appears that no consideration has been given to the possibility of constructing bypasses and there is no interest in putting in place a ring road or relief road.  Where do we go from here?</P>
    <P>In times of progress, delays experienced on simple journeys are completely unnecessary.  We must consider if it is necessary to have a National Roads Authority.  Other Members believe it is necessary but we must consider the efficiency of the board because, as far as I am concerned, it leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to make my points as succinct as possible.  We are discussing a review of the National Roads Authority.  We might ask why it was established and what are its terms of reference and its functions.</P>
      <P>During his contribution, the Minister stated that &ldquo;53 per cent of the national road network including the four key corridors will be completed by 1999.&rdquo; Bearing in mind that only 5,500 kilometres of the 90,000 miles of road in this country are classed as national primary or secondary roads, it appears the NRA has little responsibility. However, its expenditure of millions of pounds begs the question, is the investment worthwhile?  In the year 2003 or 2005, when we have prepared for the &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo;, what will the NRA and the Department of the Environment and Local Government do to maintain and protect that investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was granted objective 1 status which ensured that European funding would be spread throughout the country.  The interests of the west, north-west, east and south-east were represented during this debate.  I live in the south and I look <Col N="306" /> with envious eyes at the investment made along the east coast.  I recall attending a conference a number of years ago which was addressed by NRA personnel.  A map was placed on the wall and we were informed that Portlaoise was the cut-off point from where the volume of traffic originated and emanated towards the east coast. The port of Dublin was shown and reference was made to road structures to facilitate port development. They spoke about increasing the volume of traffic through Dublin port from 20 per cent to 45 per cent.  Is that good national planning?  The obvious answer is that it is not.  If traffic through Dublin port was increased to 45 per cent other ports would lose out and a greater problem would be created for the people of Dublin.  People living on the east coast complain about the current volume of traffic and our policy is perpetuating the problem.  A better regional policy geared towards the west and south-west should be put in place.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that political intervention does not occur but I contend that it does.  I will cite one glorious example to underline my argument. I live near Bandon where the traffic count on an average day exceeds 10,000 motor vehicles travelling eastwards to Cork.  The national secondary road which runs through the town was built when ponies and traps where still in fashion. No money has been spent on improving it in the interim.  However, I attended a meeting of Tralee County Council which discussed the possibility of constructing a national primary dual carriageway &mdash; 4.5 miles long with room for 7,000 vehicles &mdash; at the entrance to the town.  How can that grading be justified?  Representatives of the National Roads Authority have been invited to attend meetings of Cork County Council and, if they do, we will ask them to provide that justification.  It is no surprise that they do not attend council meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members for the large measure &mdash; I estimate it at 99 per cent &mdash; of support they have given to this motion.  I compliment the new Senators who made excellent contributions and appear to be well briefed on the problem.</P>
      <P>It is abundantly clear that the National Roads Authority is a layer of authority we could do without.  The Minister was as diplomatic as possible when he stated &ldquo;If the message from this House tonight is that the NRA may have lost sight of the genuine needs of some of its customers, I am sure that is something the authority will take note of and act upon&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister's remarks will be acted upon because, if a change in attitude occurs, we may not need to abandon the National Roads Authority.  If Senators Callanan, Lanigan and others from rural areas complain about this problem it is clear that change is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Last year, when I was in Opposition, Commissioner Neil Kinnock sat in the chair he now occupies and I asked him if a case had been made <Col N="307" /> to him in respect of improvements to the A5 and the N2.  He informed me that no such case had been made, that he knew the roads to which I referred and that if a case was made he would provide funding for improvements.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are receiving &ldquo;pothole&rdquo; money, nothing more, and time is being wasted. The democratic system has been passed over and people elected to these authorities have very little say.</P>
    <P>The large amounts of money are being spent by bureaucrats who are not democratically elected to their positions.  They may have been appointed by a Minister but they quickly assumed power to themselves.  It is right that the House has given notice of its dissatisfaction in this debate.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to wait a little longer for improvements.  I hope the House will re-examine the performance of the NRA in the near future. I also hope that Senator Leonard and others will continue to monitor the issue in the future.  This matter is of fundamental importance to rural areas and the people we represent.  If we cannot get satisfaction we might as well throw in the towel because this issue is basic to us as representatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an important address.  I hope we will see a consistent effort to bring about change.  I appreciate the support shown for the motion and we have sent out a clear message this evening.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for being in the House this evening to respond.  When I mentioned Annacarty, Cappawhite, Donohill, Hollyford and Clonoulty in the House this morning they were unknown to many.  However, I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the great Tipperary hurlers who came from these towns.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, 31 August, a severe downpour occurred in this rural area.  In the region of £1 million damage was done.  South Tipperary County Council, through the efforts of its staff, helped alleviate some of the problems.  Great hardship has been caused in the area as a result of the flooding.  This is an agricultural area and people badly need good roads to go about their daily work.  The area was developing its tourism potential.  Two handicapped people live with their families in Rossmore and they are experiencing great hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> The county council has put a proposal to the Minister and made submissions for grant aid towards the restoration work on the roads.  To date we have been disappointed.  I hope to hear good news from the Minister of State tonight. South Tipperary County Council has carried out £200,000 worth of work and there is a shortfall of about £800,000.  The people of the area will remain in severe hardship unless funds are made available to the county council.  Immediate repairs need to be carried out because, to quote a proverb, a stitch in time saves nine.  The roads will deteriorate further unless repairs are effected now.  I urge the Minister of State to come to the rescue of the county council.  I cannot express adequately the hardship being experienced.  It has to be seen to be understood.</P>
    <P>A report from the county council on the damage includes photographs which indicate its extent.  The conditions could almost be described as third world.  I am sure the Minister of State does not wish to preside over such a situation. The people of the area feel hard done by.  They are in a rural area and have very little support.  If such damage occurred in a built up area it would have been highlighted in the media long ago.  I urge the Minister of State to take action.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Senator O'Meara.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Hayes for sharing his time and allowing me to speak on behalf of the people of Hollyford and Cappawhite.  It is appropriate that we should do so because our role is to speak for those whose voice would not otherwise be heard and to raise issues that would not otherwise be considered.  Senator Hayes referred to the county council's report on the effects of the storm.  In only 45 minutes an horrific level of destruction was wreaked on the area.  The report refers to the need to reconstruct entirely a number of roads.</P>
      <P>I have been unfortunate enough to have experienced house flooding.  Its effects last for months and it puts severe pressure on a house; indeed, permanent damage can be caused.  The initial damage done in that 45 minutes may affect people for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disgraceful that the Minister will not meet with a delegation to hear the concerns of the people involved.  He should see the state of the roads.  This issue is very important to the relationship between central and local government and between Government and the communities in Hollyford and Cappawhite.  The powerlessness of these communities is summed up by the knowledge that £1 million would make a huge difference to the quality of their lives but it is not forthcoming although we are told the country is awash with money.  A 45 minute downpour has left this community feeling more isolated and downtrodden. The flood is an act of God and the Department may argue that it cannot respond to every such event.  However, a Department should be <Col N="309" /> able to respond.  Why can a Department not have sufficient budgetary flexibility to provide for such events and to respond to the needs of a community? That is not too much to ask.</P>
    <P>As I said, the country is awash with money.  We hear of &ldquo;payback time&rdquo;.  When will it be payback time for the people of Cappawhite, Rossmore and Hollyford?  All that is required is £1 million.  I look forward to the budget because I want to see who will be paid back.  I urge the Minister of State to appeal to the Government to listen to the needs of this isolated community and to respond to them.  The Minister should at least meet a delegation and treat the matter with the urgency it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, regrets that he is unable to be present in the Seanad this evening to reply and he has asked me to do so on his behalf.  The subject of this motion has already been raised by Minister Dempsey with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.  The Minister has also discussed the matter with the chairman of Tipperary South Riding County Council.  The Minister indicated he would be willing to address a meeting of the county council on Friday, 24 October, and in this context would address the subject of this motion.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads is a matter for local authorities, to be funded from their own resources, supplemented by State grants provided by the Department of Environment and Local Government.  Furthermore, local authorities are regularly reminded that the cost of remedial works arising as a result of flooding and storm damage must be met from the combined annual State grant and own resources provision and that they should provide a contingency sum from these sources to finance road and bridge restoration works which may be necessitated by severe weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, Tipperary South Riding County Council was allocated a total sum of over £4.21 million by the Department of Environment and Local Government in 1997.  This allocation represents an increase of 24 per cent on the 1996 payment figure.  Taken with an estimated own resources figure of £1.4 million, this means that the council has over £5.6 million to expend on its non-national road works programme in 1997. While this is a considerable sum, I must point out that it would have been higher if the council had maintained or increased its own resources input. The £1.4 million to be provided by them this year is, in fact, 13 per cent less than the amount they provided in 1996.  While it is appreciated that there are many financial demands being made on councils, this decrease is disappointing, especially when State grants have been increasing so <Col N="310" /> dramatically and at a time when local authorities themselves are identifying the unsatisfactory state of many of our non-national roads as a major priority at local level.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, State grants for non-national roads in 1997, including grants for the local improvements scheme, will amount to £177.815 million, an increase of £30.953 million or 21 per cent on the 1996 payments of £146.862 million.  The 1996 payments were in turn up 17 per cent on the 1995 outturn of £125.948 million. State grants for non-national roads have increased, therefore, by 41 per cent since 1995. All local authorities have been asked to increase their own resources input at least in line with inflation.  This is absolutely essential if we are to tackle the problem of restoring non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the Government's commitment as set out in the Action Programme for the Millennium to ensure increased funding for regional and county roads.  The Minister intends to honour this commitment in full.  In doing so, he does not want State grants to be used as a substitute for own resources.  This would simply subvert the efforts being made by the Government to restore the network to an acceptable level.  All local authorities, therefore, are expected to play their part and to do so in a realistic manner in the area of funding.</P>
    <P>It can be confirmed to the House that a request has been received from Tipperary South Riding County Council seeking a sum of £704,600 to repair damaged roads.  Further recent correspondence from the council now suggests that the total sum required is well in excess of this figure as additional bridge works are necessary.  Notwithstanding the position outlined earlier, namely, that the council is responsible for dealing with these emergency works, and the disappointing position about the reduced own resources provision by Tipperary South Riding County Council in 1997, the House will be aware from questions answered in the Dáil &mdash; the latest just yesterday afternoon &mdash; that the Minister is prepared to have his Department examine requests from local authorities for assistance in cases of demonstrated emergency need.  The request from the council is being examined in this context.  I might add here that similar requests have also been received from a number of other local authorities.</P>
    <P>However, apart from any limited funds which might become available for reallocation, all grant moneys for 1997 have now been allocated and there are no other funds available from which further grants could be made available to the council.  As examination of the various requests is ongoing in the Department, I am not in a position tonight to indicate the outcome.  However, I can assure the Senator that the request from the council will be considered and the council will be notified of the position in the near future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, to the House.</P>
      <P>My topic is the need for the nation to take its full part in the celebrations of World Food Day tomorrow, 16 October.  The Minister and I were away last week.  We met at the World Trade Fair in Germany and I was unaware that tomorrow was World Food Day.  The Minister and I spent some time together in the company of Chancellor Kohl.  We saw what is happening to the world trade in food at the largest trade fair in the world. There were hectares of stands.  There were Irish stands, one of which we can be immensely proud. The food represented there showed the food of Ireland to an extent that would make anybody whose taste buds were not even whetted gasp with delight.  Some 103 nations and 6,500 different companies were represented.  The opportunity for business and the way we could create a market came to mind.  The cornucopia of delights took my breath away.</P>
      <P>Then I stepped on the plane to come home and picked up a magazine carrying an article called &ldquo;Food for Thought&rdquo;.  It said &ldquo;It is world food day on 16 October but who will notice and who will care?&rdquo; I was struck by this because it showed the most horrific pictures of people starving in eastern Asia, including India, in Africa south of the Sahara, Latin America, China, North Korea and so on.  Many people are starving, they will wake up in the morning knowing they will not get enough to eat.  Yet we were coming from this Utopia, if I could call it that, of food in Cologne and reading this article.</P>
      <P>I will touch on something I learnt from this article.  I was ten years of age in 1947 when we commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Great Famine.  I am delighted to see members of the Catholic Guides of Ireland from Drimnagh here tonight; they range from ten to 15 years of age, and I can remember the huge impact the commemoration of the Great Famine had on me at that age.  I remember seeing people hungry in Biafra in the 1960s and in Ethiopia in the 1980s. I thought all this was in the past until I read that article.  I was struck by the recognition that we have almost forgotten that there are people hungry in the world.  When I concentrated on this I realised that the purpose of the celebrations tomorrow is to draw the world's attention to the fact that there are people hungry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 800 million people in the world are suffering from malnutrition and that number is growing considerably.  The FAO estimates that in 40 years time the world population will be increased by 3 billion more than the present 5.7 billion.  If hunger were a disease it would be of epidemic proportions.  That is why every year the FAO nominates 16 October, the anniversary of its foundation in 1979, as World Food Day.  The objective is to heighten public <Col N="312" /> awareness of hunger, malnutrition and poverty in the world.</P>
    <P>This year's theme is &ldquo;Investing in Food Security&rdquo;. Food security means it is the human right of each man, woman and child on this planet to at least have enough food to lead a healthy and productive life.  Hopefully, World Food Day will stimulate interest and activity throughout the world.  We must not hold our breaths, however, nor be too sure that it will happen.  It is interesting to note that enough food is already produced to feed everybody &mdash; the real problems are its availability and affordability.  The poor need the means to grow food and Third World countries need the means to set up adequate distribution systems.</P>
    <P>Some years ago an interesting book was written by a Canadian economist and futurist called Frank Feather.  He said we will not have a problem in future with lack of food or lack of space. There is plenty of space and the world's population could fit into the state of Texas.  We produce enough food but what is lacking is the ability to distribute it.  That is surely a management problem.  We can face up to that challenge and manage to do something about it.  A rocket was due to travel to Saturn today at a cost of $3 billion.  At a time when we are able to achieve that sort of thing, the challenge of being able to distribute the food that already exists is surely not too big for us.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the technology we use is safe in the area of food security.  We must support only the highest standards if we are to apply the development of such systems as genetic engineering to food.  In the interests of those who are hungry, however, we must also insist that we adhere to the very best practices our scientists and agriculturalists can come up with.</P>
    <P>Crop varieties that were developed over centuries to resist pests, disease and climatic conditions are being lost.  Once a crop variety is lost its attributes can never be recovered.  Therefore we must work hard, not as a nation particularly but as a world community, to make sure this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Some 30 per cent of domestic animal breeds are at risk.  In Europe half the breeds that existed at the beginning of this century are being lost to intensive production.  Many challenges are facing us, but these are only management challenges.  In our own hands we can solve them.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment so that we will think of it on World Food Day tomorrow and we will use the opportunity to do something about it.  Future generations will look back on what is happening at the end of the 20th century &mdash; just as we look back on slavery or capital punishment for minor offences 100 years ago &mdash; and ask how we put up with a system of paying farmers not to grow something under the set-aside system when others were hungry.</P>
    <P>As a State we cannot solve this problem on our own, but our nation suffered from famine 150 years ago and it is that very feeling and emotion <Col N="313" /> inside us that encourages us to do something about it.  We must begin to look at food needs from a global perspective, not purely from a European one that only serves local interests.</P>
    <P>Given our history we should be a leader within the European Union in pressing for a reformed agricultural policy that encompasses a moral dimension as well as an economic one.  I want Senators to consider that tomorrow at lunch and dinner when we enjoy food that many in the world do not have.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your election as Cathaoirleach.  I served as a Member of this House 15 years ago.  I was elected in April 1982 and spent a few months here doing an apprenticeship, one could say.  I wish success to all Senators.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for raising this matter. Since I became Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, with special responsibility for food, the Senator has crossed my path in many areas.  I praise his work for the food industry.  He was clearly an influence at the Enuga food fair during the week.  He knows the food business and is doing good work for the country.  We had an excellent trade exhibition at the fair with the theme &ldquo;Ireland, the food island&rdquo;; we had an excellent team there.</P>
      <P>We have much to offer the world in terms of good quality food.  The presence of retailers like Senator Quinn, who are prepared to travel the world to help our food industry, helps farmers and food processors.  I have watched his progress since the study was done on the food industry. We discussed the Senator's minority report for which I had respect at the time.  I congratulate him for his efforts.</P>

      <P>World Food Day is celebrated on 16 October each year, on the anniversary of the founding of FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN.  World Food Day is observed in more than 150 countries.  Its objective is to heighten public awareness of the problem of world hunger.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Investing in Food Security&rdquo; is the theme for World Food Day, 1997.  This theme is particularly appropriate and important at this time.  The issue of how to achieve food security for all people is one of the greatest challenges facing the world as we enter the 21st century.  It is estimated that over 800 million people are hungry or malnourished in the world today while a far greater number, perhaps 2 billion, have diets which are chronically deficient in essential vitamins and minerals.  It is the responsibility of all of us &mdash; Governments, NGOs, international organisations and individuals &mdash; to do all we can to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, food security was seen largely as a problem of agricultural production.  It was thought that if enough food was produced no one <Col N="314" /> would go hungry.  However, experience has shown us that food security is a complex and multi-faceted problem.</P>
    <P>The World Food Summit in November last year, in which Ireland as President of the EU played a leading role, provided a forum for Heads of State and Government from around the world to put their political commitment behind urgent action to eradicate hunger and create world food security.  It agreed a specific target of reducing the number of under-nourished people to half its present level of 800 million no later than 2015.</P>
    <P>The summit defined food security as follows: &ldquo;food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&rdquo;.  The summit plan of action consists of seven commitments and associated actions focused on the factors necessary to achieve food security.  These are an enabling political, social and economic environment.  This is the essential foundation which will enable states to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication; policies aimed at eradicating poverty and improving access to food &mdash; poverty was clearly recognised at the summit as the prime source of food insecurity; the provision of sustainable food, agricultural, fisheries, forestry and rural development policies, which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies; ensuring that trade policies are conducive to fostering food security for all through a fair and market-oriented world trade system; preparation for, and prevention of, natural disasters and man-made emergencies; optimal allocation and use of public and private investments and implementation, monitoring and follow-up to the summit by governments in co-operation with the international community.</P>
    <P>The summit has been understandably criticised for setting a target which envisages that there will still be 400 million starving people in the world in 20 years' time.  However, it must be borne in mind that FAO predicts that unless current trends are changed, there will be 680 million people starving by 2015.  It is in this context that the figure of 400 million must be seen.  To achieve even this admittedly limited aim will require radical change from current trends and, therefore, will need real and substantial action by the Governments and organisations which have committed themselves to this aim, and to the plan of action adopted by the summit.</P>
    <P>Unlike previous pledges to eradicate world hunger, the summit provides for a detailed system of implementation, co-ordination and monitoring to ensure that Governments, NGOs, and the UN system take action to implement their commitments. I assure this House that Ireland will take an active role in ensuring that summit commitments are taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The 150th anniversary of the Great Famine has sharpened our official and voluntary commitment to development and food security.  I pay special <Col N="315" /> tribute to the role played by Irish non-governmental organisations in this effort.</P>
    <P>One of the most important ways in which the Government implements its commitments on food security is through the Irish aid programme. The total allocation for Irish aid in 1997 is £122 million, which is equivalent to 0.31 per cent of GNP.  This is the highest level ever, both in money terms and as a percentage of GNP. Ireland now has the fastest growing aid programme of any donor country.  Since 1992, growth has been particularly strong, with the allocation increasing from £40 million or 0.16 per cent of GNP in that year to, as I have said, £122 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> Gorta, Ireland's freedom from hunger campaign, will hold its annual World Food Day seminar tomorrow on the theme investing in food security, with a range of participants, including NGOs, academics and the food industry.  Also tomorrow, the Irish aid advisory committee will host a lecture by the director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute on the challenges and opportunities for assuring food security in developing countries.  I am confident that events such as these will contribute to increasing public understanding and awareness of this most important issue.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 October 1997.</P>
