      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to abandon all existing plans for a marina in Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to state when funding will be provided for the construction of the feeder main for the Ballybeg and Ballagh water scheme in County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I got a copy of the statement made by Senator McGowan last night and I have arranged for it to be sent immediately to the chairman and chief executive of An Post. I will convey their reply to the House as soon as I receive it.</P>
      <P>Today's business is Items 1, 2 and 3.  All Stages of Item 1 will be taken as there is only one section in this Bill.  It is to conclude not later than 12 noon, but if more time is needed, it will be provided. Item 2 will start at 12 noon and there will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  Item 3 will be taken at 2 p.m. and Second Stage will be completed. This Bill is in the name of Senators O'Kennedy and Daly.  After Second Stage of that Bill, we will resume the debate on Item 2.  As happened yesterday, there will be a certain flexibility and discussion between the Whips to see if further business can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good that there is flexibility and that small changes can be made during the <Col N="538" /> day.  I subscribe to this because sometimes there is timewasting because of a lack of flexibility.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader tell us what legislation, statements and other business the House will be dealing with from now until the summer recess or end of term?  I will not ask about fisheries statements, but I want to know everything that will happen in the House over the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed, but like Senator Fitzgerald, I would like some answers from the Leader.  Is there any possibility of debating the Geneva Convention Bill, which has been published?  I asked the Leader yesterday and he said some of my concerns could be raised in a debate on the Chemical Weapons Bill.  That Bill applies far less to us than the ratification of the Geneva Convention Bill.  I would like that to be included in the list of legislation to come before the House before it adjourns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have called for a debate on safety in the fishing fleet on a number of occasions.  Yesterday I welcomed the response from the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, to the recent policy blueprint.  If it is possible, we should have a debate or series of statements on that report before the election or summer recess.  Some of the figures it contains are harrowing. For example, 64 per cent of fishing vessels are deficient and 70 per cent of fishermen have no formal training.  This should be addressed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement that Castletownbere is to have a training centre for fishermen but I hope that will not be at the expense of the Greencastle fishing school, which is planning to extend and improve its facilities.  I come from a strong fishing constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement but I call on the Leader for a debate or series of statements on this matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Leader's helpful approach to the statements on An Post last night. It was a pity that Senator Neville was not allowed to contribute, because this was an all-party concern. We should have sufficient flexibility and discretion from the Chair.  I have been in this House a long time and no Opposition has ever behaved as responsibly as this one.  We have not called divisions on the Order of Business and the record will show that no party has behaved better in Opposition and shown such maturity.  A little flexibility should have been shown last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Maloney's call for a debate on fisheries which should include a report on the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  It has been fined £40,000 in the courts for discriminating on religious grounds.  We cannot ignore the fact that this Government is participating in the management of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, a cross-Border <Col N="539" /> organisation which has been found guilty of discrimination.  We should have an open and fair debate covering all aspects of fishery policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my request for a debate on the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  It is time we responded to this report rather than allow it gather dust.  The report is important and detailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health the urgency of the Food Safety Bill, which is due to be introduced. In the next few days we will rush through a number of Bills because of a possible general election.  The value of the Irish pound will give exporters a considerable opportunity, particularly in relation to food.  The Government's decision to set up a Food Safety Council and to introduce a Bill has become more urgent.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to read that the European Commission has given Mrs. Bonino the authority to set up a food and veterinary office and that she has recommended that it be located in Ireland. The link between veterinary medicine and food is a recognition of the importance of what she calls a &ldquo;plough to plate&rdquo; control on food.  We have the opportunity to establish a reputation for the quality of our food and it would be a pity if we delayed the introduction of this legislation. The Food Safety Council was set up on a preliminary basis last October but it is now May and the legislation has not come before the House.</P>
      <P>I was interested to note there was not an immediate call for a discussion on the Constitutional Review Body's report on the Seanad published yesterday.  Like Senator Dardis, one or two Members will suggest that there will be a demand for sex changes if Members are to be reelected. We should ensure the report receives the discussion it deserves.  We have had interesting discussions on the work of the Seanad but this report has come from outside the House.  While it may not be urgent, we should have a debate on it shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryKelly" hpid="Ms Kelly Ms Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Ms Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator Quinn's call for a debate on the role of the Seanad.  In most countries public buildings, particularly Government buildings, are marked by the national flag but that is not the case here.  As we approach the tourism season, this would be an opportune time to mark our public buildings by flying the national flag.  Polling stations should also be similarly marked at election time.  Often our flag is debased because it is flown only in public houses and other dubious institutions.  It is something of which we should be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Without pre-empting any debate the House may have on the all party committee report on the Seanad, I refer to a misinterpretation in some of this morning's newspapers on one of the proposals.  We do not suggest that <Col N="540" /> half the Members of Seanad Éireann should be women.  We suggest that half of those nominated by the nominating subpanels should be women. We cannot tell people involved in direct elections that they must exercise a franchise which will limit their right to freedom of choice.</P>
      <P>Today elections to Westminster will take place elsewhere in this country.  As party spokesman on Northern Ireland, I wish our colleagues in the SDLP every success in their continuing commitment to peace.  I wish all the political representatives in Northern Ireland the same success.  It is important that whatever Government emerges from the general election in Britain will have a sense of urgency to put in place a permanent peace in the event of another ceasefire and be committed to involving all the elements in Ireland, North and South, in discussions.  In my experience, no party is better qualified to make that contribution than the SDLP which, during 30 years of tension and violence, has steered a consistent and non-sectarian course and deserves our congratulations and best wishes.</P>
      <P>Following on from what Senator Sherlock said, yesterday the Disability Federation of Ireland, representing the Irish Wheelchair Association, Cerebral Palsy Ireland, the Centre for Independent Living, the National Association for the Deaf and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, had to take the unprecedented step of arriving outside the Houses of the Oireachtas to protest about their scandalous treatment by an uncaring Government.  I agree with Senator Sherlock that it is time we had a discussion on the commitments given by the Department of Health in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They received a commitment last year for annual funding of £12 million towards the programme for an independent future.  In the first year, the Government reduced that commitment to £3.6 million.  How can any Government justify treating people with such disdain and contempt?  I agree with Senator Sherlock that we should have a full debate soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>When Irish Life was privatised some years ago its management stated that it wanted to be free of the shackles of Government so it could expand.  Since then up to 500 jobs have been lost and we have witnessed several debacles, including the sale of the Mespil flats.  We have also seen the longest lock out of workers since 1913.  However, there appears to be plenty of money for the top cats given the severance payments paid to managers in recent years while at the same time, the workers seek their just demands.  The Minister responsible should contact the management of Irish Life and tell them their treatment of the workers is unacceptable in 1997 as the company made £96 million last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald asked what legislation is expected to be dealt with between now and the end of session.  Apart from the legislation on today's Order Paper, the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1997, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, and the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, a Private Members' Bill, we will also deal with the Finance Bill, 1997, which we will debate next week, the Chemical Weapons Bill, 1997, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, which is just a report from the Dáil, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Bill, 1997, the Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997, the Youth Work Bill, 1997, the Prompt Payments Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Electoral Bill, 1994, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, and the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Bill, 1997.  That is the legislation it is intended to introduce before the House rises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure colleagues we will sit next week and a full week the week after.  As Senator O'Kennedy, our resident expert on the Seanad, knows, the Upper House is ever vigilant, will not be adjourned and will remain in session, even when Deputies in the other House are engaged elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the rub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am serious.  That is the legislation it is proposed to introduce in the House in the coming weeks.  We will sit a full week next week, although we will sit late on Wednesday to allow people to attend the Arbour Hill ceremonies. We will also sit a full week the week after. After that, I am open to consultation.  Senator Fitzgerald also asked about statements on a number of issues.  I will attempt to facilitate him if time can be found.  I have made a number of commitments in that regard which I will try to honour.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry asked about the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  I do not think it is proposed to deal with it in this session.</P>
      <P>Senator Maloney raised the issue of safety in the fishing fleet.  There will be a number of debates dealing with the fishing industry and he has an opportunity then to pursue the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan is correct that the procedure agreed for statements on matters of importance could be made more flexible to allow other Members to take part and I will raise the matter at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Senator has possibly raised the issue of the Foyle Fisheries before on the Adjournment. It is an important issue but also a very specific <Col N="542" /> one which might be amenable to being raised on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock raised the issue of people with disabilities.  The record of this Government is one which can be defended, but on the other hand no Government can probably ever do enough for people with disabilities and I would welcome a short debate on the matter, if possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked an important question. The Food Safety Bill is not at a stage where it can be debated but the point he made is extremely serious and I will convey the text of it to the relevant Minister.  As of now, it is not proposed to publish the Bill within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked about the report of the all-party review group on the Seanad &mdash; I will not call it the O'Kennedy report.  It is important and I have read it.  It takes into account many points made in this House during our lengthy debate on the subject.  It offers a map or charter of what a second House should be doing in the next century. There are details in it I think are slightly daft, but it also has a number of good ideas.  It is worthy of the fullest debate by this House, but I suspect it is not an issue exercising the minds of the electorate at present and will probably have to await the autumn.</P>
    <P>Senator Mary Kelly raised an interesting point about the flying of flags on public buildings.  Perhaps we do not fly the flag on a sufficient number of them.  There is something very fine about the national flag flying on a good public building but something awful about a dirty, soiled and grubby national flag flying outside a hotel or private building.  People frequently fly the flag in a way which brings it into disrepute.</P>
    <P>All parties join in Senator O'Kennedy's tribute to the SDLP.  Over the years it has fought the hard fight, sustained the heat of battle and has some of the finest people we have ever met.  Our good wishes go to them, as they do to all parties which stand for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend asked about the Irish Life dispute.  All parties would like to see a prompt resolution as it has gone on for too long.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not subject Members to the 17 pages of my script and will instead give the briefest outline of what it is about.  This is important but simple legislation which was passed unamended by the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Development Association, IDA for short, is an affiliate of the World Bank. It is one of the bank's main instruments in the <Col N="543" /> fight against extreme poverty.  It was set up in 1960 to assist the poorest countries which cannot afford to borrow money from the World Bank on its normal lending terms.  These countries had an annual <i>per capita</i> income in 1995 of $905 or less. IDA beneficiaries are the people of the world's 79 poorest countries, which have a total population of 3.3 billion.  This is equal to 57 per cent of the world's population.  The IDA is the world's most important source of global multilateral concessional assistance.  Sustainable poverty reduction remains the overarching objective of the association and of development.</P>
    <P>Broad based economic growth, led by the private sector, and environmental sustainability are two key supporting objectives of the IDA.  The association also recognises that development requires growth accompanied by broad based investment in basic health, education and infrastructure.  The critical underpinning requires macro-economic stability accompanied by structural adjustment and the building of civil society.</P>
    <P>The International Development Association fund is replenished every three years.  This Bill provides for the next replenishment, which covers the period June 1996 to June 1999.  The appendix to the Bill outlines the previous replenishments. Donor funds will be supplemented by repayments made by IDA's borrowers in respect of earlier loans and by transfers from the available net income of the World Bank.  The United States is contributing only to years two and three of the eleventh replenishment.  As a result, it has been necessary for the IDA to establish a one year interim fund on an exceptional basis.  The absence of the US contribution for the first year prevented the other donors from agreeing on an adequate and fully burden sharing funding basis for the full three year period.  The fund is therefore divided to provide a facility in year one without the United States and with its full participation for the other two years.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to the eleventh replenishment will amount to £13 million.  This Bill facilitates the State's contribution.  The money goes to the poorest of poor countries.  We have had a traditional interest in those countries through our missionaries and our overseas aid programme.  I can offer more information on the past performance of the fund and so forth and I am willing to answer questions in that regard. However, it would be fairer if I listened to the views of Senators rather than lecture the House for another 20 minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said the International Development Association is an affiliate of the World Bank and is one of the bank's main instruments in the fight against extreme poverty.  With regard to the latter, the World Bank has been a total failure.  Poverty in the poorest countries in the world has not been eliminated or ameliorated by the International <Col N="544" /> Development Association.  Huge amounts of money have been given to Governments and not to people.  The World Bank and the IDA deal with Governments and in many of the poorest countries the money does not filter down to the people.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said annual <i>per capita</i> income in 1995 terms is $905 in these countries. However, in some countries the annual <i>per capita</i> income is not even half that amount.  The people in those countries are not being helped by the International Development Association.  I am glad more money is being provided for NGOs which deal directly with people rather than with Governments.  The poorest countries have the worst Governments in the world.  We must look at how money provided by the Irish Government is spent by the agencies which receive it.  Where is it spent?  Who has benefited?  Has it gone to Governments instead of people?  Unless we carry out such an audit we should not continue to increase our contribution at the rate it has increased in recent years.</P>
      <P>Why has the United States declined to be involved in the first year of replenishment?  That is a disgrace, even if I am critical of how International Development Association money is spent.  What reason has the United States offered for its non-participation in the first year?  The United States is already the largest debtor of the United Nations and has not paid its full contribution for many years.  It offered geopolitical reasons for this and claimed not to favour the previous Secretary-General.  If it favours the current Secretary-General it might start to pay its fair share to the UN.</P>
      <P>The world's poorest countries are getting poorer.  The western world, including Ireland, is not contributing enough at ground level to deal with the problem of poverty in those countries. Poverty in the Third World cannot be compared with poverty in Ireland.  In Ireland poverty is based on comparisons between what some people have and others do not have.  Poor people in Ireland are not in the dire poverty experienced by people in the Third World.  There is no conception in Ireland of the reality of poverty in those countries.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with the trans-global media is that while one can see and hear what is happening, one cannot smell it.  If it were possible to convey smells through television or radio and if people could smell poverty, deprivation and death, a giant step could be taken towards eliminating poverty in the Third World.  Unless one can smell poverty and deprivation at its most dire, one cannot get a true sense of the problem.  Having seen a picture once on television, another picture will not have much impact.  However, if people could smell the odours associated with the picture there might be a chance of eliminating such terrible poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one visits a country where the World Bank operates, one will discover its headquarters in the most sumptuous surroundings.  Its personnel have <Col N="545" /> the best hotels, vehicles and food, even though they are living among people who have nothing. They create a sub-society within those poor countries. They employ people at above average rates and create a second stratum of society.  The same is true of people who work with the United Nations.  They, too, live in the lap of luxury among the poorest people in the world.  Perhaps the United States is making a point by its non-participation. If it was a political decision, it is unacceptable that the United States should not be involved.  If it was not a political decision, what reason was given?</P>
    <P>The United States has an annual <i>per capita</i> income which is almost 100 times the amount of £588 per year quoted by the Minister of State for the world's poorest countries.  Incidentally, I disagree with that estimate.  In some countries of west and east Africa, the annual <i>per capita</i> income is more likely to be $200.  There are atrocious differences in such statistics.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Irish Government's contribution of £13 million to the replenishment.  The money should be placed where it will be best utilised for the benefit of the people of the countries concerned and should not go to Governments and dictators, as happened in the past.  The Minister's contribution and effort are welcome.  One of the bank's main instruments in the fight against extreme poverty has not worked.  It should be better focused in the future to work for the people of the Third World whose poverty we cannot even imagine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an important Bill which has not been amended in the Dáil.  I do not see any reason why it should not pass through this House quickly.  The Bill provides funding for people who live in extreme poverty in poorer countries.  The Minister mentioned that the average annual income <i>per capita</i> in those countries is less than £600.  I visited South Africa and saw people living on far less.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan raised the important point about the fund being administered through the agencies.  The second section of the Bill states that the International Development Association is the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; loan arm of the World Bank.  It provides loans to the world's poorest developing countries on highly concessionary terms.  The IDA is the largest single source of global multilateral concessional assistance, providing aid across most regions and sectors.  IDA obtains its resources principally from periodic replenishments which are, in effect, grants provided by its richer member countries, also known as Part I members, and a small number of its other members.  These funds are supplemented by repayments made by IDA's borrowers in respect of earlier loans and transfers from the available net income of the World Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this, the grants or loans are made directly to countries.  The agencies do not administer <Col N="546" /> the funds.  I agree with Senator Lanigan that much of this money goes to the Governments and is not reaching the people who deserve it.  We are doing our best in providing funds to the poorest people in the world.  It is right that the rich should pay for this.  Where it is possible, we should try to ensure the funds are given to people who need and deserve them.  It seems that the funds go directly to the Government in some countries and, as Senator Lanigan said, those are the worst run Governments in the world.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is right that the people who can afford to pay should do so.  The contribution of £13 million over a three year period is a small amount in our terms.  It is interesting that the Americans are not involved in the first year of this programme and perhaps the Minister can inform us why.  For people who are earning less than £600 per annum, £13 million is a sizeable sum of money.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Lanigan and Senator Burke for their concise contributions and their obvious support of and interest in the principle of this Bill.  Some of the questions raised are answered in my script, but I would like to emphasise some of them.</P>
      <P>I cannot make judgments about the US position. They are far and away the biggest contributors to different types of overseas ventures, both inside and outside the UN.  There is an element of resistance in some sectors of Congress, just as there is a strong isolationist streak in the US generally. Successive administrations, because of the interaction of the American Executive and Congress, have delayed funding indefinitely in pursuit of other budgetary objectives.  Although it sounds shocking in some respects, those who feel strongly about cutting US debt have done so indiscriminately at times, including reducing much of the proposed expenditure in overseas aid.  I do not make any excuse or case for that as it is what has happened.</P>
      <P>It is heartening that the US has made a clear commitment to the second and third year of this programme and also to pay the arrears which have arisen under IDA 10.  There seems to be a cohesive move in the American administration, now it has more confidence in the Secretary General, to bring its arrears to the UN and its agencies up to scratch.  This should be welcomed, although the US position is not defensible in terms of the poverty Senator Lanigan and Senator Burke referred to.  US bashing is not necessarily the best policy.  It tends to react strongly to certain forms of criticism.  We need to use the carrot and stick approach to encourage it to fulfil its responsibilities, which I think is beginning to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point about how this money is spent is well made.  One of the great difficulties for many of the agencies is that they are dealing with intensely corrupt Governments.  It is spelled out clearly in <Col N="547" /> this Bill that Ireland is not satisfied with that.  We need to built partnerships not just with Governments but with agencies in the countries, whether through our NGOs or other organisations.  Those who are not involved in Government need to take possession of many of these programmes.  The combination of foreign advisers and Governments has not worked.  Ireland is in the forefront of making that case.</P>
    <P>Our total overseas contribution this year is £122 million.  I know the Leader of Senator Burke's party undertook some months ago to increase that by £50 million, which would bring the figure from 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of GNP, which is well on the way to the objective of 0.7 per cent. I do not know how the Taoiseach will pay for this but I do not think there will be any disagreement across the House if he can do it.</P>
    <P>IDA aid is the softest type of loan funding imaginable.  It has virtually no interest rate &mdash; only 0.75 per cent per annum as a charge.  It has a ten year moratorium on repayments and a 30 year payback provision.  The loans are deliberately designed to make repayment as easy as possible.  In that sense this is specifically targeted at the poorest countries.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the past failure to direct money to where it was most needed and pointed to the wrong signals being sent out by the over elaboration of buildings and lifestyles associated with some of the UN agencies.  His point was well made.  I can assure Members that the Irish effort, led in many respects by our own President, does get through to the people on the ground through the NGOs and through our long history of a non-colonial and missionary involvement in this area.  Ireland has adopted a position which is out of proportion to our size and ability to pay, but we do play a moderately successful role.  The encouraging support received from Members of the House obviously recognises that.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been to the forefront of getting the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor countries underway as quickly as possible.  The first country which will benefit from this is Uganda. At the spring meeting of the international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and so on, a decision was taken on Uganda.  That decision will have an effect on Uganda's debt service of a reduction in its multilateral and bilateral debt of 20 per cent, which is equivalent to $700 million.  That will come into play within a year. Ireland pressed to have the initiative brought into play immediately but there was some opposition to that and a compromise was reached.  Other countries, primarily though not exclusively in Africa, are also on the list of countries which will benefit from this initiative.</P>
    <P>The story is not all bad.  With the strong commitment of countries such as Ireland, Canada and others to the Third World, progress is being made on this issue.  However, that progress is too slow and it may be too late for some countries.  We cannot afford to become complacent about that. <Col N="548" /> In so far as this side of our overall effort must be facilitated through the Houses of the Oireachtas in order that Ireland can begin to pay the money, I am very grateful for the support of Members in both Houses and I thank the Senators.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the debt repayments to Uganda and referred to the $700 million moratorium which has been given.  The Ugandan people are not going to benefit one whit from that debt reduction.  It will only mean that the Government will be able to reduce the amount of money it owes.  The Ugandan authorities will be able to write off $700 million of moneys which they have received from the international community and which they have misused. These moneys have not been used for the benefit of the Ugandan people.  Writing off debts to corrupt Governments is not, in my view, the way forward.  Unless the Ugandan people benefit from this debt reduction, there is no point whatsoever to it.</P>

      <P>I do not have any in-depth knowledge of the current Government in Uganda other than what I have read about the difficulty and chaos there.  One could, however, have an expectation that democracy will begin to flourish in the future and that people will ultimately take power and run a good Government.  At least a better Government at that point would not be saddled with the debt of its forbears and would be in a position to invest whatever money it can borrow or generate in infrastructural and educational projects and so on.  We would all desire that.  This is a very difficult dilemma.  On the one hand, if one keeps the adding to the burden of debt, the prospect of any kind of democracy emerging from such a situation is very remote. On the other hand, people can be encouraged and can raise their heads in the hope of ultimately having a better Government which will not be burdened by debt to the same extent.  That is a positive scenario for the future even it is not achievable now.  It is ironic that many of the funds which have now been overlooked were totally misused by corrupt Governments.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to present to the House the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, a measure that will help strengthen our capacity to tackle one of the most serious social challenges of our time.  The Bill's primary purpose is to provide for a range of measures to help local authorities in addressing problems arising on their housing estates from drug dealing and related serious anti-social behaviour.  The Bill forms part of a wider range of measures which are being undertaken by the Government to deal with the issue of drugs and related crime.</P>
      <P>Before I elaborate on the specific measures in the Bill I wish to outline the background and context within which these measures are being brought forward.  Every Member of the House is aware that the illegal drugs trade has damaged, even destroyed, many young lives and threatened the peace and stability of whole communities. The Government's approach to the problem is multifaceted.  A package of tough and effective legislation is in place to expose and deal with those who traffic in illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>The ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs recommended a range of measures in areas of treatment, education and rehabilitation and estate improvements. These recommendations were accepted fully by the Government and £14 million was allocated to carry out a programme which is based in the communities that are most severely affected. To tackle the drug problem effectively we need to rebuild communities, improve them in terms of the physical and social infrastructure and revitalise them economically.  To succeed we need to create a new dynamic and trust between statutory agencies and local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly stressed to local authorities the importance of good estate management.  Tenant participation is part and parcel of estate management, as is the importance of an integrated approach, drawing all interested bodies into the process.  Considerable progress is being made in this regard and will continue to be made.  The Bill must be seen as one element in a wider strategy which is aimed at building communities and making them safe from drugs.  There is, I believe, broad agreement in the House that the extent to which the residents of many local authority estates have suffered at the hands of drug dealers, <Col N="550" /> and those working with and for them, is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There is also, I believe, broad support for the main purpose of the Bill, which is to provide local authorities with improved legal powers to help them deal with drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour in their estates.  The Bill will assist local authorities to discharge their estate management function in a positive manner so that all local authority tenants may reasonably aspire to live in an estate that is free from drug dealing and associated violence.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the serious threat that drug dealing poses to individuals and to society.  In areas where drug dealing gets a foothold, everyone is a potential victim.  There is reason to believe that many major heroin dealers began their evil careers in local authority housing estates and that much of their nefarious activities are centred there.  A Dublin Corporation report put the matter very well when it stated:</P>
    <P>The victims of anti-social behaviour (including drugs-related activities) and their families endure enormous distress and are unable to enjoy peaceful occupation of their dwellings.</P>
    <P>We must make it clear that the Government and the statutory agencies will no longer tolerate publicly funded housing being used as a base for drug pushing and related anti-social activity.  We must ensure that a new generation of barons do not have local authority housing as a nursery unit in which to develop their ugly trade.  We must ensure that those who are enriching themselves by bringing misery, distress and violence on their neighbours can no longer be allowed to undermine and destroy their communities.  There is a duty on us as legislators to ensure that communities are no longer exposed to the menace of drug dealing by any deficiencies or constraints in the law.</P>
    <P>Constraints and deficiencies have been identified through practical experience.  Regrettably, the existing statutory response has come to be seen as ineffectual in the face of an increasing drug problem and, in recent times, some communities have sought to impose their own remedies. Particular issues of concern include: unsuitability of existing approaches in certain situations, for example, where the existing sanction of eviction may be too blunt and sweeping an instrument; lack of effective immediate action against squatting by persons engaged in anti-social activities; difficulties with the exchange of information between relevant authorities; slow procedures, for example, delays in service of summonses, and intimidation and risks to witnesses.  The Bill seeks to rectify these deficiencies through a combination of increased powers, more targeted measures and more streamlined and effective procedures.</P>
    <P>In preparing this legislation I have taken into account the experience of local authorities in their attempts to deal with anti-social behaviour <Col N="551" /> in their estates.  I met elected members of Dublin Corporation who represent many of the worst affected areas.  They were emphatic about the need for urgent and effective measures.  I or my officials also met representatives of other interests, including the voluntary housing sector. I have had the benefit of widely divergent views ranging, on the one hand, from unfounded fears about the possible impact of the Bill to, on the other, a concern that measures in the Bill do not go far enough.  There has been extensive discussion of the measures in the Bill in the Oireachtas and beyond.  I have given full and detailed consideration to the many views expressed.  I was particularly pleased to be able to respond positively by way of amendments on Committee Stage in the other House to requests from the Irish Council for Social Housing to extend certain provisions of the Bill, notably the excluding order procedure, to housing provided by approved voluntary housing organisations.  I was also pleased to be able to extend the provision preventing payments by squatters, etc., from creating tenancy rights to rented housing generally including lettings in the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The definitions of anti-social behaviour and estate management in section 1 are of particular significance and are central to the purposes of the Bill.  They form the basis for the application of various powers under the Bill including excluding orders, vetting of tenancy applications and social welfare assistance.  I have made every effort to frame these definitions as tightly as possible. Anti-social behaviour has been carefully defined with particular reference to drug dealing and related serious violence or threats of violence to individuals.  I emphasise that possession of illegal drugs solely for personal use does not come within this definition, nor does vandalism or damage to property unless the damage was being used to intimidate or threaten.</P>
    <P>There are two elements in the definition.  This is essential because the measures in the Bill are designed to deal both with anti-social behaviour related to drug dealing and the serious violence and intimidation that is associated with drug dealing, both of which are in themselves offences under the criminal code.  The activities included in the definition are very serious in nature and their effect must be to cause significant or persistent danger, injury, damage, etc., to persons rather than to property.  Imprecise or potentially less serious concepts such as &ldquo;nuisance&rdquo; have been avoided in framing the definition.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;estate management&rdquo; is defined as including the securing or promotion of the interests of tenants and other occupiers, whether individually or generally, in the enjoyment of their local authority houses and the avoidance, prevention or abatement of anti-social behaviour in that context.  The term &ldquo;good estate management&rdquo; is a long standing concept in common law and in the landlord and tenant code, but it has <Col N="552" /> not been defined in statute.  The concept is being given specific statutory recognition in this Bill in a very positive way so that housing authorities can actively promote the interests of their tenants and work towards the avoidance, prevention or abatement of anti-social behaviour.  The concept of good estate management is currently used by housing authorities as a reason for seeking repossession of dwellings where anti-social behaviour is involved.</P>
    <P>Section 2 will help to reduce delays and difficulties which have been experienced in the serving of summonses in housing cases.  This section provides that a summons may be served by ordinary post without first having to attempt service by registered post or any other method.  The section also provides for summonses to be issued by a District Court clerk instead of having to be signed by a judge, a procedure that already applies in criminal cases.  The wording of the section is in line with recently made rules of court in relation to the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The single most important measure in this Bill is probably the introduction of a new excluding order procedure.  The relevant provisions are contained in sections 2 to 12.  A local authority tenant will have the right to apply to the District Court for an excluding order against a member of his or her household who is engaged in anti-social behaviour.  A housing authority will have power to seek an excluding order where it believes that the tenant would be intimidated from doing so. Excluding order proceedings can only be taken by housing authorities after consultation with the tenant and the local health board.</P>
    <P>The excluding order procedure will allow a more targeted response than is currently available to local authorities.  Up to now the only action a local authority could take in cases of serious anti-social behaviour was to seek to have the entire household evicted with both innocent and guilty subjected to the same legal sanction. The new procedure is intended to meet a situation where only one or some of the members of a household are engaged in serious anti-social behaviour.  It also recognises the reality that there are instances where not only does the tenant not have effective control or influence over an individual in the household but that the tenant and the rest of the household may be intimidated by that individual.  Hence the provision for local authority intervention where a tenant is too fearful to take proceedings themselves.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the court will have power to exclude a person engaged in anti-social behaviour from any specified house or housing estate and to prohibit intimidation or other interference with a tenant or other occupant of the house.  Under section 4 the court may make interim excluding orders where there is immediate risk of significant harm to a tenant or other occupant.  The court will also be empowered to hear excluding order cases <i>in camera.</i>  There are a number of important safeguards such as provision for appeal and for variation and discharge of orders where <Col N="553" /> appropriate.  I believe this new procedure will make a major contribution to the fight against anti-social behaviour in local authority housing by providing a means to target the perpetrators, to protect the victims and to leave the innocent in their homes.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends the application of the excluding order procedure in sections 3 to 12 to houses provided by voluntary housing bodies.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 local authorities will be empowered on grounds of anti-social behaviour to refuse to let a dwelling or to sell a dwelling to a tenant under a purchase scheme.  Consent to the resale of tenant purchase dwellings may also be refused on these grounds.  This will provide valuable legal backing to the efforts of housing authorities to prevent known drug dealers from moving into their estates.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for exchange of information between relevant agencies, namely, housing authorities, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Síochána, the Department of Social Welfare, health boards and voluntary housing bodies. This provision is designed to overcome the sort of difficulties experienced by different statutory agencies acting without access to relevant information which is available to another statutory agency.  It is incomprehensible to local residents that one or more State agencies would be aware that an individual was a drug dealer, yet another agency would be totally unaware of the fact.  The exchange of information in this area is essential for the operation of various measures under the Bill, such as the excluding order procedure, vetting of applicants for housing, tenant purchase or for supplementary welfare assistance towards rents of private accommodation.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides discretion for health boards to refuse or withdraw supplementary welfare assistance rent or mortgage interest supplementation for private housing in the case of persons evicted, excluded or removed from, or refused housing on grounds of anti-social behaviour. In line with the extension of the excluding order procedure to voluntary housing, the discretion to refuse or withdraw supplementation will also apply where persons have been evicted or excluded from a house provided by a voluntary housing body.  Health boards must have regard to any information provided to them in relation to such persons by housing authorities or other specified bodies.  There has been severe criticism of the fact that, on occasion, drug pushers evicted from local authority housing have, with the help of supplementary welfare assistance rent allowance from the health board, been rehoused in private accommodation in the same area and from where they have continued their illicit activities.  Health boards argue that they simply had no option but to provide SWA rent assistance in these cases.  However, in future the health boards will have discretion for the first time to refuse to fund private accommodation in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> Section 17 amends the Social Welfare Acts to allow, in certain circumstances, for deduction of local authority rents at source from social welfare incomes.  This will allow for timely pro-active intervention where rent arrears are building up. The Minister for Social Welfare will have power, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, to make regulations providing for mandatory deduction of local authority rents from social welfare payments where rent is unpaid for a certain period or arrears exceed a certain level.  This is an important and practical measure to minimise the need for eviction proceedings in order to obtain payment of rents and will, I believe, greatly reduce the need for local authorities to have to threaten or actually go to court for repossession in rent arrears cases.</P>
    <P>Section 18 prohibits intimidation of or other interference with staff of a housing authority or a health board or members of their family or witnesses in proceedings under this Bill or in eviction proceedings.  This is an important provision designed to address the sort of real difficulties which have been encountered by local authorities and tenants.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that any payment made to a housing authority or other person acting in the capacity of a landlord by a squatter or a former tenant who has been given notice to quit but still remains in occupation of a dwelling will not create any tenancy rights in the dwelling.  This is to remove a possible loophole whereby such persons might claim rights on the basis of such payments. The original provision in the Bill was amended to extend it from local authority housing to rented housing in general.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides a new power for the Garda, on notification by the housing authority, to direct people squatting in local authority accommodation and engaged in anti-social activity to leave the accommodation.  Non-compliance will be an offence and gardaí will have powers of search and arrest without warrant.  This is separate from and does not affect the due process of normal repossession procedures under section 62 of the Housing Act, 1966, which are excessively lengthy to deal effectively with squatting where drug dealing is involved.</P>
    <P>Existing legal powers have been found ineffective against recurrent squatting which is associated with drug distribution, drug parties and in some instances serious intimidation of new tenants.  The new powers are designed to provide a direct and effective means of addressing this serious problem.  They do not apply to cases of squatting where no anti-social behaviour is involved.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is designed to help address the question of obtaining evidence of anti-social behaviour where witnesses are in fear of serious injury or worse.  It provides for acceptance by courts of statements by gardaí and housing authority or health board officials as evidence of anti-social behaviour in proceedings for repossession or excluding orders where the court is satisfied that <Col N="555" /> there are reasonable grounds for this and that other possible witnesses would be prevented from giving evidence due to intimidation.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is unrelated to the other provisions of the Bill.  It is a technical amendment to put beyond doubt the fact that a housing authority's general power under section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, to repossess in the event of default on a loan applies to certain loans made prior to 1986 under section 5(2) of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 23 contains a minor amendment of section 3 of the Housing Act, 1966, to provide that documents such as notices and orders under the Housing Acts may be served by ordinary post where a registered letter is returned undelivered.</P>
    <P>The measures being made available in this Bill apply only in serious circumstances and will be used sparingly, but where necessary.  We must always remember that local authorities are in the business of providing housing not, except where there is no other course open to them, of evicting people.  Indeed, local authorities have in the past been severely criticised for the length of time it takes to secure action against even the most blatant and serious cases of anti-social behaviour.  I do not accept that local authorities will use their powers in an arbitrary or cavalier manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, just one part of a broad ranging overall response by Government to the problem of drugs and anti-social behaviour.  That broader response involves measures to tackle both the supply and demand aspects of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The government has put in place a package of measures to tackle the supply side &mdash; drug dealing &mdash; and the serious criminal activity that it spawns. Equally significant are initiatives to reduce the demand for drugs.  These are being pursued in the context of recommendations by the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs.  New structures have been established at national and local levels to ensure an effective response to drug abuse in society.  The report of the task force, of which I am a member, put forward a comprehensive, co-ordinated package of measures comprising treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.  The Government approved our recommendations and allocated £14 million for their implementation.  Arising from these recommendations, I have introduced an estate improvement programme which aims to assist in tackling environmental and related problems in severely run-down local authority housing estates and flat complexes in certain disadvantaged urban areas thereby enhancing the living environment for tenants and improving estate management.  The £3 million Exchequer funding being made available for this programme over the period 1997-98 will be at least matched by authorities from their own resources.  Work to the value of more than £6 million will, therefore, be carried out under the programme and will have a significant beneficial effect on the areas in question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> I again emphasise that this Bill is not the total response of the Government or local authorities to drug dealing and anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates.  Since taking office as Minister of State responsible for housing and urban renewal, one of my main objectives has been to encourage and assist local authorities to improve their overall estate management not just in terms of dealing with problems but also in terms of raising standards and involving tenants positively in the management of their housing estates.  To support local authorities in this respect I have introduced a number of initiatives including a housing management grants scheme and the setting up of a housing management group to promote best practice in housing management. Authorities are also being assisted to undertake a programme of training and development for their tenants.</P>
    <P>The Housing Management Group has prepared best practice guidelines in housing management and workshops are currently being held for local authority officials.  The guidelines are aimed at promoting new approaches to the delivery of housing services which place the emphasis on service quality and customer satisfaction.  This is very much in line with the thrust of the recent policy document on the future of local government, <i>A Programme for Change.</i></P>
    <P>The officials who attended the workshops are broadly supportive of the approach being adopted in the guidelines and are committed to their implementation.  However, this commitment must be matched by practical support at the highest levels to ensure that they are effective.  For this reason, I arranged a seminar earlier this week for county and city managers to discuss housing management issues and to ensure their support for the measures now being developed in this area.  I also stressed to the managers the need to adopt a co-ordinated approach to estate management which involves tenants, other statutory agencies, including the gardaí, and community and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I see improved housing estate management as a crucial step forward which will pay substantial dividends not just as fire brigade action now but more importantly in helping to prevent the same scale of problems emerging in the future.  Local authorities deserve credit for the extent to which they have developed their estate management role over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I have tried to provide a reasonably full account of this Bill and the background to it.  As I indicated, it is only part of our response to a serious, complex and multi-layered issue, but it is an important and positive part of that response.  I am pleased, therefore, to commend the Bill to the House and look forward to strong support for it and the objectives which it seeks to attain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this timely Bill.  I am glad she organised a seminar for city and county managers with members of her staff.  Perhaps she should also <Col N="557" /> invite the housing officers who are directly involved in this matter.  While managers are in overall control of a local authority area, housing officers work closely with tenants and may have more in common with them than a local authority manager would have.  The housing officers should have a seminar of their own as this is an important part of the operational programme she envisages.</P>
      <P>I am glad that someone is finally tackling the problem of drugs in housing estates because it puts the lives of other tenants at risk.  Powers will now be invested in local authorities to evict those involved.  However, if a local authority tenant is evicted, it would be easy for him to rent a house in the private sector.  We should compile a dossier on such tenants.  Private landlords should be compelled not to rent a house to people evicted from local authority property, otherwise all we are doing is moving the problem from one part of the community to another.  If a person runs up a bad debt in one bank and tries to get money from another, the second bank can look up his record. We should implement a similar system.</P>
      <P>I would hate to see drug barons rooted out from areas of large population only to move across the country.  There is a drugs problem everywhere.  It used to be a problem in cities only and not in rural areas but now it is in all parts of society.  My fear is that drug barons will lift their tents and move to rural areas, perhaps to cash in on the tourism trade and interfere with other parts of the community who have built up their businesses over many years.</P>
      <P>Stiffer penalties must be imposed.  If a tenant is evicted there is a possibility of intimidation.  I compliment the gardaí on their work in the Veronica Guerin murder case.  She highlighted this problem.  They have arrested about 135 people in connection with that crime.  There is a great deal of intimidation, especially by drug barons.</P>
      <P>Some days ago, a 14 year old boy boasted that he was making £1,600 per week from drug trafficking on his estate.  This must be tackled, but where do we start?  We must bring information into schools and I am glad the Vintners' Federation of Ireland has taken this on board.  If all sections of the community tackle the problem we will be able to resolve it.  We may not eliminate it but we will contain and control it.  I compliment the young people who are distributing anti-drug badges.  We must train teachers along these lines.</P>
      <P>Years ago we heard about drugs in other countries and thought they would never reach our shores but we are now a hub for drug trafficking. I commend the gardaí, the Revenue Commissioners and Customs officers for detecting at source large quantities of drugs entering the country.  It used to be the norm that only the wealthy in high society used drugs but when that market dried up the drug tycoons moved into housing estates and targeted the needy sections of our community.  Naturally, they were vulnerable to that.  I am glad this will be taken on board and that an attempt will be made to end it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> People against whom exclusion orders are made should be labelled for many years.  They should not be able to get houses in other counties where they could set up business.  That must be carefully monitored.</P>
    <P>My local authority organised many schemes over the years where prizes were given to people who kept their housing estates tidy.  Housing estates became very competitive about keeping their areas looking well.  Such schemes should be promoted in order to make housing estates nicer.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to the local authority 18 or 19 years ago a person would have to be on a housing list for four or five years before they got a house.  Thankfully, the list is much shorter now.  However, when people apply for a house now it is as if they are buying a car in that they want to pick out the type of house they want. People should be made aware that taxpayers pay for these houses.  Some local authority tenants run up massive rent arrears while receiving supplementary welfare allowances.  They say they cannot pay their £8 or £10 rent for a house provided by the State; but they have satellite dishes costing between £400 and £600 on their houses and they also pay £400 for the MMDS service. They will not even paint their houses.</P>
    <P>Community groups in housing estates should be promoted.  I welcome the seminar for county and city managers to which the Minister of State referred.  Housing staff officers should also be included in that seminar because they communicate with those groups on the ground.</P>
    <P>Drugs are found not only in local authority housing estates but are everywhere, including the houses of the wealthiest people, although parents might not know what their children are doing. Programmes on drug awareness should be enhanced and funded.</P>
    <P>I have pity for some drug users.  However, I do not have much compassion for many of them because after a while they ignore the helping hand which is offered to them.  They go on methadone programmes which they want to be able to get on demand in clinics resembling little supermarkets. Restrictions must be implemented on such programmes.  Being high on drugs should not be allowed as a defence in court.  That makes a mockery of good citizens who try their best and local authority tenants who try to keep their houses in proper order.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State would be proud to go into many housing estates in her constituency which are 20 or 25 years old.  Those estates are neatly kept and the tenants are proud of their homes.  I am delighted to see the tenant purchase scheme being put in place.  Such schemes must be enhanced.  People have more pride in their homes when they own them rather than being local authority tenants.  Some tenants do not bother to paint their houses and say they will get new windows when the old ones fall out.  They then demand mahogany or aluminium windows.  If the tenant purchase scheme could be made more attractive and if more tenants bought their homes, a sense <Col N="559" /> of pride would return to those estates and transform them overnight.  The older housing estates are all kept very well, with neatly decorated houses and mown lawns.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said &ldquo;We must ensure that a new generation of barons do not have local authority housing as a nursery unit in which to develop their ugly trade&rdquo;.  How does she intend to implement that?  How can people against whom exclusion orders have not yet been made be vetted? This point might apply more to rural local authorities than those in Dublin, but when my local authority discussed the housing list we knew most of the people on the list.  We knew their families, their parents, from where they came&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many of them did not vote for us.  Once they got what they were looking for, they voted whatever way they wanted, although they might pretend they were voting for us.</P>
      <P>Local representatives contributed a great deal in that regard but it is now a managerial function. A great deal of consideration should be given to the views of local representatives because they know more about tenants than housing engineers or staff officers do.  They know the background of these people and their needs.  It should be emphasised to the county managers at the seminar that they should take more notice of the views of local representatives in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have discovered in my years as a local representative that when houses are allocated in a particular town or village the local people like them to be given to people from the surrounding area.  In that way they can control their communities themselves.  It would be wrong to bring outsiders into the local authority system.  That must be monitored.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that communities have sought to impose their own remedies for the problem. People should not take the law into their own hands.  This legislation will help local authorities to tackle the problems.  Some people hold the gun in one hand and the ballot box in the other and think they are the only people who can get drugs out of an area.  God only knows what they are doing to make money for their own needs.</P>
      <P>Estate management is the core issue and exclusion orders will be vital to its success.  These may be granted against specific members of a household, whether male or female, who may be misbehaving and involved in drug dealing.  What mechanisms will be used to exclude them, especially in cases where the person is married and may have visiting rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare provisions in the Bill are welcome.  Many people who have satellite dishes and other consumer goods in their homes approach public representatives on the basis that they are unable to pay their rent.  This may arise because of drug related, drink, gambling and other problems.  It is difficult to see a woman with <Col N="560" /> children trying her best to survive while the provider, usually a male, squanders the income received from social welfare.  In such circumstances she is often obliged to seek supplementary welfare allowances.  While the Bill provides that local authorities may deduct rent from income squandered in this way, it is a delicate area that must be monitored carefully.  How is it proposed to implement these provisions?  It is my experience from involvement in local authorities that those seeking supplementary welfare benefits to try and pay the rent will not receive them because they are generally only provided for necessities such as food.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that local authorities may threaten court action to those in arrears.  The ensuing local publicity would be a cause of acute embarrassment.  In this regard local authorities take a compassionate view if a sincere attempt is made to pay back arrears, even by small amounts. They are always willing to discuss matters with tenants in difficulties and this practice should minimise the necessity to threaten court action.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Garda are to be given more powers, including searching without warrant.  These will not apply to cases involving squatters and where there is no antisocial behaviour. When a local authority house in my own County Kerry becomes available squatters often move in with their belongings, which can include donkeys and horses.</P>

      <P>The problem is prevalent in other parts of the country, including, Sir, in your own constituency.  The Bill was drafted in response to drug related operations, where housing estates are used as market places.  While I welcome it, I would have preferred to see the exclusion orders against individuals extended to the private sector, otherwise the problem will be shifted to the private estates.  Landlords should be entitled to ascertain if exclusion orders were issued against prospective tenants.  Those who have been issued with them should not be rehoused.  It would make drug barons think again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  To take up a phrase that the Minister of State's party used over the weekend, it will &ldquo;make a difference&rdquo; to many local authority housing estates and local authorities whose hands have been tied because of the bureaucratic arrangements set in train by a range of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Housing Act, 1966, Ireland, and especially urban Ireland, is a fundamentally different place today than it was then.  Everybody is aware of the huge problems in local authority estates.  They relate to massive unemployment and drug related, environmental and demographic problems.  The Bill will make a difference to thousands of local authority tenants and to the <Col N="561" /> managers who have the responsibility to house them and ensure best practice.</P>
    <P>The ESRI report yesterday depicted a booming economy that is the pride of Europe.  However, a minority of people are excluded from it.  Large numbers of them are clustered in urban ghettos to the west and south-west of Dublin and in other cities and large towns.  The Bill puts their interests at the centre of Government.  I hope the legislation will be operable as soon as possible and that it will make a difference to those who are excluded from the lifestyles we enjoy.  It is right that this House and the other House are brought face to face with the situations facing people in those communities, because they suffer massive deprivation, which is regularly seen in the low turnouts at elections.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde and I are members of South Dublin County Council.  At regular housing committee meetings we are told of the appalling condition of the housing stock in some instances and the appalling level of intimidation that people, mostly women, must suffer.  There is an astonishingly high number of single parent families in these estates and women are being intimidated by thugs involved in drug dealing.  I spoke to a member of the religious community in west Tallaght recently and she said that she is frightened working in that community for the first time in 18 years.  She pointed out the level of firearms that exists in these estates.  These arms are readily available and in many cases the gardaí do not want to know and will not respond adequately to the problems in these estates.  I do not say that emotionally, but as a matter of fact.  We are cutting these estates off from the rest of society and failing to address their concerns.  However, I am confident that this legislation will deal with the real issues about which these people are concerned. People come to see me every week and describe the tension and fear on these housing estates.  Young Idi Amins of 13 and 14 years of age are intimidating people and feel they have a right to physically abuse people and take others' property.</P>
    <P>There is a sense of hopelessness and anger in these communities that I hope to articulate in speaking on this Bill.  That sense of anger should be heard in the Seanad and the Dáil.  I commend the Minister of State on this Bill.  The backdrop to the legislation is a wholly changed housing environment with which we are only now beginning to deal.</P>
    <P>A key concept in the Bill is that of estate management. It is vitally important that communities are involved with local authority managers and the Department of the Environment in devising a system whereby central funding and local authority moneys are used in the most effective manner. I am glad that south County Dublin is developing a number of strategies to deal with estate management, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the power to exclude specific people who are causing trouble in housing estates.  We <Col N="562" /> are not tarring entire families under the exclusion section, but we are selection those who are causing problems in these estates.  These people can now be excluded from estates as it is no longer our responsibility to house them.  If they have huge incomes from drugs and they are intimidating other local authority tenants, the State should abdicate its responsibility to look after them.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for the provision in this legislation that deals with supplementary welfare assistance.  Many of my constituents are concerned about the renting of private accommodation, as there is no discussion between the gardaí, local authorities and the health boards about certain people who move from local authority housing estates, get supplementary welfare assistance from the Eastern Health Board for private rented accommodation and cause worse problems in those estates.  The Minister of State has included an important section in the Bill that deals with this.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister wants this legislation enacted speedily and we on this side of the House will support it in any way we can.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing in this legislation.  As she said, it is multifaceted.</P>
      <P>I wear three hats in relation to this problem.  I approach it as a member of South Dublin County Council, as a guidance counsellor who works in a disadvantaged area and as a Senator.  The Minister of State is taking a huge problem on board and estate management is the key to it.  We need to clear out these areas and build new environments that will create new communities and build up trust.  That is the kernel of the matter.</P>
      <P>Education is not sufficiently emphasised in this Bill.  It has a huge role because most of these communities have no leaders.  There is 80 to 90 per cent unemployment and many people come from dysfunctional backgrounds, so there are no value systems.  There are no-go areas where home-school links cannot be created.  There are no junior liaison officers to deal with problems and teachers will not move into these areas because of the fear in these estates.  Schools have a huge role in solving this problem.  There is an infrastructure in areas like mine, where we work with the JLOs, home-school links, remedial teachers and guidance councillors.  They are moving into these areas to rehabilitate young people and build up families.  We must have estate management by the local authority and I am delighted to see the increased powers of the local authorities and the gardaí in this regard.  There should be leaders in these communities, but some of them have gone beyond the point of redemption.  They may have to be evicted so that new families can move in.</P>
      <P>This is a huge task that will not be completed today or tomorrow but the Minister of State might make more use of the educational input in each area.  I compliment the Minister of State as this legislation will help if we all work together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this welcome Bill.  I have always supported the idea of adopting a co-ordinated approach to activities on the River Shannon. The River Shannon must be looked at in the context of drainage and as a tourism amenity.  As a member of a local authority for 17 years, I am aware of the input each local authority has made and of the importance of the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>It is important there is a co-ordinated approach to deal with activities on the River Shannon.  In recent years local authorities have adopted a co-ordinated approach when dealing with EU funding for town sewerage systems.  The improvements which continue to be made in that regard are welcome.  Improvements in drainage in Longford town, Ballymahon and Granard show how important it is for all local authorities to adopt a co-ordinated approach to the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>From a tourism point of view, it goes without saying that the Shannon is recognised across Europe and elsewhere as an important cruising amenity.  The number of cruise boats arriving in places like Lanesborough, Cloodara and Termonbarry, has increased, and such traffic is important to the local economy in these areas.  The River Shannon is an important amenity with considerable tourism potential and it also helps to drain surrounding areas.  It is not easy to co-ordinate all the aspects of activity because at times there can be conflicts of interest.  That is the reason a co-ordinated approach is important.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>As has been said by Senator Belton, the proposers of the Bill and other speakers, this is common sense legislation.  One may wonder why such legislation has not been introduced before, given what Members have said. The interaction and lack of interaction between local authorities and those who should look after the development of the Shannon has been a revelation to me.  The two Senators who brought the Bill to the House deserve our sincere thanks and congratulations.  I thank the Leader of the House, <Col N="564" /> the Government and the Minister for accepting the Bill and for providing Government time to debate it.</P>
      <P>The River Shannon is the main artery to the centre of the country and has been underutilised for years.  One can travel on the River Shannon to Northern Ireland and to Dublin along the canals, on which the Office of Public Works has carried out considerable work in recent years. The River Shannon has been a great source of pleasure to many people.  Many Members spend their weekends on the Shannon.  Recently I discovered that some Senators have bought boats and like to traverse the river occasionally.</P>
      <P>The stretch of water from the mouth of the River Shannon to Limerick is probably underdeveloped in terms of industry.  It is, however, utilised by cargo ships travelling to Foynes and Limerick with oil and other necessities.  It is hardly necessary to outline the need to protect the River Shannon.  Senator O'Kennedy spoke of his younger days spent on the banks of the Shannon with his father and how there was no problem taking water from the river to boil for tea or to drink.  That is now changed as there is a vast amount of pollution in the Shannon.  This is understandable in a developing country; the use of fertilisers and the development of bogs has resulted in such pollution.</P>
      <P>This Bill attempts to resolve the problems of the Shannon.  It amazed me to learn that a substantial amount of pumping equipment at the river lies disused and is the subject of disagreement between local authorities.  This Bill sets out to encompass all the authorities adjacent to the Shannon and bring them together with State bodies and the Government to resolve the problems of the river.  It is wrong that local authorities do not always perform their functions, but perhaps that is as a result of a lack of legislation.  Perhaps successive Governments have not performed their functions.  With this Bill we can expect major changes in the supervision of the Shannon river over the next few years.  It is a pity the main artery to the heart of Ireland was not treated in the past with the respect it deserved.  I saw a short film from the Central Fisheries Board called &ldquo;While Fishes Watch&rdquo;.  The idea behind it was that there is life in rivers as long as there are fish in them.  If they die, we are next, because we cannot live without clean water.  The pollution in the Shannon is considerable.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill and I thank and congratulate Senators O'Kennedy and Daly for bringing the Bill before the House.  I also thank the Government, the Minister and the Leader of the House for accepting the Bill.  I ask that it proceed quickly to Committee and Final Stages.  It might be drafted by two great men but they may have overlooked some aspects which require amendment on Committee Stage, which would be acceptable.  I ask for sufficient time to be given to complete the passage of the Bill.  It is a good one which I recommend to the House.</P>

      <P>Listening to the compliments paid to Senators O'Kennedy and Daly reminded me of the Ceann Comhairle's response to the worthy tributes paid to him last week, that he had to kick himself to see if he were still alive.  That does not diminish our admiration for anyone, especially in Opposition, who takes the initiative to introduce legislation.  Irrespective of whether it is plain or complex, there is a skill in crafting it. The Minister would be the first to admit that he must rely on the expertise of his officials.  In praising Senators O'Kennedy and Daly, I am sure they in turn have acknowledged and shown appreciation to all those who helped them, from the parliamentary draftsman's office to the various organisations they referred to in their Second Stage speeches.</P>
      <P>I welcome this initiative as someone who lives at the tip of the inverted triangle of Lough Allen, which it is sometimes forgotten is the first lake on the Shannon.  I am pleased this Bill has come before the House for discussion and I naturally enthusiastically support its broad thrust.  I appreciate one must progress slowly in these areas, especially when something new is created. If and when this authority is set up, I would like to see it progressively adopting more functions of existing statutory bodies.  We along the Shannon are plagued by statutory bodies, such as the ESB and the Office of Public Works.  The Department of the Environment and local authorities become involved where environmental matters are concerned. The Department of the Marine is also involved.  There is an unnecessarily large number of statutory bodies responsible for different aspects of the Shannon and their functions overlap. I suggest we have lost the focus at the centre of this Bill: the development of the river and its hinterland and the improvement of its water quality by the elimination of pollution.</P>
      <P>I read recently, and agree with the economist who proposed the theory, that the environment is the most important issue facing us as we approach the new millennium.  It is the issue which concentrates the minds of young people more than any other political activity.  Young boys and girls who have only been at school for a year are aware of the world around them.  It is a credit to our teaching profession that they concentrate at an early stage and follow up at the later stage of education on creating an awareness and an appreciation of the environment.  I have young children of five and six years old who, when they come home from school, tell me about going on nature trails and identifying plants and trees.  Their paintings and drawings relate to the world around them and not to the latest pop stars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as legislators have failed to concentrate our undoubted energies towards improving our environment. We have come late to it.  It reminds me of a documentary about the Third World which was shown several years ago and which claimed we were five minutes away from midnight with regard to helping that world.  I believe we are five minutes away from midnight with regard to our <Col N="566" /> environment.  Unless we do something practical this country, which enjoys a green image, will be overwhelmed.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish and irresponsible not to welcome industrial development, improved infrastructure and the subsequent enhancement of people's quality of life.  However, if our environment is to be damaged as a result, whither progress? We must find a balance and it is the responsibility of the Government and legislators to frame legislation that will achieve that balance.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a genuine and welcome attempt to seek that balance in the Shannon catchment area. It follows initiatives which commenced a number of years ago, particularly in Lough Derg.  Senator O'Kennedy referred to one of the bodies involved in that initiative which is still up and running, SOLD &mdash; Save Our Lough Derg.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the chairman of that body, Councillor John Sheehy from Ballina, who first came to my attention when he circulated a document outlining a doomsday scenario for the future of Lough Derg.  It forecast it eventually becoming a dead lake unless urgent action was taken to improve and revitalise that which had been lost as a result of pollution from a variety of sources.</P>
    <P>It was perhaps inevitable given the location of Lough Derg and, to a lesser extent, Lough Ree in the mid-west, that there has been substantial and welcome industrialisation over the past 25 years.  That development has created jobs and brought prosperity to the region.  However, the price we are paying for industrialisation appears to be too high.  If we take urgent action now the price will be acceptable because, if we cannot return lakes such as Lough Derg and Lough Ree to their original pristine condition, we will at least be able to arrest the erosion that has affected the habitats, flora, fauna and fish life in those waters.</P>
    <P>According to one report Lough Derg was identified as being heavily polluted while Lough Ree was moderately polluted.  The third lake, Lough Allen, is still pollution free.  However, recent welcome developments in that area have raised serious questions about the lake's future environmental protection.  The reopening of the Lough Allen canal and the Shannon-Erne link have resulted in a huge upsurge of boating traffic in the past three years while an increased number of tourists visit the area to fish and use the lake and the Shannon for other leisure pursuits.</P>
    <P>It is an unpalatable fact of life that where there are people there will be pollution.  People must be educated not to dump rubbish and pollute.  We are one of the few species who foul our own nest with alarming regularity.  Every day we can witness the careless disposal of ice cream wrappers, cigarette boxes and take away cartons as they are flung with abandon on to the streets of towns and villages.  It happens everywhere.  What possesses us to pollute our environment so carelessly and irresponsibly in public when we would not do the same thing in the privacy of our homes?  We teach our children not to put their dirty shoes on <Col N="567" /> cushions, not to leave their bedrooms untidy and to dispose of rubbish in proper containers, yet we travel the highways and byways and visit our lakes and rivers and consistently pollute them.  It is because of that unacceptable fact that the legislation before us is being debated and, I hope, will be passed.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred this Bill to assume a more aggressive role in view of the plethora of State and statutory bodies involved in the Shannon region.  Senator O'Kennedy referred to the marvellous history of the Shannon corridor.  He spoke of it as a haven of recreation for anglers, boatmen, swimmers, gamesmen, archaelogists, school outings and family picnics along its length of 214 miles.  He also referred to the history and culture of Ireland.  Many monastic settlements were located there and crannógs have been identified in Lough Allen.  It is a rich heritage.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Pot is the source of the Shannon. It is located in the Cuilcagh Mountains between the towns of Dowra and Blacklion.  There is a signpost halfway between those towns which indicates the way to the Shannon Pot.  One can travel there on a good quality road, the result of the good work of a local councillor, Eddie Feeley. However, when one arrives at the Shannon Pot one simply sees a pool of water in the middle of the ground and nothing else.  Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Office of Public Works, presumably the statutory body responsible for the site, to make it a little more presentable.  More and more visitors are travelling to the source of the Shannon and, as it is so readily accessible, a little more thought might have been put into its presentation.  The area could be cleared and information could be provided on information tablets.  There might even be a visual presentation on the flora and fauna and the history of the river. However, there is nothing there and the same is true of many locations of interest along the length of the river.  A piecemeal approach has been adopted.  Presentation is good in some areas and bad in others.</P>
    <P>The Shannon River Council should concentrate not only on pollution and the environment but it should also assume a developmental role. Nobody else is doing it in a comprehensive manner. In many cases it is up to local authorities, depending on their resources and whether they have the initiative, to develop areas along the Shannon.  In Leitrim the Office of Public Works has the legislative authority to acquire property for development along the Shannon, yet we have been waiting several years for that body to acquire land on two sides of Lough Allen to provide landed jetties for cruiser traffic.  There are monastic settlements and areas of great historical interest within walking distance of the proposed jetties.</P>
    <P>Lough Allen is seven miles long and three miles wide and if one travels on the lake one cannot get off the boat until one returns to Drumshanbo. The existing jetties are offshore and were <Col N="568" /> erected primarily for shelter, not access.  That is just one example of an area of significant tourism development potential where the statutory agency responsible for its development has not taken the initiative.  I am sure the same is true of many areas along the Shannon corridor.</P>
    <P>A statutory body such as the river council, which would be charged with monitoring and establishing a foothold along the length of the river and in its catchment area, would be an ideal developmental body.  However, I am not aware of the Government's views on this concept, other than its acceptance of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the widest possible range of interests is represented on this body.  It is the successor to the Shannon Forum which was set up on a non-statutory basis in the 1980s and encompassed all the interests operating in the Shannon catchment area, farming and environmental organisations, local authority representatives, tourism interests etc.  I hope this council will be comprehensive in its membership so those who have a genuine interest in all aspects of the Shannon; its environment, history, tourism potential and farming; and the statutory councils will be involved.</P>
    <P>One can imagine the explosion of creativity that would emerge from the Shannon River Council if all of these fine people were involved. Would the Government be prepared to give it the necessary resources to carry out its mandate and allow it to flower and develop from its humble origins?  I would like to hear these questions answered by the Minister.  What is the future of the Shannon River Council?  What role is envisaged for it in the continuing development of our most important waterway?  Will it act in a developmental role across the range of activities I outlined or will it be narrowly focused on water quality and environmental matters?  I do not want to diminish the importance of those.</P>
    <P>As someone who lives beside the Shannon waterway like many of my colleagues contributing to the debate, I see its future development as vital to the enhancement of the economic prosperity of the inhabitants who live along it.  I am an enthusiastic supporter of this Bill and I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I express my appreciation and that of Senator Daly to the Minister and all of our colleagues in the House for the all-party welcome they have given to this initiative which we have undertaken.  It is of considerable importance, not just for Shannonsiders, but also in terms of the national significance of this major waterway.  It is the finest waterway in Britain and Ireland and has played a major role in all stages of Irish development &mdash; cultural, recreational, industrial, urban and agricultural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not our purpose in this Bill to diminish in any way the development along this national artery.  Our purpose is to ensure the ordered and regulated continuation of that development to guarantee that the economic wellbeing of those <Col N="569" /> who live in the Shannon catchment area will be enhanced in the future in a way that will not spoil the pure waters of that lordly river.  I am grateful, as is Senator Daly, to my colleagues for the warm response they have given to our initiative.  Unfortunately, Senator Daly is indisposed today, although not seriously.  Otherwise he would be here to express his thanks to our colleagues.</P>
    <P>If the welcome which has been given to the Bill by our colleagues and the Minister has qualifications, we accept them.  We are the first to acknowledge that we want to have a Shannon river authority with a full and effective statutory function to regulate, control and penalise, not just monitor and report.  We want to see an authority which will be guaranteed a statutory function by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We recognise there are a plethora of agencies and authorities that have a statutory function &mdash; the ESB, Bord na Móna, fisheries boards, local authorities and the Board of Works.  We cannot presume that we could get agreement from Government in one fell swoop to abolish all of those bodies and their interests in and around the Shannon and immediately replace them with the Shannon River Council.  That is the ultimate aim of every Senator who has spoken on this matter. Until we have that degree of statutory control and function, we will not be able to guarantee the protection of the waters, streams, rivers, wildlife and fishlife of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>At a time when there is some discussion on the role of the Seanad, this debate is a tribute to that role and a vindication of the significance and importance of this House.  I appreciate the active role my colleagues have played in debating this issue.  The Seanad, as it has demonstrated on this Bill, is the House where legislation can be considered calmly and effectively without a partisan political attitude.  As is evident from the welcome given to the Bill by all sides of the House, it extends beyond partisan politics.</P>
    <P>I note the suggestion that Senator Daly or I may not be in this House at a later stage as if we are successful in the forthcoming election we will be promoted or demoted to the Lower House. What is being done here must be continued and developed in the other House as soon as the Bill passes through the Seanad.  It is my intention, whether in Government or in Opposition in this House or the other one, that this Bill will proceed and I will take on board the valid suggestions made by colleagues in this House.</P>
    <P>Those suggestions have been consistent and many Senators, including Senator Belton, have correctly pointed out that there is overlap.  We are addressing this.  I probably know the river Shannon and its lakes better than anyone else. When I was four or five years old my late father and I went fishing at Luska with the late Johnny Kennedy, who was then 84 years old.  One could call him the old man of the Shannon.  I am familiar with the moods of that lake and I love its character.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> I am conscious of the overlap and the lack of co-ordination which exists between various bodies with responsibility in this area.  I propose on Committee Stage to take on board some of the suggestions made by tabling amendments to the Bill.  I hope those amendments will not elicit any negative response from Government though this has not been the case to date.  I intend to consult the Leader of the House, the Minister and all parties with a view to introducing amendments which could be agreed on an all party basis.  I do not want this Bill to be viewed as a partisan, party issue.</P>
    <P>The real feature of this Bill is that all the voluntary organisations and lakeshore communities that live beside the Shannon and play, fish, swim and boat on it will be, for the first time, involved in a statutory council.  It will be the first time that the views of local people will be taken into consideration with regard to the development of the Shannon and so on.  The people living in those lakeshore communities are those best equipped to advise, through a council, on what effective actions should be taken to co-ordinate the activities of local authorities, the development agencies, the Board of Works and so on.  They are in a position to ensure that gaps or unnecessary confrontation between authorities are eliminated so that people can work together in a common cause.  I pay special tribute to those voluntary organisations and lakeshore communities.</P>
    <P>Before I introduced the Bill I consulted groups and communities in the Lough Derg area.  The Shannon extends as far as Lough Ree but I did not have the opportunity or capacity to consult people there.  I want to record the fact that this Bill would not be before this House were it not for the vigorous support of those lakeshore communities and voluntary organisations.  In the case of Lough Derg, these communities include Portumna, Terryglass, Luske, Puckane, Dromineer, Urra, Youghal Bay, Garrykennedy, Ballina and Castleough.  If that list does not suggest I know the lake fairly well, I do not think anything would.  Many people from those communities travelled quite a distance to give us the benefit of their views on the programme we are proposing for the Shannon River Council.  I acknowledge the role played by the various angling, boating, yachting and swimming clubs along the Shannon which were all involved in the consultation process but if I were to single out one group it would be the organisation, referred to by Senator Mooney, known as Save Our Lough Derg or SOLD.  I should also acknowledge the contributions of Greenpeace, An Taisce, the ESB and all of the other bodies which had an involvement.</P>
    <P>The SOLD campaign and its members were of immense assistance to Senator Daly and me.  I would like to pay particular tribute to its Chairman and Secretary, John Sheehy and Bernard Chadwick who did a marvellous job in co-ordinating much of the work done in the preparation of this Bill.  We owe it to them and the people they <Col N="571" /> represent to ensure that we do something positive about this issue.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to the Minister for responding to the Bill.  Minister Burton provided us with some very significant information which, if anything, strengthened the case for a Bill such as this. The Minister mentioned that the Shannon catchment area extends for 2,228 kilometres if one considers the number of rivers, streams and channels involved.  One is literally dealing with the waterway of Ireland and with something that impinges on the lives of those living along the Shannon and beyond it.</P>
    <P>I am indebted to the Minister for pointing out that surveys have shown some 32 per cent of the river channel is polluted.  Less than 20 per cent of this is regarded as moderately polluted and 12 per cent as slightly polluted.  I understand that the 12 per cent figure has increased to 17 per cent.  If one considers that almost all of the upper Shannon near Lough Allen and the Shannon Pot is, fortunately, almost totally unpolluted and unspoiled one will get an indication of the level of degradation of Lough Ree.  We cannot watch that degradation continue without taking action of the kind I am proposing.  Speakers on all sides of the House have supported me in this.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that I want the council to have a statutory function which will confer limited and specific responsibilities.  If I could give the council the statutory function to do all that requires to be done on every front in respect of the development of the Shannon, the control of pollution and so on I would propose that right now.  I acknowledge that all of this is necessary in the long run.  However, as an experienced legislator I am aware that will not, and cannot, be done overnight but it is time it started.</P>
    <P>The real feature of this Bill is that, for the first time, local people are being given an opportunity to make their views known.  These include local representatives and county councillors who up to this point have had no statutory function in relation to the control of pollution of the Shannon, recreational organisations, lakeshore communities, and those interested in the archaeological sites along the Shannon and its cultural inheritance.  Monuments are being spoiled along the Shannon through casual intrusions and by picnickers. All of these are matters of fundamental importance for this council.  The castles and monasteries along that river are a particular feature of Lough Derg.  My family name is associated with it through Mr. Garry Kennedy and the old castle at Dromineer.  It should be protected and enhanced and the council will have a major role in ensuring that is done.</P>
    <P>It will be a statutory council with executive functions.  It must have its own staff and it will have the power to monitor, control and report on the activities of the other agencies and bodies associated with the River Shannon.  Unfortunately, some of those bodies have done the opposite to what statute requires them to do.  I <Col N="572" /> will not point the finger at individual local authorities but the function of each authority is to control pollution and the environment.  However, many of them for various reasons, such as a lack of adequate financial support from central Government, are among the primary polluters. Untreated sewage is a major issue.  If one visits the beautiful still waters of the bays of Lough Derg at Dromineer, Luska and Urra one can see the effect of pollution caused by those who are charged with reducing environmental damage.</P>
    <P>Individual members of local authorities, such as the chairman of SOLD, Councillor John Sheehy, should be members of the new body.  Representatives of boatmen, yachtsmen, swimming clubs, An Taisce and environmentalists should also be involved.  Senator Mooney said the council will generate an explosion of creativity with regard to the River Shannon.  This should be based on a constant commitment in terms of the recommendations the council will make to the Minister for the Environment, to whom it will report on a statutory basis twice a year.  The Minister of the day and not the council will have responsibility for making decisions.  However, the council will make recommendations twice a year which will be published and debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They will be a matter of public record and any Minister in any Government would ignore the recommendations and findings of such a body at their peril.  The central thrust of the Bill is that the council will be an on the spot watchdog. It will ensure that its recommendations are effectively implemented.</P>
    <P>The lordly River Shannon has a mile for every day of the year and industrial and agricultural development and urban renewal should continue in every town &mdash; Athlone, Banagher, Nenagh, Birr, Roscrea, etc. &mdash; along its 365 miles.  There should be development but it must be controlled in a way which ensures that it enhances the river rather than spoils it.  I acknowledge Members' points about the overlap of facilities and that one cannot suddenly eradicate the role of statutory bodies.  However, judging by the mood of the House and the public's reaction to the Bill, it is time to start taking action on a co-ordinated and effective basis.  The Bill is our contribution to the initiation of that action.</P>
    <P>I first joined the House in 1965 and I have had a lengthy political career involving a number of Ministries.  It is for others to judge the significance of my contribution in the Departments of Education, Transport and Power, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Agriculture and Labour. However, if I thought this Bill was the beginning of the protection and enhancement of the beautiful River Shannon, from the Shannon pot to Loop Head, whatever else I did in my political career would pale into insignificance in comparison to the contribution that Senator Daly and I made in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the person has refused to participate at pre-tenancy training courses.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns people who refuse to participate in pre-tenancy courses.  Future tenants of houses should be brought into the local authority office for a training course.  It would also help them get to know their neighbours better.  I am not talking about running a course over a couple of weeks but rather providing for tenants to be told what is expected of them in giving them tenancy of a house.  It should be stressed that they are being given a home for their family which, if they do not respect, could be taken from them.</P>
      <P>There should be a probationary period for certain people moving into local authority housing so that the local authority could review after one year the manner in which people treat their homes.  My town is small and we do not have the same problems that are evident in the city. However, it often amazes me, especially at election time when I go from door to door during the campaign, to see nine of ten houses kept beautifully &mdash; properly painted and with nice gardens &mdash; and then a family house with broken glass in the front door and rubbish thrown around the garden.  For some reason they do not seem to care; they are not house proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House but this amendment would ensure such people are brought into a local authority office in groups of 11 or 12 &mdash; although the groups would be larger for Dublin &mdash; and told what is expected of them.  This would make a significant difference.  They should be told that ignoring such advice or warning would result in eviction.  This is not a major problem but it is happening.  However, there is no legally binding threat a local authority officer can issue to tenants <Col N="574" /> regarding the upkeep of their home.  This is why the pre-tenancy training course and the probationary tenancy mentioned in my second amendment are important.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pick out particular people in society but those who have lived in caravans all their lives, going from post to pillar, and travellers not used to living in the one place, should be told what is expected of them.  I can only speak with authority about my own, very caring, council.  At present, a letter is sent to the future tenant saying the agreement must be signed and that the rent collector will call.  The agreement is signed, the keys are handed over and the tenants are then left on their own.  Nobody goes into the house with them to show them where the stop cock for turning of water is or where the fuses for the different lights are located.</P>
    <P>I do not want training courses to be akin to tenants returning to school.  I am talking about making legal provision for local authorities to organise training courses if they deem it necessary. By inserting this provision in the Bill, local authorities will be given legal clout to do this and to warn tenants.</P>
    <P>Regarding the probationary period, there are cases where local authorities need to examine how a tenant is running their home and be able to issue a legal warning to them.  At present local authorities have no legal powers to say it is not happy with the way the house is being maintained. The Minister must have seen local authority houses with a piece of cardboard stuck in the window and a towel sticking out through a hole in the glass while nearby there are beautifully kept houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the points raised, pre-tenancy training courses and probationary tenancy are important issues best addressed by local authorities in the context of their management practice.  A report made in June 1996 to the housing committee of Dublin Corporation on proposals for the implementation of the estate management initiative stated that the corporation could make the completion of a pre-tenancy training course an essential requirement for the allocation of a dwelling.  The report concluded, however, that it might be difficult to refuse to house persons in need simply because they had not attended a course.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to infer that, because a person failed to undergo a pre-tenancy course, he or she is likely to engage in anti-social behaviour. There may be other genuine reasons for non-participation. I do not want pre-tenancy courses to be seen as a negative instrument for vetting tenants. Where there is a serious risk of prospective tenants engaging in anti-social behaviour, the provisions of section 14 as it stands allow the housing authority, for the first time, to refuse or defer the making of a letting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Deputy's points on good estate management and I encourage local authorities to <Col N="575" /> carry out pre-tenancy training.  It is more beneficial if there is encouragement of and by local authorities and it would not be appropriate or helpful statutorily to require tenants to undergo pre-tenancy training because persons in need of housing could not be refused on these grounds alone.</P>
    <P>As to probationary tenancies, Dublin Corporation's submission on estate management to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs in 1996 stated that parole tenancies were unlikely to improve anti-social behaviour.  While I accept the Senator's points on estate management, this Bill is not the vehicle to put it into statute.  That would be unhelpful in achieving the goal he has outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his views.  I am a member of the housing committee of South Dublin County Council, which has put in place an estate management programme which ensures that young people who become tenants in our catchment area are given training.  It is probably not happening at the same level around the country nor to the extent which the Senator would wish.  Dublin Corporation has returned some 12,000 local authority homes to South Dublin County Council since last January, so our courses are run much more regularly than heretofore. I agree with the Minister that it is best left to local authorities to set up such courses and ensure the correct people attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister and Senator Hayes say but, unfortunately, the county council has no legal clout to enforce these schemes.  It is totally voluntary and tenants might laugh off a threat from the council because there is nothing in legislation to back it up.  However, so be it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
      <P>Section 14 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before section 15, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1992, a local authority shall be empowered to secure and relet abandoned rented dwellings if it is of the view that the dwelling is in danger of being damaged or vandalised.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was first moved in the Lower House and is moved again because we think the process of retrieving an abandoned house is too slow.  A person may leave a house for various reasons and once it is vacant, it could be stripped <Col N="576" /> or vandalised within a week.  This problem may not be as great in rural towns as in Dublin.  This new section would give local authorities the power to act quickly.</P>
    <P>If the same provisions applying to houses with outstanding loans were applied to these houses, as is suggested in my amendment, such houses could return to local authority control in a short time and would not be abandoned for a long time. Under present law, it would take up to 18 months for a local authority to retrieve an abandoned house.  Section 12 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 provides for security of abandoned dwellings where a local authority or the housing finance agency had made a loan and believed that the dwelling has been or is in danger of being damaged or trespassed upon. This Bill should provide a similar procedure for dealing quickly with abandoned rented dwellings.</P>
    <P>Similar rules apply to any loan on a house. Some years ago I took out an Irish Permanent Building Society loan on my house.  I made alterations to the house, including changing my boundary slightly.  My neighbour had also applied for an Irish Permanent loan, so this change came to the building society's notice.  I immediately received a solicitor's letter, asking how I dared make any alteration to my house or property without the authority of the building society.  I was sorry I had done anything without first asking the Irish Permanent, which was within its rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows better than I how long a local authority must wait before regaining possession of an abandoned house.  This section would mean that the same provision would apply to such houses as to houses which are subject to a local authority loan, so that the authority could move to protect its property.  Letting a house is a financial transaction, just like giving a loan.  The only difference is that in one case the council provides finance to build a local authority house and rents it to the tenant, in the other the council provides the tenant with the finance to build his own house.  A local authority can take immediate action against a person who has taken out a loan and abandons his house, but cannot act against a person who is the tenant of an abandoned house.</P>
    <P>This would be a good provision and would speed up the process, especially in Dublin and the other cities.  Senator Hayes would be much more familiar with the problems caused by squatters and the vandalism of empty houses, which are not necessarily local authority houses.  I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment because it would be a major step towards improving the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe there is some confusion about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The power in relation to abandoned houses on which a local authority had advanced a loan is based on their power in <Col N="577" /> relation to rented houses, namely section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966.  I am satisfied there is nothing in the Housing Acts which would prevent a local authority from securing and reletting an abandoned local authority house.  It is important to stress that a local authority can move to secure a house.  Obviously, there are rights of tenancy which must be dealt with properly.  However, I assure the Senator that local authorities have sufficient powers under section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966, to secure their rented houses.</P>
      <P>My Department has made extensive inquiries on the matter with a number of local authorities which have confirmed the adequacy of the powers under section 58 of the Housing Act, 1966, to secure vacant dwellings where necessary.  I am aware that housing authorities have regularly taken prompt action to secure abandoned houses where this is considered necessary because of serious risk of damage, illegal occupation or use for drug dealing and anti-social activities.  This can be done immediately while steps are taken to locate the tenant or to repossess the dwelling with a view to reletting where this is necessary.</P>
      <P>Apart from any legal considerations, local authorities should, as far as possible, avoid boarding up dwellings.  While it may, in some circumstances, be necessary to secure a house pending reletting or where serious damage has already occurred, refurbishment, boarding up or security drilling a house for any length of time can lead to serious problems.  It serves to draw attention to the fact that the house has been abandoned and can act as a magnet for anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>Where a local authority dwelling has been abandoned, the priority should be to relet the dwelling as soon as possible.  I believe local authorities are aware of the need to secure speedy reletting.  However, I will consider bringing the matter to their attention in the context of guidelines to be issued following the enactment of the Bill.  Where there is no option but to secure the dwelling for a period of time, the local authority has adequate legal power to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not dispute that local authorities have the necessary powers &mdash; I am arguing that it takes too long to implement them. However, local authorities can immediately move in cases where there are local authority loans involved.  Why not have the same law apply to both cases?  The local authority spends the same amount of money in both cases.  In one case the building of the house is financed by the local authority and the Department and in the other case the local authority provides the finance to buy the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a house on which there is a local authority loan is abandoned the local authority can repossess the house in a matter of days or weeks.  In the other case, a lengthy legal process must be gone through before the authority can take over, protect and relet the house.  I do not see why the same law could not be applied to both cases.  The <Col N="578" /> Minister of State is right in saying that the powers exist, but one process is very slow, taking up to a year or a year and a half, while the other is instant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald. The amendment makes good sense and I cannot see why the Minister of State should have any difficulty in accepting it.  Senator Fitzgerald is right that there is no difference between rented local authority accommodation and accommodation mortgaged through local authorities.  In some housing estates, half the accommodation is rented from the local authority while the other half is owned.  In fact, in most reasonable estates almost 75 per cent of the houses are owned.  The problem is that, in the huge conurbations which were built years ago, stretches of houses are allowed to deteriorate and are boarded up.  It is all very well for the Minister of State to say the local authorities have adequate powers in such cases but they do not actually have those powers because if a tenant returns after three or four months they will say they did not abandon the house and will demand it back.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should have no difficulty inserting this qualification into the Bill.  It does not harm the Bill but strengthens it from the point of view of the Government and the taxpayer. I ask the Minister of State to consider that by accepting the amendment she would strengthen her own hand and that of the suppliers of the money, the taxpayers.  The delays which have occurred in cases involving rented accommodation have been much longer than those in cases involving mortgagees of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Senator that the process is the same in both cases.  The confusion seems to be arising about the power to secure the property and the legal process which must be gone through to take back the property.  Section 58 of the 1966 Act provides local authorities with the power to secure their property.  It may be the case that Senators have experience of local authorities not availing of that power in certain instances and that complaints have been made to Senators about houses which were not secured. However, the reality is that local authorities have the power to secure their property, obviously without prejudice to the outcome of a case if they are going through the normal court proceedings. Delays of a year or a year and a half in these court actions are not the experience at local authority level.</P>
      <P>The powers in relation to houses on which there are loans is based on the powers which were already in place in relation to houses rented from a local authority.  It is unnecessary to add this amendment because the power already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very interested to hear of examples of local authorities not availing of the power to secure their property if Senators wish to provide me with that information.  I will send out a circular with guidelines on this.  I would like to ensure <Col N="579" /> that local authorities are making estate management work and using their existing powers.</P>
    <P>There is sometimes a tendency to think that additional legislation is required.  However, the legislation and powers are in place.  The normal protections are also in place because we are dealing with people who have rights &mdash; there must be court procedures with regard to taking back a house.  In the meantime, the power to secure lies with the local authority and is effectively the same as the other example mentioned by the Senator.  If it is not being used appropriately I would be happy to take that up on the Senator's behalf because I want to ensure that estate management is effective and of a high standard across the board.  To ensure this, the powers at the disposal of local authorities need to be used, and used effectively, from time to time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister of State's comments, would it not be more appropriate to have the other legislation to which she refers incorporated in this Bill?  I have no knowledge of abandoned houses, but I am informed that they are widespread in some local authorities. Houses are boarded up for protection, which indicates that there is something wrong with the legal process of reletting or repossession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>A very small number of local authority houses are boarded up because when previous tenants do not look after them they must be repaired.  In many instances it can take a considerable period of time to bring the property back to an acceptable condition for the next tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In large urban areas huge numbers of houses have been boarded up, some as a result of the sale of local authority houses to tenants. Tenants did not buy their houses in certain areas and this led to various social problems.  A huge number of estates in Dublin, Cork and Limerick are boarded up, giving them a bad reputation. When this happens, people will not move into them.</P>
      <P>Proper estate management is probably the answer to this problem.  Under existing legislation, county councils and urban councils have the right to establish estate management groups and become involved in estate management between the tenants and local authorities.  Proper estate management in all local authority areas would prevent the problems described by Senator Fitzgerald coming to the fore.</P>
      <P>Huge social difficulties are associated with allocating houses.  There are also difficulties connected with mixed estates and with the way in which people manage their houses.  Houses on estates become abandoned when people wishing to live a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life move out.  The boarding and securing of such houses by local authorities exacerbates the problem and these houses become the target of anti-social activities.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) a private landlord.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The destruction that drug abusers, pushers and barons are wreaking on society, including maiming, murder and other related activities must be addressed.  The Bill provides that an exclusion order can be brought against those involved in these activities, which is welcome.  It is time that a &ldquo;get tough&rdquo; approach was taken and that what may be described as draconian laws were introduced to discourage these people from interfering with society and with our families.  Their activities have created fear in the country.  They must be excluded from society and I would support the efforts of any Government in this regard.  Virtually every crime involving the taking of money is drug related.  Not a day goes by without hearing reports on drug abuse and associated problems.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the issuing of exclusion orders to people renting accommodation from local authorities.  If they are excluded, where will they go?  Landlords are within their rights to investigate whether an exclusion order has been served against a prospective tenant.  This could be done confidentially through the Garda Síochána, health boards or housing authorities.  No respectable landlord would wish to see an excluded tenant within an ass's roar of his or her property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landlords or estate agents have the right to protect their property from drug pushers.  A record of exclusion orders served by local authorities should be maintained.  Computer technology should make this register instantly available to landlords.  It would enable landlords from different parts of the country to check on exclusion orders wherever they were served. Many people are leaving the cities and seeking refuge in rural areas, particularly in the west of Ireland.  Local communities do not know where these people come from or who they are.  They go into social welfare offices and claim the dole. I am not suggesting that these people are pushing drugs.  However, landlords in rural areas should <Col N="581" /> be able to check whether an exclusion order was served against an individual.  That should be the only information available to them.  This should be inserted in legislation rather than having it done behind closed doors.  If we do not do this we are simply moving the problem from local authority houses to another location.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a relationship between this legislation and the Homeless Persons Act.  I understand the reasoning behind this section in which an individual can be excluded and refused reallocation of another house by a local authority as a result of drug pushing or anti-social behaviour. However, these people then become homeless.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not clarify the circumstances under which people can be excluded.  Are they excluded following court proceedings?  Are they excluded because someone has suggested their involvement in drugs to the local authority?  What are the criteria for exclusion?  Who will be excluded?  For example, if the husband is excluded what is his wife's situation?  If a husband is excluded is he no longer entitled to a house? Under the Homeless Persons Act are people entitled to appeal the exclusion and their subsequent ineligibility for a second house?  What criteria will be used to reverse an exclusion order so that people can be rehoused?  This Bill contradicts the Homeless Persons Act so one of these pieces of legislation is flawed.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as a private landlord in 90 per cent of lettings.  Ninety per cent of social welfare lettings are part paid for by the health boards.  Private landlords are now State aided.  If someone is excluded from local authority housing can health boards pay a subvention towards that person's private rental costs?  If they can, the Bill is a nonsense.  What effect will the Bill have on private rental accommodation in which health boards pay so much of the costs? Private landlord should have access to the same information as local authorities when considering the suitability of a tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a degree of confusion.  I am not sure if this is self-induced.  I am opposed to including private landlords in this section.  Supplementary benefit is paid directly to claimants who then organise their own rented accommodation. Benefit payments are not made to landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> There is a problem in Dublin where most landlords do not meet local communities and refuse to follow up queries from communities where a tenant breaks a tenancy agreement.  Section 15 is a sensible section and brings the relevant parties around the table for the first time.  That is the important point.  We now have the relevant parties discussing this and I do not believe we should have the private landlords at those discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised but I do not consider it appropriate that private landlords be empowered to request information along the lines proposed.  The exchange of information provided for in the Bill is between statutory agencies and other agencies subject to Ministerial approval.  Private landlords are in neither category and it would be inappropriate to extend this power to them on that account.</P>
      <P>The exclusion orders are modelled on the barring orders in cases of domestic violence.  They target people in a household who are guilty of antisocial behaviour.  A local authority can issue an exclusion order and the case can go to court, where the court decides whether the exclusion order will be made or not.  There will be also be a time limit on the exclusion order.  There is an improvement in the Bill on the current situation, where if one member of the family is guilty of antisocial behaviour, the entire family can be evicted.  Under this Bill the perpetrator is targeted more effectively.</P>
      <P>In relation to the social welfare payments and rent allowance, the health boards are being given the discretion to decide whether or not to pay rent allowance to someone with an exclusion order against them or who is considered guilty of antisocial behaviour.  Before this Bill was introduced there was no discretion, which was a big problem in this area.  People who were dealing in drugs were being evicted from local authority estates but were able to move in nearby by availing of a rent allowance and set up shop again. There is a new and important power in this Bill relating to rent allowances and supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty addressed by this section relates to an information deficit that exists because of the Data Protection Act and confidentiality. Statutory agencies have certain statutory controls that mean they cannot communicate information to each other when it is necessary. This section has an enabling provision that means they will have the right to exchange and pass on information as is appropriate and needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private landlords are under no statutory obligations to provide accommodation for anybody.  I was interested to hear the Senator mention a figure of 90 per cent.  That is not my view of how many people are availing of rent allowances.  A landlord can refuse to provide accommodation for a prospective tenant or he or she can require that person to provide such information, for example, that proves the person has not had an exclusion order issued against them.  The applicant <Col N="583" /> must then get the necessary information from the local authority.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, there is a difference between statutory agencies who are obliged to provide accommodation and who require this information exchange, and private landlords, who have a different relationship with tenants.  They need a different facility to ensure they have the information they need before entering into any tenancy arrangement with an applicant as it is a different relationship.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable local authorities to manage their estates and to deal with serious antisocial behaviour that arises from drug dealing.  The Bill does not deal with the drugs menace no matter where it occurs. We have a range of measures and all sides of the House are aware that there is no single piece of legislation that will solve this problem.  This Bill gives local authorities enabling powers to target and deal with antisocial behaviour.  That needs to be remembered when amendments are being discussed, because we are talking of statutory agencies which have obligations to people regarding housing.  We need to ensure that their information exchange is working properly.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State says that this Bill relates to local authorities but everything must work together.  People cannot be taken out of local authority housing and farmed out to the rest of society.  It does not matter if it is included in this Bill or others, but people should have the right to information.  If I want to know about the Minister of State I can go to the library and get all the information about her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Or all the information about myself.  Why should the drug dealer or person excluded from local authority housing be different? This is a Bill to give enabling powers to local authorities, but this section was brought in because of the opposition of residents to drug dealers.  I was worried that this would flare up into more crime and killings.  When I mention private landlords, I am referring to myself or Senator Lanigan, if we had a house to let.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had a house, we still deal with a local authority because it can demand that house.  If there is a shortage of accommodation and our house is vacant, the local authority can demand it.  The Minister of State's advisers disagree, but that is the impression I had, though I will not labour that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would protect society.  If a person wants to let a house, they should be able to ask the Garda if their prospective tenant has had an exclusion order served against him or her for selling drugs. <Col N="584" /> I do not think the Minister of State will accept this amendment, but I wish she would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very discriminatory Bill. It deals with local authority housing tenants and exclusion orders can be granted against them. The same exclusion cannot be applied to those who are not in local authority housing. It is being suggested that most of the problems arising from drug dealing are coming from local authority housing areas and that by excluding specific people from these areas this situation will change.  What will happen to somebody who has been convicted by the courts and sent to prison?  The Minister of State said they will be excluded from getting rented accommodation through the local authority.  I presume they will not receive a subvention from the health board for private rented accommodation but if they do, what is the point of this? Where will we house such people?  Will we dump them on the street because they have been convicted of anti-social behaviour?  Will they end up back in prison?</P>

      <P>If an exclusion order is served on somebody, he or she must leave the local authority house.  They will then seek a payment from the Eastern Health Board for private rented accommodation.

Why is there a difficulty with that because it does not involve private landlords?</P>

      <P>Will this happen before or after these people return from their holidays in the Canaries?  I ask that because drug barons have considerable sums of money.  If the local authority and the Garda have information which will remove this scourge from our society, they should give it to others.  As Senator Lanigan said, this is discriminatory in that a local authority can obtain an exclusion order but the owner of private rented accommodation cannot.  What good is that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of homelessness, I was conscious when we drafted this Bill that we did not give a wide definition to anti-social behaviour which would lead to the outcome Senator Lanigan described.  The definition is focused and clearly relates to drug dealing.  A young drug addict living at home in a local authority estate will not come under the remit of the Bill.  The legislation relates to drug dealing, violence and intimidation.  Women living in local authority estates in Dublin are terrified by what is happening around them.  Drug barons living in the Canaries are using their estates as bases from which to run their businesses.  We must deal with that problem.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that many people will be excluded as a result of the Bill, which is a deterrent and clearly sets out the limits to which people can go.  If somebody decides to deal in drugs, intimidate or act violently towards people in the interests of selling drugs, they must pay a high price which includes losing their home.  Such people may end up in a shelter for the homeless for whom there is accommodation.  The rights which people should be able to avail of, whether local authority housing or rent allowance, will be denied to them because of their activities.  That is an important message to send.</P>
      <P>I am not in the business of excluding people from their homes but the drugs crisis obliges us to deal with this problem.  The provisions of the Bill home in on individuals making money from death and who will never be homeless.  This is a big business and a considerable amount of money is being made from drugs.  I cannot imagine drug dealers wandering the streets cap in hand.  These parasites are feeding off young lives and we must make it clear that will not be tolerated.  I have no time for zero tolerance but certain aspects of the social ills which exist require zero tolerance.  We must make it clear that the Government and the Opposition, which shares our view, are serious.  I am glad this Bill has been generally welcomed.  I appreciate Senator Lanigan made those points in that spirit.</P>
      <P>There are no statutory obligations or controls on the private rented accommodation sector and the Ombudsman has no role in this regard.  The private landlord has absolute power in relation to his or her property and does not have to let it.  I was fascinated by Senator Fitzgerald's view in this regard.  I wish he would not give me ideas because I might act on them.</P>

      <P>I am advised that one would have to go through compulsory purchase order proceedings to interfere with the right to private property in that way.  I was not aware a local authority could simply move somebody into private rented accommodation, it is news to me.  We are dealing with a failure of communications between statutory agencies which have the responsibilities <Col N="586" /> about which Senator Lanigan spoke, that is, to house the homeless and provide rent allowances. That system is in place to help people in need but it must work effectively when people use the system to peddle death.</P>

      <P>In page 9, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Gardaí shall notify the local authority where convictions are secured for drug dealing or where raids on dwellings result in drugs being discovered.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is common sense that local authorities be kept informed of anything of this nature.  Some estates in Dublin are enormous.  I remember spending four hours trying to find the way out of one when canvassing for the Seanad.  It is impossible for local authorities to know of everything happening on estates of that size.  If the Garda uncover criminal activity they should inform the housing officer that an undesirable is operating from a local authority house.  This provision is in line with what is sought in the section in terms of exclusion orders being served against such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. This Bill has arisen out of considerable consultation with local authorities on deficiencies in current practice.  The Senator's proposal was not requested by the authorities, although the deficiency in information exchange was raised.  I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to oblige the Garda to notify the local authority of convictions for drug dealing.  Authorities will be empowered under section 15 to request and obtain information from the Garda in specific cases so that access to such information exists if needed.  It is important to remember that this Bill relates to the management of social housing.  A procedure whereby the Garda would be obliged to notify local authorities of all convictions for drug dealings and all raids on dwellings resulting in drugs finds would go beyond the scope of those objectives.</P>

      <Col N="587" /> Where people are in arrears with their rent, it is not enough to deduct their rent from their social welfare payments.  A small sum should also be deducted for the payment of rent arrears and the amendment specifies £1 per week.  Otherwise, those people will never clear their arrears and the debt will continue to increase.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to ensure arrears do not build up to unsustainable levels rather than for recovery of existing arrears, which remain a matter in the first instance for arrangement between the housing authority and the tenant.  There is no question of arrears being ignored.  The practices of local authorities for recovery of arrears will continue to apply. However, the section should help lessen the incidence of arrears problems in future and lessen the evictions resulting from such situations.</P>

      <P>Arrears are often known to be as high as £800 to £900.  A person paying £1 per week would take 800 weeks to clear their arrears but an effort would at least be made.  It would be a way of educating such people that they cannot allow arrears to build up, that they must be responsible, that they are fortunate to have accommodation and a good home and that they must pay for it.  In addition to their rent being deducted from their social welfare payments, arrears, where owed, should also be deducted at £1 per week.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with good estate management but does not cover all aspects of it. I spend much of my time encouraging and developing policies with local authorities to ensure they manage their estates better and that tenants are included in that process as far and as realistically as possible.  I have held seminars and have met with city and county managers to convey the message of the need for better management. I asked them to ensure it comes from the top down as well as at housing official level.</P>
      <P>This section enables local authorities to use an alternative to eviction where rent arrears exist.  It does not mean people will avoid paying rent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while still having arrears.  It is up to a local authority to ensure rent arrears do not build up.  That is a management issue and one about which I have been concerned since I <Col N="588" /> became a Minister.  Certain local authorities have not been sufficiently well managed to ensure rent arrears were dealt with at an early stage and evictions have been used as a big stick to deal with the issue.  It remains the ultimate power but this section provides another route which is more preferable and ensures the local authority receives the rent to which it is entitled.  It can also go to court to obtain it.</P>
      <P>Many people are living on very low incomes and arrears which build up should not get out of control.  The local authority has a major part to play in this.  As time goes on and the system is enforced, the likelihood of rent arrears building up to a high level will decrease.  This is a good measure to deal with a management issue.  It is not related to drugs dealing and the Senator is correct when he stated it does not focus on anti-social behaviour.  It focuses on good estate management and is an opportunity for local authorities to address the issue of rent where needs be, such as when people do not pay their rent.  It also allows them to address it in a way which meets their needs and protects innocent family members who may not be responsible for the rent arrears but still end up evicted.  I find that unsatisfactory and this is an attempt to ensure it is minimised and eliminated, if possible.</P>

      <P>I agree with what the Minister said but I do not agree that this section should be in the Bill.  I also agree with her sentiments about the containment of rent arrears and that good estate management should eliminate that.  In the past the State suffered huge losses in tax receipts because the tax authorities dealt inadequately with defaulting customers.  They have now got their act together and make prompt tax demands. The trauma of the build up of arrears can be caused by one person in the family being under the impression that somebody else has been paying the rent.  Suddenly there is a huge build-up of arrears.  This problem is indicative of bad management within the household and equally bad management on the part of certain local authorities.</P>
      <P>My local authority is exceptionally good at maintaining person to person contact and carrying out weekly collections.  If that type of estate management were introduced this provision would not be necessary.  It is unfortunate a Bill must be introduced to target people whose rent is in arrears as it probably could have been dealt with by another means.  However, I agree with the Minister of State that good management by local authorities is the answer to this problem.</P>

      <P>We must look at how legislation deals with all sections of society.  A publican who has not paid his or her tax on time will not get a licence for the next year.  If a farmer has not paid his tax on time, his grants will be seized by the Revenue Commissioners.  There are no ifs or buts and the Revenue Commissioners do not seize just a percentage of the grants.  All grants are seized. I am aware of one man who had grants amounting to £27,000 seized.  Perhaps he had plenty of money, but the seizure of that money broke him. I estimate that millions of pounds in arrears are owed to local authorities.</P>
      <P>I agree that the way to deal with this problem is by proper estate management and by calling every week to collect the rents.  However, the money is not collected and no effort is put into collecting arrears.  They tend to be written off and that practice is accepted.  The rent collector or the county manager will tell councillors they are doing their best, but then they shake their heads and say the money is gone forever.  I do not wish to labour the point, but why cannot an extra few pounds be collected to clear arrears?</P>
      <P>Obviously, there are unfortunate people who find themselves in difficulty and I am not seeking to crucify them.  However, many people have plenty of money to go to the local pub but they have no money to pay for their houses.  The first payment deducted from my cheque each month is my mortgage payment.  Then I must pay my VHI, the telephone bill and the ESB bill.  There is usually no money left and it was a great deal worse this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;or a person who has failed to vacate a house on termination of a tenancy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 defines a good squatter and a bad squatter.  A squatter is somebody who takes over property without authority.  It makes no difference to me whether a squatter is a drug abuser or a person moving from place to place, the person <Col N="590" /> is still squatting.  The amendment seeks to remove that distinction.</P>
    <P>Section 20 (a) states: &ldquo;a house provided by a housing authority or any part thereof is occupied, whether continuously or otherwise, by a person (other than the tenant or a person who has failed to vacate a house on termination of a tenancy)&rdquo;. That means the person is a squatter.  Section 20 (b) states: &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána has received notification from the housing authority that the authority believe that the person is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour and that it is necessary in the interest of good estate management that the said person be required to leave the house&rdquo;.  My interpretation of that paragraph is that if the Garda believe a squatter is causing trouble, they will notify the local authority. However, if the squatter is not causing trouble the Garda will not notify the local authority.</P>
    <P>It is clear paragraph (b) should be deleted.  A squatter is a squatter in every sense of the word. Paragraph (b) means the Garda will report to the local authority that an undesirable person is squatting in house No. 10 &mdash; I do not mean Tony Blair &mdash; and is carrying out illegal activities.  They will advise that the squatter be removed. However, in the case of paragraph (a), it appears the Garda will not report the presence of a squatter to the local authority.  The section appears to imply there are two types of squatter.  In one case, the Garda notify the local authority of the squatter's presence but in the case of the other squatter the local authority finds out itself.  If the latter is not causing trouble, it will take about 12 months to remove the person from the house.  By then the squatter will have located another house in which they will squat for another 12 months. Senator Hayes is more aware of this problem than I because he must deal with it more often. These squatters can move in circles.  Why are there two categories of squatter?  Amendment No. 9 seeks to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appears to have misinterpreted the provision.  The section provides that the local authority will notify the Garda.  These are exceptional powers to deal with exceptional circumstances so the Garda can deal immediately with a situation where anti-social behaviour is taking place.  The usual powers in relation to squatting will remain in place but this provision facilitates an immediate response by the Garda to deal with drug dealing and anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>Technically, a squatter is a squatter.  However, from the point of view of a community, there is a difference between a squatter and somebody who is squatting in order to secure a base to deal in drugs, to intimidate and break down people's doors, to terrify potential witnesses and to act violently against people.  We are ensuring the gardaí can act immediately in these circumstances so that we can deal with the scenario where a person can move from one place to another and use the courts system to delay action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> Senator Fitzgerald is right about drug dealers moving from place to place to extend their time as long as possible.  This is an effective but exceptional power which ensures that gardaí can ensure that someone leaves a house or flat.  If a squatter who is guilty of anti-social behaviour refuses to do so they will then be guilty of an offence.  We are targeting this serious issue which should not be taken lightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>They should be treated in the same manner.  There is a contradiction in what the Minister is saying.  I tabled an amendment providing for the gardaí to notify the local authority but the Minister did not accept it.  Now she is talking about the local authority notifying the gardaí.  Section 19 (b) states &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána has received notification from the housing authority...&rdquo;  This is included in the Bill to cover anti-social behaviour by drug pushers. Why did the Minister not accept my amendment which asked for the gardaí to notify the local authority?  Why can there not be two way traffic?</P>

      <P>We support the Bill but there is a contradiction in it.  A squatter is a squatter. According to Dublin county councillors, Senators and Deputies, squatters are the scourge of housing authorities regardless of whether they are drug abusers or criminals.  They are squatters and trying to get them out of a house takes about a year by which time they have seen another property in another estate and they move into it. These people are as well known to the local authorities as television personalities because they meet them every day.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how this section states the local authority shall notify the Garda Síochána when my amendment suggesting the Garda Síochána should notify the local authority was not accepted.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Ballagh-Ballybeg Water Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I want to draw attention to the need for the Minister for the Environment to inform Seanad Éireann if, and when, he intends to provide funding for the construction of a feeder main for the Ballagh-Ballybeg water scheme in County Roscommon.  This is not the first time I have raised this matter in the Seanad and I would like to outline a brief history of the position of the Ballagh-Ballybeg water scheme.  The people in these two areas have been seeking a public water supply for more than ten years.</P>
      <P>Roscommon County Council, after consultation with the Department of the Environment, decided to attempt to have part of the scheme funded on a capital basis.  In 1993 an application was submitted to the Department seeking departmental approval and funding for a 14 mile feeder main which would allow the groups involved to complete the scheme.  That application was lodged with the Department in 1993 having been approved by Roscommon County Council and having been costed by them.  Plans and specifications were drawn up and sent to the Department and £1.1 million was sought for the construction of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly and I tabled a motion in the Seanad some 12 months ago requesting that the funding be provided.  At that time the Minister indicated that money was not available in 1996 and that the matter would be considered in 1997. A delegation from the area, together with the county engineer, met with the Minister for the Environment a year ago and I understand that the Minister inquired then when the council would be in a position to proceed with the scheme.  The interpretation the delegation took from that was that they had received a favourable hearing and that there would be clearance given for the scheme.  Unfortunately nothing has happened and no funding has been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A public meeting was held in Ballybeg last Monday night and the people concerned &mdash; there are some 200 connections involved &mdash; asked that this matter be raised again and that pressure be put on public representatives to obtain sanction for the £1.1 million feeder main.  Senator Mullooly and I undertook to raise the matter in the Seanad.  I do not need to explain the difficulties which the people in those areas experience.  At a time when it is generally considered in Europe that Ireland has made huge advances, it is extraordinary that an entire section of the countryside, <Col N="594" /> from just outside Roscommon town as far as the Shannon, does not have a public water supply in 1997.  These people have been trying to get a public water supply for more than ten years, and that is, to some extent, an indictment of all the powers that be at council and Government level.</P>
    <P>Since 1993 when the new application for the feeder main was submitted, there was no option but to fund the scheme on a capital basis.  Three years have passed since that application was made and I ask the Minister to indicate to Roscommon County Council that the money will be provided for this scheme in 1997.  I am sure that not all of the money will have to be spent in 1997 given that 14 miles of pipe must be laid.  I am requesting that an allocation be made to start the scheme otherwise these people will be left for another year without a public water supply.  Even when the main is in place, they will still have to organise themselves throughout the little villages along the course of the main in order to complete the scheme.  I am asking that the Minister give the go ahead and allocate money for this scheme which is number one on the priority list of Roscommon County Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague in welcoming the Minister to the House to listen to our case and I look forward to receiving a positive response.  With many of my colleagues of all political persuasions I attended the meeting last Monday night about this issue.  The Acting Chairman, Senator Belton sent his apologies for not being able to attend the meeting and the people of the area know they have his full support.  We were invited to attend the meeting as the people in these areas want to know if, and when, finance will be provided for the construction of the main pipeline required to enable them to obtain a public water supply.  Approximately 200 people attended the meeting and they were very angry indeed.  That is understandable as they have been seeking a public water supply in the area for almost 20 years.</P>
      <P>These people have been using poor quality water from wholly unsuitable sources, such as roof water tanks, for most of their lives.  Many of the bored wells, which were provided in the area over the years at considerable cost, have proved to be very unsatisfactory due to silting and the general poor quality of the water.  The proposals for the construction of the main pipeline, as Senator Finneran pointed out, were prepared, costed and submitted to the Department in 1993. At that time the estimated cost of construction was £1.1 million.  We are not talking about a huge amount of money here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the people of Ballybeg and Ballagh see it, this Government did not seem to have any problem abolishing domestic water charges and residential property tax.  It did not appear to have had any problem meeting the demands of the various pressure groups which surfaced over the past six months but unfortunately, it would appear it cannot find the £1.1 or £1.2 million required for <Col N="595" /> this much needed project in a rural and disadvantaged part of County Roscommon.  There has been much talk of equity in recent times, particularly in relation to water and payment for water. The people of Ballagh and Ballybeg do not see much equity when they have no public water supply at all and some of the wealthiest people in the country have an unlimited supply of free water for their jacuzzis, fountains, swimming pools and so on.</P>
    <P>I hope approval will be given for this scheme in the near future.  In February 1996 a deputation from the area, accompanied by the Roscommon county engineer and the Oireachtas Members for the constituency, met the Minister for the Environment. The members of the deputation were very hopeful following that meeting that it would only be a matter of weeks or, at worst, months before the project would be approved.</P>
    <P>When the project did not receive approval in the following six months, Senator Finneran and I raised the matter in an Adjournment debate.  We were told the council's proposals would be given due consideration in the context of the 1997 capital works programme.  However, it is now May 1997 and so far no approval for the project has been forthcoming.  I also appeal to the Minister to provide positive news at last for the people of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have an interest in this project.  Representations were made to me about it but I was unable to attend the meeting on Monday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this matter.  The Senators will recall that the Ballagh-Ballybeg water supply scheme was raised in the House in July last year. I do not intend, therefore, to outline again the scheme's planning history to date except to say that Roscommon County Council submitted a preliminary report for a project to serve the Ballagh and Ballybeg areas costing an estimated £1.6 million.  This scheme, however, would not provide the smaller distribution networks needed to serve all houses within the catchment and it is intended that group schemes would provide the necessary infill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that this year's capital investment programme for water and sewerage projects, amounting to over £150 million in total, is the largest ever, it has not been possible to include the Ballagh-Ballybeg scheme in the programme for the current year.  County Roscommon as a whole is faring very well as far as capital investment in water and sewerage projects is concerned. Four major sewerage schemes at Monksland, Boyle, Ballaghadereen and Roscommon, costing £10 million, are being advanced to construction under the water and sewerage services capital work programme for 1997.  The £3 million Boyle-Ardcarne water supply scheme will reach <Col N="596" /> substantial completion this year and a further two water supply projects are being advanced through the planning stages &mdash; Tarmonbarry water supply scheme, costing £850,000, and the north-east Roscommon scheme, costing £2 million.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to examine how these schemes are being funded.  All schemes in the county which are at construction or approved for construction are being supported by the European Regional Development Fund or the Cohesion Fund.  The ability of a project to attract EU co-financing greatly improves its prospects for approval.  Regrettably, it has not been possible to secure EU co-financing for the Ballagh-Ballybeg scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran will appreciate that many demands are made on the limited Exchequer resources for new water and sewerage projects. It is essential that funding is provided for water and sewerage projects which are needed to maintain existing employment and to support new job creation initiatives.  Economic justification and the impact of investment on economic activity generally is a key consideration in prioritising schemes for approval.  For example, Tarmonbarry water supply scheme is urgently needed to support tourism development associated with the expansion of the cruiser and other river based tourism activity locally.</P>
    <P>The strong case for the Ballagh-Ballybeg scheme is fully appreciated.  The possibility of authorising Roscommon County Council to advance the project will be kept under review.  I am mindful of the Senators' concern in this regard and I will ensure that the Minister is made aware of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said: &ldquo;Regrettably, it has not been possible to secure EU co-financing for the Ballagh-Ballybeg scheme.&rdquo;  Will the Minister of State clarify that point because it is strange that the area does not qualify for EU co-financing, or is there a problem in that regard?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify this aspect because it would be serious if the scheme did not qualify under EU guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  This matter calls on the Minister for the Marine to abandon the existing plans for a marina at Greystones, County Wicklow.  Great mystery and delay surrounds these plans which have puzzled the people of Greystones.  The main objection to the marina is that it is being imposed on the people of Greystones without consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> One of the extraordinary things about politics in Ireland is that large superstructures are imposed on communities without consultation. They have little say about their shape and they have no say about the final product.  Greystones is a prime example of this at present.  The lack of information is insulting to the people there.  There was one consultative meeting on 18 February where the people of Greystones received sparse information about something which will change the entire face of the village.</P>
    <P>The principal objection is not that the harbour should not be developed &mdash; something should be done about it &mdash; but the scale of the project which is being imposed without consultation.  The scale of the marina is massive, involving the building of approximately 712 units.  It is a major development and the local community should be consulted. It will not only change the shape and structure of the village but its purpose and trading patterns.  It will also change the number of visitors to the village and the direction from which they come.</P>
    <P>The project involves a 300 berth marina and the current estimate is that only 15 members of the Greystones community would use it.  The marina will be used by 285 boats from outside the area, but the people of Greystones have as yet had no say in whether they want this facility.  The county council appears determined to go ahead with the plans and to negotiate with the businessman who wants it to proceed.  However, the community should not be destroyed or devastated by commerce without it being the subject of detailed consultation.  The project will involve large scale rezoning of land from residential to amenity use.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be interested to know that an extensive leaflet campaign has been carried out in Greystones by the Greystones Protection and Development Association. It received a 90 per cent response rate, so great is the feeling among the residents that they have a right to consultation and an input.  The old harbour undoubtedly needs improvement.  It is in an appalling condition. Nobody is denying that it is in need of renovation and rebuilding, that it should have complete public access &mdash; one of the principles upon which it should be rebuilt &mdash; and that it should have access for fishing, boating and sports and leisure facilities for the people of Greystones.  However, the visual monstrosity proposed will destroy Greystones as we know it.</P>
    <P>I am not calling for a plebiscite as local plebiscites are unsatisfactory.  However, I am putting forward the case for central and local government not to run with some hare brained scheme which seems like a good idea in the abstract but which is utterly offensive to the people of the area.  I am asking the Minister to abandon the present plans and go back to the people who live there &mdash; not the county council, businessmen, people who live outside the area or the sailors who will swan in and spend a day there &mdash; and say to them whatever they want will be done but that the complete <Col N="598" /> transformation of their community will not be allowed without consultation.</P>
    <P>The marina as it stands is a monstrous project in terms of scale and I ask the Minister to give a pledge to reduce it to a level acceptable to the local community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to reply to this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Marine.  It is important to make it clear to the House that neither the Minister for the Marine nor his Department has any plans for a marina in Greystones.  Any such marina would require the Minister's prior consent in the form of a lease of foreshore which would set conditions on the construction and operation of the facility on the foreshore.  No lease will be granted until he is satisfied that its impact on fisheries, navigation and the marine environment are acceptable. The onus is on an applicant for a lease to show the effects of their proposal and to propose mitigation measures to compensate for otherwise undesirable effects.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is not privy to the detailed plans of any developer for this site, he is aware that Kirkham Enterprises, a company owned by Albert Gubay, expressed an interest in developing a 300 berth marina housing a conference and leisure centre on 22 acres of State foreshore plus adjacent county council lands just north of Greystones harbour, County Wicklow. Application was made to the then Minister for the Marine in September 1994.  On the basis of the outline specification supplied in autumn 1995 the Valuation Office computed the fair rental for a 35 year occupancy of the State lands in this fashion at £103,000.</P>
      <P>On the advice of Wicklow County Council that the proposal represented an important economic and employment opportunity for north Wicklow, the Minister agreed with the consent of Minister for Finance to offer a lease at a significantly lower figure to the county council subject to a number of conditions, namely, substantial completion by 1 March 2001 or an agreed later date; reservation of a right to repurchase the property at the sale price if not completed on time following purchase; adequacy of the coastal protection works involved and zero adverse effect on the coast north and south of the development; continued county council sponsorship of the project; acceptability of the detailed design and statutory environmental impact assessment under the Foreshore Acts and compliance with any necessary local government planning consents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offer of a lease of foreshore issued to Wicklow County Council on 16 March 1996.  The council has indicated verbally that the offer is acceptable.  It will not be responding formally to the Department of the Marine until it has progress to report.  The Department of the Marine cannot progress the project pending formal acceptance of the leasing conditions and submission <Col N="599" /> of the detailed design and necessary environmental impact statement.</P>
