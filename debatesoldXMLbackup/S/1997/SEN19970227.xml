      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to report on the discussions of the interdepartmental committee established by her to address the special needs of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Kennedy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication to give approval to Killenaule Community Television Company Ltd. for a TV retransmission system as requested by the company in its formal application to the Department on 16 January 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction and provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mullooly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide immediate sanction to the board of management of Lanesboro Community College, Lanesboro, County Longford, to advertise the proposed school extension for tender so that work on the project can commence in early Summer 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> I have also received notice from Senator O'Toole of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, in light of the indentification by the media of the nine Liberian refugees who were allowed ashore on Tuesday, 25 February 1997, to ensure that all personnel working in the media in Ireland will not repeat such a life-threatening exercise.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney, O'Kennedy, Finneran, Mullooly and O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Mooney's and O'Kennedy's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Finneran, Mullooly and O'Toole may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1, Second Stage only, will be taken from now until 1 p.m., with 20 minutes per speaker.  Item 2, Second Stage, will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 o'clock, with 20 minutes per speaker.</P>
      <P>For the information of Members who have raised this matter previously on the Order of Business, the Universities Bill has now completed Committee Stage in the Dáil.  It will probably be completed there in another two weeks.  I expect that the Seanad will commence considerations on the Bill either immediately before or after the Easter recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is acceptable to us and the times are agreed.</P>
      <P>Recently I had occasion to look for bound volumes of the Official Report of debates in the House for the 1993 period.  I was amazed to discover that bound volumes are only available up to March 1991.  For some reason no bound volumes after that date are available.  I inquired further and discovered that more recent volumes, up to mid 1995, are ready and at the printers.  In all fairness, bound volumes should be made available, especially for anyone wishing to research what happened in the last four or five years in the Seanad.  Any delay in preparing the bound volumes should not exceed one year.  Will the Leader investigate the matter?  I would appreciate it if something could be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Such material should be available on computer disc and if people want to have dusty volumes as well that is fine.  I understand that an attempt to put the material on disc is in hand.  It would be worthwhile knowing what stage it is at.  It is easier to deal with in disc format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weeks ago I raised with the Leader the question of making available to Members of the House the Buckley report on salaries and allowances for higher civil servants and Members of the Oireachtas, but it still has not been made available.  The discussion has almost concluded in <Col N="427" /> the media and at Government level and it is a breach of industrial relations principles.  It should be made public.  There is nothing to hide.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader clarify the Government's position on VAT on créches?  Are the proposals on hold?  I have received many queries on this matter.</P>
    <P>Last year the House discussed a motion on flooding and legislation was passed.  In particular the situation in north Clare and south Galway was discussed.  A number of investigations were established at the time to resolve the problem. Will the Leader clarify the matter with the Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's comments that he considers the present arrangements regarding the circulation of reports to Members to be unsatisfactory.  Will he arrange an early meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss this matter so as to ensure that Members receive reports and are fully briefed before discussing issues in the House?</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader indicated that he would give a date for a debate on agriculture.  When will that debate take place?</P>
      <P>What is the Government's attitude to the Gilligan case which was before the High Court yesterday? Will there be amending legislation covering the Criminal Assets Bureau or will other measures be taken to ensure that pursuit of assets which are allegedly from criminal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the matter clarified by Senator Enright.  However, my question was to the Leader rather than the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator would be just as capable of answering from the back benches of the Dáil as from the back benches of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>What is proposed, in addition to any appeal, by way of amending legislation to ensure that this loophole is closed?</P>

      <P>Nobody has yet received the sports report referred to yesterday and due for discussion next Wednesday.  Will the Leader ensure that we receive it as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I welcome the decision of the Revenue Commissioners to suspend collection of VAT on child minding and créche facilities.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business yesterday and was supported by Senator Lanigan and Senator Henry.  I recommended that they should suspend collection until the issue was clarified and I am glad they have done that.  The education content of child care is such that it should be exempt from VAT and I hope that will be the final decision of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I understand youth legislation is likely to be published in the next two weeks.  I welcome that. We have had several debates in the House on the importance of youth affairs, particularly young people who leave school early without qualifications. Last week the House had a very positive debate on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that the Revenue Commissioners reacted very positively to what was said in the Seanad yesterday, even though the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> gives the impression that there was no mention of VAT on créches and play schools in the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader tell us when the House will debate the National Roads Authority?  This is a matter of great concern to many people.  The last time I raised the matter I asked the Leader for an urgent debate in the context of gridlock developing on the approach to Waterford and problems on the Dublin to Waterford road through Kilkenny.  Road works are being carried out on the Kilkenny side of County Waterford along the Suir.  The regional hospital in Waterford is on the wrong side of the river which has only one bridge.  Will the Leader arrange for an urgent debate?  There is an ambulance or paediatric &ldquo;flying squad&rdquo; in the south east which can take three hours to get from the regional hospital in Waterford to Kilkenny, Clonmel or anywhere else in the south east because of the road works.  It is nonsense that the National Roads Authority will not give permission to have a second bridge built over the Suir or develop the N9 or N10 into Waterford.  It is a crisis.  The National Roads Authority have responsibility to develop the national road network and I ask the Leader to arrange for an urgent debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I raised the issue of settlements in east Jerusalem and suggested we should protest vehemently against them.  Yesterday afternoon the Israeli Government gave permission to build 2,456 new settlements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am developing the question. Both Houses of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to deal with this matter.  If the Israeli Government continues with the building of these houses we should not allow the Government to ratify the EU-Isael agreement which is due for ratification in the coming few weeks.  I am glad <Col N="429" /> that the Tánaiste vehemently protested against the building of these houses in east Jerusalem.  If the Israeli Government persist, can we ensure that the Government does not ratify the EU-Israel agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Sullivan's call for the youth services legislation to be published and brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  This Bill has been in incubation for the past 20 years.  It is important for youth service providers and the thousands of people who give their time voluntarily that there is legislation.  Will the Leader ask the Government when this legislation will be introduced?  It will be a lengthy Bill and it is important that it is passed before the election.  Of course, we can also discuss it after the election.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader speak directly to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht concerning the proposal by U2 to have their concert in the Phoenix Park this summer?  It is a disgrace that the leading Irish rock band cannot play in their own city.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to knock a few heads together in Dublin Corporation and the Office of Public Works in order to resolve the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all anxious to encourage co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic in non-contentious areas.  Will the Leader congratulate the Minister for Health and his predecessor on the encouragement they gave to the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland to establish an institute of public health for the whole island?  This body is to be supported by the Department of Health here and the Department of Health and Social Services in Northern Ireland.  It is by making efforts in these areas that we show co-operation between the two jurisdictions is possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>On last week's Order of Business, I raised the question of broadcasting Seanad debates.  I asked the Leader to speak to the Broadcasting Unit.  They had in fact shown the Seanad proceedings but had done so before they had shown Dáil proceedings, which was unusual. I wish to withdraw my request and I apologise to the staff of the Broadcasting Unit.  As we know, coverage has improved enormously; I just thought they were slipping back into old habits, which they were not.  It was my fault and I was wrong.</P>
      <P>The second issue I raised with the Leader was in relation to the Special Olympics.  I thought it was disgraceful that no member of the Government went out to Dublin airport to greet them. One could not get into the airport when the Olympics were on, but when the Special Olympics were on nobody turned up.  I am glad to see on this morning's newspaper that the situation was rectified through a reception given by the Tánaiste for the Irish competitors in the Canadian Special Olympics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senators O'Sullivan, O'Toole and Lanigan, I too welcome the suspension of the collection of VAT on childcare services.  There is a regulation in place since 1977 which will have to be dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners. Through the Leader, I appeal to the Government to move now to resolve the issue by having childcare, as Senator O'Sullivan said, classified as an educational service, given the huge developmental role played by any childminder.  Such a measure would remove childcare from any VAT liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice to make a helicopter available to the State Pathologist as he has such a heavy schedule.  I do not think it is acceptable to have the State Pathologist travelling in 1897 transport &mdash;the railway train&mdash;in 1997.  I think it is a disgrace that remains should be left lying for up to 24 hours uncovered.  There should be a tent, or some such covering, available in every district to put around the bodies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to make a helicopter available to the State Pathologist in times of crisis and in view of the fact that so many murders are being committed.</P>
      <P>I agree that VAT is not being charged on childcare facilities for the time being.  I ask the Leader whether the Revenue Commissioners withdraw themselves or were instructed to do so by the Minister for Finance.  If not, have the Revenue Commissioners become political by withdrawing this contentious tax in the lead-up to a general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly endorse Senator O'Toole's request to the Leader to have the Buckley report debated in this House as a matter of urgency.  We had a brief discussion yesterday on the issue of public salaries which I think tells us more than all the rhetoric about the value placed on public service.  I think the Buckley report would provide an admirable opportunity to discuss the issue seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what has already been discussed on the Order of Business, could I suggest that the Minister for Finance would give a direction to formalise the communication he had with the Revenue Commissioners, or ensure that in the course of the Finance Bill he would put in a provision to guarantee that childcare services would be exempt from VAT?  It is quite clear that there has been Government intervention here.  It is equally clear that any problem which arises between now and the date of the election will obviously get a considered and deeply analysed response from this Government.</P>

      <P>I was contacted by members of the State Pathologist's family who gave me some information and that is the reason I raised this issue in the House some months ago.  I suggested the State Pathologist himself should give me some information; he has not done so.  Listening to the debate here this morning, I know exactly why he has not.  Senator O'Kennedy's contribution reduced this important matter to a trivial question of political point scoring and that is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to give us some indication as to the arrangements for the special debates which are forthcoming, in particular the one on the Luas system.  The transport situation in the city is worsening all the time.  Senator Farrell referred to the 1897 train service; at least trains run on tracks and do not disrupt everything else.  The one place a bus cannot be found in the city, as I discovered this morning, is in a bus lane.  I would welcome a debate on transport which would concentrate on the Luas system.</P>

Senator Mooney, whose views I have supported on many occasions, has raised the subject of rural development in this House.  One of the aspects of rural development is that people living in rural Ireland should have the same facilities as people in Dublin and other cities.

      <P>Senator Dardis asked about the circulation of reports.  When I next have a consultation with the Cathaoirleach, I will ask for an urgent meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss this matter and convey our displeasure to the Department.

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Commissioners of Irish Lights) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to bring this Bill before the House arose from a Supreme Court judgment of July last, which upheld a High Court decision of October 1995, to the effect that the powers given to the Commissioners of Irish Lights under the 1894 Merchant Shipping Act could not be interpreted to include the provision of radio-based aids to marine navigation which were unknown when the Act was introduced.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners currently provide a range of radio aids to navigation.  All modern aids to navigation are based on the transmission and reception of radio waves.  The primary purpose of the Bill is, therefore, to give the necessary powers to the commissioners to enable them to continue to provide such modern technological aids in the interests of maritime safety.  The Bill also makes further necessary provisions in relation to the functions of the commissioners.  I propose to deal with the main provisions in the Bill later, but it would first be useful to place the Bill in context by outlining the statutory background and powers of the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal basis for the operations of the Commissioners of Irish Lights dates back to an Act passed by the Irish Parliament in 1786.  That Act created a &ldquo;Corporation for preserving and improving the Port of Dublin&rdquo; whose functions <Col N="437" /> were, as its title suggests, the maintenance and development of Dublin port.  In 1810, subsequent to the abolition of the Irish Parliament, the British Parliament passed the Lighthouses (Ireland) Act which gave the corporation all powers, duties and functions relating to the control of lighthouses around the coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, established a &ldquo;Port of Dublin Corporation&rdquo; to superintend and manage the lighthouses in Ireland and the adjacent seas and islands and from then on the corporation, when exercising these powers, acted as separate and distinct from the corporation for preserving and improving the port of Dublin.  The Dublin Port Act, 1867, gave formal legal recognition to this state of affairs by serving the two bodies. The Port of Dublin Corporation was given the new name of the &ldquo;Commissioners of Irish Lights&rdquo; but retained its constitution as laid down in the original Irish Act of Parliament of 1786, while the other corporation became the &ldquo;Dublin Port and Docks Board&rdquo;, with its own constitution.</P>
    <P>The constitution of the commissioners, which is effectively still the same today as laid down in the 1786 Act, provides for the election of 17 members who are nominated by the body itself as vacancies arise.  It also provides that the board of the commissioners shall comprise three representatives of Dublin Corporation, whose successors are nominated by the corporation, and the Lord Mayor of Dublin <i>ex-officio.</i>  Under the Irish Lights Commissioners (Adaptation) Order, 1935, which legitimised the functions of the commissioners in the Irish State, the election of a new commissioner by the body itself can be disapproved by the Government. However, this power has never been exercised.</P>
    <P>The current powers of the commissioners derive from the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. Under this Act, the superintendence and management of all lighthouses, buoys and beacons in Britain and Ireland are vested in three bodies known as general lighthouse authorities.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights is the general lighthouse authority responsible for providing and maintaining aids to navigation throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands.  Likewise, Trinity House serves England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, and the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses are responsible for Scotland and the Isle of Man.</P>
    <P>The Act gives the Commissioners of Irish Lights powers to provide lighthouses, buoys and beacons and enables them to purchase any land which may be necessary for the exercise of their powers.  The overall control of local lighthouses, buoys or beacons provided by individual harbour authorities is also vested in the commissioners.  In addition, the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, gives the commissioners powers in relation to the marking and removal of wrecks which are a danger to navigation where no harbour authority or local authority has the power to do so.  This Act repealed the relevant <Col N="438" /> section in the 1894 Act which dealt with wreck and salvage matters.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are unique in so far as their remit covers the entire island of Ireland.  The services provided by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the other two lighthouse authorities are financed from one source &mdash; the general lighthouse fund.  This fund derives its income principally from light dues levied on commercial shipping at ports in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Light dues collected from shipping traffic at Irish ports are, however, insufficient to meet the cost of the elaborate system of lights required by Ireland's geographical position. Under an agreement reached between Ireland and Britain in 1985, the Irish Exchequer pays the general lighthouse fund an annual supplement towards the cost of the service provided by the commissioners in the State.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the onerous task with which the Commissioners of Irish Lights are charged.  They are statutorily responsible for aiding the safe passage of mariners in and around the entire inhospitable coastline of Ireland which covers over 2,000 miles.  More than 75 per cent of Irish imports and exports rely on our sea routes and the commissioners are responsible for the protection of this vital lifeline to and from the outside world.  It should also be remembered that, in addition to inshore sea traffic trading to and from Irish ports, aids to navigation provided in Irish waters are used by a high percentage of vessels plying some of the world's busiest shipping lanes from North America to Britain and mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>In this era of rapid technological change the role of coastal aids to navigation is changing. Traditional visual aids such as lighthouses and buoys are, however, still an essential part of marine safety as the location of hidden or underwater dangers must always be clearly indentified.  Lighthouses and buoys have been modernised in line with technological advances.  The automation of all lights under the control of the commissioners will be complete when the Bailey Lighthouse is demanned in April and all buoys are now solar powered.  As technology advances, the lighthouse will come to be thought of more as a hazard warning than a point-to-point aid to navigation around the coast.  Radio navigation systems provide the enhanced position fixing accuracy required by modern shipping.  The speed of vessels is increasing and there is a greater risk of marine pollution.</P>
    <P>The varied nature and topography of the Irish coast requires a mix of traditional and modern aids to navigation to guide seafarers.  The commissioners carefully select each aid to navigation to mark a particular local danger or hazard while ensuring that these aids link up with adjacent aids in order to form a comprehensive chain of navigational aids all around the coast.</P>
    <P>The commissioners provide not only traditional visual aids such as lighthouses and beacons but also a variety of modern electronic aids which <Col N="439" /> allow vessels to determine their position by interpreting radio signals from transmitters on shore. The four types of electronic aids provided by the commissioners are radio beacons, radar beacons &mdash; known as racons, radar target enhancers and the differential global positioning system&mdash; DGPS.  I would like to briefly outline the manner in which these radio systems operate.</P>
    <P>Radio beacons are radio transmitting stations which operate in the low and medium frequency bands and provide ground wave signals from which ships can obtain their bearings by means of direction finding receivers.  Racons are radio navigation devices which allow ships' radar to identify the geographic location of the device. Radar target enhancers are devices which automatically transmit a signal in response to an interrogating signal received from ships' radar.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these devices is to improve the radar return signal from navigation marks and to improve radar detection of small craft so as to reduce the risk of collision.  DGPS improves the accuracy of the satellite global positioning system &mdash;GPS &mdash; which is a navigation service operated by the United States.  The DGPS involves having, at precisely known locations, reference stations which provide real-time corrections to the signals of GPS.  Differential corrections are transmitted by radio beacons to any user of the GPS who is near a reference station.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have provided radio aids to navigation since 1931.  They currently operate 25 such aids around the coast of the Republic. However, as I indicated earlier, the courts have ruled that these systems are <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of the commissioners under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  In 1979 the UK amended that Act to provide for the inclusion of radio aids to navigation in the powers of general lighthouse authorities in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The role of the commissioners is clearly of the utmost importance, involving as it does accident prevention, pollution avoidance and, above all, safety of life at sea.  It is vital, therefore, that the commissioners be given the necessary statutory powers to continue to provide modern aids to navigation in the interests of maritime safety.  It is against this background that I now wish to outline the main provisions of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill rectifies the legal deficiencies identified by the courts by giving the commissioners, in relation to maritime navigation, powers to construct, operate and maintain radio navigation systems. It also allows the commissioners to purchase land for this purpose.  The Bill validates the provision of radio navigation systems in the past. The commissioners provided these systems in the interests of maritime safety.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> The Bill also provides that the commissioners shall be responsible for the superintendence and management of all maritime radio navigation systems. As indicated earlier, the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, vested the superintendence and management of all lighthouses, buoys and beacons, including those provided by harbour authorities, in the commissioners.  It is, therefore, considered appropriate that this Bill should extend the commissioners' management function to cover radio aids to navigation in this jurisdiction in the same way that they are responsible for such aids in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, co-operate with other agencies, including a competent authority of another jurisdiction, in relation to the provision or operation of radio navigation systems and any services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution or related matters.</P>
    <P>This provision recognises the fact that international co-operation is of vital importance in the provision of aids to navigation and in relation to maritime navigation in general.  There is, in this regard, ongoing co-operation between the Commissioners of Irish Lights and the two general lighthouse authorities serving England, Scotland and Wales.  The three general lighthouse authorities are at present developing closer planning and operational functions.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights are represented on the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities.  This association promotes co-operation between lighthouse authorities and the co-ordination of worldwide standards on aids to navigation matters.</P>
    <P>It was considered prudent to also allow the commissioners to co-operate with other agencies on the provision of services relating to wreck location, pollution or related matters.  This could be of particular benefit in an emergency where the commissioners' light tender ship may be able to provide assistance to the Department of the Marine or other competent authorities.  I should mention that the Irish Lights tender <i>Granuaile</i> played a prominent role in the search for the <i>FV Carrickatine</i> which was tragically lost off the Donegal coast in November 1995.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision which gives the commissioners power to make financial contributions towards the funding of bodies concerned with maritime navigational assistance. However, this power may be exercised only with the consent of both the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights currently make financial contributions to the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities in respect of their membership of that body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> A further provision in the Bill allows the commissioners, for gain or otherwise, to enter into agreements, with the consent of the Minister for the Marine, for the provision of maritime navigation systems and services relating to maritime navigation, safety, distress, wreck location, pollution and related matters on behalf of harbour authorities and other third parties.  The need to include this provision arose following legal advice received by the UK Department of Transport which indicated that the maintenance of a third party's buoys is <i>ultra vires</i> the powers of Trinity House, the general lighthouse authority throughout England and Wales.  This advice also applies to the Commissioners of Irish Lights with regard to the provision of such services to third parties such as harbour authorities.  The commissioners currently maintain in excess of 50 lights and buoys within harbour limits.  The Bill validates services provided by the commissioners to harbour authorities to date.</P>
    <P>Legislative action is also being taken in the UK in this regard.  A Merchant Shipping and Maritime Security Bill, currently before the British Houses of Parliament, contains a similar provision which will allow general lighthouse authorities to enter into agreements with third parties.</P>
    <P>In order to cater for possible future developments in technology I have taken this opportunity to include in the Bill a provision enabling the Minister for the Marine to confer on the commissioners appropriate additional functions in relation to maritime navigational matters.  The Bill stipulates that orders made in this regard shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary legislation.  As I stated in the Dáil last week, the need for its urgent introduction arose following a letter I recently received from the Chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  He informed me that the commissioners had received legal advice that each commissioner is potentially liable for any claims or expenses arising out of the non-statutory, illegal operation of radio aids to navigation and that they had no option but to notify mariners of the termination of such aids as and from 28 February unless the required legislation was passed or an indemnity was given by the Government. I explained to the commissioners that that is no legislative basis for granting an indemnity as moneys must be voted by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I asked them to bear with me and undertook to introduce the necessary legislation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This Bill will, if enacted, update the powers given to the commissioners under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and allow them to continue to provide modern technological aids to navigation <Col N="442" /> to enable ships, fishing vessels and pleasure craft to sail our waters in safety.  Before I commend this Bill to the House, I would like to refer to the Loran C long range radio navigation project.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Supreme Court ruling of 18 July last arose, in effect, out of a legal challenge to the commissioners' powers to proceed with the erection and operation of the Loran C long range radio navigation system.  Ireland's participation in Loran C was provided for in an international agreement between this country, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and France which was duly approved by Dáil Éireann on 8 October 1992.  The terms of this agreement, as approved by the Dáil, included an undertaking by Ireland that a Loran C radio mast would be erected in the west as an essential link in a system of nine masts stretching from the north of Norway to the south of France.</P>
    <P>Prior to the approval by the Dáil of this agreement, an extensive radio mast site selection study had been undertaken by the Commissioners of Irish Lights with the assistance of a firm of consulting engineers, the University of Wales and the head of the north-west European Loran C programme management office.  System coverage predictions and a detailed set of guidelines informed and guided a detailed geographic and geophysical study of 40 possible sites.  This study led the team to select the site currently envisaged for erection of this mast at Loop Head.  The detailed guidelines required, <i>inter alia</i>, that the site be both extensive and flat with no adjacent mountains or hills and that it should be in an area of low population density and be removed from other major public infrastructures and power lines.  The Loop Head site was regarded by the team as that which best met the detailed selection criteria developed in advance of the study.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Irish Lights, acting as agents of the Minister for the Marine and on foot of the above-mentioned site selection study and the approval of the Dáil of the international agreement, subsequently applied for and obtained on 4 November 1994, on appeal for and Bord Pleanála, planning permission to proceed with the erection of the mast at Loop Head, County Clare.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the commissioners have been unable to proceed with the project because of litigation connected with both relevant marine and planning legislation.  The House will also be aware that, since the approval by the Dáil in 1992 of the Loran C agreement and the completion of the planning process in 1994, considerable disquiet has been expressed about visual and health aspects of the mast at the chosen site and, more fundamentally, whether we should even be party to the agreement in the first place.  Claims <Col N="443" /> that the system was a threat to health, infringed our neutrality, constituted a damaging environmental intrusion and was already obsolete were levelled against the proposal.  The intensity with which these claims were pursued contrasted with the lack of substantive public or political debate in 1992 when our national policy in relation to Loran C was being decided.  Thus the current debate, being dissociated in time from the original decision, suffers from having no public channel or forum through which these issues, which are of real and legitimate concern to many people, can be aired and informed.</P>
    <P>I regard this state of affairs as unsatisfactory, potentially damaging and inconsistent with the need to ensure the maximum practicable level of public information and consultation.  I wish to inform the House, therefore, that I am not satisfied that the Commissioners of Irish Lights should proceed with the project without first allowing an informed and structured public debate on the issue.  I am also conscious that, notwithstanding the legislation before the House, there remains the possibility of further litigation in relation to the validity of the commissioners' powers at the time to have applied for the relevant planning permission.  Furthermore, I am conscious of the need to ensure that the retrospective legislation currently before the House does not interfere with the constitutional rights of any individuals or groups.</P>
    <P>Having regard, therefore, to the need to allay public concerns about the project and in view of inevitable further legal uncertainties and the need to protect constitutional rights, I have decided on two important courses of action.  First, a public forum, consisting of three individuals including persons with knowledge and expertise in maritime matters generally, will be set up shortly to allow individuals and groups to articulate publicly concerns they might have about the appropriateness of our involvement in the Loran C project in general, about the impact or effect of a Loran C mast on public health and the environment and about the selection of an appropriate site for such a mast.  Second, the Commissioners of Irish Lights will be directed, following the outcome of the current Supreme Court case and the public forum mentioned above, not to proceed with the erection of a Loran C mast at any location without undertaking a renewed and appropriate planning application procedure.</P>
    <P>I intend that the public forum will consult extensively on the general merits and demerits of the project as articulated in the debate to date, on the impacts and effects of a Loran C mast, whether in County Clare or elsewhere, and on the site selection procedure used by the commissioners. The forum will draw on expert advice <Col N="444" /> and will adopt an informed view on the legitimacy or otherwise of concerns and opinions on all these and any other issues put to it.  The proceedings of the forum will be public, open and comprehensive and its report will be published following the completion of its work.  I envisage that its work will take three to four months from its commencement.</P>
    <P>Since announcing the establishment of this public forum in the Dáil last week the following terms of reference for the forum have been drawn up.  First, it is to make arrangements for interested individuals and groups to publicly articulate their views and present supporting evidence, where appropriate, in regard to the proposed Irish Loran C station, with particular reference to the appropriateness of Ireland's involvement in the Loran C project in general; the impact of a Loran C mast on public health and the environment; the selection of an appropriate site for such a mast and any other relevant matters.  Second, based on the proceedings outlined above, it is to make an assessment of these issues and report back to the Minister for the Marine as soon as practicable.  The membership of the forum is currently being finalised and the necessary administrative arrangements being put in place with a view to having the forum up and running as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On this basis and having regard to my statements earlier that this legislation is essential to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue its current work of assisting all vessels on the high seas and close to our coasts to sail our waters in safety, I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I understand that the House wishes to increase the time limit for speakers on this Bill from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide the navigational assistance which is so essential for the maintenance of maritime safety, reducing the risk of accidents and collisions at sea which often result in widespread pollution and loss of life the safe passage of traffic at sea and the maintenance of a high level of marine safety around the Irish coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an island nation, we are heavily dependent on maritime transport.  Maritime traffic is becoming more dense and concentrated and with the rise in economic activity traffic has increased substantially. The Commissioners of Irish Lights have a proud record in the provision of such services. In their unique administrative arrangement and arrangements with the Northern Ireland and UK authorities, they have been successful not <Col N="445" /> only in ensuring safety here but also in the North and the UK and have protected the marine environment for many years.</P>
    <P>They must be complimented on their commitment and concern for maritime safety but their involvement in the proposed Loran C radio navigation system has brought them into the courts and into controversy.  As a result there has been a negative impact on the good work which the commissioners have undertaken.  Unless a speedy resolution to this issue can be found, the commissioners will be drawn into further unhelpful and unfavourable controversy which may damage their good name and reputation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the result of litigation by two farmers in west Clare backed by a huge majority of the local community who oppose the erection of the Loran C navigational mast on the Loop Head peninsula.  This resulted in the High Court and Supreme Court decisions in July 1996.  As in other areas of Government activity, the powers in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, were not interpreted to include current navigational aids.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision in the Loran C case was similar to that given in the Mullaghmore case in that the Supreme Court found that the Commissioners of Public Works did not have the statutory authority to undertake such a venture. However, one difference between this Bill and the Act introduced after the Mullaghmore case was decided is that retrospective legislation was not introduced to cover the three interpretative centres, Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley, which caused controversy at the time. They had to go through the procedures laid down in the new legislation.  This Bill is different in that it gives retrospective powers to the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  If we pass the Bill in its present from, there will be nothing to stop the commissioners from using this legislation in relation to the Loran C navigational system.  I and the people of west Clare are concerned about this.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that this legislation is specifically designed to give retrospective cover to the Loran C project.  Section 3 gives the Commissioners of Irish Lights power to erect systems, develop roads and purchase land.  Subsection (2) states: &ldquo;The Commissioners shall have, and be deemed always to have had, all such.....powers.....&rdquo;.  They did not have these powers before.  This provision has been included to remove any legal doubts that might arise should the commissioners proceed to erect this system after the procedures the Minister outlined today have been concluded. There is no other proposal to erect a maritime installation for which such powers are required. However, I am prepared to listen to the Minister's arguments if he can convince me otherwise. This Bill is specifically designed to facilitate the <Col N="446" /> completion of the Loran C project and it gives legislative cover to the existing navigational aids with which we have no difficulty.</P>
    <P>I admire the professionalism and expertise of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  However, they should reconsider this project and look at alternative proposals.  When I was appointed Minister for the Marine in 1987, I examined the administrative and legal arrangements governing the protection of our marine jurisdiction.  I visited the headquarters of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and had useful and informative discussions with them.  I had the opportunity to join the commissioners on their light ship when it visited the Shannon estuary.  I was impressed with their skills and interest in new technological developments which would help them in the work in which they were involved.</P>
    <P>At that time, lighthouses were beginning to be demanned and new technology was replacing systems which had been in place for hundreds of years.  The commissioners were acutely aware of the necessity to avail of modern technology to deal with some of the major problems which could arise in the future.  There is a continuing necessity to look at alternative systems to Loran C, particularly in light of the demanning of lighthouses, the emergence of drug trafficking along the coastline and the opening up of our fisheries to the Spanish fleet.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the amount of maritime legislation he has introduced since he took office.  He has modernised international conventions and introduced new legislative measures to give effect to EU directives.  No Department has responded as effectively to the inadequacies of legislation with which we have been saddled for generations as the Department of the Marine. I pay tribute to the Minister and his staff for the work they have done in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Loran C navigational system has been overtaken by events and many people feel it is not as effective or accurate as they were led to believe.  In light of the controversy which has developed about Loran C and the fact that nothing has happened in the past five years, it is opportune and timely to take another look at alternative systems to meet our requirements. This Bill should exclude the commissioners, the Department or any agency the Government may identify from proceeding with the Loran C navigational system.  This Bill would be passed in minutes if we could get the Minister's reassurance in that regard.  Following the discussion in the other House, it is clear there will be difficulties with the Loran C radio navigational system.  It is a mistake to provide for it in the Bill; it should be specifically excluded from this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision was waiting to happen.  Rather than contesting the High Court <Col N="447" /> judgment of October 1995, the commissioners should have been grateful to the Clare farmers and their solicitor, Mr. Michael Nolan, for bringing these proceedings which identified the lack of legislation to deal with these issues.  Had it not been for that case and the Supreme Court judgment, which confirmed the High Court decision, a major tragedy could have occurred along the coastline and the commissioners' powers could have been challenged and found to be inadequate.  This would have had expensive and far-reaching consequences for the commissioners and the Government.  The public owes a great debt of gratitude to the people who challenged the validity of the merchant shipping legislation. These people made stringent efforts to mobilise public support in west Clare against the project which they felt was not adequately researched. They were concerned about its long-term reliability, what it meant for our neutrality and its effect on the environment and on people's health.</P>
    <P>On 18 February in the Dáil the Minister put on record extracts from a letter he received from the Chairman of the Commissioners of Irish Lights. It was regrettable that the chairman sent a threatening letter to the Minister for the Marine suggesting that the lights around the coast would be switched off unless legislation was introduced to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I was a Member of a number of Governments and if such a communication was received by a Minister that chairman would be quickly called to account for his comments.  On a number of occasions I observed similar bully boy tactics being used by some of the semi-State bodies in relation to their obligations.  Whenever this occurred, the Government quickly pointed out the consequences for these bodies if they persisted with such tactics.  Did the Taoiseach see this letter and was the Government aware of it?  No Government or Minister for the Marine can give in to threats.  I deeply appreciate the work done by the Commissioners of Irish Lights but it is unbecoming for the chairman to behave in this fashion.</P>
    <P>If we pass this legislation, which gives sweeping powers to the commissioners, we can expect to see them use similar jackboot tactics on the communities in west Clare or other parts of Ireland. I am not prepared to accept this type of behaviour from the chairman of a body which has an onerous responsibility.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights cannot be allowed to dictate policy to the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister was angered by accusations that he had misled the Dáil and the public about the Loran C issue.  The Minister is a responsible, straightforward and trustworthy man and I do not accept that he intends to deceive anyone or act in <Col N="448" /> an underhanded manner.  However, he is being badly advised by people who would like to see this legislation passed on the back of threats to switch off the lights around the coast.  Such an action would create chaos for shipping and that chaos is being threatened in order to achieve the installation of the Loran C system.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable if the Loran C system was excluded from this Bill.  Another Bill could be introduced if the commissioners remained in favour of this system following the deliberations of the forum.  That Bill could outline the terms of reference for the forum.  Work could begin following the passage of the Bill giving statutory cover to the existing systems of lights and buoys. This approach would have the advantage of providing a statutory framework for the airing of objections, similar to the planning laws.  It must be borne in mind that Clare County Council unanimously rejected the proposal for this system.</P>
    <P>The forum announced by the Minister has received no response from the people of west Clare.  The vast majority of them, even those willing to entertain the project initially, would like to see the Loran C system sink into the Atlantic off Loop Head.  People in Loop Head, the Shannon estuary and west Clare are aware of the importance of safe navigation for the maritime sector.  However, they do not want the Loran C system because of health, environmental and other concerns.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know that, no matter how democratic or expert his forum may be, the people of Loop Head will accept no recommendation other than the rejection of this proposal. Having rejected this system, it would not be fair or reasonable for the people of west Clare to try to impose it on any other community.</P>
    <P>This is an opportune time for the commissioners to examine alternatives.  The Minister can assist them in this task.  I suggest that he establishes a task force which includes experts on international navigational and safety systems.  This task force should examine all possible alternatives and recommend to the Minister of the day a course of action to ensure that the safest and most reliable safety navigation system is in place. When we had difficulties in relation to the provision of a west coast search and rescue service and problems as to how it might be undertaken, bearing in mind the service was being provided by the Air Corps at Baldonnel, a task force was established under the former Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  He reported within six months to the Government and made recommendations which resulted in the setting up of the search and rescue service on the west coast, which has been an outstanding success.  Before that decision was made, it is fair to say officials and <Col N="449" /> Ministers did not have a clear view as to how we should proceed.  The task force, which included a representative from the European Union, provided much expertise.  We could avail of the expertise of a representative from the European Union in the task force I suggest the Minister set up.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest that the Minister exclude the provision for the Loran C system from the Bill. He should set up a task force rather than a forum to discuss Loran C. A task force could draw on international expertise and set down a set of procedures designed to achieve the best possible navigation system, after which we could decide on how they could be implemented.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the Loran C system.  The Minister will be aware that Decca has served the marine community in many parts of the world for over half a century, and continues to do so.  It was anticipated that when the Loran C system would be put in place the Decca system would remain and both would operate simultaneously.  I, the Minister or his Department do not have the expertise to decide on these matters. He should not rely totally on the advice from the Commissioners of Irish Lights, although it has expertise.  It is necessary to look at international developments in this area.  The Minister has the best interests of maritime navigational safety at heart.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion about the GPS system, the US global positioning system.  As far as I recall when thre was discussion in 1992 about an agreement to which I will refer, it was anticipated that the GPS system would be available for civilian use in 1993.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate the position because the US GPS civilian system was supposed to be in place two years ago. However, this system has been criticised because the US can decide when to turn it on and off. Five or six years ago, moves were being made by the international community which was working on a system known as GNSS, a global satellite positioning system.  It was anticipated as a replacement for all the older system and would be a more sophisticated global satellite positioning system.</P>
    <P>When discussing safety, drug trafficking, navigation or the surveillance of the fishing fleet, I recall the Minister said he would utilise the services of GPS, GNSS or perhaps a combination of the two systems.  In the light of that statement, is it advisable to proceed with the Loran C system five years after the initial agreement was made in Oslo?  Nothing happened in the past five years and given the way we are proceeding, nothing will happen over the next five years.  This brings me to the original agreement which was signed in Oslo on 6 August 1992.</P>

      <P>There is a clause in article 18 of the Loran C agreement for a denuciation of it by any of the contracting parties.  In approximately five years the Government may go to the parties to the agreement and say it no longer wants to be part of it.  That is an option for the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister was sensitive in the Dáil about being unfairly criticised, and I sympathise with him as I also suffered as regards this issue.  He has documentation at his disposal which indicates that I had no hand, act or part in the location of sites.  I am responsible in that I, along with Senator Taylor-Quinn, was a Member of the Dáil when this agreement was unanimously ratified. However, events have overtaken that agreement and circumstances have changed.  The Minister is as aware as I that it is not possible to proceed with this proposal and should exclude it by tabling an amendment which we would support and would result in the Bill being passed in minutes.</P>
      <P>At a meeting between Deputy Bertie Ahern and those objecting to the proposal, I saw a woman of over 70 years of age who had lived in the area all her life being moved to tears of despair at the prospect of this going ahead.  We should not decide on such issues on the basis of sentiment or emotion.  However, those in the locality of Loop Head believe this mast is an unnecessary development.  A large number of people are in despair at the prospect of this development going ahead.  The Minister would give all politicians a vote of confidence if he respected the views of locals by excluding this proposal.</P>

      <P>This Bill is before the House because the people of west Clare took High Court action concerning the powers of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to build radio navigation systems.  That was appealed by the Commissioners of Irish Lights to the Supreme Court which held that the Commissioners of Irish Lights do not have the power to erect radio navigational aids because it was not on the minds of legislators when the 1894 Act was passed.  That was a wise decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been advised by the Commissioners of Irish Lights that if it is to continue to provide radio navigational aids around the coast it would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> and could be liable in the event of an accident.  I sympathise with the Minister who was obliged to introduce legislation to regularise laws governing navigational aids around the coast.  It is important that a proper radio navigation system is in place, as it has been for many years, to ensure safety at sea for personnel on commercial, fishing or pleasure <Col N="451" /> craft.  It is extremely important that the system is properly maintained at all times.</P>
    <P>People in County Clare have always had a good relationship with the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The commissioners give employment to many families in Clare, particularly west Clare, and that has been appreciated for many years.  It is unfortunate that in recent times that relationship has deteriorated rapidly.  It is important to examine why that has occurred.  The primary reason for the deterioration is that the Minister and Department of the Marine employed the Commissioners of Irish Lights to act as its agent for the erection of a Loran C mast on the Loop Head peninsula.  It is important that this House has, for the first time, an opportunity to openly and properly discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>On 6 August 1992, the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government concluded an international agreement.  The agreement, 27 pages long, was very detailed and was not concocted in a few months.  Extensive preliminary negotiations obviously preceded its finalisation.  It was signed on behalf of the Irish Government by Deirdre O'Connor of the Department of the Marine.  The parties to the agreement were the Governments of Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Norway.  The objectives of the agreement were, under Article 2:</P>
    <P>The Main Parties shall provide, maintain and operate the facilities listed in Annex A (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;the facilities&rdquo;) as the basis for the LORAN C System described in Annex C, save that the facilities so listed and described at Ejde shall be provided, maintained and operated by Denmark.  The Parties shall finance the facilities in accordance with the cost sharing arrangements set out in Annex B and the accounting procedures set out in Annex D.</P>
    <P>The reason for this agreement was that the United States indicated that it would no longer use the Loran C system in Europe and that it was prepared to hand over its stations and systems to the countries in which their operations were located.  Discussions were undertaken between those countries and Ireland, where no such facilities existed.  Under Article 2 of the agreement:</P>
    <P>2. Each Party shall be responsible for obtaining the required frequency clearances for its respective areas of responsibility and, in cooperation with relevant national authorities and international organisations, shall seek to reduce interference at these frequencies.</P>
    <P>3.  In accordance with overall policy provisions and common technical standards laid down from time to time by the Steering Committee established by Article 3, each of the Parties shall arrange for the provision or modification (as necessary), and the maintenance and operation of any of the facilities located in their territory; and the Parties shall endeavour to ensure the continuous operational availability <Col N="452" /> of the facilities and to make good with all speed any damage to or destruction of the facilities.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the agreement deals with the administrative organisation which provides for a steering committee and a co-ordinating agency.  Article 4 deals with the functions of the steering committee. The steering committee has the following functions:</P>
    <P>(a)  to determine the overall policy direction for the implementation and operation of the LORAN C system provided for in this Agreement;</P>
    <P>(b) to determine the rules of procedure of the Coordinating Agency;</P>
    <P>(c) to give appropriate directives to the Coordinating Agency and to monitor its activities;</P>
    <P>(d)  to take decisions on all budgetary and other financial matters related to the implementation of this Agreement based on proposals made by the Coordinating Agency;</P>
    <P>(e)  to take decisions on all other proposals made by the Coordinating Agency relevant to the maintenance and operation of the facilities; and</P>
    <P>(f)  to take decisions on proposals made by the Coordinating Agency with regard to the monitoring, operation and control of the chains.</P>
    <P>(2)  In carrying out its functions the Steering Committee shall have regard to the national laws and regulations of the Parties.</P>
    <P>The agreement goes on to deal with the co-ordinating agency and describes its powers.  That agency is obliged to set up a project management team.  A further article deals with exchange of information on developments with regard to technical equipment, antennae, buildings, power, maintenance, spare parts, procedures, monitoring, expenditure and any matter deemed necessary by the steering committee.</P>
    <P>The agreement was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in October 1992 and its approval was passed by the Dáil on 8 October 1992.  The extent of its coverage in the Dáil was one paragraph in the Official Report.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gallagher, moved the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the International Agreement concerning the Establishment and Operation of a Civil LORAN C Navigation System in North West Europe and the North Atlantic in accordance with Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, copies of which Agreement were laid before the Dáil on 24th July, 1992.</P>
    <P>The motion was put and agreed to and the Dáil went on to deal with other business.  The matter was rushed through the Dáil without anybody knowing what was involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> In the meantime, an equally hush-hush operation was taking place in west Clare.  There were whisperings but nobody could get information. There were rumours and counter-rumours about attempts to purchase land and moneys being put on options on land in the Loop Head peninsula. However, it was difficult to find out exactly what was happening.  The truth only emerged much later.  All this activity was taking place long before 1992.  The agreement, which is extensive and goes into fine detail, was being discussed for a number of years in advance of its conclusion, but that was all hush-hush.  Why?  The Minister must answer that question.  It is unfair that he is in such a position because he had nothing to do with the agreement.  However, his hands are tied by the actions of a previous Government which entered into an international agreement and made a specific commitment to fulfilling it. Ireland is bound by the agreement.  Not only did the previous Government do that, it employed an agent, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, to implement the agreement.  Now we must deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>The Loran C system was agreed and put into place without any legislation being put before the Oireachtas.  It was put before the House and a motion was agreed to.  What must be done to get rid of it?  Does the Minister have to refer back to the other signatories to get out of it, or are he and his Department bound by Article 18?  That is the denunciation article in the agreement.  It states:</P>
    <P>After the expiry of ten years from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, any Party may denounce the Agreement within the first six months of the eleventh year.</P>
    <P>The agreement was signed on 6 August 1992. Does that mean that any time after February, 2003, the Minister may denounce the agreement? The article continues:</P>
    <P>2.  Any party which has not given notice of denunciation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall remain bound by the provisions of this Agreement for further consecutive periods of seven years following the expiry of the first ten year period. Such a Party may denounce this Agreement within a period of six months immediately following the expiry of the current seven year period. Such denunciation, which shall be made by notice in writing to the Depositary, shall take effect at the end of the year following the year in which the said notice has been received by the Depositary, or at such later date as may be specified in the notice.</P>
    <P>3.  Any Party having given notice of denunciation shall remain liable for any commitment undertaken under, and any obligation arising from, this Agreement until such time as its notice of denunciation takes effect.  Such Party shall, in particular, remain liable for rendering <Col N="454" /> its contribution under the cost-sharing arrangements set out in Annex B to this Agreement.</P>
    <P>4.  The Depositary shall, in addition to informing the other Parties in accordance with Article 21 of any notice of denunciation, also inform the Coordinating Agency.  On being so informed the Coordinating Agency shall as soon as may be draw up a proposal for amending the cost-sharing arrangements, which shall be submitted to the Steering Committee for decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine should examine article 18.  He should seek legal advice on the denunciation issue to find out if he is fully legally bound by the agreement until 2003 or if his Department can enter negotiations with the parties concerned prior to that year.  Nothing other than a withdrawal from this international agreement will resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>The people of Clare are very concerned about this problem and have highlighted their concerns whenever possible.  The people have taken the matter to the courts on two fronts &mdash; the powers of the Commissioners for Irish Lights and the planning laws.  The issues needs to be addressed quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister finds himself in a situation created by a previous Government.  It is interesting to hear Senator Daly speak on the matter.  One would have thought that he was at a great remove from the matter as an ordinary member of Fianna Fáil from Clare, when in fact he was a Minister of State in the Government which signed the convention.  One would think he was thousands of miles from Clare when the &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; discussions took place about the acquisition of land.  I would be interested to know why and how the specific land areas on Loop Head were chosen.  There were about 40 sites examined and it is curious that the particular site chosen was finally decided upon.  Why were land areas a mile or so on either side not chosen?  I hope such issues will come to light at a later date.</P>
    <P>The Minister has listened over the past few weeks to the concerns I have highlighted on behalf of the people of west Clare and he has responded positively.  A central feature of this affair has been the quick and secretive way in which the matter was dealt with &mdash; the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people of west Clare did not have an opportunity to debate it.  The people of the area were ignorant of what was happening and knew nothing of the Loran C system.  Most of us do not have a technical expertise in the matter. The issue was not dealt with in a democratic manner, but in a secretive manner in the hope of getting away with it.  However, that will not happen. The persistence and determination of the people of west Clare will help them to fight on. As far as we are concerned the Loran C mast will not be built on Loop Head.  The Commissioners for Irish Lights should get that message and if the Loran C system is to proceed they should look elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> The Minister has responded positively by introducing an element of democracy to the debate. He has agreed to set up a forum to listen to the views of the people.  It is in the interest of the people of west Clare that the forum is seen to be independent.  It should not have any ties with the Commissioners for Irish Lights.  I hope the Minister can assure us of the independence of the forum.  In addition, it is important that the forum would meet in County Clare so that the people of the area are not put to any further expense or trouble in articulating their views.  The forum should be available to the people and be seen to work for the people.  It should not be just another arm of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Democracy should be by, for and of the people. On this issue the debate has not been for the people.  The Minister has introduced this aspect of democracy by proposing to establish the forum.  We thank the Minister for this development. The people will have an opportunity at the forum to highlight their concerns on the appropriateness of Ireland involving itself in the Loran C system.  We have heard details of GPS and other systems and how the Loran C system is becoming obsolete.  The US will close down its Loran C system by 2000 and will depend on the GPS system. The Loran C system could be replaced on a worldwide basis by a combination of the GPS and the Decca systems which could be used in conjunction with the local area augmentation system.</P>
    <P>The European Union should examine that possibility because there is increasing evidence that the GPS system is becoming more accurate. In the initial discussion on Loran C fears were expressed about the danger that since the Americans controlled it they could cut if off at various intervals.  That was evident during the Gulf War. Seven or eight months ago we received assurances from the Americans that they will no longer interrupt the GPS system, so we can rely on it. We must examine a combination of other systems in the course of this debate.  Hopefully, constructive proposals will emerge that will forever deem the Loran C system unnecessary and inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The forum will also afford people an opportunity to outline their concerns about the effects and impact of the Loran C mast on public health. They have already done this in numerous fora, including the planning appeal process and various court hearings.  The case has been well put by the people of West Clare.</P>
    <P>The forum will also afford us all an opportunity of highlighting our concerns about the effect of the mast on the environment in general.  The Minister may not be aware that a portion of the Loop Head area has been classified as an NHA and it is possible that portion of it will also be classified as an SAC.  If that is so, there is no way to proceed with any mast, apparatus or construction that would be foreign to the environment of the Loop Head peninsula.  That fundamental <Col N="456" /> issue is emerging now and will definitely prevent the Loran C mast going ahead.</P>
    <P>The final opportunity afforded under this forum will be to discuss the issue of selecting an appropriate site.  From that discussion it will emerge that Loop Head is not an appropriate site.  The Minister should remember that the mast is nothing more than a monstrosity; we are talking about a massive steel erection higher than the Eiffel Tower.  Quite frankly, that is not on and both the Minister and Irish Lights know that.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, the interruptions were uninvited.</P>
      <P>The people of the area will make full use of this important forum.  The net result of this is that the entire Loran C system is up for public debate. For the first time people will be afforded a structured way in which to air their views and concerns. In the event of it being decided to proceed with the Loran C system the entire issue of site selection will be discussed and all 40 sites that were examined previously can be re-examined. This is a positive step and I thank the Minister for agreeing to establish the forum.  He should take note of the concerns that exist about the independence of the forum which will be fundamental to its success.  People will now have an opportunity of preventing the Loran C mast from being built at Loop Head and even preventing the system entirely from being used elsewhere.  I hope people will avail fully of the opportunity that is being afforded to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the discussions I have had with the Minister, he has directed the Commissioners of Irish Lights not to build anything in Clare or elsewhere until all discussions have taken place, <Col N="457" /> the forum has examined the situation comprehensively and has reported its findings.  I thank the Minister for agreeing to do that.  It was a wise decision.  The Minister has also directed Irish Lights to seek planning permission in the event of a decision to proceed with the Loran C system. However, in the view of the experts, this system is not required.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary to legalise the situation and allow the Commissioners of Irish Lights to continue to provide the radio navigation aids which are already in place.  The Bill does not relate specifically to Loran C, but to the navigation system in general.  Before the Committee and Final Stages, perhaps the Minister can seek legal opinion as to the full effects of this agreement. What do we have to do to get out of this system?  Can we sign out of this international agreement?  Can we enter negotiations to sign out of an agreement which was entered into years ago by a previous Administration, or are we bound by the denunciation clause in Article 18 until the year 2003?  The position of the agreement in national and international law is fundamental to the issue which centres on this question.  I hope the Minister can respond to that concern.</P>
    <P>Overall the Bill is necessary and the Minister had no choice but to bring it before the House. The Minister is bound by international agreements that were drawn up by previous Administrations long before he assumed office.  I sympathise with his position.  As a people we have always dealt with national and international business in an honourable manner.  I have no doubt that if we are to break an international agreement we will have to do so legally.  That is why I want the Minister to elaborate on the situation relating to the denunciation clause in Article 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Senator Fitzgerald and I were raised within a few hundred yards of the Atlantic, so the Minister's passing reference to the inhospitable coastline is a bit upsetting to those of us who live or lived there.  I find it quite hospitable.  The Minister's remark might give the wrong impression to those from the east coast who tend to come down regularly to that hospitable part of the country.  I am sure the Minister did not mean that, but I wanted to draw it to his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a deep, long-lasting and abiding love of that part of west Clare around Loop Head.  One of my earliest memories of holidays was as a three or four year old child being taken to Loop Head and shown the moveable altar used during the era of the Penal Laws.  I am sure it is still there.  That part of Ireland is special to many people.  It is important for politicians to recognise that the needs of small groups of people in rural areas are as important as those in the centre of a great metropolis.  That comes through in Irish life time and time again.  I made the point in the House yesterday and again this morning that if the floods in north Clare and south Galway were happening in Donnybrook, a Government commission <Col N="458" /> would be investigating the problem. People in the west are supposed to put up with this hardship for the sake of the rest of us.  We should show interest and concern in their affairs and needs.</P>
    <P>I recognise the pressure the Minister is under in introducing this legislation and the legalities which make it imperative.  I am not an expert, although I do not have a boat, but I think this area is of crucial importance to general safety.</P>
    <P>When listening to the Minister's speech I was struck by the strange position of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  One of the junkets attaching to the honourable role of Lord Mayor of Dublin was an annual tour of the lighthouses and light ships.  It was considered the greatest gourmet experience of all time and it was said that people sought the position of Lord Mayor in order to part take in these outings.  It is an anachronism that the Lord Mayor of Dublin plays such an important role in this area, particularly when responsibilities of the Commissioners of Irish Lights concern the inhospitable coasts, which rarely includes the east coast.  I am not impressed simply by longevity, whether it is the rules that established Trinity College or the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  If it was right 200 years ago is it not time we started changing it?  Perhaps the Minister will examine this issue <i>en passant.</i></P>
    <P>I recognise the need to introduce this legislation. I read it very carefully to see how a position can be arrived at which will protect the legitimate views of people in west Clare and the legislative demands on the Minister.  I would be most uncomfortable voting against this Bill.  If I were to do so, another piece of legislation would have to be brought forward to regularise the position. I will be seeking ways of amending the legislation to ensure that the Loran C issue is dealt with and will table an amendment along the following lines:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any powers or provisions conferred on the commissioners or the Minister by this Act, nothing in it shall be used to give effect to the operation of a Loran C radio navigation system.</P>
    <P>This provides an easier way forward than the complicated system of public hearings and I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to it.  I hope my amendment will receive the support of Members.</P>
    <P>I am worried that the Commissioners of Irish Lights can place the Minister in a situation which necessitates him bringing forward urgent legislation. There is something deeply wrong in the relationship which allows this to happen.  Will the Minister explain how their previous powers were interpreted to allow them do something patently outside their remit?  Despite what Senator Taylor-Quinn says about my knowledge in the area, there seems to be some incompatibility between the Minister's interpretation of the Supreme Court decision and the interpretation of other legal professionals who feel it is only <Col N="459" /> focused on a narrow area of what their powers may or may not be.  The Minister seems to be taking a broader view.  He did not say what legal advice he had taken in order to establish the exact meaning of the Supreme Court decision.  Is the Minister saying that all issues being brought forward by means of enabling legislation are necessary? I would like the legality of this spelt out.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister's view that safety at sea is paramount. Search and rescue was raised on this morning's Order of Business.  It is discussed regularly whenever there are problems at sea or a boat missing.  Those of us brought up in fishing ports know what it is like when one of the fleet does not return and the manner in which a whole community is galvanised into action.  The idea that the Commissioners of Irish Lights were going to turn out the lights all around the coast on the basis that they did not have authority to keep them on smacks of irresponsible behaviour. People should resign their jobs before they turn off all the navigation systems.  Who is going to be responsible for loss of life?  Negligence can be by commission or omission and any court would consider it negligent of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to turn off the navigation system on the basis of legal interpretation.  They would be negligent if by turning them off they created a danger to life at sea.  Would the Minister be held responsible for their negligence?  If the Commissioners of Irish Lights can take a decision like this which will cost the taxpayer money, then we need to know.  It is another reason for examining the present legislation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of unanswered questions about the Loran C proposal.  I have read about and tried to understand this issue and I am unhappy with a number of aspects.  Two things concern me as a citizen and as an elected public representative.  I have a letter from the Department of the Marine to the chief executive of the Commissioners of Irish Lights dated July 1988. The letter raises two fundamental questions, one constitutional the other legal.  I am not playing politics in raising this &mdash; both sides of the House can argue whether it was Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or a Coalition Government that was responsible. I believe it is a question the Minister would want to have answered.</P>
    <P>In this letter from the Department to the chief executive of the Commissioners of Irish Lights in July 1988, two questions are asked.  First, would our participation infringe on our policy of military neutrality given that control of the Southern chain would be in the hands of the French Navy? This question was asked nine years ago, It is a constitutional question asked of the Commissioners of Irish Lights by a diligent civil servant on behalf of the Department of the Marine. It is a constitutional question of some moment and it becomes more important in the light of the global anger towards the French authorities' nuclear testing in recent years.  It needs to be answered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> The second question which is more relevant to this legislation is legal: does our participation in Loran C require special legislation or Dáil approval?  Are the Commissioners of Irish Lights empowered to construct and operate the Irish station?  If that question was asked by the Department in 1988, who answered it?  If the matter was drawn to the attention of the Commissioners of Irish Lights nine years ago and they were made aware of that query, what did they do about it? Did they advise the Department further?  Why is the Minister now being forced into legislation when this information was lying around nine years ago?  There is something wrong there, perhaps there is a simple explanation.  I do not pretend to know of any explanation but I will not let the issue pass.  The Minister is entitled to that information, as would any Minister for the Marine since 1988.  This is something into which the Minister should look.</P>
    <P>In his response, I would like him to deal with the constitutional and legal issues raised nine years ago by his Department with the Commissioners of Irish Lights asking them to look into the matter.  They must have done so.  I want to know what happened from the time they were asked that question until the time they wrote to him last year saying they were going to turn off the lights of the navigation system.  Somebody should be held answerable for the decisions taken, or not taken, along the way.  Somebody must find out whether the letter from the Department of the Marine was ignored.  If the matter had been dealt with then, this kind of emergency legislation would not be necessary.  I congratulate the civil servant who raised that issue; whoever it was had a very clear understanding of the issues. The letter was written following a meeting in Reykjavik where the construction costs of Loran C was discussed.</P>
    <P>If for no other reason, the involvement of the French military authorities would be sufficient for me to oppose Irish participation in a joint project which has the potential to become involved in warfare and the other activities of the French Navy in various parts of the world.  I do not want to be part of that and neither does the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister's comments on the legislation.  They are well weighted and I have no difficulty with what he is saying in terms of explanation.  One of the things happening in this House in recent times is that Ministers come in here, look around and count both sides of the House.  They make judgements to cater to the numbers present.  I would like to know what the Minister thinks of Loran C, not what the Government thinks, not what the Department thinks. When he has heard all the debate, I want him to stand up and say &ldquo;I am the Minister and this is what I think.  I am going back to my Department and this is what I am going to say&rdquo;.  Of course, the Minister must take advice and make a decision based on that advice.  In his well crafted speech, he has very carefully avoided giving any argument in favour of Loran C.  In fairness to the <Col N="461" /> Minister, I think it is important that I point that out.  In fairness to himself, the Minister should not have any doubts about being up front in his views. If, at the end of the day, we all have to change our minds, then we should be prepared to do so if better evidence is presented.  Such evidence is not available at the moment.  Far too many questions remain to be answered.</P>
    <P>I am not going to deal with the health debate about masts and so on; I do not understand it and I am sceptical about the whole issue.  Whenever a mast is erected, there is a queue of people saying it is detrimental to public health.  This may well be the case, but I am leaving that argument aside. However, I do have a view on the technical nature of the mast construction.</P>
    <P>From my days in the FCA and a course I did on radio, I recall that &mdash; whether one is talking about long wave, short wave or the modern variations of same &mdash;land-based radio systems can never match satellite systems.  I know that and the Minister knows that.  For the simple reason line of sight becomes important to radio waves and land intervention can also be a problem in terms of broadcasting.  I believe the Loran C system is a generation behind; it is a generation too late.</P>
    <P>The Decca system, with which we are all familiar works and we understand it.  The global positioning system &mdash; GPS &mdash; is, I believe, the next best system and it is far cheaper than the Loran C system.  The global satellite navigational system has also been looked at and refined in North America and Canada; it is the preferred option for the future by some of the main maritime nations.  I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong about this.  My understanding is that Canada, the US, the UK, Norway and others favour this system as the way forward.  I feel it is.  I do not know why we are erecting masts at all.</P>
    <P>To digress for a moment; the row about ESAT Digifone is a joke because the system could be achieved for half the price <i>via</i> satellite.  We will no sooner have a second digital phone system than we will be selling a satellite phone system in a couple of years.  Such a system exists already. Many boats use satellite phones which cost in the region of £5,000.  The Loran C seems to be a far more and needlessly expensive option than the satellites or GPS.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear by fishermen's associations that the transfer of information from Decca to Loran C cannot be technically streamed and would be difficult to achieve.  That transfer of information is crucial.  Having grown up in a fishing port when the transition was made from the folklore of fishing to new fishing technology, the best fishermen to my mind were the local fishermen in Dingle who knew where every wreck and submerged rock was located and where the shoals were likely to be.  They had received that information through word of mouth and linked it into the technology.  These were successful fishermen. We are now faced with a situation where there is no technical marriage of information between the proposed Loran C and the existing Decca system. <Col N="462" /> The location of every hazard will effectively have to be transferred by the fishermen.  This will cause problems and give rise to inaccuracies and the cost of equiping boats would be in the region of £4,000 or £5,000.  This is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at going straight on, or phasing in, to satellite.  Has he the authority to direct the Commissioners of Irish Lights in a certain direction?  Has he the authority to ask the commissioners not to proceed with this project or to direct them not to do so?  Has he the authority to withhold funding?  I would like an answer to those question.  I would like to know the extent of the Minister's authority in this area.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and Euro Peche &mdash; which I presume means fishermen &mdash; are not in favour of Loran C. If the fishing community and the people of west Clare are opposed to it, why are we proceeding with it?  Who wants it?  I ask the Government and the Minister to separate and distance themselves from the Commissioners of Irish Lights on this issue.  I also ask the Minister to forget about the public forum and to accept my amendment which states, &ldquo;Notwithstanding the powers and provisions conferred on the Commissioners or the Minister by the Act, nothing in it should be used to give effect to the operation of a Loran C navigation system&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the broad cross-party welcome for this Bill in the Dáil, I am delighted to be able to bring it before this House today.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Bill is on Dublin's docklands, an area which has made an invaluable contribution to the development of Dublin as a port and as a city.  In the 18th century, Dublin's working port moved into the docklands area from further west along the Liffey quays, largely because of the need to cater for the increasing size of ocean going vessels.  As the area grew in importance, so too did its overall profile within the city.</P>
      <P>However, the good fortunes of the docklands were not to last indefinitely.  Ironically, the same forces which had led to the area's growth were also instrumental in its decline.  The deeper berthage requirements of ever larger ships and the increase in containerisation saw the port move further eastwards along the Liffey.  Now, the bulk of the working port is concentrated outside the original docklands area, on the north docks to the east of the East Link Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" /> Although the principal port activities have moved on, the docklands area left behind retains many features which provide evidence of its hey-day as part of the working port.  The area is fortunate in having a number of strong residential communities and it also boasts a network of waterways with significant amenity potential.  Its proximity to the city centre adds considerably both to the importance of the area in terms of the wider city, and to the development potential of the area.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the exodus of the port related activities from the area has had significant adverse impacts.  There are many obsolete and undesirable uses in the area, as well as vacant sites, all with their obvious adverse implications. The greater mechanisation of port activities has also significantly reduced a traditional source of employment for the docklands communities. Unemployment in the area is estimated to be running at 30 per cent, far ahead of the Dublin city and county rate of 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>The aim of the docklands initiative is to harness the collective energies of all those interested in the area in order to secure its regeneration.  The engine driving this process will be the special purpose authority to be established under this Bill. It has the potential to secure the vital synergies between the actions of the individual players in the area which would otherwise be lost.</P>
    <P>The docklands regeneration initiative was announced in last year's budget.  As there has been quite a considerable amount of progress with the initiative since then, I would like to take a few minutes to outline the principal developments. I will then detail the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the 1996 budget, a docklands task force representative of the key Departments and semi-State organisations involved was established. The task force was asked to focus on two key issues.  First, it was asked to consider what arrangements should be made to prepare a master plan for the docklands area; and, second, it was asked to make recommendations on the appropriate mechanism for the master plan's implementation.</P>
    <P>The task force got to work quickly and in little over two months submitted a comprehensive report to Government.  The task force concluded that the master plan should be prepared by a team of consultants with the broad range of expertise needed to address the very many serious issues facing the area.  It also recommended the establishment of a new authority which would lead the implementation of the master plan and, ultimately, the regeneration of the docklands.</P>
    <P>Having considered the report of the task force, the Government accepted these two key recommendations. Since then, the first has been implemented through the appointment of a team of consultants whose work on the preparation of a team the docklands master plan is now well advanced. <Col N="464" /> The Bill we are debating today fulfils the Government's commitment to the implementation of the task force's second recommendation, the establishment of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Of course, the task force report was not the only factor to influence the development of the docklands regeneration initiative.  Another significant factor which has come into play is the experience of urban renewal which has been gained since the first urban renewal scheme was introduced over ten years ago.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1980s, many areas in our urban centres were suffering from the urban equivalent of heart disease.  They were simply unable to fulfil their role as the life force of the urban community. Smaller, leaner satellites in the suburbs were assuming much of that role.  Although at that time the word &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; had yet to become fashionable, it was clear that the suburbanisation process which had become established was unsustainable.  Continuously increasing suburban development compelled us to provide a whole range of expensive, new infrastructural services which were already available in city and town centres.</P>
    <P>The aim of the urban renewal schemes was to reverse this trend by encouraging investment back to the hearts of our urban centres.  Under the first scheme introduced in 1986 and its successor which came into operation in 1994, areas designated for urban renewal have seen £1.9 billion of investment to date.  The schemes have, therefore, been hugely successful in achieving their principal aims.  Indeed, a consultants' study on urban renewal published last December strongly supports this view.</P>
    <P>However, the past ten years have shown us that physical renewal alone is not enough to ensure the vitality of our urban centres.  There also has to be social renewal where local communities are given a role in determining the way their area is renewed and benefit from that process.  There is also a much deeper appreciation now of the importance of architectural and urban design considerations in shaping our urban centres.</P>
    <P>The consultants' study on the urban renewal schemes makes extensive recommendations on how these issues can be more fully addressed in the future.  These recommendations are currently the subject of a process of public consultation and a conference to draw together the various strands of opinion will be held late next month.  Proposals for future policy on urban renewal will be submitted for Government consideration in the following months.  While the urban renewal review has yet to conclude, we have already learned from what has emerged to date.  Many of the provisions in the Bill before the House today reflect that learning process.</P>
    <P>Another important factor which has influenced the docklands regeneration initiative is the experience gained in the Custom House Docks and Temple Bar areas.  The docklands area includes the Custom House Docks area, which is <Col N="465" /> home to the now firmly established International Financial Services Centre.  The new docklands authority to be established by this Bill will be fortunate in having this catalyst for further development available to it.  The centre still has tremendous growth potential in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Much of the success achieved to date in the IFSC is due largely to the efforts of the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  Since 1986 the authority has, with the help of the powers given to it under the Urban Renewal Acts, acted as the driving force in turning the Custom House Docks Area around.  In the course of the Dáil debate on this Bill, I placed on record my acknowledgement of the authority's considerable achievements.  I want to do likewise here in this House today.  The 3,500 people now employed in the area will serve as a reminder of the authority's ten successful years, long after it is subsumed into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to be established under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In Temple Bar we have seen the importance of an architectural framework plan.  It facilitates the introduction of imaginative, modern architectural styles in a manner which is sympathetic to the existing built environment.  The Temple Bar and Custom House Docks models have also highlighted the success which can be achieved when a specially focused body is established to lead a regeneration initiative.  At the same time, the size and nature of the docklands clearly illustrate that it would not be well served by a simple replication of either the Temple Bar or Custom House Docks models.  Bringing together the wide range of interests in the docklands will be a fundamental requirement for the regeneration voyage we are about to undertake.  To successfully complete that voyage, sophisticated structures will be required.</P>
    <P>Many influences have been brought to bear in framing this Bill.  The influence of the urban renewal experience during the last ten years is evident in the mandate to be granted to the new authority.  While the authority will have an important function in improving the area's physical environment, its remit will extend far wider than that, encompassing the sustainable social and economic regeneration of the area.</P>
    <P>I earlier referred to the success of the International Financial Services Centre and its potential for future growth.  In recognition of the Government's commitment to the IFSC, the authority will have a specific statutory duty to promote the further development of financial services activities in the Custom House Docks Area.  While the Custom House Docks Development Authority has, in effect, been exercising a similar function since the IFSC was established in 1987, it does not have an express statutory duty, as such, to promote the centre. The new authority will have such a duty under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals in the Bill, the docklands authority will have a council and an executive board.  The council will be responsible for the <Col N="466" /> principle policy making functions of the authority and will be representative of the many organisations with an interest in the area.  The authority's executive functions will be exercised by the executive board.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the individual provisions of the Bill in more detail.  The Bill has four parts containing a total of 58 sections and there are three Schedules.  Part I contains sections 1 to 13. These include the standard technical provisions in relation to the short title, commencement, interpretation, the power to make orders and regulations, repeal of enactments and expenses of the Minister.  Provision is also make in section 11 for the indemnification of certain persons connected with the authority in relation to the bona fide performance of their functions.  Under section 12, the authority will not be liable for damages because of a failure to perform any of the functions provided for in the Bill.  That is a standard provision.  Section 13 deals with the prosecution of offences under the Bill and the penalties applying to such offences.</P>
    <P>Part II is the most significant part of the Bill and covers sections 14 to 47.  Section 14 provides for the establishment of Údarás Forbartha Dugthailte Bhaile Átha Cliath&mdash;the Dublin Docklands Development Authority&mdash;which will consist of a chairperson, a council and an executive board.  Under section 15, the chairperson of the authority will be appointed by the Minister for the Environment, usually for a term of five years.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with the council, which will consist of the chairperson and 25 ordinary members.  While the ordinary members will be formally appointed by the Minister for the Environment, the Bill provides that they will be drawn from the broad range of interests involved in the area.  The relevant Departments and semi-State bodies will be represented on the council as will Dublin Corporation, at both elective and official level.  There will also be representation for organisations concerned with the social, economic or other development of the area, in addition to community based organisations.  The professions concerned with the built environment&mdash;town planning, urban design, architecture, conservation and engineering&mdash;will also be represented on the council, as will individuals with experience in a range of areas which would be of relevance to the authority's functions.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the establishment of the executive board, which will have eight members. Apart from the chairperson, there will be seven ordinary directors who will be appointed by the Minister for the Environment for terms of up to five years.</P>
    <P>Section 18 sets out the functions of the authority. Under this section, the authority will be obliged to secure the sustainable social and economic regeneration of the docklands area, the improvement of the physical environment and the continued development of financial services activities in the Custom House Docks area.  As I mentioned earlier, the authority's remit will be <Col N="467" /> quite broad reflecting the wide range of factors which have a bearing on the regeneration of an area which covers 1,300 acres and is home to almost 17,000 people.  The participation and inclusion of local communities in the regeneration of the area will be vital.  As the future of the docklands area will have a major impact on the future of its people, they must have an important role in shaping that future and be in a position to reap the benefits it brings.</P>
    <P>The types of activities in which the new authority will be involved will be wide-ranging.  For example, it will be able to develop land, carry out environmental improvement works and make provision for infrastructure.  It will be able to promote the co-ordination of investment in the area and the development of an appropriate mix of housing.  Promoting the provision of employment, education and training opportunities, key issues in the overall socio-economic regeneration of the area, will also be a function of the authority.  In addition, provision is made in section 18 for further functions in relation to the regeneration of the docklands area to be assigned to the authority by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Sections 19, 20 and 21 set out the duties and functions of the chairperson, council and executive board.  Section 19 provides that the chairperson will be responsible for securing the efficient discharge of the business of the authority.  This will be achieved through the chairperson's role in chairing both the council and the executive board.  In this role, the chairperson will have a particular responsibility for ensuring that, together, the council and executive board work cohesively and effectively.</P>
    <P>Section 20 sets out those functions of the authority which are to be the responsibility of the council.  In line with the report of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force, the council will be responsible for policy-type matters including the preparation of the master plan under section 24 and the submission of planning schemes for approval under section 25.  Its functions will also include making certain recommendations to the executive board and to Ministers.  Under section 21, the remaining functions of the authority, other than those assigned to the council under section 20, will be the responsibility of the executive board.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 are standard provisions dealing with the meetings and procedures of the council and the executive board.  Section 24 provides for the preparation of the master plan for the docklands area.  The master plan will be central to the authority's work as it will act as the blueprint for the fulfilment of the general duty imposed on the authority by section 18.  Provisions is made for significant public consultation in the course of the master plan's preparation, reflecting the critical importance of bringing all the interests in the area together in support of the plan.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that work on the preparation of the master plan, including extensive <Col N="468" /> consultations with all the interests in the area, has been initiated in parallel to the preparation of this Bill.  This will ensure that the new authority, once established, will lose no time in getting the docklands initiative formally under way.  It will facilitate the authority's early consideration of a range of proposals now being developed by the consultants preparing the master plan who recently published a report setting out their progress to date.</P>
    <P>The consultants' work has benefited from the completion of a number of studies on the docklands area commissioned by the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  These studies cover the area's socio-economic profile, its land use and building conditions and the important features of its architecture and industrial archaeology, all key factors to be considered in preparing a workable master plan.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the making of planning schemes for certain areas, the effect of which is to exempt development complying with the schemes from the requirement to obtain planning permission. A similar power has been available to the Custom House Docks Development Authority in respect of the Custom House Docks area since 1986 and schemes were made in 1987 and 1994.  The process of making a planning scheme provides for consultation with Dublin Corporation and requires the authority to have regard to the corporation's development plan.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 to 33 deal with the financing requirements of the new authority.  The extent of these requirements will be considered by the Government once the master plan, which will include costings and funding options, has been completed.  Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force, the Bill makes for a number of funding mechanisms.  The extent to which each will be used will be determined in light of the financing element of the master plan and the Government decision in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The funding mechanisms which are provided for include Exchequer grants under section 29, borrowings under section 30, some of which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance under section 31, and Exchequer advances under section 33.  The authority's power to borrow will be subject to a ceiling of £50 million on the amount of borrowings outstanding at any given time.  The maximum amount of this which could be sourced from Exchequer advances will be £25 million.</P>
    <P>Section 34 will enable the authority to ensure that it has an adequate number of employees to enable it to perform its functions.  This power will, of course, be subject to appropriate ministerial consents in regard to numbers, gradings and terms of employment.  Under section 56, the existing employees of the Custom House Docks Development Authority will transfer to the new authority on its establishment.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Custom House Docks area, the new authority will also be able to make planning schemes in respect of other areas which are <Col N="469" /> specified by order of the Minister for the Environment under section 25(1)(a).  It is envisaged that the power to make orders for this purpose would only be used where there are special circumstances which make the planning scheme approach appropriate.  Any order made under section 25(1)(a) would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before coming into operation.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for the carrying out of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in connection with planning schemes prepared under section 25.  While it is possible at present to include any EIA-type development in a planning scheme, section 25(1)(c) of the Bill will place a restriction on this.  In future, the EIA related development which may be included in a planning scheme will be limited to industrial estates, urban development projects and sea water marinas.  If any other development to which EIA applies is proposed for an area covered by a planning scheme, it will be subject to the normal requirements of the planning process.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the compulsory acquisition by the authority of land other than land owned by statutory bodies which, under section 28, may in certain circumstances be transferred from such bodies to the authority.  Similar powers are available to the Custom House Docks Development Authority at present.</P>
    <P>Section 41 deals with the disclosure of confidential information by persons associated with the authority, while section 42 prohibits the making of improper communications to such persons. Under section 43, it will be possible for the authority to accept gifts of money, land or other property. However, the authority will be precluded from accepting any gift if the conditions governing its acceptance would conflict with the effective performance of the authority's functions.  The authority will be required to publish details of all gifts accepted by it in its annual reports.</P>
    <P>Section 44 is a standard provision in relation to accounts and audits.  Under section 45, the authority will be required to prepare an annual report on its activities and to provide the Minister for the Environment with such other information relating to the performance of its functions as the or she may request.  Under section 46, the Minister for the Environment will be able to give the authority policy directives and directives in respect of financial objectives.  This is a balanced provision which allows the Minister to give directives which would apply generally to the authority's performance of its functions, while at the same time being clear that it does not confer any power or control in regard to the authority's exercise of its functions in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Section 47 makes provision for the dissolution of the authority by way of order made by the Minister for the Environment.  The authority will not have an infinite life but will aim to fully carry out its duties over a period of ten to 15 years. Once the authority has completed its work, section 47 will enable an order to be made to dissolve <Col N="470" /> it and to make the necessary consequential provisions.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, covering sections 48 to 57, sets out the transitional provisions which will apply to the subsuming of the Custom House Docks Development Authority into the new authority.  Section 48 provides for the transfer of all land and other property from the Custom House Docks Development Authority to the new authority, while section 49 makes a similar provision in respect of rights and liabilities.  Section 50 is necessary in order to provide for the continuation in force of a range of contractual and other agreements.  Section 51 and 52 make similar provisions in regard to the continuation of pending legal proceedings and the construction of certain references to the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  Section 55 provides for the continued admissibility in evidence of documents of the Custom House Docks Development Authority after its dissolution.</P>
    <P>Section 53, which provides an exemption from stamp duty in respect of the vesting in the new authority of property or rights transferred under the Bill, is a standard provision where transfers between public bodies are being provided for. Section 54 provides for the preparation of the final accounts of the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  Section 56, to which I have referred, provides for the transfer of all the employees of the Custom House Docks Development Authority to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Under section 57, the Custom House Docks Development Authority will be dissolved on the date to be specified under section 14 as the date on which the new authority will be established. Section 58, the only provision in Part IV of the Bill, provides for a number of technical amendments of sections 4 and 7 of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, in regard to the making of orders and rates remission schemes under that Act.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule of the Bill describes the Dublin docklands area which corresponds to the area outlined at Appendix 1 of the Dublin Docklands Area Task Force report.  Under section 4, the Minister for the Environment may make an order adjusting the area.  The Second Schedule describes the Custom House Docks area, which corresponds to the area currently defined as such by virtue of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, and orders made under the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987.  Section 5 of the Bill makes a similar provision to that in section 2 of the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987, under which the area can be extended eastwards as far as the East Wall Road.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule lists the repeals to be made by the Bill.  Part III of the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, which provided for the establishment of the Custom House Docks Development Authority, and the entire of the Urban Renewal (Amendment) Act, 1987, are to be repealed.</P>
    <P>This is a comprehensive Bill.  It is necessarily so because of the need to establish structures which <Col N="471" /> will provide for the widest possible degree of participation in the authority's work.  It is also dictated by the need to clearly set out the comprehensive mandate which is being assigned to the authority.  The coming months will see the master plan for the area taking shape.  I very much look forward to this and, more particularly, to seeing the master plan's proposals being translated into reality.  The establishment of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority will be the critical factor in that process.</P>
    <P>The regeneration of the docklands area will not only be important for the area but it will be of immense importance for the city of Dublin and for the nation and it will raise the city's ongoing renaissance.  A city, like any living organism, requires a healthy beating heart.  As a strategic part of the heart of Dublin, a healthy and vibrant docklands area will be of enormous value to the city which has seen many other parts of its central area regenerated in recent years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It might seem presumptuous of me, a culchie in the capital, to respond to this Bill on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  I support the Minister's view that it is vital for any country to have a decent capital city.  For many years, Dublin was in decay with some of its most attractive features threatened by the shifting patterns of trade and commerce.  Some of its traditional industries and businesses declined and there was social deprivation and chronic unemployment which needed to be remedied.</P>
      <P>I was in Government when the first major initiatives were taken by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, to develop the International Financial Services Centre in the Customs House Docks area.  Our present leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was a Deputy for that area and he took a keen interest in its social and economic problems.  I was briefed by the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Padráig Flynn, who adopted a formidable approach to this project.  The International Financial Services Centre is a good example of what can be achieved if the appropriate authority is put in place and given the necessary powers, functions and finances to do its job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I come from the most remote part of the west, I have lived in Dublin for a couple of nights a week for the past 25 years, so I can give a valid assessment of this area.  One matter which should be utmost in the mind of the chairman of the new authority is that this development must contribute to the improvement of the local people's living standards and opportunities. Reports on this area show that many young people are leaving to seek alternative opportunities elsewhere.  The local community is afraid that in developing this area, we may throw the baby out with the bath water.  These people have seen major investments in other parts of the city and they want to ensure that not only will they have a part to play in the preparation of plans <Col N="472" /> and objectives to regenerate the area, but that they and their families will have future opportunities.</P>
    <P>This is a huge undertaking.  We appreciate the fact that the Minister is prepared to take the initiative to develop this area of the city.  He has the support of the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil Party to take whatever measures necessary to ensure the survival of the city and its future development into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister expects us on this side of the House to criticise one or two aspects of this Bill.  I believe&mdash;I am not speaking for Fianna Fáil&mdash;it is difficult for big boards to achieve anything. I am concerned that the authority will consist of a chairman, a council of 25 members and an executive of eight.  I would prefer a small board with a good executive to do the main work and subcommittees could be set up to deal with specific areas.  However, if local or vested interests, such as semi-State bodies which have properties in the area, are represented on such a large board, it will not take initiatives and get results but will be racked with indecision and conflict and be less effective than the Minister would like it to be.</P>
    <P>In 1959 the Government realised that air traffic through Shannon would increase, so it decided to set up the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  It was and still is a small but effective board of nine members.  Its success in the midwest region is an example of how successful a company could be in developing an area, creating jobs and generating economic prosperity.</P>
    <P>My second criticism of the proposed authority is that it should take account of the educational requirements of the local people.  They should be given the opportunity to play their part in the development which will take place at an accelerated rate.  There was a huge development in Money point during the early 1980s which employed approximately 1,500 people.  However, a major criticism was that few local people were employed in its constructions and that although they had to suffer disruption to traffic and business for many years while the project was underway, they did not get permanent employment when it was completed.  I do not know how the Minister can deal with this.  He needs professional help and advice.  Perhaps the new authority could provide this, but it needs to be undertaken soon.</P>
    <P>It will be important that this legislation sets out the education, training and business development opportunities which will be available to the people living in the area.  The majority of these people leave school early and would be less likely to avail of the new opportunities than those from outside.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal initiatives have created over £2 billion in investment.  These have affected most of the larger towns in Ireland.  Almost £20 million has been invested in urban renewal in Ennis.  This far exceeds the initial estimates and has regenerated the town.  There are almost 1,500 acres <Col N="473" /> involved in the Dublin docklands development so it is important to clearly state the tax incentives and initiatives which will be available under the Bill.  These incentives should be targeted at the areas which are most deprived and neglected.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Marine I was able to study some of the opportunities for development which exist in the marine leisure and recreation sector. I am glad that Senator Magner is here as he has a keen, practical interest in maritime affairs.  I was pleased that he accepted my offer to assist the Ringaskiddy free port when it was established and he is very aware of the opportunities offered by our inland waterways and canals.</P>
    <P>The port of Dublin offers enormous opportunities for marine leisure activities leading to the creation of many jobs.  We have neglected our maritime resources and ignored one of our most important natural assets.  There has been some development in the port of Dublin; however, the opportunity remains for the development of additional marine leisure facilities.  For example, there is no junior sail training facility in the city. Many young people are interested in marine leisure activities, yet there is very little opportunity for them to get any training or expertise, apart from piecemeal vocational education committee courses.</P>
    <P>The drive to increase the number of tourists coming to Dublin will have a dramatic effect on the economy of the city.  Many new hotels have already opened.  This has created some apprehension in the west because there is a fear that the east and Dublin will get the bulk of tourism developments over the next few years.  I do not accept this.  Most tourists have an enjoyable experience in Dublin and then travel to the west. There should be no conflict between a thriving tourism business in Dublin and the west.  Such business creates new jobs, industries, leisure developments and tourism business in the city.</P>
    <P>The inner city has had its problems.  There has been a lack of training, a shortage of housing and a decrease in the number of families living there. However, these problems can be addressed by proper planning.  When I was in South Africa during the elections I visited the new waterfront developments in Cape Town.  These are not unlike what is taking place in Dublin port.  Cape Town is a thriving seaport which fell into decline due to the changing pattern of the shipping business. However, the city has regenerated its waterfront and created thousands of jobs.  This has not resulted in any degree of conflict between the local people and those who moved in.  Wealthy people will move into the new docklands environment in Dublin and bring their expensive cars. There will be luxury apartments, as in Temple Bar, selling at £200,000.  However, this should not create any conflict if the development is properly managed and creates an equal opportunity for local families to have a stake in their communities.</P>
    <P>This area has unique assets, such as important heritage sites which need to be protected.  The <Col N="474" /> new authority will face a mammoth task but it can make a meaningful contribution to the overall development of Dublin and the country.</P>
    <P>There will be new investment in the area, including new DART facilities.  The proposal for the Dublin port tunnel is well advanced.  There has been some criticism that adjoining areas such as Pearse Street should be included.  I have been briefed that there are other areas adjacent to the site.  The Minister might put a buffer zone around the area because some people may feel neglected. That happened in the Custom House Docks area and we have heard criticisms made by local people who did not get jobs there.  Although 3,500 people work in the Custom House Docks area, they are all computer or financial service experts. Prospects for young people living in the inner city around the Custom House Docks did not exist. We should look again at the legislation to see if the hi-tech jobs which will be created can be directed at those leaving school who could be trained for these job opportunities.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well, although I am sorry he will not be in office to see this reach fruition because the election will be held&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not hold my breath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the wholehearted support of this side of the House, although we may table amendments on Committee Stage to improve the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to Senator Daly, who made a typically generous speech, that I do not come from the school which claims credit for everything, whether I did it or not.  We openly acknowledge the input of Charles Haughey, Garret FitzGerald and others who were instrumental in getting the International Financial Services Centre up and running.  This project, which will take 15 years, will become the property of successive Governments, and there is nothing wrong with that.</P>
      <P>The speed with which the Docklands Advisory Board worked took my breath away as I have never served on a board which met at 8 a.m.  It was run efficiently by the Secretary of the Department and by an official, Mr. John McCarthy, who did trojan work.  I give them credit for their work, which the Minister truly appreciates. Dublin port as we know it began to develop in 1707.  This project, as it comes to fruition, will change the face of Dublin forever.  Luckily, we are not reinventing the wheel as this has been done in many ports throughout the world. Although it is invidious to copy&mdash;I do not believe copying is a form of flattery but a lack of imagination&mdash;with our weather and so on, we must do things differently to other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern port of Dublin is centuries old and this development will change it forever.  The world of commerce is ever changing&mdash;nothing stands still in the business world, something which Senator Quinn will quickly tell us.  Our <Col N="475" /> indigenous manufacturing industry reduced the amount of produce coming into this country and the use of aircraft and the roll-on/roll-off container ferry did enormous damage to employment in the docklands.  Dublin has now become a large container port.  In common with all other seaports such as London, Liverpool, Bristol and those in the Baltimore area of the United States, the hustle and bustle has come to an end.</P>
    <P>Like those countries, we were left with the problem of deciding what to do with the docklands. How do we regenerate a central part of the city?  When the DART goes to Barrow Street, this will be a central location.  Like those in other countries, this development will be outstanding. The decline of shipping and cargo brought immense misery, massive unemployment, bad housing and education facilities.  Despite the efforts of representatives, this area was abandoned by business and, to some extent, by successive Governments.  It did not rate as priority.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not come from the school which takes credit for everything but I was impressed at the speed with which the Minister for the Environment took this project in hand.  I took it that the backing of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, would be automatic because much of this area lies in Dublin South-East.  Nonetheless, he occupies a pivotal position when it comes to development and I am sure the Minister for the Environment knows that only too well.</P>
    <P>A new opera house has been opened in the Belfast docklands area and a barrier has been built across the River Lagan.  That area is being regenerated as we speak.  It had the same problem of a long established and defunct gas industry which we have in the basin.  It has attempted to deal with that problem, although Dublin Corporation engineers describe it as unsatisfactory.  That is a matter of debate which will attract the attention of the authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures the existing population in the area has a central role to play.  I am not being critical of Temple Bar, which was a wonderfully dynamic development, but it was flawed.  Those representing that and other areas in Dublin said there was a feeling that the ordinary folk living there should move on.  That was a major mistake. Activity in that area concentrates on public houses and restaurants, which are wonderful, but the over-emphasis on drinking is a little disturbing. Those with large cars and cheque books who paid large amounts of money for property are as welcome as the flowers in May provided the co-exist with those who have lived there since God was a boy.  The Bill's remit adequately deals with that potential danger.</P>
    <P>Last year's ESRI study highlighted a number of issues.  While we should not talk down an area, the facts contained in this report are stark and it is not necessary for me to detail them.  We are offering the people of the docklands and of Dublin a dynamic vision of what that area could become and the rewards which would flow from <Col N="476" /> such a development.  The remit of the authority refers to statutory duty to education, training, retraining and employment.  That process should begin the day the executive comes into being, which did not happen with the International Financial Services Centre.  Because it has the data, it should immediately begin to train and retrain.  I understand from the ESRI study that a large number of young people will come onto the labour market without the necessary skills and education, certainly in terms vocational education but if action is taken in terms of training and so on, it will provide those living in this area, and indeed, the greater Dublin area, with jobs.  One does not have to be from Ringsed to get a job there.  I welcome this aspect of the authority's remit.</P>
    <P>The master plan will show the types of jobs which will come on stream and the preparation I mentioned is a prerequisite to taking advantage of those industries.  This Government had the vision to see the potential of such a vast area. Senator Daly mentioned 1,500 acres, although not all will be developed because much of it contains railway tracks, port facilities and so on.  It will transform Dublin from the Custom House to the mouth of the river and will also provide leisure activities in the area.</P>
    <P>The potential which was seen by the Minister for the Environment, driven by the Minister for Finance and our colleagues in Government, will pay huge dividends and, as was the case with Government Buildings, everybody will share in the pride of it.  The challenge is great because it will have to marry forces that are, in many ways, conflicting. Hopefully, this development will become a model of co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal and the Royal Canal are treasured assets.  They barely escaped becoming major highways.  It is now recognised throughout the world that when a city has a waterway it should be protected, enhanced and used for all types of activity.  The situation in Ringsend basin is most encouraging.  The Irish Nautical Trust and many subsidiary activities there need assistance. The windsurfing school, based on the Naomh Éanna, is also located there.  There are the beginnings of the type of projects for which the basin is ideally suited.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the waterways service which has been given responsibility for the canals.  CIE did the country a disservice in the way it treated the canals.  In addition, CIE only gave the Office of Public Works control of the water bodies and not the surrounding land.  As a result it is almost impossible to gain access to the docks at Spencer Dock because the authority does not own the land.  That is stupidity and, although I praised politicians and civil servants earlier, it is also a reflection on them that they allowed this debacle to happen.  Obviously no thought was given to the proper development of the Grand and Royal Canals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> Last year I was down on the docks when four boats, which arrived here from Britain on Irish ferries, launched on the Liffey.  They entered the basin at Ringsend and the next time I saw one of the boats it was tied up in Enniskillen.  The person who owns the boat is retired and intends to stay here for two years.  A total of six boats came here last year and many more inquiries have been made since then.  One cannot get to Lowtown because the canal is blocked with the number of boats there.  If the Ringsend Basin had a properly equipped marina not for the huge yachts of millionaires, although I do not case any aspersions on them, but for the leisure pursuits of ordinary people, it would be ideal.  It would allow people to use the canals.</P>
    <P>Last week I met two young people who have degrees in marketing.  They are buying a passenger boat in England and intend to bring it to Ireland.  They have received sanction from the waterways service to put the boat on the Grand Canal and conduct school tours and heritage tours and other functions.  Activity on the canals is beginning even before this authority is established. We are already aware of the potential of the canals.</P>
    <P>The develops are waiting to see what is in this project for them.  The financial incentives that were given to developers in Temple Bar are not appropriate for this development.  Land which is adjacent to water carries a premium anyway. Apartments located near waterways are being sold from plans and people are queuing to buy them, just as they are queuing to buy houses in Knocklyon.</P>
    <P>Developing the infrastructure of the Grand and Royal Canals will be long and difficult.  For the first time in many years jetties have been established on Mespil Road and in Portobello while the plans are ready to construct a safe haven at the Ninth Lock in Clondalkin.  I do not accept the term &ldquo;indian country&rdquo; which has been used to describe some areas.  There are areas of degradation and social difficulty but it is our job to deal with them.  We cannot walk away from them and abandon them.</P>
    <P>Such areas have been successfully dealt within Birmingham and London.  The city of Birmingham has been successfully regenerated and the canals have become the focal point of that development.  They are beautiful.  They attract a substantial number of tourists and they are a joy to travel on and to look at.  Many Irish people are also familiar with Paddington, which suffered serious degradation over many years. Paddington is now called Little Venice.  It has a beautifully appointed harbour and, the last time I visited it, there were queues of people waiting for boats to transport them to Camden Lock and its massive market.</P>
    <P>We are not re-inventing the wheel with this legislation.  However, this will be the most exciting project in our lifetimes.  Another improvement for which the Office of Public Works and the waterways service must take credit is the <Col N="478" /> installation of a sea wall which leads from the Liffey into Ringsend Basin.  That is a boon for boat owners.  Senator Daly will be aware there is not a free harbour space for boats on any part of the Shannon.  Most of their owners live in Dublin and, on a Sunday evening, one can be stuck for almost two hours at Kinnegad when travelling from the Shannon to Dublin.  The safer and more attractive we make the Grand and Royal Canals, the greater will be the dividend from the investment and the quicker the yield.</P>
    <P>British boat owners have to queue for hours to get through locks on canals in Britain.  They almost need traffic lights and might as well be on a motorway.  When they come here they cannot believe their eyes because the waterways are relatively empty.  In the Netherlands, which is the same size as Munster, there are 50,000 boats while there are only 800 boats on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I hope this development will herald a new era in co-operation and that we can bury the Irish love of the split, as Brendan Behan called it.  We can argue about the hairs on somebody's jumper and, as somebody was heard to say, if one had a joint ticket and won the lotto, the question would be who gave one the right to buy the ticket.  I listened to the debate on Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil and to the views of local community representatives.  They have a point, but things have moved on a great deal.  No executive authority can ignore the people.  The people have progressed in terms of education and they are aware of their statutory rights.  Nobody will ride roughshod over them.</P>
    <P>However, one can object to any development and hold it up for months, even if one has no interest in it.  Before the Merchant's Quay project in Cork was to be developed by Robin Power, I met a well known civil engineer and a well known barrister in a pub.  They decided, as an exercise, to object to the development.  They drew a line from the top of Roches Stores to the Merchant's Quay centre and lodged an objection.  The project was never started by Mr. Power because the objection process continued.  It was an exercise in obstruction as an intellectual game.  That is the type of nonsense that sometimes happens.</P>
    <P>This is a most exciting project.  Everybody can take ownership of it&mdash;political parties and other groups.  I do not think the Government will emulate the Tories but we will win the next election. However, I do not think we can look beyound that. I wish the new authority and the council well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a joy to hear all parties welcome the Bill.  Senator Magner referred to this as a most exciting project and the Minister talked in terms of a vibrant renaissance and giving a healthy beating heart to the city.  There are few items of legislation that attract such terms. However, we should still attempt to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of developing these neglected areas of Dublin.  I drive through them frequently and I am aware of the problems and the enormous potential for future developments which <Col N="479" /> exist there.  I welcome the Bill as a long overdue step to realising that potential.  However, I have some grave reservations about whether the approach in the Bill is right.  I doubt the wisdom of adopting the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach.  About 15 years ago a Mr. Shumacher addressed the IMI on a book he had written on the theme &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo;, an approach which I support.  I shudder when I see attempts to solve problems on grandiose scales.</P>
    <P>There is a limited scope for offices, factories and shops.  However, there is considerable scope for residential development and, above all, for tourism and leisure development.  We have seen examples where this has been successful, although I understand Senator Magner's criticism of Temple Bar.  If an economic driving force is to be created in the docklands area it will almost certainly revolve around tourism and leisure, building on the coastline and the existing enclosed water areas.  However, with the greatest respect to the Custom House Docks Development Authority, it has no expertise or track record in this regard.  On the contrary, the original plans for the Custom House Docks involved a a large element of festive shopping, along the lines of the Fenway Hall in Boston, Covent Garden in London, the waterfront in Cape Town, to which Senator Daly referred, and Darling Harbour in Sydney.  I get excited about the development of areas which were once run down and which have achieved great success.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks authority completely failed to deliver that leisure element, although it was successful in the other elements created.  It probably does not matter greatly in the Custom House Docks where it would only have been one element among others.  However, in the docklands generally creating tourism and leisure attractions will be central.</P>
    <P>The Custom House Docks Authority also lacks expertise with regard to small business.  It has been very successful in attracting world names but less good at understanding the needs of smaller firms.  In general, the potential and benefit of small business has not been realised in the past.  We must work hard to ensure that we do so now.  One of the largest areas of potential for the docklands would be the creation of small businesses. I believe in the adage horses for courses and the Custom House Docks Development Authority is not the horse for this course, so to speak.  In saying that I do not wish to detract from its great achievements to date.</P>
    <P>I also doubt whether a master plan is the best way to develop the docklands.  We will expect a group of consultants to draw up a specific master plan for the next 15 years&mdash;a plan that will solve all the problems and tap all the potential.  That is a totalitarian approach.  We are being misled by the past.  It made sense for the Custom House Docks and Temple Bar to have a master plan because they are small, compact areas which are focused around a single theme.  However, the <Col N="480" /> docklands is a different kettle of fish.  If ever there was an occasion to learn as we go along and leave the maximum room for experimentation this is it.</P>
    <P>We do not need a detailed master plan to decide the future of the docklands but a loose enabling plan which will create a set of favourable conditions within which that future can evolve and thrive.  Master plans look very neat when they are first unveiled.  However, the reality can often be quite different.  I remember being present at the launch of the Custom House Docks plan.  Although the area has been successful, it is instructive to look back at the original master plan and compare it to what is <i>in situ.</i>  Much of what was planned originally is not there and the overall balance, which was the point of the original plan, is but a memory.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts that the development of the docklands is being tackled in the right manner. That said, I realise that the die is cast in terms of the overall direction.  However, we can improve the approach to give it the best possible chance of success.  In this regard I will suggest some changes which I hope the Minister will consider before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to marketing it is vital that the authority wins the confidence of the people in the area.  It must be capable of catching the imagination of the local and wider public with its proposals. It will find that difficult with such an unwiedly title as the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  My sympathy went to the Minister who had to repeat the title many times during his speech.  The Irish version is worse again.  In 1983 I was appointed chairman of what was called An Bord Poist.  Nobody could pronounce &ldquo;poist&rdquo;. The Department then informed us of the name for the new postal authority which we decided was too unwieldy to sell.  We sought an alternative and came up with An Post, which worked in Irish and English.  We got back to the Department and it felt there would have to be another version in Irish.  However, having made our case to the then Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, he agreed that An Post would work for every post office and a translation was not needed.  I mention that example because I take a certain pride in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think about the title of the authority.  I cannot give him any ingenious suggestions.  However, we are not naming an item of legislation but a promotional body which faces a tough task.  At the very least the title should be slimmed down.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the membership of the council has not been sufficiently well though out.  I accept Senator Daly's point about the awkwardness of it its size.  However, there is no representation of tourism interests which should be at the heart of it.  There is no representation from Trinity College, yet a prime objective should be to persuade Trinity to use the docklands as its preferred base for campus companies.  On the other hand, there is representation from An Board Gáis which is unnecessary because at the moment <Col N="481" /> Bord Gáis happens to be the owner of a very large derelict site where the gasometers used to be.  The board should, and in all probability will, sell that site and get out.  As a company Bord Gáis has no role in developing the economic potential of the docklands.  I am not sure that boards must have representation but they should have something that reflects the future of the docklands rather than its past.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make concerns openness and communicating effectively with the various stakeholders in this exciting project.  The provisions for consulting and informing the outside world about what is happening appear to be totally inadequate.  They are lifted straight out of what is done with local authority development plans.  That is inappropriate.  We are not talking about a local authority but about a development and promotional body that is setting out with those objectives.  The eventual success of that body will depend on the extent to which it succeeds in bringing people along with it as well as in unlocking the enthusiasm and creativity for the project to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>The requirements for communication we lay on the authority should fully reflect the information age in which we live.  I hope the Minister will accept that I wish to be constructive.  The docklands have been neglected for far too long.  We owe it to the communities there and to the nation as a whole to provide the best framework for development that we can.</P>
    <P>Despite my reservations about the approach we are taking, I wish the Bill well and I hope we can significantly improve it on Committee Stage. I admire the Minister's approach and his enthusiasm. He finished his speech by saying Dublin and the nation have a healthy, vibrant part to play.  I support the objective and I am sure the Bill will achieve great success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to Senator Quinn whose views are always very constructive. Varying degrees of progress have been made in the capital over the years.  The city has been renewed and I welcome that.  The developments in Temple Bar and those carried out by the Custom House Docks Development Authority required something different and the changes envisaged by this Bill require something special.  We are giving this area special treatment. Under the terms of the Bill the Custom House Docks Development Authority will be encompassed in the new Dublin Docklands Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last 30 years have seen dramatic changes in Dublin port.  Freight vessels have been adapted to ro-ro and lo-lo systems.  The live cattle trade, which was once an important part of Dublin's commercial life, has now ended.  The introduction of mechanisation and materials lifting facilities has changed the entire aspect of the port. Employment in the surrounding areas has been affected.  The old form of berthage has disappeared <Col N="482" /> and port warehousing is a thing of the past.  Some port related activities have been transferred to other areas of the city.</P>
    <P>Dublin port handles 25 per cent of the nation's external trade and 40 per cent of its value.  It is a vibrant place and quite different from the port that existed 30 years ago.  The area covered by the provisions of the Bill amounts to approximately 1,300 acres of which 560 acres are on the north side and 740 acres on the south.  The south side is quite different from the north side of the port area, in other words, the southside is one and a half times the size of the northside.</P>
    <P>Since I know the south side of the city best I would like to say a few words about it.  I attended primary and secondary school in Westland Row from 1944 to 1954.  The area contained a vibrant community at that time.  The docks then employed 2,300 people compared to little over 100 now.  The meant processing factory at Grand Canal Street is gone, as are An Bord Gáis and Boland's Bakery.  A number of indigenous industries have also disappeared from the area and have been replaced by the IDA units on Pearse Street.  One the great tragedies of the area is that it has been ravaged by unemployment over many years following the disappearance of traditional industries.  I know families in the area whose fathers and children have not worked for 20 or 30 years because no new industries were found to replace the old ones.</P>
    <P>The south side comprises industrial land, some of which is in use at the moment by various plants.  They include the ESB power station at Ringsend; Dublin Corporation's sewage plant, which will be extended in the near future with the addition of secondary and tertiary treatment; and the container traffic terminal.  Redundant areas surround Sir John Rogerson's Quay, the Hanover Quays and the old Dublin Gas site.  The important sites comprising 80 acres between Pearse Street and Ringsend, which contain two huge unused docks known as the basins, have been neglected for years.  The area contains numerous empty sites as well as warehouses, factories and CIE's bus depot at Ringsend.</P>
    <P>There is a good mix of housing in the area. Some people have referred to poor housing in slums but I remember when we really had slums there.  Queen Street has now been demolished and its residents rehoused in good local authority housing in Ringsend.  There has been a substantial increase in housing in the City Quay development and on Pearse Street.  In addition, there have been private developments in recent times.  The sad thing about this area is that in the past people had jobs but poor housing whereas now they have nice housing but no jobs.  I do not know which is worse because one can feel the poverty when people have no jobs, even though they may be in a new house.</P>
    <P>The future of this site lies in the inner basin and harbour which join up with the Grand Canal. We also have the outer basin which links up with the River Liffey and the open sea.  These are two <Col N="483" /> magnificent stretches of water that lie so near to the heart of the city.  When I was first elected to Dublin Corporation a constituent had a great interest in developing a marina, but he was 20 or 30 years ahead of his time.  He showed me the inner and outer basin area.  I was surprised to see the vast tracts of land that lay undeveloped and unused.  I wondered if any other civilised city would fail to use such a facility.</P>
    <P>The future of this area lies in the development of these two basins.  This week <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> had an article on proposals by the people seeking the competition for Dublin 2000 to build a marina, hotels, fishing facilities and berthing facilities for ships beside the Dublin Gas lands. This type of development will create jobs locally which is very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to the Custom House Docks development.  However, a survey would show the very small number of local people employed there.  Of the 3,500 employees about ten are local people.</P>
    <P>The local labour force have to be trained to take their place in hotels, shipping or other developments there.  There is a tradition in shipping in Ringsend.  If the local labour force is not trained prior to development, people from outside will take the jobs; this happened in the IDA centre in Pearse Street where local people were not employed because they were not trained for the jobs there.  I hope the aim of this measure is to give local employment to an area that has long been ravished by unemployment.</P>
    <P>On reading the Bill I was taken aback to find that the planning would be separate from the Dublin Planning Authority.  However, I concede that the majority of the lands are owned by semi-State bodies and, in that context, a planning scheme taking into accounts the Dublin development plan would be the best way forward.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Government now proposes to establish the Dublin Docklands Authority to rejuvenate that area of the city in a way that has never been tried before, to consider collectively the issues affecting local communities&mdash; employment, leisure and investment&mdash;and to create an integrated plan for the future development of the area.  The plan will set out the economic, social and other issues relevant to the regeneration of the Dublin docklands area together with proposals to address these issues. Appropriate areas for detailed development or conservation will be identified.  The Government plans to facilitate implementation of the master plan with a range of selective tax reliefs based on its recommendations.  The intention of the legislation is to transform the heart of Dublin docklands over the coming 15 years, providing new jobs, homes and amenities for the next generation of Dubliners.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The participation and inclusion of local communities in the regeneration of the area will be vital.  [I fully agree.]  As the future of the docklands <Col N="484" /> area will have a major impact on the future of its people, they must have an important role in shaping that future and be in a position to reap the benefits it brings.</P>
    <P>That is the most important aspect of the Minister's speech.  The local people, who have shown a tremendous interest in the area, will be facilitated under the Bill and will be represented on the board.</P>
    <P>Five members of Dublin City Council will also be on the board.  They will come from the areas covered by the Dublin Docklands Authority development plan.  I represents that area and will play my part in achieving the objectives of the Bill if selected by Dublin Corporation to represent its interests on the new docklands authority.</P>

      <P>I am very happy with the positive response this legislation has received from all sides of the House and the very measured, careful contributions made by Senators.  It mirrors the reception the Bill received in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>There is great potential here and I am very proud to bring this legislation before the House. It is an enabling Bill which can set in train a process of regeneration, renewal and improvement that will transform the heart of the capital city.  I am excited by this and I hope that enthusiasm is evident.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly and other Members referred to the size of the council.  We were anxious to learn from the strengths and mistakes of the past.  The councils is to be as inclusive as possible, to include those with good ideas, representatives of the City Council, relevant State agencies, the community and the professions and skills which can be brought to bear on this process of regeneration and renewal.  At the same time we wanted a slimmer, efficient executive to carry out the day to day duties.  The balance achieved is right.  It will meet the needs of those who say that the weakness of the Customs House Docks Development Authority was that it was not sufficiently inclusive.  That authority did a remarkable amount of good work but it almost transplanted itself in a community and was deaf to the needs of the community.  We need a different model for this much broader remit encompassing 1,300 acres.</P>
      <P>All the issues raised by Senator Daly, particularly the need for education and training, will be specifically addressed by the new authority.  The interim progress report being prepared identifies those as priority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Magner spoke of the history of Dublin port.  I pay tribute to him and his contribution to the task force.  We moved speedily on this following the announcement in the 1996 budget to the establishment of a task force, the acceptance of the recommendations by Government, the drafting of legislation and the commissioning of supportive reports.  Few such elaborate pieces of legislation have been brought to the point of publication <Col N="485" /> so quickly.  This shows the sense of ownership of this project taken by so many people and groups and I am grateful for their input.</P>
    <P>I am also grateful to the officials in my Department, led by my Department Secretary.  They did a remarkable amount of work and I am delighted to reflect credit on them.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Doyle who spoke of the immense potential of the basins of Dublin, Senator Magner has his own vision for the canals and his enthusiasm was imparted to us.  It is incredible that so many houses turn their backs on the canals.  In other European cities they are seen as the principal feature.  We need to refocus and see the waterways as one of the greatest potential assets for the development of a vibrant capital.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn welcomed the Bill but had some reservations, the principal one being the totalitarian and big bang approach.  It is the right way to go.  The alternative is the <i>laissez faire</i> approach, hoping that the regeneration will be structured and planned and that there will not be totally unsuitable development alongside good development. That would mean providing incentives and allowing developers take their course.  That is not a good way to go.  We need a structured approach. If we get it wrong it is wrong for all time so there is no option but to have a very structured master plan ensuring that all the pieces of the jigsaw fit.</P>
    <P>Too often in the past, we have seen wonderful areas with potential where one bad planning decision has resulted in unsuitable development which is an eyesore and ruins the character of an area.  The notion of a structured master plan, focused by a development authority, might be ambitious but it is the right way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn made a number of specific proposals one of which concerned the title, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  He was concerned that I had to say it so often today.  I will reflect on that further but we have got things right in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle reminded us of the demise of the traditional structures in industries which characterised and transformed this area in the past.  Dublin is changing, as is Ireland, at a remarkable rate.  It is important that we do not just hope that the rising tide will raise all boats. Communities that suffered in the past must have their rights factored in to any development and the training necessary to ensure they are employed must be encompassed in it.  That is my plan and it will be one of the responsibilities given to the new authority.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the positive support of many Senators to this measure and I look forward to its early enactment in order that we can get on to the truly exciting phase of implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare an interest in that one of my daughters, Siobhán, who is now seven, is a child with special needs and attends a special class in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim. The class was set up on the personal intervention of the Minister for Education and I acknowledge that.  I also acknowledge her continuing interest in and commitment to developing the necessary support services to assist children such as Siobhán.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months, it has become apparent to me, as a parent as much as a public reapresentative, that there is a severe lack of necessary support services for children such as Siobhán and for classes such as the one she attends, specifically in the areas of language therapy and psychological support.  Further investigation on my part revealed that the services, such as they are, are provided by the health board and the Department of Education only has a peripheral role.  There is a small, limited number of psychologists in the primary school system.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Education last autumn asking if her Department intended addressing the problem of poor resources and lack of personnel in this area.  Her reply indicated she was aware of the problem and that she was setting up an interdepartmental committee to investigate this aspect of support services for children with special needs and other related matters.</P>
      <P>It is now some four or five months since that correspondence.  As there is still a deficit in this area, I am anxious the matter should be kept in the public domain.  I raised the matter on the Adjournment to show that it will not go away, that there is a problem in this area and that the best efforts of the health board are not sufficient to provide these children with the support services necessary to help them develop as full individuals. I would be grateful for any further information the Minister of State may have.  I hope it can go some way towards providing the necessary resources in the area of language therapy and child psychologists.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on services for young people with special education needs was established following a recommendation from the special education review committee.  The review committee envisaged <Col N="487" /> that the interdepartmental committee would play a co-ordinating role.  It would endeavour to ensure a high degree of co-operation between the Departments of Education and Health in policy making and planning and an equitable and comprehensive delivery of services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee was established in December 1995 and its terms of reference are to identify existing and anticipated areas of service delivery where improved or modified approaches or structures are required; in respect of each area identified, to bring forward recommendations for future approaches, specifying in each case the respective roles and responsibilities of the Departments of Education and Health and their agents; to make such further recommendations as are considered necessary or desirable for the achievement of a more effective and efficient delivery of services to children with special needs and to co-ordinate policy and monitor service delivery on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The committee is comprised of a core membership of administrative and professional staff from the Departments of Education and Health. However, the membership of the committee can be supplemented where necessary to address particular issues.  The committee has already held a number of meetings and has developed a comprehensive agenda of items which will feature in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>At present, the committee is adopting a particular focus on services for children with severe or profound mental handicap.  The objective is to ensure that the multi-disciplinary response required by such children, which involves educational and health care inputs, is delivered in a co-ordinated fashion which maximises the benefit to the children concerned.  The committee is also involved in a review of likely future service requirements in the special needs area, in the light of information emerging from the database on mental handicap developed by the health services.</P>
      <P>It is not envisaged that the interdepartmental committee will engage in the preparation of regular formal reports on its activities.  Rather, it will pursue its objective of achieving maximum co-ordination of service delivery through a process of consultation and agreement with relevant parties.</P>
      <P>The committee will keep the Minister for Education and the Minister for Health informed of the general progress of its work and will consult where necessary on particular issues.</P>

      <P>I have raised this matter because it deals with one of the most fundamental issues we, as a nation, have to address&mdash;the depopulation of our countryside and the magnetic pull of our rural communities to our cities, particularly those on the east coast where there are facilities which are not available to rural communities in historic centres.</P>
      <P>In my county of Tipperary, we are proud that our rural communities have the deepest and richest sense of community values.  We are proud that these values are based on self-help, community cohesion and a determination to maintain the population in our rural areas.  This Adjournment Matter is geared to protect the Killenaule Community Television Company Limited and those who are served by it.</P>
      <P>The areas to which the company seeks to have television signals retransmitted are some of the most historic and deep-rooted communities of Tipperary which have made us proud of their contribution at all levels, during the War of Independence and before it.  I am speaking of communities such as Killenaule, Fethard, Ballingarry, Drangan, Cloneen, Botharlahan&mdash;famed in song and story&mdash;Kilcommon and Upperchurch.  These areas cover what we call the Slieveardagh and Slieve Felim region of Tipperary.  As the name suggests, we are dealing with what we are proud to call the &ldquo;people of the hills&rdquo;&mdash;people who are the very bastions of Irish value in society.</P>
      <P>Killenaule Community Television is a self-help, non-profit making organisation concerned in protecting against the magnetic pull towards the cities because of the attractions available there, which in this instance, are multi-channel television facilities.  Young people in Tipperary want access to the same television facilities as those in Dublin and Cork, although they are confident in the knowledge they are sufficiently strong in their own culture and proud of their own place.  They are equally determined they should have a right to the transmission of channels such as BBC1, BBC2, UTV and Channel 4 at a reasonable cost and good quality reception.</P>
      <P>Killenaule Community Television is community-based. It wants the right to retransmit signals to areas in the heartland of Tipperary.  They have support in Tipperary from one range of hills to another.  They submitted a formal application to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, on 16 January, seeking his approval to establish a retransmission system in the UHF TV broadcast band to the areas of Killenaule, Fethard, Ballingarry, Drangan, Cloneen, Boherlahan, Kilcommon and Upperchurch.</P>

    <P>Such communities are our richest resource.  The quality and loyalty of this community organisation deserves a positive response from the Minister. There will be no demands from this organisation to provide heavy resources in terms of containing crime or otherwise, although there will <Col N="489" /> always be isolated incidents.  These are the best people who live in the heartland of Ireland and are entitled to ensure their young people say in that rich and valuable environment.  What is available in our cities should also be made available to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Kennedy for the opportunity to make a Statement on this subject.</P>
      <P>I note that one of the terms of the matter before us refers to the &ldquo;need&rdquo; for the Ministers for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, to give approval for the Killenaule Community Television Company's TV retransmission system.  The Minister is not too sure how that need arises.  He is informed that the licensed MMDS operator for the area is already providing service in the Killenaule area and has substantial numbers of subscribers to its service there already.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows very little of the Killenaule Television retransmission system because the formal application to which the Senator referred is no more than a short letter to him, from the company, seeking his approval to establish a TV retransmission system.  Other than some details of the intended coverage area contained in the letter, he has no other information on the Killenaule system.</P>
      <P>It is suspected that the Senator is being somewhat mischievous in putting forward this matter. He should be aware that the Minister is no more in a position to approve or licence the Killenaule system than he is to approve or licence any other such system retransmitting television signals on the UHF band.  As the Senator will be aware, this subject has a long history.  Such systems are usually referred to as deflector systems and where they operate they do so illegally because the use they make of the radio frequency spectrum is not approved or licensed.</P>
      <P>The Minister would like to take the opportunity to inform the House of the current position regarding the operation of deflector systems.  Following the High Court judgment in 1995 on the action brought by South Coast Community TV, he is obliged to reconsider an application from that organisation for a licence to operate its television retransmission system.  The court did not dictate the form that consideration should take, much less the outcome of any such reconsideration. However, in order to provide a degree of objectivity far beyond what was necessary for the process, the Minister's predecessor decided to ask outside technical experts to carry out an analysis of the application in the first instance.  This was partly because the main difficulty about the use of deflector systems from the outset has always been technical, that is, the inevitable congestion that would be caused in the broadcasting frequency band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultants nominated by the European Broadcasting Union carried out the technical analysis of the South Coast application and <Col N="490" /> recently reported to the Minister on the matter. He is now obliged to give due consideration to the South Coast application in light of all the relevant issues, including those that are the subject of the report.  In the event that anyone might believe otherwise, the Minister wishes me to point out that the report does not contain any imperatives, either in respect of the South Coast application or for the operation of deflector systems generally, because the consultants were not asked to make any decisions or recommendations on the main issue.  All the decisions to be taken on these matters fall within the Minister's statutory remit.</P>
    <P>From reading the report it is clear that a tremendous amount of work has had to be invested in the technical analysis of this application. The Minister is not surprised at this because radio frequency interference analysis is complex and time consuming work.  There are many technical variables to be taken into consideration in the radio frequency planning process. Those involved in this area within the Department have consistently maintained that this degree of analysis is necessary to assess the technical feasibility of any deflector system.  They have also maintained that the work involved would become increasingly more difficult if the Department was to consider fitting unplanned services into the broadcasting bands beside the four national services which are being progressively rolled out.</P>
    <P>The Minister hopes, therefore, that people will not be led by idle speculation into a belief that the report contains clear cut solutions to all our problems.  It is a complex document dealing with complex issues and it will take time to digest.  The Minister has made available a copy of the report to South Coast Community TV because its application is the subject of the report.  When he has studied the report, he will give some thought to wider publication of its contents to interested parties for consultation purposes before he makes a final decision in the South Coast case.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that this report is confined to an examination of certain technical matters which bear on the South Coast application. However, these are not the only aspects to be considered and, just as there are competing interests at stake in this area, there are also competing economic, administrative and legal aspects to be taken into account, including the Department's obligations under international treaties governing the assignment of broadcasting frequencies. It is the Minister's job to take these factors into account and make a balanced judgment in the interests of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that, because of the High Court judgement, the Minister's primary responsibility in this area is to consider the South Coast application.  This process is underway and he will make a decision on the matter as soon as possible.  The only comment the Minister wishes to make about other deflector systems, including the one planned by the Killenaule Community <Col N="491" /> Television Company, is that, in coming to a decision on the South Coast application, he will have regard to the implications of, and for, deflector systems generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State indicated that all that is known about the Killenaule Community Television Company application is contained in a short letter.  I suggest that, rather than implying this application is completely inadequate, the Minister of State and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications might, as a matter of courtesy, indicate to the people of Killenaule <Col N="492" /> the information that is required in support of their application.  That would be more appropriate than making a veiled criticism of a highly motivated community.  If there are further details to be supplied, perhaps the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications might request them through his Department.</P>
