      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mullooly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to provide immediate sanction to the board of management of Lanesboro community college, Lanesboro, County Longford, to advertise the proposed school extension for tender so that work on the project can commence in early summer 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to expedite the tendering procedure for the proposed multi-denominational school at Ranelagh.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction and provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Mullooly's and Senator Doyle's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senator may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2.  The Second Stage of item 1 will be taken from the end of the Order of Business until 1 p.m.  I hope we will complete Second Stage by then.  I suggest 20 minutes per speaker.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.  I would ask that all Stages of item 2 be taken today.  It is a one section Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  We are happy to take all Stages of the Courts Bill if time allows.  For the last three of four months I have been calling for a debate on the Naval Service.  A review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service has been completed.  Can I have a copy of this review?</P>
      <P>There are many important reviews in circulation. I have asked for a copy of the BIM review, which was completed eight or nine months ago. This review has twice been sent back to the authors because it was considered too strong by the Department of the Marine as it told too many home truths.  This review should be published.  I am not complaining about the Minister as he is an honourable man.  Six months ago he assured me that I would have a copy of the next review as soon as it became available.  However, last week the Department of the Marine refused to give me a copy of the review on harbours, including fisheries harbours.  I was informed that this was private property which would not be handed out.</P>
      <P>This review has considerable bearing on the harbour in Dingle and the Minister told me that I would receive a copy.  When harbour legislation was passed by this House a year ago, Dingle was the only fisheries harbour mentioned.  Will the Leader ensure that these reviews are made available so that we can debate them in this House? We have passed Bills on freedom of information and equality, however, it appears that we are entitled to nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader gave me a commitment that we would have a debate on Partnership 2000.  He also stated that developments regarding economic and monetary union and the single currency could be included in that debate.  I have no difficulty with that.  However, we need to debate this matter.  Everyone has had their say on Partnership 2000 except politicians.  It would be an important contribution to the debate if people could understand the objectives of the programme, how it works and how it might be harnessed to provide a better future.  Such a debate would tie into people's concerns about monetary union and the single currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the status of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation?  Is it on hold or finished?  Is there a long-term plan?  There may not be an answer at present but some view should be expressed that it may be reconsidered, is finished or may come into operation again, given certain circumstances. I am particularly concerned with the deterioration in this situation.  The Tories have now given a commitment to a grand committee in the North <Col N="643" /> and we should try to relate the structures there to our structures.</P>
    <P>Can the Leader inform us of the plans for Report Stage of the Employment Equality Bill? We did not conclude Committee Stage and it is scheduled for next Thursday, 13 March.  Is it intended to complete both Stages then?  It is important to know this so that amendments can be put down.</P>
    <P>I have raised the issue of agricultural policy before, as have other Members.  It ties into the food industry and consumer confidence in that sector.  There should be regular debates on this, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should come in to bring us up to date and hear our views.  Wednesday morning would be very suitable for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the issue of policing in Northern Ireland.  An article will appear in tonight's <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> from Chris Ryder, who, with David Cook, was sacked from the Police Authority a year ago and he will put his side of the case in tonight's article.  His case is that after the sacking, the new chairman of the authority, Pat Armstrong, assured the public that the Police Authority would be open and accountable. This is one side of the argument.</P>
      <P>The Secretary of State and the Security Minister appear to be acquiescing in this.  In the absence of information coming from the Police Authority &mdash; they have not even issued a report on 1994, though it was due last year &mdash; would it be possible under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to tease out this case?  The Police Authority does not appear to be speaking up for itself.  It would be a delicate matter, but perhaps the Maryfield secretariat could tease this out.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>So far we only have the statements of Mr. Cook and Mr. Ryder.  The Leader might pass on my request to the requisite authorities. The Police Authority was founded to make both sides of the community proud to have a career in the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader request the Minister for Education to begin procedures to deal with the disturbing level of vandalism in a number of schools?  A body should be established to review school security after school hours.  A school in my constituency has been very seriously vandalised on successive nights this week and it is becoming impossible for that school to pay for the smashed windows and other destroyed property from its meagre resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister also put an emergency fund in place to deal with the immediate effects of vandalism and also with the installation of security devices, such as closed-circuit television, for remote schools and to pay for additional security activities?  It is a distressing reality that so many <Col N="644" /> schools are being vandalised and many of them are suffering very severe financial losses because of it.  Communities should also assist the Garda and school authorities in identifying the culprits.</P>
    <P>Can the Leader arrange a debate soon on the new proposals on public service management procedures?  Last night an announcement was made that another announcement would be made on this important issue today.  There is an element of discourtesy to both Houses of the Oireachtas in that last night's announcement contained all the details today's announcement is to contain.  I welcome any change in management procedures but the Seanad would be a good place to discuss those proposals.</P>
    <P>I will be writing to the Leader for advice on comments made in a recent court case arising out of the Children Act.  The judge admonished the plaintiff not to make contact with certain public representatives or to divulge certain information to those representatives.  This appears to be a transgression by the Judiciary into the role and responsibilities of public representatives to represent the public, listen to their views and, where they feel an injustice is being committed by a statutory agency, to correct that injustice.  I will bring the correspondence in question to the Committee for Procedures and Privileges through the Leader.  An extraordinary principle is being established here; judges can say to people looking for defence against excessive action by a statutory agency that they cannot contact named public representatives.  I am one of those public representatives and will continue to represent the family in question.  It is a serious matter and the Leader might advise me as to whether it would be appropriate to bring this to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>Raising the issue is probably the wrong terminology for this matter.  The roof of the hangar housing the air-sea rescue helicopter in Finner Camp in Ballyshannon blew off recently and the helicopter service was transferred to Carrickfinn Airport.  It costs £3,000 a week to keep the staff there and the hangar will not be repaired until May.  Can the Leader bring the cost of this to the attention of the Minister for Defence?  I have heard of the wheels falling off the wagon but here the roof has come off the hangar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written in the past without much effect to Mr. Michael Howard, the British Home Secretary, about prisoners.  To show I was not defeated, I wrote again to him recently about Róisín McAliskey.  Again, I have received no response.  I explained that I worked in a maternity hospital where many British doctors trained, and that if he needed advice on how pregnant women should be treated he could consult one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment this woman and other pregnant women in British jails are receiving must be of concern.  International Women's Day is almost upon us.  Can the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to note that many Irish women are <Col N="645" /> concerned about the treatment of Róisín McAliskey and to bring this to the attention of the British Home Secretary again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were debating the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, Senator O'Kennedy and I expressed our reservations about that Bill because of its provisions concerning the prison service.  A Government announcement had informed us that there was to be a new statutory framework for prisons. Although the Order of Business has been agreed, does the Leader not feel it is vacuous and ineffective to discuss the Courts Bill, which increases the number of judges from 19 to 22, when current judges are not in a position to imprison people?</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Junior Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to come into this House for a discussion on the situation with regard to the potato industry in Ireland which seems to be in total disarray at present.  There was a problem some years ago but farmers got together and we are now self sufficient. The potato industry is in chaos and farmers are only receiving in the region of £40 per tonne for potatoes.  In supermarkets, potatoes are making in the region of £500 per tonne.  Something is drastically wrong there.  This situation is <Col N="646" /> driving the potato farmer off the land completely. When we had a serious situation with potatoes in Ireland five or six years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader to ask the Junior Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to come into this House to see what can be done about the current situation in the potato industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Leader that he indicated that we would have a debate on the Luas transport system at some stage.  Has he come to any decision as to when that will happen? The reason I ask is that we must be getting closer to the date of the public inquiry about which I have received no information.  Press headlines continually say that the Luas project is on target.  That seems to effectively undermine any inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Miss Ormonde Miss Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Miss Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Education to make a statement on the current confusion regarding the leaving certificate applied programme.  I have received several calls from around the country inquiring about the delay &mdash; because of a dispute by civil servants in the Department of Education &mdash; in assessing project work which should have taken place in February.  Teachers had geared students up for this assessment and morale is very low at the moment.  Large chunks of this course have not yet been completed and there is much confusion among people.  This is a pilot scheme and, as a result, the confidence of teachers and students alike is being undermined.  This programme was marketed to the country last September and October.  It is now falling apart and morale is very low.  It is important that the Minister would make a statement in order that teachers, students and the public in general would know what is happening with this new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Senator Maloney is a very serious one.  Until recently, I understand, this service was provided by Irish Helicopters, which had the ability to hover over a craft which was in trouble.  On a recent rescue off the south west coast, it took a long time to get a fisherman into shore because the foreign company which replaced Irish Helicopters do not have the ability to hover over a stricken vessel. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Defence if he intends to look into this matter?  The current company were allowed a month at the beginning of February to install this facility but nothing has happened thus far.  It is a very serious matter that the helicopters which we employ for air/sea rescue cannot hover over stricken craft.  This is a ludicrous situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Leader is aware that there has been a reduction in the milk <Col N="647" /> prices offered to farmers this year.  I am sure the Leader is not aware of that, but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will know that there has been a fairly serious reduction in the price being offered by the farming co-operatives. This seems to be the situation in all of the co-operatives in spite of the fact that they are making millions of pounds in profit.  Reports have been published of their financial returns in recent days and several of them have made in the region of £50, £60 and £70 million of profit.  In the light of that situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;farmers have been faced with a huge reduction in milk prices.  This is seriously eroding the incomes of small dairy producers, especially in the west of Ireland.  I ask the Leader to endeavour to get some information from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as to how he proposes to deal with this situation.  A request has been made for some compensation because of the income fluctuation which has resulted from this price reduction; I believe that some European funding is available for this.  Can we get some indication, through the Leader, from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as to what the situation is?  We are facing into the start of the milk supply year and farmers are in a very serious position.  It is important that something be done about this situation soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with much the same subjects as those raised by Senator Dan Kiely and Senator Daly.  We should have a debate on agriculture with special regard to the price of potatoes and milk.  I think there is confusion with regard to milk quotas, especially in view of a court ruling which was made yesterday.  There was a fear that Ireland would be way over quota but now I think it will not be.  That is unfair to milk suppliers.  Some co-ops are refusing to take back surplus milk.  They would certainly take it if they needed it.  In spite of the figures which were emanating from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I do not think we will be over quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise another issue and I will ask a question then.  Unlike my colleague, Senator Dan Kiely, I would be happier if we could have the Minister in the House.  With no disrespect to the Junior Minister &mdash; Senator Dan Kiely might feel that the Minister being from his own constituency might mean he would get better results &mdash; I would like to see the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry coming into the House because I would like to ask him why his Department attempted to stop a peaceful march <Col N="648" /> in Limerick on 29 January 1997.  The march was organised by the IFA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support Senator Rory Kiely's call for a debate on the milk quota system.  Such a debate is long overdue.  It is necessary to find out what is happening on the ground in this area. Recently, a constituent of mine, who has 24 acres of land and a milk quota of 18,000 gallons, sought an increase of 1,200 gallons so that he could stay in business.  He was refused on the grounds that his son was attending third level education and was unlikely to stay in farming.</P>

      <P>This is all about consensus.  I had discussions with the Leader of the House in relation to an excellent Private Members' Bill which Senator Daly and I have drafted &mdash; The Shannon River Council Bill.  As it cannot be done before 3 o'clock today, will the Leader make Government time available for this important legislation?  I think the House will adopt it by consensus.  This legislation is urgently required because of the growing level of pollution and degradation along the Shannon catchment area. All the concerned voluntary organisations from the source to the outlet are very supportive of this type of legislation.  I would be happy if the Government adopted the legislation and promoted it.</P>

The public service legislation will be brought before the House shortly and the Senator can contribute to the debate.  The case he raised is interesting.

Alternatively, if the Cathaoirleach so decides, a special meeting can be called to discuss it.</P>

There is an obvious case for humane treatment and if the British Government was trying to incite public opinion in this country it could not have gone about it in a better way.</P>
    <P>The answer to Senator Mulcahy's question is no.  I do not agree with him.  Senator Dan Kiely and other Senators spoke about potatoes and the crisis in that industry.

    <Title>Central Bank Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank Bill, 1996, provides for a range of new measures relating to the powers and obligations of the Central Bank.  The main Acts relating to the bank are the Central Bank Acts, 1942, 1971 and 1989.  The last major revision of Central Bank legislation was the 1989 Act which, as well as updating the charter of the Bank itself, considerably extended the powers of the bank to supervise banks and other financial institutions and introduced a deposit protection scheme for depositors.</P>
      <P>The present Bill includes provisions relating to payment systems, <i>bureaux de change</i> and investment intermediaries as well as dealing with a number of other matters in Central Bank legislation which require updating and amendment.  A limited number of amendments are included to ensure compatibility with certain defined provisions of the Treaty on European Union, which took effect with the start of the second stage of economic and monetary union on 1 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Bill does not address the legal issues arising from the move to stage 3 of economic and monetary union.  Although extensive preparatory work has been done on the legislation required in connection with the move to stage 3 of economic and monetary union it would be premature to finalise it at this stage or in this Bill.  Article 108 of the Treaty requires each member <Col N="651" /> state to ensure that, by the date of establishment of the European System of Central Banks, the ESCB, at latest, their central bank legislation is compatible with the Treaty and the statute of the ESCB.  With stage 3 of economic and monetary union commencing on 1 January 1999, this will be early 1998.  It has been decided to wait until strictly necessary before legislating for stage 3 of economic and monetary union.  The European Monetary Institute has been consulted and they have agreed with this approach.</P>
    <P>Currently, the Central Bank has no role in the approval of payment systems nor a direct right of supervision and intervention.  The growth of international trade, the size of daily settlements, the increased use of electronic payments and the volatility of trade flows have caused individual central banks to take steps to address the various risks arising in their own domestic payment systems, in particular the risk of default, breakdown and liquidity shortage which would have grave implications for the security and stability of the banking system.</P>
    <P>Similar steps are now required in Ireland, particularly for large-value transactions.  The current payment system, which has served well to date, is not properly equipped to respond adequately to the increasing pace of change in money transmission services.  Discussions on the restructuring of the current system have been ongoing for some time and are at an advanced stage.  The Government is particularly concerned to ensure that payment systems in the State are effective, efficient and open and that the systems themselves do not add to, or cause, instability in the operation of financial markets.  In brief, the Central Bank will be given the power, for the first time, to approve the establishment of payment systems and vet their rules.  These powers will also apply in the case of existing payment systems.</P>
    <P>Apart from those which form part of a bank's operations, <i>bureaux de change</i> have been effectively outside the scope of any official supervision since the abolition of exchange controls some years ago.  The need to introduce a supervisory regime at this point arises from our international commitments in the area of money laundering.</P>
    <P>The Financial Action Task Force, FATF, of the OECD, the international body set up to combat money laundering, has strongly recommended that those countries which do not currently supervise <i>bureaux de change</i> should do so because of their potential use in the money laundering chain. While we are not bound to follow the views of the FATF in this matter, failure to do so would undoubtedly leave Ireland open to criticism.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, decided to include provisions in the Bill to give the Central Bank the appropriate powers of supervision. These provisions are based very closely on existing provisions relating to the supervision of money brokers &mdash; Chapter IX of the Central Bank Act, 1989 &mdash; and will require <i>bureaux de <Col N="652" /> change</i> to be authorised by the Central Bank with the standard provisions regarding appeal to the Minister for Finance where the bank proposes either to withhold or revoke an authorisation. The degree of supervision of the operations of <i>bureaux de change</i> would largely be a matter for the discretion of the Central Bank under a general framework set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, established the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank as supervisory authorities for investment business firms.  The Act also provides that the Minister and the bank are the competent authorities for the purposes of the EU Investment Services Directive and Capital Adequacy Directive in relation to those firms which are subject to the Directives.</P>
    <P>The Government, on the recommendation of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for commerce, science and technology, Deputy Rabbitte, has decided that responsibility for the regulation of those investment business firms which are currently regulated under the Minister for Enterprise and Employment should be transferred from that Minister to the Central Bank. The Central Bank will, as a result, be the sole supervisory authority for investment intermediaries and the sole competent authority for the purposes of the Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive.</P>
    <P>In so deciding, the Government took into account a number of factors, including the need to take strong and decisive action to restore confidence in the investment intermediary system after the Taylor affair and earlier financial scandals; the experience to date in the implementation of the existing regulatory structure under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995; the fact that the regulatory regime envisaged when the original legislation was drafted was no longer feasible because of the decision by the Irish Brokers Association to cease to act as a self-regulatory body in respect of its members and the earlier decision by the Insurance Intermediary Compliance Bureau not to take a regulatory role under the Act; recommendations made to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment with responsibility for commerce, science and technology by the authorised officer carrying out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Taylor affair; the need to maximise operating efficiency and ensure consistency in the approach to legislation; and, most importantly, the expertise and resources available to the Central Bank for the regulation of financial concerns generally and investment business firms specifically.</P>
    <P>It is essential that responsibility for regulation of these intermediaries be transferred to the bank as soon as possible to avoid the wasteful use of resources by the Department of Enterprise and Employment in establishing an interim regulatory system to take over the role envisaged for the Irish Brokers Association and the IICB.  The <Col N="653" /> amendments contained in Part VI are no more than the minimum amendments necessary to effect the transfer of regulatory responsibility under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is carrying out a review of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, in conjunction with the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Justice and the Central Bank.  That review will also take account of any recommendations made by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, which, as Members of this House may be aware, is examining the system of regulation of investment intermediaries administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, with particular reference to the collapse of the Taylor Group.  I look forward to the report of the committee.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that any necessary amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, will be incorporated in the forthcoming Investor Compensation Bill.  I should add at this point that the amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, which are contained in Part VI of this Bill, have been the subject of consultation with the European Monetary Institute.  The institute has confirmed that these amendments will not adversely affect the stability of financial institutions and are not inconsistent with the requirement for independence of central banks.</P>
    <P>Several other matters requiring attention are also incorporated in the Bill.  The extension of the supervisory and enforcement powers of the bank is proposed in order to bring them up to date with best current practices.  Provision for the accountability to the Oireachtas of the bank is also included.</P>
    <P>To save time and to spare Senators a recitation of the obvious, I propose to restrict my remarks on individual sections of the Bill to those of substance or particular interest.  First, I would like to point out that Part 1 of the Bill, which is usually a routine set of provisions, actually contains a section that is of some importance, that is section 2(2).  This is a section which defines &ldquo;deposit&rdquo;. Banking business is defined essentially as the taking of deposits.  There is, however, no Irish legal definition of what constitutes a deposit.  As the savings market becomes more competitive, the distinction between deposits and other forms of investment is becoming more blurred and the lack of a legal definition of a deposit is causing concern.  This anomaly caused particular concern during a recent successful prosecution of a finance company by the Central Bank.  Section 2(2) provides for such a definition to be incorporated into Irish law.</P>
    <P>All of Part II deals with payment systems and the manner in which the Central Bank will implement their new responsibilities in relation to the approval and regulation of payment systems. Perhaps the most interesting provision here is in section 19, which provides that once payments <Col N="654" /> have been debited from a credit institution's account in the Central Bank, on the instructions of the credit institution concerned, the payment becomes final.  This is to ensure that once payments have entered a payment system they cannot be revoked.  Revocation of a large value payment could result in the unwinding of a number of other related payments within the system and this could have serious consequences for the system as a whole.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for the power of the Central Bank to form or acquire a company, and in this regard section 23 provides that, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank may become a member of and/or acquire, hold or dispose of shares in a company.  The functions of any subsidiary company established or acquired under the terms of this section will be restricted to those of the bank, and any guidelines or obligations applicable to the bank will also apply to such companies.</P>
    <P>As regards Part IV, the provision which, I suppose, hits closest to home is in section 24, which provides the Governor shall attend before a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann &mdash; currently the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs &mdash; and furnish that committee with any information requested, having due regard to the independence of the bank and subject to any restrictions imposed on the Governor under the Central Bank Acts &mdash; for example, the confidentiality provisions of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  This statutory obligation on the Governor to attend before the committee will replace the informal arrangement which is currently in place and the terms of reference of the committee must be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, Part V of the Bill deals with the supervision of <i>bureaux de change</i> and I suppose the only thing to be said here is that the Central Bank will have discretion on the level of supervision to be applied.  The main objective here is to make sure that <i>bureaux</i> are not used for money laundering purposes &mdash; not that there is any suggestion that they are at present &mdash; but to bring us into line with the recommendations of the OECD's moneylaundering watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force.</P>
    <P>As regards Part VI of the Bill, the various provisions here are purely technical &mdash; those required to ensure that the Central Bank will be the sole supervisory authority for all investment business under the terms of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of Miscellaneous there are a number of sections worthy of comment. Sections 50 and 51 amend the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, and the Cheques Act, 1959, to confer legal status on cheques marked &ldquo;account payee&rdquo; with or without the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  The intentions behind these provisions are to help counteract fraud and to also ensure more speedy transfer of cheques to recipients.  Section 50 also provides an indemnity to banks arising from any refusal to cash the cheque or to transfer the cheque to <Col N="655" /> another in pursuance of an endorsement on the cheque to that effect.</P>
    <P>These provisions were originally requested by the Insurance Industry Federation.  The federation wished to ensure that cheques made out to policyholders and transmitted via insurance brokers, etc., must be handed on to the client and cannot be converted in any way to the use of the intermediary.  They felt that such a safeguard would considerably reduce the risk of the fraudulent conversion of clients' money.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that these provisions were the subject of lengthy discussions in the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. Questions were raised as to difficulties which may arise for recipients who, having safely received cheques crossed in the manner prescribed in the Bill, have no bank accounts into which to put them.  Following the passing of the Bill in the Dáil, representations were received from the Irish Bankers' Federation which raised, <i>inter alia</i>, complex issues concerning the legality of title to these cheques.  I will revert to the House on this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 54 the provisions of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which relates to non-disclosure of information by the bank, are extended.  Various amendments facilitate the disclosure of information in relation to the conveyance of statistical information to the Central Statistics Office; the disclosure by the bank of information received from another regulatory authority where that authority has given permission; the ability of the bank to request information from entities it supervises in response to requests for such information from regulatory authorities outside the State; the bank's obligations under the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and the conveyance of information to the European Monetary Institute in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 56 facilitates the protection of the payments system in the event of a liquidation by requiring that the Central Bank be notified of any petition for winding up before the petition is presented.  In a number of countries there exists a provision in law called the &ldquo;zero-hour rule&rdquo; whereby a liquidator of a defaulting bank can ask the courts to set aside all financial transactions and payments made by the bank between the time the liquidator was appointed and the previous midnight, &ldquo;zero hour&rdquo;.  Among EU authorities there is a general concern to involve the central banks at an early stage so as to limit the potential damage to payments systems of any such rulings.  There is no precedent for such a ruling in Ireland but it is not precluded.  The requirement that the bank be notified of any petition for winding up before the petition is presented should ensure the protection of the payments system in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 59 amends section 90 of the 1989 Act, which relates to the supervision by the Central <Col N="656" /> Bank of firms established in the International Financial Services Centre, to allow the bank to enforce its supervision from an earlier date specified by the bank.  Under the existing legislation, Central Bank supervision commences when the tax certificate is issued by the Minister.  However, several firms operate in the centre in advance of receiving the certificate.  This section allows the bank to enforce its supervision from an earlier date specified by the bank &mdash; for example, the date on which a firm's application to set up in the centre is accepted.  The practice whereby firms are approved in principle and start operations prior to certification has become well established and the supervisory law must recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>Sections 66 to 70 delete provisions in Irish law which conflict with Article 104 of the Treaty on European Union which prohibits monetary financing of the public sector by central banks and this is where we reach our reference, however limited, to economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 79, I have to admit that even Homer nods.  This section provides for the bank and any subsidiaries of the bank to be subject to value for money audits under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  In order to facilitate separate arrangements to make the bank accountable to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, an order was made under section 21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, which had the effect of excluding the bank from examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This order had the unintended effect of removing the bank from the list of bodies subject to the value for money audit under the Act.  This section provides for the bank and any of its subsidiaries to be subject to such audits.</P>
    <P>Section 80 amends section 101 (a) of the Building Societies Act, 1989, to provide for more equitable treatment of certain joint account holders as respects voting rights and the issue of free shares in the context of future conversions of building societies.  The need for this amendment arises from experience with the conversion of the Irish Permanent to a plc.  There was controversy regarding a number of joint account holders who did not qualify for free shares because of the order of the names on an account or shareholding following death or marriage of a joint account holder, even though the joint account would have otherwise met the relevant qualifying criteria, in particular being a shareholder for two years.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is a provision to allow the Minister to transpose into Irish Law the new EU Directive on Cross-Border Credit Transfers which during the Irish Presidency of the EU, I managed to steer through the tortuous conciliation procedure with the European Parliament.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State for her comprehensive presentation of the Bill. This Bill is very diverse in the range of activities <Col N="657" /> it covers.  The Bill purports in the terms of its Title to deal with the Central Bank, but half of the provisions are analogous to the Central Bank. The Bill is not just complex but is composite legislation which seeks a range of complex achievements.  One can argue in favour of such legislative arrangements whereby certain provisions are piggy-backed, so to speak, on a central legislative provision.</P>
      <P>The composite approach in this instance is not a good approach.  It prevents us from focusing on the core issue in the Bill.  Generally speaking, legislation should be as focused as possible and there is nothing wrong with short Bills seeking to achieve a specific purpose.  If we are enacting legislation to consolidate a variety of related items of legislation the approach adopted in this Bill carries with it certain dangers.  It makes it difficult for either House of the Oireachtas to focus in a way that will do justice to the provisions the Bill seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>It was suggested in the Dáil that the Bill had the appearance of being driven by the need to preserve a role for the Central Bank after economic and monetary union transfers its functions to Frankfurt.  I am sure that is a little disingenuous but it is an idea that suggests itself on reading the Bill.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Bill is driven by territorial imperatives of the Central Bank, which faces a degree of pruning in the not too distant future with the move into economic and monetary union.  It was also suggested in the Dáil that the Bill was little more than an attempt at &ldquo;feather-bedding&rdquo;&mdash; providing new roles for an institution which will lose some of its core functions.  In her response in the Dáil I do not think the Minister of State entirely dispelled that suspicion and, although her speech this morning was comprehensive, the suspicion lingers.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the regulation of payments systems.  It extends to the Central Bank the right to become a party to a payments system and to become involved in the regulation of such systems.  That would merit the entire focus of an item of legislation in itself.  Section 15 allows the bank to impose requirements on members of a payments system and that is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank already possesses analogous powers in so far as it currently regulates banking payment operations and charges.  The Central Bank does not acquit itself well in this regard. Banking in Ireland has been allowed to operate as a cartel, in effect, since the foundation of the State.  Real competition is only recently becoming evident and the extent of real competition when one compares charges must be questioned. Despite greater competition and recent profits, the Irish banking system continues to impose punitive charges on the accounts of individuals and small firms.  The Central Bank has not used its existing regulatory powers to positive public benefit so there is a question mark over giving it additional regulatory powers, as is done in Part <Col N="658" /> II.  Perhaps it is time the Oireachtas debated the existing regulatory arrangements within the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Part III gives the authority for the formation and acquisition of subsidiary bodies by the Central Bank subject to the consent of the Minister. There are certain dangers in this.  Over the years in the State-sponsored sector &mdash; not just in Ireland but worldwide &mdash; acquisitions and extensions into subsidiary areas have proven difficult to control.  I would have imagined an arrangement to allow the Central Bank to acquire a subsidiary body should also receive the prior, positive affirmation of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I am concerned that it will only require the prior consent of the Minister.  For some time there has been a rather incestuous relationship between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, so perhaps the Minister will consider making any acquisition subject not just to the consent of the Minister but to the positive approval of Dáil and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the functions and duties of the Governor of the Central Bank.  Section 23 provides he shall attend before the Dáil Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and furnish it with any information requested.  The Minister gave a comprehensive reason for including that provision, which I endorse because it provides a degree of clarity.  However, one House of the Oireachtas, Seanad Éireann, is excluded, a point I have had to make on several occasions in the recent past to a variety of Ministers.  Is it wise to specify in this section, with such particularity, the committee before which the Governor should appear?  It is not impossible to envisage that other committees may wish to meet him.  It is dangerous to specify because it would give the Governor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not specify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies has had difficulty getting people to appear before it.  I understand from the Minister's remark that this is not meant to be a constricting section and I accept that.  However, whatever the current intent of the section may be, it gives rise to the danger that a future Governor who may wish to be less than forthcoming will use it to avoid appearing before other committees.  If I am wrong the Minister can correct me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 empowers the Central Bank to assist the Central Statistics Office in the collection, compilation, analysis or interpretation of balance of payments, national accounts or other financial statistics.  This is an odd provision as one would have imagined the utmost co-operation between these agencies.  When I was an official in the Department of Finance I was deeply concerned at the lack of co-operation between the various agencies involved in the compilation and production of national income and expenditure statistics.  Shortly after I left the Department, when I worked as a consultant, it struck me that <Col N="659" /> no section of Government knew what happened in other sections.  An almost proprietorial attitude was adopted by each agency to the statistics and material they generated; this had no good purpose and did not serve the public interest.  I am, therefore, surprised that it is necessary to give effect in statute to something which should have occurred anyway but there must be a good reason and I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate what it is.</P>
    <P>Section 25 amends section 19 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, and extends the proper prohibition on the Governor being a director of a licensed bank.  Is the extension needed because of the increased number of roles given to the Central Bank under this Bill?  Arrangements which apply elsewhere could apply here.  Rather than it being necessary to introduce a measure like this at each change in the role of the Central Bank, there could be a general prohibition on the Governor being a director of any institution.  I have no adverse comment on section 26 but I wonder why it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part V which deals with the operations and supervision of <i>bureaux de change.</i> Some of them are little more than free-wheeling, bucket shop operations and there are considerable and inexplicable variations in their rates and charges, so I am glad the business will now be regulated.  As the OECD task force warned, there is a danger that unregulated <i>bureaux de change</i> could become involved in major criminal activity like money laundering and, while there is no evidence of that in Ireland, the Minister is right to take note of the point.  However, why did she draw back in her contribution from fully endorsing the findings of the OECD task force?  Notwithstanding comments made elsewhere about Part V, its provisions are good.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged that Part VI is somewhat heterogeneous.  It is like a muesli with almost everything included &mdash; it is difficult to comprehend, its diversity is unsatisfactory and it raises a number of issues.  Sections 35 and 36 provide an indemnity to banks arising from any refusal to cash or transfer a cheque to another in pursuance of an endorsement on the cheque to the effect that it is &ldquo;account payee only&rdquo;.  I am not clear what the sections mean, although the Minister referred to the need to protect clients. Other sections of Part VI touch on the composition of the board and the governorship of the Central Bank, matters worthy of being debated at other times as well as on this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said, there has been an almost incestuous relationship between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  The tradition has been that the Central Bank governorship has almost inevitably been a sinecure, albeit a valuable and central appointment, for a retiring Secretary of the Department of Finance.  I wonder at the way governors and members of the board of the bank have been appointed.  While governors have served the State well, there is a need for a wider <Col N="660" /> debate on the composition of the board of the bank because, notwithstanding the advent of economic and monetary union when it will have a different focus, it will play an increasingly important role in the economic life of the nation.</P>
    <P>Part VI also deals with important lessons that have arisen from investment intermediaries, especially from the collapse of the Taylor group. There is a recognition of failure in this section. The decision to pass responsibility from the Department of Enterprise and Employment to the bank is important.  In my experience, the Department has been timid and fearful in implementing its supervisory role.  On four or five occasions in this House I asked that a designated official be appointed by the Department to examine the affairs of companies concerned with Clonamannon over a number of years.  This finally occurred after 18 to 20 months of lobbying.  The then Minister was advised that my proposition was so novel that it was outside the law.  While Ministers involved shared my concern, the advices they received from the Department were narrowly drafted and timid.  It has failed in its responsibilities as an agency in this area, and Part VI of the Bill recognises that.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing debate on the Taylor affair.  A point made is the need for the publication of as much material as possible arising from the belated interventions of the designated official and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The Minister of State has explained that he does not wish to publish the full details of the report on the affair because he and his officials are anxious not to prejudice future action.  While no public representative would wish this, there is a need for information and for details of the investigation to become available as soon as possible.  Deputy O'Rourke called on the Minister of State to publish as much material as possible, without prejudicing future actions, and to let us have reference in the report to the failures of supervision.  They would be helpful to formulating our views on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty understanding the impact of sections 50 to 54 in so far as monetary financing of the public sector by central banks is prohibited. Will the Minister of State elaborate on this?  I welcome section 63, which provides for the Central Bank to be subject to value for money audits under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  I encountered difficulties with the bank over its reluctance to hold any debate on the issue of new coinage.  Its approach did not represent best value for money.  However, a lacuna which existed is now being addressed.</P>
    <P>I have no specific difficulties with the Bill. However, a Bill like this, containing such a diverse range of complex issues, is very difficult. Where possible we should avoid dealing with complex issues in the form of composite legislation. It has proven to be dangerous and even disastrous in other jurisdictions, for example, in the US, where there is a tendency to piggy back on legislation.  We should not go down that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State for steering through section 22 and the provision regarding cross-Border credit transfers during the busy Presidency of the EU.  I do not have great difficulty with the Bill, which is very technical. Given this, I will deal with aspects of it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes provisions relating to payment systems, <i>bureaux de change</i> and investment intermediaries as well as dealing with a number of other matters in Central Bank legislation which require updating.  The Minister of State pointed out that the growth of international trade, the size of daily settlements, the increase in the use of electronic payments and volatility of trade flows have caused central banks to take steps to address various risks arising in their domestic payment systems.  She went on to say that the current payment system, which has served us well to date, is not properly equipped to respond adequately to the increasing pace of change in money transmission services.</P>
      <P>The Government is right to ensure that the payment systems in the State are effective, efficient and open and that the systems themselves do not add to or cause instability in the operation of financial markets.  The Central Bank will be given the power for the first time to approve the establishment of payment systems and vet their rules.  These powers will also apply in the case of existing payment systems.  I am pleased that the Government has decided to include provisions to give the bank the appropriate powers of supervision with regard to <i>bureaux de change.</i></P>
      <P>Section 79 provides for the bank and any of its subsidiaries to be subject to value for money audits under the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  To facilitate separate arrangements to make the bank accountable to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, an order was made under section 21 of that Act which has the effect of excluding the bank from examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This had the unintended effect of removing the bank from the list of bodies subject to the value for money audit under the Act. The section provides that the bank and any of its subsidiaries are to be subject to such audits.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the amendment of the Building Societies Act, 1989, to provide for more equitable treatment to certain joint account holders in respect of voting rights and the issue of free shares in the context of future conversions of building societies.  The need for this amendment arises following the conversion of the then Irish Permanent Building Society to a plc.  It generated controversy when some people who had been account holders for years did not get shares.  I understand that the company will be providing approximately £14 million later this year for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has included section 80 in the Bill.  I agree with Senator Roche <Col N="662" /> about what happened with Taylor Investments; it was a scandal and should be debated.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State elaborate on the issue of crossed cheques?  People can be caused a great deal of embarrassment when they try to cash a cheque in a bank with which they do not have an account and the bank refuses.</P>
    <P>Nobody disagrees with competition.  However, there are too many financial institutions in this country.  Our population is only 3.6 million but every financial institution &mdash; building societies, banks, credit unions &mdash; is represented in every town.  They would not be in business unless they were making money and it is ordinary people who have to pay.  We must examine the area of controlling interest rates and bank charges for lodging coins, cashing cheques and so on.  I do not know how financial institutions make money because ordinary businesses can fold and go out of business as a result of competition.  However, apart from Taylor Investments, it appears financial institutions do not go out of business.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to discuss the issue of small family businesses with the Minister for Finance.  If the majority of family business owners run short of money, get into financial difficulties or wish to set up a business, they approach their parents, brothers or sisters for financial aid.  Tax concessions should be given to relatives who invest in family business.  The majority of family members have, at some stage, contributed to their family business but have received no reward in terms of tax relief.  There is great scope in that regard for immediate family members to invest in family businesses.</P>
    <P>The first time home buyer's grant of £3,000 was introduced a number of years ago to aid the then ailing building industry.  However, there has been a complete turnabout in that area and now the building industry can exploit house buyers. Recently, people have been queueing to buy houses in Dublin.  However, they are only queueing to buy new houses; I do not see any queues to buy second-hand houses.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister for Finance that the £3,000 first time house buyer's grant should also be made available to first time buyers of second-hand houses.  There is great value in second-hand houses for the people who are setting out in life and buying a house for the first time.  There have been large increases in property prices throughout the country recently, with some properties doubling in value.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the Bill, with which I have no great difficulties.  It is a very technical Bill and I would like to go into it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very technical Bill which provides for a range of new measures relating to the powers and obligations of the Central Bank, including the provision for the accountability of the Governor of the Central Bank, extension of the Central Bank's supervision and <Col N="663" /> enforcement powers and supervision of <i>bureaux de change.</i>  These are designed to comply with the provisions of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the regulation of the establishment and operation of payment systems in the State.  Briefly, these provisions will require all payment systems to be approved and have their roles vetted by the Central Bank, which is very welcome.  Part III gives authority for the formation or acquisition of subsidiary bodies by the Central Bank.  Part IV deals with the accountability of the Governor of the Central Bank while having regard to the independence of the bank.  It provides for the attendance by the Governor of the Central Bank, if so requested, before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs of Dáil Éireann.  Those provisions are very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to electronic payments.  It is possible for people in far off parts of the world, through the use of credit cards and otherwise, to move money.  That must be properly controlled or else it will lead to money laundering and the transferring out of the State of money obtained by dubious methods.  I welcome the controls in the Bill for this.  The speed, volatility and huge volume of world trade means that Ireland cannot allow itself to be left behind.</P>
      <P>We need tighter controls to prevent fraud, particularly the loss of clients' savings by companies which act as brokers for people who freely and honestly give them their money.  The steps being taken in the Bill will help to eliminate that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions which have been made regarding <i>bureaux de change</i>, especially in relation to money laundering.  However, the Central Bank and the authorities should also look at the rates of exchange offered and commissions charged by <i>bureaux de change.</i>  The rate of exchange offered by these <i>bureaux</i>, which often do not work to the good of the customer, is often very different to that quoted in the newspapers. The requirement on future <i>bureaux</i> to be authorised by the Central Bank is a very welcome step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Sections 50 and 51 deal with the legal status of cheques marked &ldquo;account payee only&rdquo;.  It is very important to give these cheques legal status.  When payments are made to a client through an agent, one dishonest person handling money that way can lead the client along the wrong road.  If the legal status of these cheques, marked account payee, are strictly adhered to, the money will get to the client properly.  They can easily open an account in a bank rather than running the risk of the money being handled in a dubious fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the provision for the regulation of investment firms with controls for the Central Bank as distinct from having them dealt with by the Department of Enterprise and Employment. This will lead to more safety in investment.  In order to provide an nest egg for their futures, some people invest their savings and find themselves <Col N="664" /> caught out as has happened in the past. The more regulation we have to prevent this the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their support for the Bill and their constructive questioning of certain elements.  I appreciate that it is a wide ranging and technical Bill.</P>
      <P>However, I do not accept Senator Roche's point that only 50 per cent of the Bill relates to the activities of the Central Bank.  This Bill is necessary to clear the decks before the publication of the economic and monetary union Bill. On the issue of economic and monetary union, this Bill is not designed to feather bed the jobs of central bankers in the post-EMU period as was suggested by the Senator.  The only functions that will transfer from the Central Bank to the European Central Bank will be those relating to monetary policy.  All other functions, in particular those related to the regulation of the financial markets, will remain the responsibility of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche called for a wider debate on the composition of the board of the Central Bank and the manner of the appointment of the Governor. These are issues which will have to be addressed in regard to the economic and monetary union Bill and I look forward to an extensive debate on these and other issues when that Bill is published and introduced before the Houses.  The Senator also mentioned bank charges.  The Central Bank no longer has responsibility for these; it is now a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.</P>
      <P>The provision dealing with subsidiaries of the Central Bank is an enabling one and not only is the approval of the Minister for Finance required but the possible functions of such subsidiaries are delineated in the Bill.  They can only perform functions which the Central Bank is empowered to do and are subject to whatever direction or guidelines that may be given to the bank.</P>
      <P>Senator Roche referred to the Taylor affair.  I am aware the Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology has issued a statement to the effect that the report of the authorised officer of the Department of Enterprise and Employment appointed to investigate the collapse of the Taylor group of investment companies will not be published.  The decision not to publish the report is based on legal constraints and I thank Senators for recognising those constraints.  We must do nothing as public representatives to prejudice due legal process. The investigation into the collapse of the Taylor group is a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  I am not in a position to comment further on the matter as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Roche referred to section 26 and inquired about its purpose at present.  The Governor of the Central Bank is prohibited from holding office as a director of the bank and <Col N="665" /> section 26 extends this prohibition to all other financial institutions regulated or supervised by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to the crossed cheques provision.  I will deal with that in more deal on Committee Stage.  There are concerns about the legal interpretation of the move we have planned in this Bill in response to the insurance industry. I am looking at that again and will return to it on Committee Stage.  We must do nothing to make life more difficult for individuals who wish to cash crossed cheques in banks, particularly if they do not have an account in the bank.  That is not the intention of the proposal and I will also be looking at that on Committee Stage in response to representations from the banking industry on their concerns on that matter.  I thank Senators for their supportive comments on different aspects of the Bill and for underlining areas of concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I became Minister for Justice I was acutely aware of the need for reform of our courts system.  A full reappraisal of where the courts stood and where the system was going was long overdue.  A fresh approach was badly needed.  A vastly increased volume of civil actions, family law business and criminal cases over a number of years meant that the entire courts system was under considerable strain.  The most serious and immediate problem was, of course, the delays in the hearing of actions and appeals at all levels of <Col N="666" /> the courts system.  This adversely affected litigants, victims of crime, the business sector and the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>The first major step I took to turn around this unsatisfactory state of affairs was to introduce and secure the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  That Act provided for a total increase of 18 in the statutory maximum limit of judges &mdash; three in the Supreme Court, three in the High Court, seven in the Circuit Court and five in the District Court.  All but three of those extra judges have been appointed.  The 1995 Act contained other innovative reforms that improved the position considerably &mdash; for example, by enabling the Supreme Court to sit in two divisions which could hear appeals simultaneously and by giving the Master of the High Court and county registrars the power to deal with business that previously only judges could handle.</P>
      <P>Last summer I brought forward the Courts Bill, 1996, to increase the maximum statutory limit on the number of judges of the Circuit Court by a further three to 28 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court.  The Courts Act, 1996, and the 1995 Act have provided for an additional ten Circuit Court judges, that is, an increase of more than 50 per cent in the number of judges of that court.  Developments in the family law area and changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts in 1991 had a major impact on the volume and complexity of business coming before the courts system as a whole but this affected the Circuit Court in particular.</P>
      <P>The implementation of divorce legislation is likely to impact further on the volume of business, particularly in the Circuit Court.  It is not yet possible to assess its long-term requirements for judicial and staffing resources but in the short term it is expected that there will be a considerable number of applications to the courts.  My Department is currently in touch with the Department of Finance regarding the provision of additional staff in this regard.  If a continuing upward trend becomes apparent, I assure the House that the Government will examine the need for additional judges and staff in that specific context.</P>
      <P>The appointment of additional judges has enabled the President of the High Court to arrange additional sittings of the Central Criminal Court and the President of the Circuit Court to arrange additional sittings of the Circuit Court around the country, particularly in areas where delays are most acute.  Alongside my legislative programme, this development has had a significant effect on the arrears of cases before those courts.  My strategy has been to combine the allocation of additional judicial resources with practical legislative and administrative reforms to quickly equip the courts system with the means to make inroads on delays in hearing cases and appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strategy has produced excellent results. The existing backlogs in the courts are well on the <Col N="667" /> way to being cleared.  For example, in the Dublin Circuit Court I understand that new litigants in civil cases can now obtain a court date within six weeks of the lodgment of their case.  This compares to a delay of two years last July.  In family law cases in the Dublin Circuit Court the delay has been reduced from 16 months to four months and there are now no delays in the hearing of criminal cases in the Dublin Circuit Court.  I hope Members will recognise that a serious attempt is being made to reduce the delays and that the strategy the Government and I adopted has produced excellent results.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of personal injury actions in the High Court have been reduced from 35 months to 20 months and delays in the hearing of cases in the Central Criminal Court have been reduced to as low as six months in some cases. There have been similar substantial reductions in delays in the hearing of cases in the provincial Circuit Court.  For example, delays in the hearing of civil cases in Galway have been reduced from two years to as low as three months and delays in the hearing of family law cases, involving a great deal of trauma, which were up to six months have been eliminated.  The vast majority of provincial Circuit Court venues have experienced this pattern of reductions in the level of delays in the hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>A major step has been taken to reform the courts system with the establishment of the working group on a courts commission which I set up at the end of 1995, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, to review the operation and financing of the courts system with particular regard to the quality of service provided to the public.  I also asked the group to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in line with the commitment to that effect in the Government of Renewal programme.</P>
    <P>Last November, the Government approved the recommendation contained in the working group's third report, <i>Towards the Courts Service</i>, to the effect that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to legislate for a courts service as an independent and permanent body and accorded priority to the drafting of this Bill.  The legislation which is required to enable the new courts service to be established is being dealt with as a priority in my Department and this measure will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The working group is continuing its work on the review of the day to day operation of the courts system and it will submit further reports to me as appropriate.  This is valuable work and I take this opportunity to again thank Mrs. Justice Denham and the other members of the working group for the very important work they have undertaken in this area.  This strategy for the longer term development of the courts system is, in my view, crucial.  Too many sticking plasters were put on other areas of the courts and prison <Col N="668" /> system in the past and these fundamental and long-term changes need to be made to the courts system.  The reason the working group has been so successful is that all those involved, including the members of the group, the staff associations and the staff who sent submissions and met the group, have been positive about the concept of a new courts service.</P>
    <P>Another major area of concern which I am actively addressing is the standard of court accommodation.  A major courts building programme has been drawn up and a number of works are under way throughout the country.  I am aware that, despite work carried out in recent years, the standard of much court accommodation throughout the country is seriously inadequate and is failing to provide the facilities necessary for persons using the courts.  Therefore, I have obtained £7.5 million from the Government this year to carry out capital projects and a further £1.6 million for maintenance projects. This is the highest amount to be allocated in one year since financial responsibility for courthouses was transferred to the Exchequer in March 1990 and is an indication of the Government's commitment to provide modern court accommodation which is necessary for the effective discharge of court business.  During the next month or so new courthouses will be provided at the former River-bank Theatre and the former Richmond Hospital in Dublin, at Carrick-on-Shannon and at Naas. Work on the building of a new courthouse in Tallaght has just commenced and major projects in Ennis, Listowel, Longford, Trim and Cork city will also get under way this year.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill, Senators will be aware of recent Government decisions to appoint two judges of the High Court, Ms Justice Mella Carroll to the Nursing Commission and Mr. Justice Brian McCracken to the Dunnes tribunal.  These developments will naturally have implications for the existing judicial resources in the High Court and that is the background to this Bill.  I would be most concerned if the progress that has already been made in reducing delays in hearing criminal and civil cases before the High Court was adversely affected by the appointment, albeit temporary, to other duties of the two judges I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit on the number of judges of the High Court, not including the President of the High Court, from 19, as set by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, to 22.  This will be raised to 23 where one of the judges of the High Court is appointed to the position of commissioner in the Law Reform Commission, which is a standard provision.  It is my intention that one new judge should be appointed to the High Court when the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>The Bill takes account, therefore, of the need for possible future increases that may be required in the number of High Court judges.  I believe that approach makes better sense than legislating to increase the complement of judges on an <i>ad <Col N="669" /> hoc</i> basis on each occasion that an additional judge might be required.  Urgent circumstances could arise in the future which would require the appointment of an additional High Court judge. This Bill means that it will be possible to respond to such a need without having to bring forward another Courts Bill.</P>
    <P>We had not anticipated that two High Court judges would be working for the State in connection with the nursing commission or the Dunnes tribunal.  The legislation provides that the Government of the day may, if necessary, appoint two additional judges to the High Court.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, my key priorities are tackling immediate problems and implementing a longer term development strategy for the courts. The reforms I have already put in place and ongoing reforms will ensure for the future that the courts will have the capacity to respond effectively to the demands placed on them.  This commitment of resources and longer term planning is vital for the operation of an efficient system of justice.  That is a standard the public is entitled to expect and which I am confident my reforms will deliver.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important measure that will enable the very significant progress that has been achieved in the operation of our courts system to be maintained and developed further and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always welcome when progress is being made.  I will not take from the progress made by the Government in respect of the appointment of additional judges.  I agree with many of the sentiments in the Minister's contribution.</P>
      <P>Enormous progress has been made in Circuit Courts throughout the country and the backlog in the Dublin Circuit Court has been virtually eliminated. The Minister stated that new litigants in civil cases can obtain a court date within six weeks of the lodgement of their case.  However, the correct position is that a case will be heard within six weeks by the Dublin Circuit Court when notice of trial has been served and all pleadings in that case have been closed.  That is to be welcomed because justice delayed is justice denied.</P>
      <P>I am slightly puzzled by the fact that additional judges were not appointed in the past.  Lack of resources may have been one of the reasons for this.  Past years were not as bounteous as this or last year and the cost to pay and maintain a judge is quite high.  The figure provided in the explanatory memorandum is approximately £131,000, which includes payments to support staff, etc. Therefore, the appointment of judges is an expensive process.  However, I remain puzzled why additional judges were not appointed in the past.  In fairness, the Minister's predecessor, initiated the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, which contains a provision for the appointment of additional judges but she was not in power when the legislation was finally passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> The Minister may be pleased to discover that I do not intend to shout or roar about anything to which she referred.  I genuinely welcome the appointment of additional judges and the progress that has been made.  I also welcome the fact that, on many country circuits, two Circuit Court judges hear cases.  This has a double effect: it ensures that cases are heard sooner, previously one judge served five to six counties, and barristers can no longer withhold a number cases to have them heard on the same day.  For example, a barrister may have a case in County Longford and one in County Laois on the same day and cannot deal with both.  This has streamlined the system and ensures that cases are heard sooner.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced about the High Court.  The Minister stated that the delay in cases coming before this court has been reduced from 35 to 20 months, approximately.  This remains an unacceptable waiting period.  I am not stating that I have all the answers.  I believe the late Justice Niall McCarthy stated that a person who had to wait such a long period for their case to be heard might well have good cause to take a case for judicial review.</P>
    <P>The Constitution makes it clear that people have a right to avail of the administration of justice. Implied in that right is a further right to have one's case heard within a reasonable period.  I believe that the 20 month waiting period might be too long.  I am not accusing the Minister of being complacent but I ask her to review that figure and work further to reduce it.</P>
    <P>I have a general reservation about the Bill and I would be failing in my responsibility were I not to mention it.  If some of the additional judges appointed are going to be involved in criminal cases, one must ask if they are serving any useful purpose.  In an article which appeared in yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> a judge appointed by a previous Government was quoted as stating that the law was being brought into disrepute because of the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; prison system.  The article further states that Judge Gerard Haughton refused to hand down a prison sentence to a serial shoplifter who admitted several theft charges. Those are his words not mine.  I know the prisons issue is not being discussed here today.</P>

      <P>I cannot close my eyes to the fact that a judge said there is no point sending someone to prison because there is no prison place for them.  Can the Minister assure me that prison places will be available for people convicted by these new judges?  If the Minister is not able to give me such assurance and if some of these judges are involved in criminal trials, is it not open to a charge of vacuousness to appoint a judge in such circumstances?  It is entirely different if they are dealing with civil matters.  The Minister must accept my concern at appointing judges to hear criminal cases in circumstances where there is no effective sanction available for the people who are convicted.</P>
      <P>On 9 October 1996 the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, said in this House: &ldquo;I am the person who proposed postponing Castlerea prison because, at the time, the programme for its construction would not have created extra prison places until 1998&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister has no view on the matter, but she did not inform the House about whether she agreed with that proposal. Given this Government's alleged commitment to openness and transparency, it is not unfair of me to ask her to state publicly if she was aware of that proposal and, if so, if she agreed or disagreed with it.  Given the serious problems in the administration of justice, an answer should be forthcoming.  I have not called for the Minister's resignation or for the resignation of any member of the Government.  However, if the Minister for Finance proposed to postpone Castlerea prison, he has questions to answer, particularly in light of the shortage of prison places as exemplified by the judge's comments.  I am not saying the Minister is obligated to answer on his behalf, but he should answer these questions to alleviate the public's concerns.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil wants to assist in the fight against crime.  We welcome the appointment of new judges and we hope their addition to the bench, whether for civil or criminal cases, will assist in speeding up the administration of justice and in bringing criminals to bear responsibility for their activities.</P>

      <P>This Bill is part of the Minister's package to improve the criminal justice system and to give the courts a stronger role and make them more efficient so that law and order is restored in our society and the State is able to protect its people.  This is one of many measures the Minister has brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I welcome the fact that the problem of delays in the courts, which was discussed in both Houses for many years, has been tackled. As Senator Mulcahy said, further improvements are needed, but we should recognise that considerable progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Delays in the litigation area have been reduced from 35 months to 20 months in the High Court. While we would like to see this reduced further, the process which has developed over the years is a delaying factor in itself because parties wish to <Col N="672" /> discuss the issues involved.  While the majority of cases are resolved outside the court, a system has developed which makes it more difficult to speed up these cases.  I am sure Senator Mulcahy understands better than I the steps the court takes to postpone cases to see if a settlement can be reached.</P>

      <P>Which I would question, although a settlement is found in many circumstances.  I also question the compensation culture which has developed in society and the role our legal system plays in this area.</P>
      <P>Many genuine claimants, who were advised not to return to work as it would affect the outcome of their cases, suffered from stress as a result of these delays.  At least the delays will be reduced from 35 months to 20 months as a result of the appointment of additional judges.</P>
      <P>Many of the Bills the Minister introduced are now law.  This has led to an increase in the number of citizens sentenced to prison, which is putting extra pressure on the prison services.  The Minister has provided 160 extra prison places in the past two years and an additional 850 spaces will be available by the end of 1998.  This represents a one third increase in prison places.  The prison population is currently 2,300, but it is increasing like in other western countries.  The Minister said the US authorities, for example, would need to build a prison every three days to meet the increase in crime.  The Minister has also been criticised in the past two weeks for creating an extra 100 places by doubling up the number of prisoners in each cell.  None of us would like to see that happen but we must recognise that because of pressure on the prison system, the Minister took an unpopular decision, which could be criticised, to increase the number of places in this way.  While we do not like it, we have to recognise that it was necessary in the present circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, at last, recognised the fact that there is an urgent need for improving the conditions of our courts.  While I cannot put a figure on it, the conditions in many of our courts are appalling.  As a member of the Employment Appeals Tribunal since 1989 I have visited many of these courts, especially in the south-west and I am surprised they have been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent.  Such conditions would not be tolerated in other State sectors.  At times, judges have rightly refused to sit in certain courts.</P>
      <P>We should, however, recognise that for the first time the Minister is investing £7.5 million to carry out capital projects as well as providing a further £1.6 million for maintenance projects.  That is the highest amount to be allocated in one year to this sector since 1990 when it became the responsibility of the Exchequer.  It is a small but important area that the Minister is dealing with.  The Minister and the Government should be encouraged to improve the contributions to that area to ensure that out prison standards reach a level of acceptability.  The Minister is making a serious attempt to reduce delays in the court system.  She has successfully done so to date and this will contribute to that effort.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill which I welcome as a small contribution in the context of ensuring that the criminal justice system, including the courts, is more efficient, and that our citizens can be protected.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the efforts being made by the Minister for Justice to deal with the problems of the court system.  We all welcome the principle of the Bill, which is to increase the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  The Minister is acutely aware of the need for reform of the court system and has taken <Col N="674" /> steps to establish the working group and the Courts Commission, which was set up almost two years ago, as well as the appointment of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham to review the operation of funding and financing of the court system.</P>
      <P>I was going to ask how the recommendation relating to the establishment of the Courts Commission was progressing but the Minister already said it is being dealt with as a priority within her Department and will be published as soon as possible.  I welcome that fact.  I also welcome the increase in the number of judges in the High Court, a move that has reduced the backlog by allowing additional sittings to take place.  While the progress that has been made in that area is welcome, and we are never satisfied with everything the Minister does, she has made quite a number of improvements in this difficult area.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on areas of the court system which need attention.  All these areas have a cost factor and I appreciate the Minister does not have unlimited resources at her disposal.  However, she must make decisions and try to target those areas she feels need particular attention.  In a recent report on the family law courts, the Law Reform Commission referred to what it described as &ldquo;the negative ethos of the court system as it currently operates in the area of family law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As a politician, more and more people come to me with difficulties they are experiencing in the family law area.  With the introduction of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, and given the incidence of family breakdown and separation, family law is an area with which we are becoming more familiar.</P>
      <P>When referring to the negative ethos of the court system, the Law Reform Commission explained it as follows:</P>
      <P>Instead of concentrating on the empowerment of individuals to resolve their own family disputes by encouraging negotiation and agreement, the emphasis of our system, with its concentration on adjudication, is on solutions which take control away from the participants.  A humane system of family law is one which encourages the responsible resolution and management of disputes wherever possible by members of the family themselves. Judicial intervention is, of course, necessary to prevent exploitation or abuse between family members.  The ideal of empowerment should not blind us to the problems of inequality which may arise in a system of private ordering. This apart, it is perhaps time to consider how reforms in our legal process may help in the process of family empowerment.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations of the Law Reform Commission is the establishment of a system of regional family courts based in 15 centres around the country, operating as a separate division of the Circuit Court and presided over by judges nominated to serve for a period of at least one year who are assigned on the basis of their suitability to deal with family law matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> I appreciate the Minister's efforts, and those of the Government, to increase the number of judges and to establish the principle of judicial training.  Much remains to be done, however, and it is disappointing that neither the Family Law (Divorce) Act nor this Bill has taken on board the family law reforms suggested by the Law Reform Commission.  It is a difficult situation and the Minister cannot solve every problem at once, but I am concerned about this area, nonetheless.</P>
    <P>Another idea of the Law Reform Commission is that each regional family court should have attached to it a family law information centre with responsibility for providing impartial and objectively presented information relating to possible alternatives to litigation, the implications of separation, court processes and the availability of support services.  This is an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>While the Family Law (Divorce) Act, like the Judicial Separation Act, obliges a solicitor to inform clients of the availability of mediation services, there must be a danger in many cases that this will be no more than a ritual to be gone through.  While the concept of mediation has much to recommend it, one wonders whether there exists a sufficiently comprehensive service to meet the levels of demand, particularly those that can be envisaged after the passing of the Family Law (Divorce) Act.</P>
    <P>We need to establish a regulatory regime involving accreditation and recognition of training qualifications if we are sincere about shifting family disputes away from the courts and into the area of mediation.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the establishment of the Courts Commission and I welcome the Minister saying this will be a priority in the Department of Justice.  All Members would have to say they are in favour of more judges as we would be in favour of more gardaí or hospitals.  I appreciate the efforts the Minister is making in this area and I welcome and support this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State in her speech said that the Bill being debated today is an important measure that will enable the very significant progress achieved in the operation of our court system to be maintained.  This important measure allows for the appointment of one High Court Judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The framework will allow for three but this means that one High Court judge will now be appointed.  To call that an important measure is an abuse of language.  The Minister appears to have indicated that the reason for this important measure &ldquo;to enable the immediate appointment of a High Court judge&rdquo; is that Mr. Justice Brian McCracken has been allocated to the Dunnes Stores tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government set their face against appointing a tribunal on this issue and strongly resisted <Col N="676" /> that idea.  When a similar Bill to the present one was introduced recently, it was on the basis that the complement of judges in the High Court and the Circuit Court was adequate.  Otherwise, the Minister could have increased the panel or limit as I invited her to do.  Then she would have been able to work within that limit to appoint judges. However, the Government did not want any extra appointments at that time and made no such provision. Now they have reversed their decision on the Dunnes Stores tribunal and have brought in what the Minister calls a very important measure that will enable her to appoint one High Court judge.</P>
    <P>This raises questions about the rationale behind the repudiation of a tribunal and the subsequent appointment of one that will demand considerable time from Mr. Justice McCracken.  I have no reservations about a tribunal but I query how a Government can make it clear they do not want a tribunal and subsequently announce they have changed their decision, appointing an extra judge because Mr. Justice McCracken is busy with the tribunal.  It is a gross distortion of language to say this is important legislation on that basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave this Bill a brief introduction. I cannot recall any legislation having such a limited purpose as this one in my time in the Oireachtas; the Minister herself said so.  The Bill enables the Minister to appoint an extra High Court judge.</P>

      <P>The Minister could again shelter behind a judge to avoid the Government's responsibility.  Why not appoint another commission for the gardaí?  The Government could again shelter behind the Judiciary instead of acting effectively.  If the teachers approach the Government, another judge could be appointed to a tribunal because we now have the framework to appoint more judges to the bench.  The incoming Government will act responsibly, as it has since 1987, in the interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Anyone familiar with the courts will be aware that there has been an improvement in the Circuit Court where there was a very severe backlog; I supported the Minister on that issue.  Now the appointment of Circuit Court judges has been vindicated, although I have some queries nonetheless.  The Minister may have to consider extra appointments.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Equality and Law Reform was in the House I queried one provision of his divorce legislation; it concerned people living apart in the same house.  That Bill is now law, and one can only qualify for divorce proceedings by being separated or living apart for four years. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform introduced the provision where people could be living apart in the same house and I queried the effect this would have on the presentation of evidence. The Minister's response was that the judge would know who was telling the truth.  How can a judge reject the only evidence available to him or her in the Circuit Court if two people collude to say that they have been living apart for four years in the same house?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the divorce legislation so I want to refer her to some concerns that the Bar Council has in relation to that, arising out of a seminar they held last weekend.</P>

      <P>I quote from the Minister:</P>
      <P>Last summer I brought forward the Courts Bill, 1996, to increase the maximum statutory limit on the number of judges in the Circuit Court by a further three to 28 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>I invited the Minister to do the same thing last summer but she did not do it.  The Minister, in her speech, went on to say that the 1996 Courts Act provided for an additional ten Circuit Court judges and so on.  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
      <P>Developments in the family law area and changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts in 1991 had a major impact on the volume and complexity of business coming before the courts system as a whole but this affected the Circuit Court in particular.</P>
      <P>I am sure I do not need to remind the Minister of her own speech, she goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The implementation of divorce legislation is likely to impact further on the volume of business, particularly in the Circuit Court.  It is not yet possible to assess its long-term requirements for judicial and staffing resources but in the short term it is expected that there will be a considerable number of applications to the courts.</P>
      <P>If what I have quoted from the Minister's speech is her idea of a passing reference, we have a different understanding of the use of the English language.  In that context I want to make the point that it is now accepted by those who are most competent in the legal area that the provision which I queried at length in the course of that Bill, namely, the provision that people are allowed to live apart in the same house and qualify&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am perfectly clear about what I said.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, insisted that there could be no collusion in this matter.  The judge would know.  The only evidence presented to the court may come from the two parties who are at odds with each other and who want to attain a divorce. If both of them say &mdash; which may not be in accordance with the facts &mdash; they have been living apart in the same house for four years, I specifically invited the Minister to tell me how any judge could have any basis in evidence or in law for reaching any judgment other than that the people were living apart for four years.  I will come to the significance of this argument in relation to what the Minister said here today.</P>
      <P>It is now the considered view of all the professionals operating in this area that this scenario will give rise to a flood of cases in the Circuit Court.  This will give rise to a huge increase in the Circuit Court jurisdiction because there is no means known to the legal profession, of which the Cathaoirleach himself is a distinguished practitioner, through which people can be prevented from coming in and defeating the purpose of the Minister's Bill even though they may be giving evidence within the terms of that Bill.

      <P>It would result in a huge increase in the volume of applications in the Circuit Court or perhaps in the High Court, if that is the appropriate jurisdiction.  It will be possible, and indeed probable, that people can defeat the Minister for Equality and Law Reform's intention while working within the basis of his Bill by colluding together.  I specifically queried that in this House.  Now I find the professional associations &mdash; particularly the Bar Council, who have had an entire seminar on this issue &mdash; expressing grave concern with that same provision and pointing out that there will be a volume increase in what was perceived to be the likely number of Circuit Court applications.  This Government is once again acting inconsistently because no provision is made here for the increase in the number of Circuit Court applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do.  For the record, I am saying that the experience will show that, because of the lack of co-ordination between Government Ministers, that there will be a huge, unprecedented and apparently unexpected volume of increase in divorce applications because the law which was brought through this House, which I <Col N="680" /> resisted, will allow for collusion between parties who would not qualify according to the terms introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>In this Minister's and her predecessor's terms of office, I have resisted the nonsense of an interview board and a consultation procedure which was intended to give the impression that the Government of the day was suddenly going to abide by different standards and ensure that judges would not have any taint of political association.</P>

      <P>I do not have to be careful at all.  My views on this are very clear.  In representing the interests of people in Tipperary and elsewhere I will resist any association in Government with the Labour Party until I have drawn my last breath.  I do not think I could make it any clearer than that.  I like people to be consistent and I will be consistent on that point.  I do not want a presentation of virtue.  I was part of a Government for a long time who appointed some very fine judges, many of whom were staunch members of the Minister's Party.  If she wishes me to name them I will.  If she has any doubts about this I can inform her that that was the position.</P>

      <P>That is good.  There is a considerable list of these staunch supporters at the highest level of the Minister's party.  However, I prefer not to get personal about this.  We did this consistently.  Now we find that this new interview board has been introduced because the Left have demanded it.  Not surprisingly, we find that we have two appointees to the Circuit Court who practised together and were active supporters of Democratic Left.  I know that is coincidental.</P>

      <P>Of course they did.  They were certainly the most eminently qualified; and it is entirely coincidental that almost all of the judges &mdash; I can think of only one exception &mdash; that have been appointed since this very open, honourable, accountable and transparent and honest system <Col N="681" /> was introduced were unashamed supporters and backers of the membership of the current Government.  I know of many such judges at Circuit and High Court level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years we have never had any problems or suggestions of lack of standing of judges.  It is wrong to give the impression that those appointed to the superior courts over the years were other then the most suitably qualified people.  If I have any power in Government I will ensure a continuance of that.  I believe in honesty above everything else.</P>
      <P>The Minister may increase the number of High Court judges by one through this legislation and later on by two or three.  However, the low courts operate in isolation.  A court can only function as part of the overall administration of justice, particularly in the area of criminal law.  The law is brought into disrepute even more so than at present when the backup for the court decision is not provided.  I am particularly referring to prison places.  The law is being brought into further disrepute with each extra judge appointed without the provision of adequate prison accommodation.  The judge will impose a sentence that cannot be put into effect or can only be put into effect by releasing a convicted criminal.  Appointing one extra judge is very bad business if we are going to increase the numbers of people sentenced, particularly in the criminal courts, without having places for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is happy that sometime in 1998 the prison in Castlerea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister had been allowed to do what she wished to do two or three years ago in relation to prison places, bail reform and related matters, we would have a more workable criminal penal system.  However, because she was not allowed do that, appointing an extra judge without the necessary prison accommodation will bring the law into further disrepute.  I greatly regret that.</P>

      <P>I would be sorry if the Minister had missed part of the fan club.  I am extremely glad <Col N="682" /> that she had tackled the difficulties in the courts' system in the way she has.  The decision to appoint additional judges is very important.  The delays in the judicial system were intolerable and very hard on those who had to come before it for trial and on victims, particularly in criminal cases. It was also difficult in civil cases where urgent business problems had to be brought before a court.  The delays in the family law area also caused the most appalling problems for people.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the Minister has embarked on the courts building programme.  In particular, I am glad of the imaginative steps being taken, such as establishing courts in Tallaght.  Why should the major centres within the metropolitan area not have courts, thus forcing everybody to go to the back of the Four Courts?  They should have the same rights as people in small towns which have their own courts.  The additional staff will take longer to recruit and I understand that this is causing problems because, naturally, there is much expertise needed among the staff.  It is not just the judges who run the courts &mdash; they rely heavily on other staff.</P>
      <P>Last night the House debated delay within the courts.  In the presence of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform I expressed the hope that with so few delays in the Circuit Court, cases of sexual harassment can be heard there as well as in the Labour Court when the new legislation is passed &mdash; and I say &ldquo;when&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;if&rdquo; as I have confidence that the Government will ensure enactment of the legislation.  I hope that, while the Labour Court has longer delays, people stick with it because it has great expertise in this area.  It would cause difficulties if Circuit Court judges down the country were obliged to learn the intricacies of sexual harassment cases in addition to the other cases they deal with.  Also, the confidentiality of the Labour Court is not to be under-estimated.</P>
      <P>Fewer delays have greatly helped the problems with bail.  I was not enthusiastic about the expansion of the terms under which bail could be refused.  While not wishing to be critical of the Judiciary, there seemed to be a number of people on bail who were in a position to interfere with evidence, if not with witnesses.  The delays in bringing people to trial was a major problem.  The additional sittings have transformed the length of time people have to wait and I welcome that.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the need of High Court judges for tribunals &mdash; and I am delighted to say that Ms Justice Carroll and Mr. Justice McCracken are friends of mine.  I hope we do not reach the situation where High Court judges are over committed to an increasing number of tribunals. We should keep retired judges in mind. Having attended the hepatitis C tribunal virtually everyday, I can say Mr. Justice Finlay did a magnificent job should a reference ever be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not tackled discrimination against District Court judges on what was referred to as the &ldquo;age ground&rdquo; during last night's discussion of the employment equality legislation.  The Minister <Col N="683" /> is aware that I have raised this issue on several occasions.  District Court judges have to be recertified every year after the age of 65 until they are 70 in order to ensure that they are in a fit state to carry out their duties.  However, those in the Supreme Court, High Court and Circuit Court do not need to be recertified.  I dislike this discrimination, considering the damage they could in the context of the important cases they try.</P>
    <P>In last night's debate Senator Lee tabled an amendment increasing the age in the employment equality legislation from 65 to 70.  The amendment was not accepted by the Minister on the grounds that it would interfere with pensions. However, all judges should be treated equally.  I know the age for their retirement will be gradually reduced, but this may take a long time.  I hope the Minister looks at the position of District Court judges, who do an enormous amount of the coal face work in family law, criminal cases and lesser civil cases.  They are an extraordinarily important part of the Judiciary.  It is a slight that they have to be recertified every year while those at other levels of the Judiciary do not.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  The improvements in the standard and speed of service in the courts must be welcomed.  I prefer money being spent on the courts and the probation service and on improving the spaces in prisons rather than increasing them.  That makes the judicial system much more acceptable not only to those accused of crime but also the victims of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate for welcoming this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill and I am surprised at Senator O'Kennedy's contribution as he is involved in the law.  He is a Senator but he also has another job as a barrister.  Judges are senior members of society and to say that any legislation dealing with the appointment or widening of the panel of judges of this State is not a matter of importance diminishes the importance of judges in a democracy.  If I was given five minutes, I could tell Senator O'Kennedy that the Statute Book is full of legislation which contains only one or two sections; it is not always the number of sections that make a Bill important but the purpose of that Bill.  I found a number of his arguments confused, inconsistent and frankly not well researched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said this was only a Bill to allow one extra High Court judge.  That is not the case.  It is a Bill to expand the panel of the High Court by an additional three judges.  In 1995 when I introduced the Court and Court Officers Bill I assessed the situation with the co-operation of the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice. It was decided that the appropriate number by which to extend the High Court at that time would be three judges and three extra judges <Col N="684" /> were appointed to the High Court.  In the fullness of time, and not so much due to the appointment of Mr. Justice Brian McCracken but to the recent appointment of Ms Justice Mella Carroll to chair a nurses commission which is not due to report for at least a year or longer if other issues arise, I decided with the agreement of the Government that I could not leave the High Court short one judge of Ms Justice Mella Carroll's eminence for that length of time.  The departure of Mr. Justice Brian McCracken to a tribunal is also very important but that will probably be of a more limited duration and perhaps the court could have survived without him.  I have deliberately provided that we can add more High Court judges if the Government decided that, for example, Mr. Justice Brian McCracken will be away from his duties in the High Court for longer than we anticipate at present and the Government of the day must decide whether it will avail of the capacity to appoint an additional judge.</P>
    <P>It is a practical and reasonable Bill and I make no apologies for introducing it as speedily as I did to ensure the kind of delays I inherited in the courts would not be allowed to build up again.  I could have ignored the fact that the President of the High Court is short two judges at present. Had I done so, the President of the High Court would have been stuck with a limited number of judges.  In other words, the benefits of three new judges which the Government gave the President of the High Court one and a half years ago has been reduced by two and, therefore, the delays would no doubt gradually build up again.  Instead, I have moved speedily and practically to fill the gap so that the judges of the High Court will be able to continue their excellent work to reduce the delays in the court.</P>
    <P>As Senator Mulcahy rightly said, the reduction in delays from 35 to 20 months is something for which to be thankful but it needs to be reduced even further.  That mainly relates to personal injury cases but, as Senator Neville alluded, there are times when people talk anecdotally about the length of delays in court case.  They often send me details of cases to see if I can do anything about them but I cannot get in touch with a judge and ask him or her to take this or that case more quickly.  From the evidence I have been given, the delays are often not in the courts but between the two protagonists who cannot reach an agreement to let the case be heard.  It is often not until they get the date of the court hearing that they actually come to some agreement. There can be long delays which can be explained not by the lack of a court and a judge but of agreement between the people taking the case and over-burdened solicitors or barristers who cannot proceed.</P>
    <P>It would be facile and silly of us to think that the only way in which we can reduce the length of time cases take to come to court is by providing extra judges.  It also requires a smartening up of the way cases are prepared before they come to court.  Solicitors and barristers told me over the <Col N="685" /> past two years that they are being told they must have their work done to bring cases to court and that they cannot leave certain cases to one side because they cannot assume there will be delays of two years.  They must smarten up now because they know they will receive a hearing much sooner and that is good for the barristers, the solicitors and, most importantly, the clients who may be waiting to have business matters settled as there is much expense attached to court actions. It is good for the victims of crime also because they will see the cases coming to fruition and sentences handed down to the convicted.</P>
    <P>Although Senator Mulcahy mentioned it, the only comment I can make about what a judge might say in court is that it is for the Oireachtás to pass the laws which decide what sentences can be handed down for particular crimes and it is for the judges to implement decisions in court based on the law.  It is for the Government of the day to decide how sentences will be managed once they are handed down by the courts and how many prison places will be provided, and this Government has taken that matter very seriously. I will say no more other than that this is the difference between my responsibilities and those of the judges.  What they say about prison places is their business but it is also their business to implement the law.</P>
    <P>I cannot give Senator Mulcahy an assurance on what will happen in regard to the sentences which a new judge will hand down.  All I know is that, as of now, people who are convicted and given sentences go to prison.  I cannot give a guarantee they will stay in prison for the full length of their sentence mainly because, since 1960, periods of temporary or early release can be given to prisoners and, due to the lack of a structured building programme in the prison system over the past five to six years, a lack of resourcing for the non-custodial sentences which can be handled down by judges and the lack of resources in the probation and welfare services which must monitor people on non-custodial sentences, there has been an increase in the number of people not completing their sentences mainly to let the next batch take their place.  I will continue to have to do that until the full prison building programme is implemented.  In the meantime, I have had to take steps which are not, as Senator Neville said, universally acceptable to ensure I make the best use of the prison places available to enable as many people as possible to serve out their sentences. I will not apologise for that.  As far as possible I am obliged to keep people in prison for the length of their sentences to protect the greater good so that prisoners are not free to commit more offences and harm more people.</P>
    <P>The decision to postpone Castlerea Prison was extremely advantageous for this Government because it allowed me time to examine again the plans which Fianna Fáil had supposedly put in place for its construction.  Of course I found that nothing had been done, other than one line in a phony budget and an announcement in the proper <Col N="686" /> place, in County Roscommon, because it suited at the time.</P>
    <P>Nothing else was done to provide the prison places.  The Cabinet decision to postpone the project allowed me to examine how the prison in Castlerea might be provided and I have now opened the prison.  There are already 25 places occupied and the building works are underway. The prison will be fully open before the end of 1997.  If I had continued the project as Fianna Fáil had left it, the former patients would still be in the building, none of the building works would have been done and there would not have been a single prisoner in the prison.  Had I continued with the Fianna Fáil plan, the 1998 date would not be attainable.</P>
    <P>I hope this is the last time I will have to explain this matter to this House.  It is embarrassing for Fianna Fáil Senators to continue to raise the matter. I invite Senator O'Kennedy and Senator Mulcahy to walk around the Castlerea campus so they can see the prisoners and the builders on site.  I will be going to visit Castlerea shortly and perhaps I will invite them personally.  They might wish to be photographed beside the buildings. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is well acquainted with the area and hence he never says the prison is not open.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan and Senator Henry raised the issue of the family courts.  The Law Reform Commission's concept of having a separate structure of family courts is being examined in the context of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham's working group. Each new major court building project includes a full and separate family courts suite.  There is one in Galway and there will be one in Tallaght and Carrick-on-Shannon, which I will open shortly. The suites include a family court and family rooms so that the two sides in a family dispute can be accommodated separately.  It is not easy for the mother and her children to be in the same room with her husband in such cases.</P>
    <P>Although it may take a couple of years, I hope that in the fullness of time we will have strategically placed family law suites in our major court towns so that the cases can be held there.  Some may complain that people will have to travel some distance to have their cases heard in a family court suite.  However, sometimes people prefer not to have their cases heard in their local town where they may be seen by their neighbours.  I would envisage that in a couple of year's time we will have a more structured family law network of courts.</P>
    <P>It was also suggested that judges should be specially nominated.  The Government takes that into account when selecting people for appointments. We are examining the areas of competence that will be needed to ensure we will have a good balance of experience.  Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness was assigned for some time as a family law judge in the Dublin area and when she was appointed to the High Court another judge has been similarly assigned in the Circuit Court.  The presidents of the courts understand <Col N="687" /> that the courts' requirements must be matched with the experience of the judges available. This is having an effect in reducing the delays in family courts, particularly in the Dublin area, where the delays had become untenable.</P>
    <P>The issue of mediation with regard to family law and divorce is a matter for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and I am sure Senators have raised the issue with him.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville referred to the state of court buildings.  There are some very bad court buildings. Until 1990 the responsibility for court buildings lay with the local authorities.  I was a member of a county council for a long time and I am aware that the county councils never had the resources to keep the court buildings in good condition. In 1990 the situation was so bad that an arrangement was reached between the Department of Justice and the local authorities whereby the Department would provide the finance and the county councils would retain responsibility for the management and caretaker functions of the buildings.  There is an improvement now in the standard of court accommodation because the responsibility of the county councils to find funds from their budgets has been transferred to the Department.  It will take time to improve all the court buildings because of the large volume of work to be done, but £7.5 million has been made available this year for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether judges will have to become more available to chair tribunals and commissions.  When such investigations are set up there is a demand for an independent chair who does not have an axe to grind and everybody looks to judges or retired judges.  The pool of retired judges is fairly limited because to date Supreme Court judges retired at 72 years of age and as they get on in age they may not wish to take on a further burden in their retirement. However, we have used retired judges for such investigations; Mr. Justice Finlay, for example, has done excellent work since his retirement.</P>
    <P>It will arise no doubt that a High Court judge will be the desired person to chair such a commission and we need to have capacity on the High Court bench if we need to make them available for the nursing commission, for example.  Senator O'Kennedy expected me to have been able to look forward from 1995 to 1997 and know that a judge would be required for a commission on nursing and that I should have made an extra place available in 1995.  We made three places available and it was decided to fill them immediately. We have now decided that when this legislation is enacted a further judge will be appointed.  However, we will continue to review the situation and if one judge does not prove enough or if Mr. Justice McCracken has to chair the tribunal for a lengthy period, I will have to inform the Government that the President of the High Court requires the vacancy to be filled.</P>
    <P>The Government has moved to act quickly so that blockages in the system do not build up <Col N="688" /> again.  We will be able to put a judge in place quickly and extra judges will be available if the need arises.  I thank Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <P>I am pleased An Cathaoirleach has given me the opportunity to raise this matter on behalf of the board of management, parents, pupils and teachers of Lanesboro community college. The conditions in this school are so bad that they have to be seen to be believed.  I have photographs which give some idea of the condition of the existing buildings at this school.  I know it would not be in order for me to display these while I am speaking but I will give them to the Minister at the conclusion of the debate and I am sure she will be as appalled as I was to see the conditions in which teachers have to teach and students are being educated in Lanesboro.  Appalling and deplorable are the only words I can use to describe them.</P>
      <P>All the prefabricated buildings are falling apart and have been condemned by the health and safety officer and the fire officer.  They are both a health and a physical hazard.  The grounds are subject to flooding on a regular basis and when it rains access to the prefabs is through a large pool of water.  Resurfacing was deferred pending work on the extension.  The old sewerage system has been condemned by the environmental health officer and the local county council.  The disposal scheme for the new extension would alleviate this problem.  Staff conditions are deplorable &mdash; there are no staff toilets and the staffroom is a 30 year old prefabricated cloakroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After four years of negotiations the Minister for Education sanctioned, on 6 April 1995, the building of an extension to Lanesboro community college.  At a meeting between the Department's planning and building section, County Longford vocational education committee design team, the principal and the chief executive officer, the schedule of accommodation was discussed and some alterations agreed.  I understand that the head of planning in the Department said money for preliminary work was allocated in the 1995 budget and he could foresee no hold-up as far as the Department was concerned.  It was understood that as soon as the vocational education committee design team had produced the plans <Col N="689" /> and these, together with bills of quantity and tender documents, were submitted and approved by the Department technical staff, the project would be advertised for tender.  When asked for a timescale for the project, he said the Department would like to see the building occupied by September 1996 but acknowledged that might be rather ambitious.  However, he said it should definitely be completed in the 1996-97 school year.</P>
    <P>The design team completed their work on the initial plans and some months elapsed while these were being checked in the Department.  Some alterations were required and agreed.  The final submission of plans, bills of quantity and tender documents was made on Monday, 18 November 1996.  These were finally approved by the Department on 5 February 1997 when the building unit stated it would issue permission to the vocational education committee to advertise the project. Later that day the vocational education committee was informed that permission would have to be withheld pending the capital allocation from the Minister's office.  When the list of schools for the 1997 capital expenditure programme was published the next day, Lanesboro was not included.</P>
    <P>The building unit has since confirmed that all is ready to go to tender and it is now purely a matter of finance being made available.  It is imperative for the survival of the school that this project is advertised for tender immediately, otherwise new students will not enrol.  Unless work commences early this summer and the new building is ready for occupation by September 1998, the school is doomed to closure as students could no longer be expected to enrol.  Promises made to parents over the past two years have not been kept.  The board of management, parents, ASTI, the TUI and the people of the locality are angered and frustrated. They have been tolerant over the last two years and want action to resolve this issue.  I call on the Minister to provide immediate sanction to the board of management to advertise the proposed extension for tender so that work on the project can commence in early summer and I look forward to a positive response.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Education I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the matter raised by the Senator regarding Lanesboro community college, County Longford.  For the information of the House, I will give brief details on the background to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension to be provided includes the provision of one general classroom, one science laboratory and preparation area, one home economics room and flatlet, a staff room, a general purposes and dining area, an administration area, and ancillary accommodation including cloakrooms and toilets.  The architectural planning of the extension is now complete and the contract <Col N="690" /> documents are currently being examined by the Department of Education's technical staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is aware of the need for this additional accommodation at Lanesboro community college and it is the intention of the Department to ensure that it is proceeded with as quickly as possible.  She appreciates that Longford vocational education committee is anxious to advertise for tenders in respect of the project.  However, because of the substantial number of building projects on hand at present and the limited capital available, it was not possible to include the work in the 1997 capital programme which was published at the commencement of the year.  The programme will be reviewed regularly and it may become possible to consider Lanesboro for later inclusion if other projects do not make progress during construction as rapidly as had been anticipated.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Senator said, I am sure the Minister will stand by this commitment.  A project which has been announced often does not make as much progress as was hoped and in that event I will inform the Minister of the Senator's wish that Lanesboro be put in its place.  As soon as it becomes possible to proceed further with the project, the Department will be in contact with County Longford vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>This is the second time I have raised the issue of Ranelagh multi-denominational school on the Adjournment.  It was previously a Church of Ireland school which was in danger of closing but parents came together to form a multi-denominational school which is now flourishing and has a long waiting list.  However, it needs new premises.  The initial planning application granted by Dublin Corporation was rejected by An Bord Pleanála.  It was not a great design because the school has a wonderful site on Ranelagh Road.  The second application to Dublin Corporation was upheld by An Bord Pleanála last October.  The Department of Education has allowed the school board to proceed to the next stage of an application for a fire certificate and the preparation of pre-tender documents.</P>
      <P>The next critical stage is for the school board is to receive permission to proceed to tender, which it hopes to do in early April with a view to the Department finalising the decision in May and giving the school board the go-ahead to commence building at the end of the school year in June.  As the Minister is aware, this timetable is quite tight and there is no room for slippage.  The school board, therefore, requests the Department of Education to process their application as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> While the new school has been approved for funding, it must be committed in 1997.  Any delay will seriously jeopardise the timing of the project, particularly if the school board was not in a position to commence work when the school term finishes in June.  As soon as work commences on the school building, pupils will have to vacate it and temporary accommodation has been promised to the school at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook. The school's board of management is also anxious to finalise its position with the Royal Hospital as it has only been allowed a certain length of time on those premises.  In view of these issues, I would appreciate if the Department of Education gave this application its most favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outlines the Department of Education's current position regarding Ranelagh multi-denominational school, Ranelagh Road, Dublin 6.  The Minister for Education is aware that the school has a current staffing of a principal, eight assistants, a shared remedial teacher and an enrolment of 252 pupils on 30th September 1996.</P>
      <P>The existing building, which was formerly Saint Columba's Church of Ireland School, is in extremely poor condition and contains six classrooms.  There are also two very old prefabs in poor condition.  The classrooms are undersized by present standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> The Minister knows that this school is in urgent need of new permanent accommodation and for this reason she included the school in the capital programme announced in 1994.  The plans provide for a new two storey eight classroom school with appropriate ancillary accommodation on the same site of the existing school.  Planning permission for this project was received in October 1996.  The existing building will be demolished to allow for the construction of the new school and it is proposed that temporary accommodation will be secured for the school for the duration of the contract.</P>
    <P>The current position with regard to the project at Ranelagh multi-denominational school is that the Department has authorised the school manager to direct its consulting architect to proceed and prepare tender/contract documentation for the project.  When this documentation is complete, a decision will be taken on the timing of the tender and contract process.  The House will appreciate that a decision on the timing of the tender and contract process must be taken in the light of existing contractual commitments and the funds available this year.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that every effort is being made by the Department to ensure that the project is progressed at the earliest opportunity.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter again and I will pass on what he has said to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 March 1997.</P>
