    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express our sincere sympathy on the deaths of Mr. Flor Crowley, Dr. Noel Browne and Mr. Lionel Booth.  Mr. Crowley and Dr. Browne were Members of the Seanad while Mr. Booth was a former distinguished Deputy for Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>Mr. Flor Crowley began his active career in national politics in 1965 when he was first elected as a Fianna Fáil Deputy for the mid-Cork constituency. He served that constituency well for his remaining years.  He had a distinguished career during which he served in both the Upper and Lower Houses.  He was an active Member of the Oireachtas, particularly as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sad passing of Flor Crowley will leave many memories with those of us who knew him for many years.  Flor, as we knew him, was a man who was larger than life.  He was a great family man who always had a warm smile and kind word.  He was always willing to lend a helping <Col N="1114" /> hand.  He was a man of the people in every sense of the word.  He was a great republican who came from a very strong Fianna Fáil tradition.  Nothing in his life gave him greater joy or delight than seeing his son Brian become a Member of this House and then to go on to become a distinguished MEP.  I knew him personally and got many pieces of good advice from him over the years.  I convey the sympathy of this House to his wife, his son Brian and the rest of his family on their sad loss at such a young age.</P>
    <P>I also propose a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Dr. Noel Browne.  He will be remembered as a great man for many reasons, and first, for his courage in pursuing his beliefs.  He was relentless in taking on great causes and was most impressive in arguing his case with all who dared to disagree with him.  He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1948 as a Clann na Poblachta Deputy and was immediately appointed Minister for Health.  He quickly instigated a campaign to eradicate tuberculosis, a disease that affected thousands of Irish families and that had already devastated his own family, claiming the lives of his father, mother and aunt.  Noel himself also suffered from that disease.</P>
    <P>Throughout his work on the eradication of tuberculosis and the mother and child scheme, Noel Browne always put the health and welfare of people at the top of the Government agenda. As Minister for Health he planned vigorously and set up a hospital building programme and ensured that the scourge of tuberculosis was eventually banished from our country.  However, he should not be remembered only for the many practical arrangements he put in place.  He should also be remembered for the challenging vision he possessed of an Ireland of the future which would bring about many innovations in health and social welfare services.  These are services we now take too much for granted.  Noel Browne lived in Athlone, where his father died, and he was a student at the Marist College there.</P>
    <P>I propose a vote of sympathy for the sad passing of a legend of his time, a man who was a Member of both Houses.  He was a Senator from 1973 to 1977.</P>
    <P>I also sympathise with the Booth family on the sad passing of Lionel Booth, who represented the Cathaoirleach's constituency of Dún Laoghaire in Dáil Éireann for 12 years.  An astute businessman, he was a pioneer in the business world.  I sympathise with his family on his sad passing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I join with the Leader in expressing sympathy with the families concerned.  Dr. Noel Browne has been written and spoken about at great length. He was a man of rare passion and lonely integrity who was always prepared to fight for the unpopular cause.  He suffered a great deal in his political career, yet he has left some outstanding monuments behind him, first, in the crusade he led against the scourge of tuberculosis, but more <Col N="1115" /> importantly in the example of moral integrity and willingness to stand up and be counted.  That inspired many people to go into politics at a time when idealism was very scarce.  I extend my party's sympathy to his wife and family.</P>
      <P>Flor Crowley was a friend of mine, as he was of many people in this House.  As the Leader said, he was a man of great humour, wit and goodness. I disagreed with his political views very strongly but that never prevented us having a genuine friendship.  He was a man I liked enormously and had great human attributes.  He was proud his son Brian spent some time in this House and is now a distinguished Member of the European Parliament. On behalf of my party, I too would like to extend my sympathy to the Crowley family, as I do to the family of the late Lionel Booth.</P>

      <P>With reference to your previous comment, I would like to pay tribute to Dr. Noel Browne while my colleague, Senator Ross, will pay tribute to the other two deceased Members with whom he was more familiar than I.  I knew Noel Browne for 30 years.  I have no doubt most people feel Noel Browne was the conscience of this country.  When I learned of his death, I thought immediately of words used by Richard Ellmann about James Joyce at the beginning of his great biography of the Irish writer when he said we are still learning to be Joyee's contemporaries. In a way we are still learning to be Noel Browne's contemporaries.  He made headlines and was well ahead of the majority of people in political life because he had a vision.  One thing which is lacking in Irish political life today is that quality of vision which Noel so clearly enshrined in himself.  He had passion which sometimes led him to make enemies but he was a forgiving and gentle man as well as a gentlemen.</P>
      <P>I was one of a small number of public representatives who attended his funeral in Connemara among the people he loved so much.  I waited for that horrible moment at funerals when one hears the thump of a clod of earth on the lid of the coffin but it never came, and I wondered why.  I looked around to see that he was being buried in a small graveyard in the wilds of Connemara and instead of clay sand was used which gently silted over the coffin.  Noel had what he deserved, a gentle death in the company of his family, particularly his beloved wife Phyllis to whom I extend my sympathy as well as to the rest of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cassidy, the Leader of the House, and Senator Manning spoke movingly about Noel's career and, in particular, his wonderful onslaught on the tuberculosis epidemic.  There were others involved who should get credit, but there is no doubt Noel Browne cut through the red tape and mobilised the resources of the State to build sanatoria and hospitals and to save lives.  Although I <Col N="1116" /> was only a peripheral member of Noel Browne's circle, my telephone rang constantly in the days after his death.  People told me their stories and asked me for the address of Noel Browne's wife or to pass on to the family their gratitude for the fact that he saved their lives.</P>
    <P>One of the most moving things in Noel's book, and which I heard him subsequently relate on television, was the fact that his mother saved the remnants of that family, although she was in the last throes of tuberculosis, by uprooting herself and taking the remaining members of the family to England where they knew they would looked after.  There may have been many other anonymous mothers in that terrible period who fled Ireland to places like England to save the lives of their children.  On this day of commemoration Noel, in particular, would like his mother, who was a figure of such extraordinary heroism and who died a few days after she brought her remaining children to safety in England, to be remembered.</P>
    <P>Noel would also like his brother to be remembered. Noel was taken up by a distinguished medical family, the Chances, who gave him a good education and his life was full of these wonderful lucky coincidences.  He had a brother who had a hunchback and was deformed &mdash; what they called a cripple in those days.  While Noel was taken up and educated, his brother was sent to an orphanage where experimental operations were performed on him and he died under the surgeon's knife.  To the end of his days Noel was moved by the fate of his brother and he used to say that he, Noel Browne, was an intelligent, attractive, fit and able young man so he was capable of being the same.</P>
    <P>Noel felt passionately for those who were disadvantaged, who had no opportunity and who were disposed of to orphanages and such places.</P>
    <P>I doubt if he would appreciate my saying that I was touched and gladdened that the Archbishop of Dublin paid a gracious tribute to him the day after his death.  That movement to reconciliation was welcomed by his friends, especially as Noel delighted in controversy.  I agreed with many of the issues he raised, especially those concerning Vatican social policy, and he unfailingly challenged the idiocies which occasionally emanate from such sources.  On a human level, he would be glad, as I am, by this gracious tribute from a former opponent.</P>
    <P>I am honoured to have been allowed speak in memory of Noel Browne.  One matter which is very important to me is that he nominated me from the first time I ran for the Seanad as a no-hoper with the illusion I would top the poll.  I received 167 votes from the Trinity electorate then with which I was very disappointed, but they have learned to behave better.  On this last occasion, I had to go to Tibet and, afraid the Chinese might find out what I was up to, thus delaying my return a little, I sent the nominating papers to Noel asking him to return them.  He signed them and I received them the day before he died. <Col N="1117" /> It was with great sadness I had to remove his name as I would have liked it to have been on the papers one last time.</P>
    <P>I salute him.  All people in this House have been improved by the company of Noel Browne. I hope we manage to produce a few more like him because this country certainly needs them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I pay tribute to the late Dr. Noel Browne for his strong contribution to Irish politics.  He was a true radical in the best sense of the word.  He had great clarity of thought and great passion for what he believed in.  He systematically achieved that which he felt was necessary to change Irish society for the better, for example, his work on the tuberculosis epidemic and the systematic way in which he organised the system to eradicate the disease.  Many families owe much to Dr. Noel Browne for the singlemindedness with which he carried out that work.  On looking back on the mother and child scheme, it seems extraordinary it was so controversial because it was a basic, simple and straightforward scheme for mothers and children which is now accepted without demur but at the time, he had to fight a battle for it and he did so singlemindedly.</P>
      <P>I remember his giving a talk in Limerick on psychology in Ireland.  He gave a long, passionate speech on how psychiatry in Ireland should be changed to treat people with respect.  I was young at the time and was very impressed that someone could feel so strongly about and speak so eloquently on an issue about which he knew so much.  That epitomised what Dr. Noel Browne was about &mdash; changing society in areas where he felt strongly it needed change.  In that, he did a great service to Irish society and will not be forgotten for it.  Neither will he be forgotten for the passion, energy, drive and singlemindedness with which he pursued the issues about which he felt strongly.  I convey our sympathy to his wife, Phyllis, and to the rest of his family.</P>
      <P>I also convey our sympathy to the families of the late Flor Crowley and Lionel Booth.  I did not know either of them personally, but I knew Brian Crowley when he was a Member of this House and I convey our sympathy to him and to the rest of his family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join in the vote of sympathy to the families of the late Senators Flor Crowley and Noel Browne and the late Deputy Lionel Booth. Flor Crowley was very much a man of the people and a true patriot who served his country well and left a distinguished political lineage behind him.  We had the good fortune of serving in this House with his son, Brian who has gone to the European Parliament where he carries on the family tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My knowledge of Noel Browne arises, particularly, from his autobiography <i>Against the Tide.</i> It is one of the most compelling pieces of political reading one could find.  Having read the book <Col N="1118" /> Noel Browne's determination and tenacity would not be in question but what was surprising was that he was not as bitter as he should have been when one considers his family circumstances and the devastation which tuberculosis wreaked on his family.  He fought against TB with great tenacity. It is part of political mythology that the Government fell as a result of the mother and child scheme but that is not the case and Senator Manning is one of those who corrected that myth in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Noel Browne was a man of immense courage and was greatly admired.  I had the good fortune to know Neville Chance quite well.  He told me some of the stories about the role the Chance family played in Noel Browne's early days and his education in England and Trinity College.  Had it not been for that, Noel Browne would not have gone on to do many of the things he did.  He was a man of immense courage, who had a tremendous determination and could be greatly admired.  For that we mourn his passing, along with those of Flor Crowley and Lionel Booth.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I join with the Leader and others in paying tribute to and sympathising with the family of Flor Crowley, whom I knew on Cork County Council in 1974.  I always remember him as being very precise in his pronouncements.  He was very dignified as he went about his business and his untimely death was a great shock.</P>
      <P>I also sympathise with the widow of the late Dr. Noel Browne.  People in Cork city remember that St. Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire, was built under the leadership of Noel Browne in his efforts to eradicate tuberculosis.  Between June 1981 and February 1982, Dr. Noel Browne and I were Members of the other House and with others we formed a group and got recognition. After a meeting Noel said to me &ldquo;Joe, we get on very well but you smoke too much&rdquo;.  I remembered that advice given to me by the late Dr. Noel Browne.  I also wish to be associated with the sympathy to the family of the late Lionel Booth.</P>

      <P>I extend my condolences to the Crowley family in west Cork.  The Leader is right when he said that Flor stood alone for his party in west Cork for many years.  He would speak of himself and the region very strongly.  I had the privilege of serving with Flor and Brian, although I did not serve with father and son in the Seanad. His loss was untimely and came as a shock to many in west Cork, particularly his family.  On behalf of my party in the region I extend my deepest condolences to his wife and family.  I wish them well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> I knew Lionel Booth extremely well since I was a child.  He was as sincere as Dr. Browne but perhaps less dramatic in the views he put forward in the Dáil and in public life.  He was a very quiet decent man who was sincerely devoted to those causes which he took up.  He was a Deputy for many years.  When he retired from Dáil Éireann at 53 years of age he miraculously began to practise law again and took up a partnership with the well known Dublin firm of Matheson, Ormsby, Prentice.  He practised with them as a consultant until his death.  He continued to visit here and use the Oireachtas Library until his last illness.  He was a magnificent man but was not fully appreciated because he did not seek the limelight as other people do.</P>
    <P>I wish to also pay tribute to Flor Crowley. Some Members may remember him because he was last in this House in 1982.  I had many heated debates with him especially on Northern Ireland, an issue on which I and many others held differing views.  One of the great hallmarks of these debates was that he never took a difference of opinion outside the House and so became a firm friend to many of us.  We also shared an interest in Arcon resources, or Conroy as it was known then.  His interest was greater than mine but it gave us a mutual interest.  I was in contact with him just before he died.  I shall miss both men and I pay tribute to them today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in paying tribute to Flor Crowley.  I knew him very well because, like myself, he was a Corkman.  He was a Fianna Fáil man, not a party or national movement man.  He was a very affable man whom I liked a great deal.</P>
      <P>I worked many years with Dr. Browne.  Before I became a gamekeeper I was a very successful poacher as a member of the liaison group of the left of the Labour Party.  At that time it was a very small group and led by Dr. Browne.  While travelling from Cork to Dublin we plotted and planned.  Eventually we succeeded in electing Dr. Browne vice-chairman of the Labour Party.  We thought the new Jerusalem had arrived and celebrated for weeks after but within six months Dr. Browne resigned and went to Libya.  He was a terrific but frustrating man.  Like all visionaries Dr. Browne did not march to anybody else's drum.  I thought we had fought and won the biggest battle of our young lives and then Dr. Browne left, as we thought, to waste his time in the sands of Libya.  We became disillusioned but we had a <i>rapprochement</i> between us at the end.</P>
      <P>As people have said Dr. Browne was an extraordinary man.  He was an uncomfortable man for the Labour Party for a very long time.  I was at the administrative council that readmitted Dr. Browne as a member of the Labour Party in the latter years of his life.  I join with all the tributes paid to Dr. Browne, Senator Flor Crowley and Deputy Lionel Booth today.  Like everybody else we mourn their passing.</P>

      <P>It is a great honour and privilege to be appointed to this position and I hope to honour the trust of Members and the Taoiseach who appointed me.  I congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your work during your term of office.  You took office in very unusual circumstances, bearing in mind the untimely deaths of the first Cathaoirleach of this Seanad, our great colleague, the late Seán Fallon, who was also a distinguished Leader of the House and Whip and served in the House for the too short time of 14 years, and your predecessor, Liam Naughten, who made a great contribution as a Member of both the Dáil and Seanad.  It is most unusual to have three Cathaoirligh in the lifetime of a Seanad and could never have been envisaged at the start.  The passing of the late Senator Gordon Wilson, who made a magnificent contribution, also left its mark.</P>
      <P>On the changeover of Government, it is only right for the House to congratulate and wish luck to the new Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, a young man who entered politics in 1977.  He served well and made his mark in the Department of Labour and as Minister for Finance.  He is now in his mid-forties and is one of the youngest Taoisigh ever.  On behalf of all the Members I wish him well and congratulate him on his magnificent win.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney, the first lady Tánaiste, has also made her mark on history.  I wish her well on behalf of the House.  I have known Deputy Harney since 1977, as have many Members, when she was nominated to the Seanad by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch.  I know she will uphold the office with great dignity and respect and will make her mark.</P>

    <P>It is right and fitting for the House to acknowledge the contribution of Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach.  He is my next door neighbour and we served in the same constituency for over 12 and a half years at one stage.

      <P>The Leader will recall the strong assurances given by both sides of the House that Item 2 on today's Order Paper, namely the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, would be reinstituted in the next Seanad.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Cassidy on his appointment as Leader of the House.  It is now payback time in terms of commitments. When the previous Government was formed, its first business in this House was legislation to increase the number of Ministers of State from 15 to 17.  During that debate, Independent Members took much criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party. We were assured by Deputy Bertie Ahern that the first action Fianna Fáil would take on coming into office would be to reverse that disgraceful legislation.  Was the House misled by former Senator O'Kennedy who gave that commitment on behalf of the leader and who was supported by Marian McGennis, then a Senator and now a Deputy in the Taoiseach's constituency?  I would like clarification from the Leader whether Senator O'Kennedy misled the House or whether Fianna Fáil has reversed its policy on the number of Ministers of State.  Perhaps he will illuminate the difficulties that arose at that time.  I recall the many difficulties outlined regarding the two new Ministers of State, one of whom is in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery and whom I thank for his work as junior Minister.  Who were the two new Ministers of State who would not have been appointed if Fianna Fáil had done as it promised <Col N="1123" /> and reduced the number of Ministers of State from 17 back to 15?  I look forward to the reply.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning mentioned the commitment he willingly gave on the last day we sat &mdash; also made by the then Fianna Fáil Leader in the Seanad, Senator Wright &mdash; that the Adoption Bill would be dealt with as a matter of priority.  This issue has caused immense heartbreak, particularly in South American adoptions.  I appeal to the Leader not to allow this to be delayed.  The House should indicate our care for those who are awaiting this Bill's passage into law in order to legalise their children's adoptions.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis C was the subject of another inquiry and wide-ranging report during the office of the previous Government.  With the parties making up the new Government, I was concerned about the late Brigid McCole's fifth question and how the last Government adopted that position.  We were given commitments that all the information surrounding the issue would be made available as soon as those parties went into power.  I applaud that commitment, remind the House of it and ask that the information be made available to us as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request that the House be recalled but I would take it further &mdash; we should be recalled to debate the outcome of the current tribunal in Dublin Castle.  It is not enough to call us back to set up a new tribunal, although I agree that is necessary.  We must also have a full debate on the recommendations, conclusions and content of the report of the present inquiry when it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I join other Senators in congratulating Senator Cassidy on being appointed Leader of the House.  I also congratulate our colleagues who were elected to Dáil Éireann and extend best wishes to those going on the Seanad campaign, although I will not be doing so.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the staff of the House on what will be my last day in the House, for the moment at least.</P>
      <P>With other Senators I ask that the Adoption Bill be resumed here quickly.  I also draw attention to the two Bills mentioned by you, a Chathaoirligh, the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill, which were introduced by the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, and dealt with issues which are important to sectors of our society not properly protected at present. The new Administration should reintroduce that legislation in a form which will ensure protection for vulnerable sectors of our society.  We should return to those issues in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House should also be recalled to debate the outcome of the Dunnes tribunal and the probable necessity of establishing another tribunal.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that the matter should be debated openly in both Houses and among the public.  Everyone is reeling from the revelations in Dublin Castle.  We will not go into them in detail today but it is important that there <Col N="1124" /> be not necessarily retribution but public accountability, so that we know exactly what happened and ensure that the culture surrounding those events will be gone forever.  This is important both to those who practise politics and to the public.  I was shopping in Dunnes Stores yesterday, surrounded by people who find it difficult to find enough money to buy groceries.  To hear of £1 million being casually handed over is shocking to them.  This must be openly debated and I support taking whatever action is necessary to recall these Houses.</P>

      <P>I support the view that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill should return to us and should be progressed as soon as possible to become law.  I also share the view expressed by Senator O'Sullivan about the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill, particularly on the rights of people with disabilities and the need to have those rights vindicated and protected in law.  The incoming Government should consider those issues very closely.</P>

I appreciate the co-operation which I received previously and continuity is vitally important in relation to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill and other issues.</P>
      <P>On several occasions I raised the Report of the Commission on People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities.  There is little evidence that any attention is being paid in this regard and I wish to keep this on the agenda.  Politics in the future will be interesting.  What has been happening in the Payments to Politicians tribunal is revealing. Every effort must be made to get to the very bottom of it.  That means having a new tribunal and I wholeheartedly support that call.  The public need to have this situation clarified.  We are entering a new era in politics and I hope I will be part of it as a Member of this House.</P>

      <P>I thank everybody and assure them I will be back.</P>

      <P>This is both my maiden and farewell speech as I am not a candidate in the Seanad elections.  Perhaps I am fortunate.  I join Senators in congratulating Senator Cassidy on his appointment as Leader of the House and in commending Senator Manning on his work as previous Leader. I have always been impressed by the calibre of contributions to Seanad debates which I have seen on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  I particularly commend the contributions of Senators representing the universities, or at least most of them.</P>

      <P>With regard to reform of the Seanad, I hope there will be room for representation of graduates of the technological and further education sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the request that the Seanad be reconvened to discuss the outcome of the Dunnes tribunal.  If it is reconvened I will be unable to participate in the debate as I will probably be standing in front of a class again.  Among the subjects I teach is CPSE &mdash; the civics, social and political education course, a new course at junior certificate level which is basically a citizenship course.  Through that course young people are encouraged to become aware of their rights and responsibilities to each other, their families, their communities and society.  I do not underestimate the damage caused by the controversy of the last couple of days with regard to the Dunnes tribunal. It is essential that the Houses of the Oireachtas are seen to take action because young people who are 12 to 14 years of age today will be potential first time voters if the next general election takes place in four or five years' time and unless they have faith in the democratic structures of society the implications for democracy <Col N="1127" /> are very serious.  I hope both Houses will reconvene to ensure whatever action that is necessary will be taken.</P>
    <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your tolerance and I wish everyone contesting the Seanad elections well during the campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the House could take as read my congratulations to everybody here, in Dublin, Ireland and throughout the universe, including whatever forms of life found on Mars.</P>
      <P>Having got the congratulations out of the way, I would like to raise an issue that might be looked at by the DPP, the question of access to this House.  It is absolutely outrageous that Members are not allowed access to the House from 9 p.m. on Friday until 9 a.m. on Monday.  The television people are allowed in, the cleaners and electricians are allowed in but for some pettifogging reason Members are not allowed in to their offices.  We have, in this House, somebody whose party is part of an armed conspiracy against the State so let us not use the excuse of security which is rubbish.  Members should be given the opportunity to work.  I hope the incoming Seanad will make that very clear to the appropriate personnel.</P>
      <P>I wish to propose a change to the Order of Business.  After discussion of item 1, which is very important, we should take item 26 which deals with the vaccination of children in orphanages and item 27 which deals with the situation in East Timor which is absolutely critical.  This House has shown an interest in this matter in the past and I would be grateful if we could rearrange business to discuss it today.</P>
      <P>I am in possession of information which makes this a very important issue.  The Indonesian authorities are illegally holding a man called David Alex whom they claim is dead, a statement not supported by eye witness account that he is still alive and being tortured by the Indonesian authorities. It is time we stood up and raised our voices against the criminal regime in Jakarta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Senator Manning and others who suggested the Seanad should be recalled to debate the outcome of the Dunnes tribunal.  I hope there will be no gloating in the fall from grace of Mr. Haughey.  It would be most inappropriate.  I would like to send my sympathy to his family, in particular to his dignified wife who has had to put up with a great deal from some of the most scurrilous members of the media.  She has borne herself with dignity and stoicism.  I wish her and her family well.  I think it is very important that these matters are brought into the open.  I also hope the Dunnes tribunal is followed by a real Dunnes inquiry.  I do not shop in Dunnes Stores, nor would I because I know how they treat their employees.  I remember how they harassed the women who upheld the conscience of this country by striking against the policy Dunnes Stores had of importing goods from South Africa.  I remember the squeals of pain from small suppliers when <Col N="1128" /> they were screwed to the walls with unfair contracts exclusive to Dunnes Stores.  Let us have a look at the ethics of the Dunnes and not just the politicians concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was.  Will the Leader graciously withdraw the nasty comments made about programme managers in the run-up to the last election? I would like to put on the record that the outgoing Government was right to have programme managers.  I had occasion to deal with a number of them who gave an excellent, efficient, highly professional and very valuable service to this country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan that we should do something about the situation in Northern Ireland.  As a Protestant, I strongly hope the Orange lodges forego what they see as the right to march down the Ormeau Road.  If they had the slightest taste of decency of breeding they would be ashamed to go down that road where they thoroughly disgraced themselves in the aftermath of a shooting outside Grahams Bookmakers.  To parade down that road, shouting slogans and giving victory signs was a disgrace not just to protestantism, to Christianity, but to the human race as a whole.  If they had any decency they would desist from this because if they annually reopen and infect these political wounds in the way they do we will never have peace on this island.  It is not consistent with common human decency and certainly not with the principles of Christianity.  I hope an opportunity will be provided at an early stage to debate the situation obtaining in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome Senator Cassidy's appointment as Leader of the House.  I also welcome all the new Senators here today.</P>
      <P>I fully support the point made by Senator McGowan in relation to the marching season in Northern Ireland.  Last Saturday 1500 people marched the roads of Rosnowlagh.  There were Orange bands and people came from all over the world to support the Orange order in their demonstration and there was no bother; people came from all over Northern Ireland and parts of Donegal to watch the scene; it was a day of celebration. Yet there was mayhem 100 miles down the road because people decided not to do anything to try to solve a problem or to bring two groups together.  I commend what Senator McGowan said and support it fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Leader of the House that as soon as possible in the new session &mdash; I may or may not be here as I, like many others, am a candidate in the forthcoming election &mdash; the Seanad introduces the Mental Treatment Act.  The Green Paper on the Mental Treatment Act was issued in 1992.  I have to say with embarrassment that we have had two Ministers for Health since then and we now have a third.  Will the Leader deal <Col N="1129" /> with the introduction of the Mental Treatment Act?  Tributes were paid earlier to Dr. Noel Browne who had highlighted the inadequacies within the psychiatric service.  They have been there since the 1945 Act.  We have come 52 years down the road and very few changes have taken place.  I do not wish mental patients to be seen as the forgotten people of society.  I ask the Leader to raise this issue with Minister Cowen as soon as possible in an effort to have the new Bill introduced to help these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second what Senator Maloney said regarding the Mental Treatment Act.  It is terrible that we have made no progress after four and a half years.  In particular, I second the motion put forward by Senator Norris that we should deal with items Nos. 26 and 27.  Item No. 26 is important.  The declaration of Helsinki states that regarding medical research the rights of the individual &mdash; and in this case it is the rights of infants &mdash; must supersede the needs of science and society.  It is very important that this matter be clarified as soon as possible.  The reports are probably unfounded and may cause our already poor vaccination rate to fall even further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Senator Norris who will undoubtedly be back here I will not but I intend to take a few minutes to say what I want.  It would be churlish of me as a politician not to say that the University Senators have made a tremendous contribution to this House during my time here.  I congratulate them not in the generic way Senator Norris did but in a specific way.</P>
      <P>I wish to join in the congratulations to Senator Cassidy on becoming Leader of the House.  He has been a very astute member of Fianna Fáil in his time.  The confidence in him is justified and I wish him well.  I worked with the former leader of the Fianna Fáil group, Deputy Wright, when he was Leader of the House.  He did a magnificent job on behalf of his party and the House.  I salute the fact that he has gone on, not to greater things, but to a draftier place.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Manning, the former Leader, there is general agreement that he has been a perfect Leader in terms of the status of the House.  I know Senator Cassidy's relationship with the Taoiseach and remind him that Senator Manning tried his best to get the then Government to take this House seriously by initiating legislation here.  He succeeded to some degree but not to the degree that is possible.  The incoming Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Administration can answer the criticism of people like Vincent Browne by making the Seanad more relevant by giving it the powers to examine and initiate legislation, as was done with the legislative committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kelly mentioned the reporting staff.  I have been particularly critical of the RTÉ productions here from time to time but I note the improvements that have been made in the Seanad coverage in particular.  I thank Don McManus <Col N="1130" /> and his staff for those improvements.  The scribes were referred to, and I pay tribute to Mr. Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i>, who has given this House very good coverage.  I will also take a swipe at the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which seems to cover nothing that displeases it.</P>

      <P>Michael Joe Cosgrave was in the House earlier.  His daughter Niamh is now a Senator so that little piece of history should be marked, as should the presence of other new Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan raised the issue of Northern Ireland marches.  This year the situation seems to have worsened.  That is not a criticism of the Taoiseach, but the situation is more dangerous than normal because the Secretary of State is new, the British Prime Minister is new and that Administration is new.  There are many uncharted waters. All we can do is wish them well in their handling of what is a potentially explosive situation.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Dunnes tribunal, that is for another day, when this House has been reelected. If this had happened in my party, I would feel very badly and ashamed of it.  It is accepted, and has always been accepted across party boundaries, that we are in politics for very little. Most of us could earn much more if we were elsewhere, and I might get that opportunity soon. That said, a shameful thing happened and due process will follow.  Nobody should glory in it because it is sad for everybody.  This matter should be investigated fully on behalf of the people and I am sure that will happen.</P>
      <P>There is a tremendous difference between the way the beef tribunal was conducted and the way the McCracken inquiry is being conducted.  That has restored faith not just in the Law Library and the Judiciary, but in the fact that we have something that is efficient, cost-effective and that gets at the truth.</P>
      <P>The Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad are ladies, which should be noted.  This is an all woman administration and the Dáil is an all male administration.  We have two of the most efficient women in the Oireachtas here, and I congratulate them.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the opening hours of the Houses.  I put in my stint but failed to crack that nut because we have allowed the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to become too subservient to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have argued that because we share the House with Members of the Dáil, there should be a Joint Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Leader should pursue this in the new Seanad as it is a huge drawback. There is no reference to the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the opening and closing of the House, and that should not be.  This is not a constitutional matter but one of housekeeping. We should have equal status in the operation of the House.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senator Magner in complimenting Don McManus on the RTÉ coverage of the House and Jimmy Walsh on his tremendous coverage.  Senator Manning asked if the House could be reconvened.  I would have no hesitation in doing so to discuss the Dunnes tribunal if that was possible and warranted.

      <P>In relation to the deteriorating situation in the North, the air of confidence there is waning fast. I was in Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim in recent days, and most public representatives and church leaders are doing their utmost to maintain peace. I particularly compliment the latter on their stance last weekend to maintain the current peace.  Senator Magner pointed out that there are two new Administrations in power, but these Administrations are as determined as their predecessors were in trying to solve the problems in the North.  People living there are suffering, as is the economy.  I look forward to the return of peace and I wish all our leaders well in their efforts.</P>

    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of opening hours.  I will try to meet the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach at the conclusion of today's business to see how we can improve this matter. I could not get into my office at 7.40 p.m. recently, and this was in the middle of a Seanad election, not to mention trying to conduct the normal week-to-week business of a Senator.

I will discuss it with the Minister at the end of today's business and notify the Taoiseach of the wishes of this House to have this serious issue discussed within a couple of weeks of our return.  I ask Senators Norris and Henry if they will consider my request as it is the last day of this Seanad.  Members will appreciate that I was appointed a few days ago and have had to establish contacts with Ministers and Secretaries of Departments and that everything is happening at once.

I do not want to antagonise Members by keeping them here when they need to go electioneering.  Perhaps we could have brief statements simply to place this matter on the record.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your kind <Col N="1133" /> words of welcome.  I reciprocate by wishing you and Members of the Seanad seeking re-election good luck in their campaigns.  This occasion is historic on two fronts.  First, it is the last sitting of the present Seanad and, second, this is the first time the House has been addressed by a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is a wide and important brief and I am honoured to have been appointed to it by the Taoiseach.  I know Members of the Seanad contributed fully to debates on legislation initiated by the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, and join me in paying tribute to the sterling work he undertook in this area.</P>
      <P>It is right that at the first opportunity I should assure the House &mdash; lest there be any doubt on this score &mdash; that in the creation of the new Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform there is no question of any lesser priority being given to matters which were the responsibility of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I pay tribute in particular to the work done by the staff of that Department over the past few years and I believe that the combined resources and expertise of both the former Department of Equality and Law Reform and former Department of Justice together will be well placed to face and address the formidable agenda ahead of us.  I am delighted too that in facing these challenges I will be assisted by the newly appointed Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who will have special responsibility for equality and disability issues.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the important resolution before the House.  Certain sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act &mdash; primarily relating to extra detention powers for the Garda &mdash; will, under the terms of the Act, cease to be in operation from 9 September 1997 unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas extending their operation.  The main section at issue is section 2 which allows persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to be detained for up to seven days.  The purpose of the resolution is to continue the relevant sections of the Act in force until 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>It is hard to imagine a more corrosive threat to the quality of life in our community than that posed by those who engage in the evil trade of drug trafficking.  Their activities have brought about death and destruction on an incalculable scale.  Families have been destroyed and communities placed under siege.  There is probably no greater fear among parents rearing children today than that their children will fall prey to drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is committed to tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way.  We will take steps to reduce the demand for drugs through education and community based initiatives.  We will offer services to those who have become addicted to drugs to help them break their habit.  We clearly recognise that a criminal justice system on its own cannot comprehensively tackle the problem of drug abuse.  The criminal justice system, <Col N="1134" /> however, has a vital role to play in curbing the activities of drug traffickers.  This Government will ensure that role is played fully and relentlessly.</P>
    <P>One message should go clearly from this House today: there will be no let up in the fight against drug trafficking &mdash; instead that fight will be intensified. The full resources of the State will be deployed in this area and where those resources need to be enhanced I guarantee they will be.</P>
    <P>Over the past year or so there has been considerable progress in taking on drug traffickers but there is no room for complacency or defeatism. It is generally accepted that the proceeds of crime legislation which I introduced in the other House last year on behalf of Fianna Fáil, and which was taken on board by the then Government, has greatly assisted the Garda and other agencies in literally ensuring that crime does not pay.  I place on the record &mdash; and I am sure Members will join me in this &mdash; our appreciation of the work which has been done in this regard by all the agencies involved and particularly by the staff of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>Our ultimate aim is not to seize the profits of drug trafficking but to put drug traffickers out of business altogether.  To achieve this we need to ensure that the Garda has the powers to enable it to investigate fully drug offences.  It is in this context that the resolution before the House is being brought forward.  The fact that this sitting is taking place indicates the importance Senators attach to the issue.  I thank Members for their co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having had the honour to be appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the Taoiseach, I have a full agenda.  We will have many opportunities in the new Seanad to debate all the issues involved.  Obviously, it would not be appropriate or possible during this short debate to deal with criminal justice matters generally in great detail.  However, in the context of the debate it would be useful to inform the House that I hope to bring forward a criminal justice Bill in the autumn which will contain a series of strong measures which will tighten the vice further on drug traffickers and, indeed, other serious criminals.</P>
    <P>I intend that the Bill, as one of a number of measures to speed up trials, will include provision for the abolition of the preliminary examination system.  There will be improved procedures for pursuing the assets of people convicted of drug trafficking offences by allowing a court to initiate an asset inquiry.  It will also deal with tougher sentencing so that those convicted of serious drug trafficking offences will know they will inevitably face sentences of ten years or more.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the technical details of the resolution. Section 11 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, provides that section 2, dealing with powers of detention, section 3, dealing with the amendment of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, section 4, dealing <Col N="1135" /> with rearrest, section 5, dealing with the application of provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and section 6, dealing with regulations regarding officers of customs and excise, shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months from the date of their commencement unless resolutions are passed by each House of the Oireachtas continuing their operation.  All provisions of the 1996 Act were commenced by ministerial order on 9 September 1996.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the 1996 Act also provided that before such resolutions may be passed the Minister for Justice must cause to be laid before each House a report on the operation of the sections in question covering the period ending not more than 21 days before the moving of the resolution. Before leaving office my predecessor laid such a report covering the period up to 16 June 1996. However, in light of the 21 day's requirement, I arranged last Monday to have a second report covering the period up to 27 June 1997 laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>When the 1996 Act was going through the Oireachtas last year it had widespread support.  It followed a Misuse of Drugs Bill I introduced which would also have allowed for seven day's detention in drug trafficking cases.  It was agreed that, given the strong detention powers which the measure contained, it was right that it be regularly reviewed by the Oireachtas.  It is against this background the House is being asked to continue the relevant provisions in operation until 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>While they are available in the report I mentioned, it may be useful for the purposes of this debate to give some statistics provided by the Garda authorities on the operation of the provisions in question covering the period 9 September 1996 to 27 June 1997.  The total number of persons detained under section 2 was 145.  Of these, 48 were held for a period not exceeding six hours, 50 between six hours and 24 hours, 26 between 24 and 48 hours, ten between 48 hours and 120 hours and 11 between 120 hours to 168 hours.  Of the 145, 97 were released without charge and 48 were charged.  Of the 48, three were convicted, four were acquitted and 41 cases are pending.  It might be worth reminding the House that, under the terms of the section, detention for periods up to 48 hours can be approved by members of the Garda Síochána of specified rank; periods greater than that have to be authorised by the courts.</P>
    <P>I also specifically mention section 6 which enabled the Minister for Justice, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, to make regulations providing for the attendance of an officer of customs and excise at, and the participation of such an officer in, the questioning of persons detained under the provisions of the Act. As the report points out, work is proceeding on the preparation of regulations under the section which will be the subject of consultations with the Minister for Finance and the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> The Garda authorities have indicated that the provisions of the Drug Trafficking Act have proved beneficial to the force in their investigation of drug trafficking offences.  The operation of the relevant sections of the Act for the relatively short period in question has made a substantial contribution to the fight against the drugs menace. The continuation in operation of these sections, with other strong measures which I propose to take, are necessary so that we can continue to tackle head on those who engage in drug trafficking.  That is why I commend this important resolution to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, congratulate him on his recent appointment and wish him the best in what is probably the most challenging portfolio in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Any serious debate about law and order in modern society must focus on effective responses by the State.  These must be legislative and structural to allay the concerns felt by ordinary people, families and communities.  No matter where one lives in Ireland of 1997, urban or rural, people live in fear.</P>
      <P>If fear is a product of crime, then drugs are the main evil raw materials which help create crime in modern society.  Gangs are running sophisticated criminal organisations in our cities and towns.  Long ago they recognised the value of these raw materials and have woven an elaborate and despicable web which feeds drugs to petty criminals, often children and juveniles, who in turn yield big profits for their overlords.  This evil business strategy has at its sick heart a vicious cycle of drug induced youths, the operatives on the shop floor feeding their habits by engaging in petty crime.  The more desperate the habit becomes, the more vicious their criminal actions and the more terrifying the effects on ordinary innocent citizens.  People cannot venture outside their front doors after dark today without feeling vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rationally examining this issue, we need to look closely at the factors which contribute to the climate of fear and concern on the streets of the cities and elsewhere.  One factor about which the incoming Government made a veritable three ring circus during the general election was the level and density of policing.  While it has improved, there is still an insufficient Garda presence on our city streets.  This is a major contributory factor, not so much to the prevalence of crime as to the absence of order.  Any serious attempt to tackle increased crime cannot rely just on laws but must also involve a reinstatement of order and the necessary personnel to enforce the law.  For example, in dealing with the complexity of modern crime, one must not only lock up the perpetrators of heinous crime or personal assaults on innocent victims, but also take stock of the small criminal.  Even petty crime, which seems relatively harmless in the greater scheme of things, nourishes and nurtures small criminal acts <Col N="1137" /> which eventually develop a mentality allowing for the acceptance of any crime.</P>
    <P>Victims of crime suffer further injustice in a system which concentrates most of its resources on the criminal and his rehabilitation.  Those victims are invariably the weaker in our society, the old, the young and invalids.  Without exacting revenge, they must be treated with dignity, genuine concern and compassion.  Crime is without question the biggest social problem in society today.  Its victims are the minorities and we must recognise this and be proactive in dealing effectively and not rhetorically in tackling this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment and Deputy Mary Wallace on hers as Minister of State.  Never has a Minister been so well prepared for the job as Deputy O'Donoghue because it is on the record of the Oireachtas that he published a historically high number of Private Members' Bills while in Opposition.  He put much thought into them and proposed legislation.  He will bring that research and thought with him.  He will perhaps accept that, sometimes in the frantic activity of ministerial office, it is not easy to have a long period in which to think in a broad, philosophical way on how to tackle problems besetting society. It is good for every Minister that they have a period before they come into office where they can gather their thoughts and prepare their actions.  I wish the new Minister for Justice the best as he has a huge job ahead of him to which I am sure he is equal.  I also welcome Senator Cosgrave and wish her every happiness in this House or any other for as long as that may be.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that the 12 monthly review of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, is essential.  To tackle the crime crisis brought about by drug trafficking it has been essential to curb one of the most fundamental liberties of people &mdash; the right not to be arrested.  When one is arrested for a period of seven days it is a substantial infringement of civil liberty.  It would be a shame if, for a prolonged period, this state of affairs had to exist and it would be a shame if the ordinary citizen was under threat of such action because of the activities of a small minority of thugs.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the scale of the drugs crisis necessitated the bringing into being of this Act. It was essential that section 2 of the Act, which allows for an arrest for seven days after the courts have been consulted, was brought into being.  The then Minister stated that the existing period of detention was not long enough to carry out investigations, many of which were on an international basis.  The Minister will agree that many drug traffickers have been operating on an international basis and it is only over a period of seven days that international inquiries can be made of foreign police authorities to ascertain whether persons arrested are engaging in drug trafficking. Section 2 and other sections are essential in the fight against drug trafficking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> I welcome the Minister's determination to carry on the fight against drug trafficking.  He is zealous about this, and so he should be.  The Garda, the Customs and Excise and the Criminal Assets Bureau have scored many notable successes and as a result many of the drug cartels operating here are in a much weakened position. However, drugs are being widely trafficked, sold and distributed throughout Ireland.  We cannot close our eyes to that reality.  I am delighted the Minister said that any resources required will be made available and that he will personally guarantee that it will not be for the lack of resources that the drug trafficking problem is not tackled.  This is a priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister should visit some of the areas worst affected by drug trafficking, especially in Dublin city and other urban areas.  As I speak, there are flat complexes in Dublin where drugs are being openly trafficked.  The Minister should arrive unannounced in some of these areas and see for himself, as I am sure he may already have done, how drugs are being trafficked in these complexes.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful. However, the public would like to know more about this success.  Some of the assets seized may already have been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Justice must be done and be seen to be done.  It would give the public hope if large advertisements setting out the assets seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau were published in our newspapers. The public wants to be confident that drug trafficking is being tackled head on.</P>
    <P>I join the Minister in praising the work of the outgoing Minister.  We supported her on many Bills in the Dáil and in this House.  On several occasions she took on board Bills drafted by Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Ryan and we commended her for this.  There were times when we were critical of her but that is the stuff of politics. By and large, she was well intentioned.  We had some serious disagreements but this is not an easy task.  I thank the Minister for proposing this resolution.  We support it and I am sure the Opposition will do likewise.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new Minister; it is a pleasure to see him here.  He is a man of clear, forthright and vigorous opinions and he does not hesitate to express them.  I like that even though I do not always agree with him.  It is appropriate that someone with his professional expertise in law should be in that Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was very gracious in his remarks about Mervyn Taylor and I share those views. However, I do not share his enthusiasm for merging the Department of Equality and Law Reform with the Department of Justice.  In the harsh reality of political life that can only mean a downgrading <Col N="1139" /> of equality and law reform as a priority. I do not mean that this Minister has any less a sense of urgency about it but it must mean that equality and law reform will be placed on the back burner unless a special effort is made.  Perhaps Deputy Wallace will be given special responsibility in this area.  She is an excellent person with whom I served on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.  I hope this new Ministry will give a sense of urgency to these matters as did the previous Government.</P>
    <P>One of the litmus tests will be the speed with which the new Government reintroduces, in amended form, the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill.  We warned the Government that certain sections might be unconstitutional but it did not listen and we have been proved right.  It is important that these Bills are reintroduced properly amended.  Fianna Fáil speakers, including Senator Mulcahy, spoke effectively on this measure when we were on the same side.  I hope we remain on the same side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the best offer I have had all day.  However, I shall resist the Senator's blandishments. With regard to the Bill, everyone is against the havoc wreaked by drugs.  However, we should be realistic.  We are not going to solve this problem.  The fight is not being successful nor is it anywhere near being so and anyone who imagines it is is living in cloud cuckoo land.  There is no way on earth to prevent the spread of drugs except one &mdash; and this measure cannot be taken by this Government or country alone &mdash; that is the massive deregulation of controlled substances on a Europe wide, if not a global, basis.  I have said time and again in this House that until one destroys the financial incentive which lies at the base of the drug cartels one will never stop drug trafficking.  Burning tonnes of cannabis resin, which is a harmless substance, is an utter waste of time.  Nobody robs, murders or breaks into premises for cannabis.  The problem is heroin which is the most highly addictive of the opiates. Chasing pot smokers is an utter distraction.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing this Bill, I attempted to include a section which would redistribute the moneys taken from drug barons to the most vulnerable areas.  I was told this was not possible. Why not?  I do not believe that.  The principal parties were involved in an idiotic Dutch auction about how many prison places they were going to build, as if that was the answer to anything.  It is a waste of money building prison places.  The £128 million earmarked for prison places would be better spent on the north inner city of Dublin and would prevent many people becoming drug abusers. Building prisons is not the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approve heartily of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I raised this issue in the House several years ago.  I do not claim any originality.  I went to somebody who really knew about the problem <Col N="1140" /> and I strongly recommend the Minister to go to somebody who knows about the problem.  He will not have far to go.  Deputy Gregory is an excellent representative in my area.  He knows about drugs.  He suggested the Criminal Assets Bureau and a proper co-ordinated response between Revenue, Social Welfare and the Garda Síochána. He was not listened to until Veronica Guerin was tragically killed.  I suggest the Minister talks to people like Deputy Gregory and the kind of acolytes surrounding him, for example, Seanie Lambe who lives in Sheriff Street flats who knows the drugs scene from the inside, Mick Rafferty, the North City Community Action Group and the ICON people.  They can give the Minister a reading from ground level as to the best way to approach this problem.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to look at other addiction problems.  In my area there are four appalling boozing joints which continually break the law.  Alcohol is a more destructive drug than marijuana.  Six months ago I warned that if something was not done to stop these pubs there would be murder on the streets.  I was attacked twice and I rescued someone from being beaten to death.  There have been five murders since I spoke about this issue in this House and each murder can be traced back to these late night boozing joints which operate until 3 a.m.  If a fight breaks out both parties are ejected from these bars into the street so they can continue fighting without spattering the nice carpets with blood.  I would like something done about this.  The Garda should oppose licences for these late night bars who flagrantly breach the law and cause social problems.</P>
    <P>I have a hot tip for the Minister for Justice.  A pub at the bottom of North Great Georges Street into Parnell Street which was formerly known as The Step In and now known as Lowes public house is for sale.  My information is that one of the leading drug barons has frightened off any opposition in order to acquire it for himself.  Will this be allowed?  When people put up massive sums of money to acquire public houses and other assets to launder their drug money is no attempt made by the Inland Revenue etc., to ascertain where this money came from?  As far as I am concerned this will be another litmus test.  I will be bitterly disappointed if I find any drug barons striding around my area owning pubs.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to look at syringe attacks.  I am not sure if blood filled syringe attacks are classified in law as attempted murder. If not, they should be.  Unlike a clean gunshot wound a syringe attack leaves its victim agonising over the threat of HIV infection for a long time.</P>
    <P>Deregulation of drugs would knock out a financial incentive.  If Ireland did it on its own we would become a magnet for every lunatic drug addict in Europe and we cannot allow that.  It should be done at European level.  Deregulation knocks out the financial incentive, thereby destroying drug empires.  People would get quality controlled substances so they would not die <Col N="1141" /> from drug impurities.  Drug users would receive clean needles and there would be no motivation to mug old people.  If this could be done at a European level I guarantee the crime rate would be halved throughout Europe.  Lives would be saved and the spread of infection would be curtailed. As a matter of principle it is not up to the State to act as a nanny.  People should be allowed to float off into outer space using psychedelic drugs if they want to.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister for Justice and I know his great commitment to trying to deal with this serious problem.  Drug trafficking is a major international business.  As Senator Norris stated it would be extraordinarily difficult for us to tackle the problem on our own but I am sure the Minister will be liaising with his counterparts throughout the European Union and elsewhere to deal with this vile trade.</P>
      <P>There are two publicly funded areas which tackle drug trafficking.  The first one which was discussed today is the side which prevents the entry of drugs to the country and the conviction of those involved in bringing them in.  I would be glad if the Minister could tell me the relative cost of this in comparison to trying to reduce the demand for drugs which is the main reason it is so profitable to be involved in this international trade.  There is an enormous cost involved in policing the ports and the airports.  We have a very long coastline which makes it extremely difficult to deal with the importation of drugs to this country and which costs a lot of money.  The long-term garda surveillance of drug traffickers is also costly.  We also have the cost of court cases and the imprisonment of drug traffickers.  It is essential to imprison the major drug traffickers.  Unfortunately, in many cases the people we imprison are very minor players in the drugs world.  Some of these prisoners are drug abusers who may want to kick their habit.  Often these people with convictions for drug trafficking have been hardened addicts since their teens.  The prison system is unsuitable for them.  It is important this area is dealt with as soon as possible.  Treating them in prison is not enough.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister looks at today's copy of <i>The Irish Medical Times</i> in which the visitors committee's new report slams medical conditions in Mountjoy jail.  The article addresses psychiatric care within the prison stating that Dr. Charles Smith has said that 5 per cent of prisoners in Mountjoy jail have valid psychiatric illness and that at least 100 prisoners should be in a psychiatric setting outside prison.  This is very important.  Is it legal to have people suffering psychiatric illnesses in prison?  We must remove these people from prison into a psychiatric sector. It is recognised these prisoners are not receiving adequate psychiatric treatment within the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> The situation in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum is so serious that no more prisoners can be transferred to it.  I think some patients in Dundrum are less seriously ill than those people who are left within the confines of Mountjoy.  I hope the Minister will address this urgent matter.  A considerable number of these patients are also involved in drugs, either hard drugs or psychotopic drugs, prescribed to the general public.  It is important we recognise there is trafficking in these drugs too.  Patients have informed me where to get the most reliable supplies of psychotopic drugs, analgesics and other drugs within the city. I have not checked this for myself but we must recognise it is a problem.</P>
    <P>The other area which costs the public purse a great deal of money is that of trying to reduce the demand for drugs.  The survey by Dr. Paul O'Mahoney of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison who are involved in drug taking, which was recently produced by the Department of Justice, shows they come from areas of socio-economic deprivation, mostly three postal areas in Dublin.  It is very important to do all we can to reduce the demand for drugs in such areas where many children begin to take drugs before they are 12 or 13 years old.</P>
    <P>It is also important to provide more funding for diversionary tactics and education.  I would like to know the relative allocation of funding &mdash; probably only 10 per cent goes to reducing the demand for drugs rather than to the more high profile prevention of drug trafficking.  In common with Senator Norris, I find it difficult to understand why the proceeds of the Criminal Assets Bureau cannot be specifically diverted to these areas.  Apparently, items which are part of the public purse cannot be named as being specifically for certain areas.  However, the Minister should, at least, encourage the spending of these funds within those areas.</P>
    <P>For years I have been approached by Sr. Marie Joseph from Dolphins Barn.  She is a very fine lady who asks me for only small sums of money &mdash; £3.5 million for a sports centre on the Player Wills site on the South Circular Road.  If such sums could be found to help parents who are doing their utmost to keep their children from becoming involved in drugs it might result in a better end product.</P>
    <P>Almost all the women prisoners in Mountjoy Prison are drug addicts.  It is fine to provide treatment while they are in prison if they are agreeable to that, but there is a grave shortage of good follow-up programmes and hostel accommodation when they are released from prison.  This means that those who would like to stay away from their previous friends when they are released have very little chance of so doing. Instead, they return to the same <i>milieu</i> and within weeks about 90 per cent of them are back to their previous lifestyle, regardless of whether that is what they want.  Given that it costs £45,000 a year to keep someone in prison, this is very poor value for money.  Far more funding should be allocated <Col N="1143" /> to reducing the demand for drugs and helping those who wish to stay away from drugs than is the case at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their kind words of congratulation. I specifically thank Senator Mulcahy for his tremendous work as the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice in this House which I deeply appreciated.  I found his co-operation and experience as a lawyer invaluable during my period as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>There will be fuller opportunities in the autumn to discuss the complexities of tackling the problem of drug abuse.  The debate on the Criminal Justice Bill, to which I referred earlier, will be one of those opportunities.  My priority, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is the supply side of the drug problem.  However, measures in this regard must be accompanied by effective measures on the demand reduction side. In this context, I am sure the House welcomes the appointment announced earlier this week of the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, as head of the national drug strategy team.  He has considerable experience, having served previously as a very successful Minister of State at the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that it is necessary to have provision on our Statute Book for detention of up to seven days.  However, it would be far more regrettable if the State did not take all action open to it commensurate with the threat which drug traffickers pose to the community.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, appropriate safeguards built into the legislation.  The statistics which I earlier outlined go a long way towards answering the fears expressed by some people last year that the seven day powers would be used excessively. In fact, of the 145 people detained, 98 were held for a period not exceeding 12 hours.  That period of detention was already permitted under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Only 21 people were held for more than 48 hours.</P>
      <P>This is the first opportunity for the House to consider the operation of the sections on the basis of the report laid before it.  The statistics in the report are in the form in which they were made available to me by the Garda.  I am open to suggestions regarding information which might be contained in future reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House there is no question of the Department of Equality and Law Reform being downgraded.  Deputy Mary Wallace, who has made a considerable impression in the Dáil, has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with special responsibility for Equality and Disability. Throughout my public life I have always had a tremendous interest in assisting the disadvantaged and marginalised.  I assure them they will have a very strong voice, not just in Government <Col N="1144" /> but in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I have an abiding interest in the subject and anybody who doubts that will be pleasantly surprised.</P>
    <P>The question of bringing forward the Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill will be considered by the Government at a very early date.  I hope to deal further with these very important issues in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>During my period as Opposition spokesperson on Justice I met with various groups, individuals and communities who are interested in tackling the drug problem and I will continue to do so. My door will always be open to them.</P>
    <P>I am resolutely opposed to the legalisation of any drugs.  There is no question of controlled substances being legalised.  The international experience has been that the legalisation of drugs leads to a far greater problem than it could ever resolve.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Norris' statement on criminal activity, I am sure if he has specific information he will be happy to pass it on to the Garda for investigation.  He also referred to syringe attacks.  When I was in Opposition I introduced a Private Members' Bill to deal effectively with syringe attacks.  The then Minister for Justice subsequently produced a Bill which was largely based, as far as syringe attacks were concerned, on the Bill I published.  The previous Government enacted legislation which carries heavy penalties for such attacks equivalent to those for attempted murder.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy requested that I visit the places worst affected by drugs and publish a list of frozen assets.  As he is aware, I have visited areas badly affected by drugs and I am amenable to further visits.  With regard to the publication of a list of frozen assets, the hearings do not currently make provision for that but we will monitor the situation very carefully.  I compliment the Criminal Assets Bureau on the great work it has been doing on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The fact that the House is sitting today is a measure of the importance Members attribute to the fight against drug trafficking.  Several Members mentioned the importance of tackling the assets of people living in opulence with no apparent means of legitimate income.  The purpose of the proceeds of crime legislation which I introduced on behalf of Fianna Fáil in the Dáil was to touch those who believed they were untouchable.  I provided that, irrespective of whether an individual was convicted or charged, their assets could be frozen if shown to be illicit as a matter of probability and that after a period of years they could be disposed of by the Exchequer or alternatively returned to the source from which they came if that source was found to be legitimate.  The objective was to tackle those involved in dealing or holding illicit assets and the legislation has been very successful in this regard. The consequential establishment and operation <Col N="1145" /> of the Criminal Assets Bureau has been very successful.</P>
    <P>In future those who deal or traffic in illegal drugs will face the prospect of having their assets frozen and subsequently disposed of.  They will also face the prospect of lengthy terms of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their co-operation in this extremely important matter.  I realise they are engaged in an election and it is a tribute to them that the House is sitting to deal with a matter of such considerable importance to society.  The good of the people is being put before the election concerns of Senators.  I wish Members well in the Seanad elections and look forward to seeing them all in the House after the election.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for agreeing to the sitting of the House to facilitate debate on this short, technical but important Bill.  I know that many Members have other pressing commitments in the election for Seanad Éireann.  Having recently been involved in the general election I appreciate that being here represents a major intrusion on Members' valuable time and again I register my thanks to them.</P>
      <P>The decision to decentralise part of the Land Registry to Waterford was announced by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on 4 November 1992 and I am greatly honoured that it falls to me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce the legislation to provide the necessary legal framework for this decision to be brought into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to stress the importance of a proper system of land registration.  The importance of proper legal title to land is something to which Irish people are greatly attached. <Col N="1146" /> We have one of the highest rates of home ownership in Europe and for the vast majority of people the purchase of their own home ranks as their highest priority.  In rural areas the need for accurate recording and registration of holdings is of great importance.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to those who work in the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the professional way in which business has been done over the years that public confidence in the institution has never wavered and that possession of title deeds verified by the Land Registry is accepted by all as valid proof of title.</P>
    <P>Having practised as a solicitor I am aware of complaints that have been made of delays in the Land Registry in processing dealings and I was very pleased to learn as part of an overall briefing on the operations of my Department that delays have been substantially reduced in recent years. For example, in 1990 the average time for processing applications for registration was about six months.  In April 1997 the average time was down to two months.  Considering that since 1990 the annual number of transactions lodged in the Land Registry has increased from about 220,000 to about 300,000, the improvements can be clearly seen.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to place on record the appreciation of all users of the registries &mdash; solicitors and the general public &mdash; for the work done by the Registrar of Titles and her staff and for the improvements which have taken place.  It is appropriate for me now to pay tribute to the registrar and her staff for the high level of expertise, efficiency and competence which they bring to bear on their work.  The fact that in 1980 there were 565 staff dealing with about 222,000 applications and that today there are 515 staff dealing with 300,000 applications bears ample testament to their selfless dedication and commitment. The service has improved and continues to improve.  These improvements have taken place with the co-operation and wholehearted involvement of staff at all levels of the registries.</P>
    <P>I would not want it thought that the improvements which have taken place represent the end of the matter: far from it.  The registrar and her staff, with the interim board, have plans and proposals in place which will bring about further improvements and improve the service to the public.  The Government is determined to ensure that progress is made in creating a customer driven environment in the public service in general and the achievements of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds will be a headline for others to follow.</P>
    <P>The future status of the registries has to be considered by the Government.  In that context the interim board, registrar and staff, have done a great amount of work on proposals for a new status.  I will be examining these proposals with a view to an early discussion with my colleagues in Government and as soon as a decision is taken I will make a public announcement of the Government's intentions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> The Land Registry operation in Waterford will involve about 140 staff transferring there to deal with work concerning Counties Kerry, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Laois, Offaly, Carlow, Tipperary, Wexford and Kilkenny.  The transfer of staff will take place on a phased basis beginning during August and completed by September. Staff are being trained at present and I know that the professional standards to which I have already referred will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some members of the legal profession are uneasy about the change and their concerns have been conveyed to me.  I am satisfied that there will be no reduction in the level of service provided and that with the use of modern technology and means of communication difficulties can be kept to a minimum.  The registrar has communicated regularly with members of the legal profession practising in the counties concerned to keep them informed of the position and I am sure that any teething problems which might arise will be promptly dealt with.</P>
    <P>To those members of the legal profession who have expressed misgivings because of the possible inconvenience of travelling to Waterford rather than Dublin, can I say that I have no doubt that the policy of decentralisation is correct.  While there might be some minor change to work patterns, I am fully satisfied that the benefits for everyone involved &mdash; staff moving to decentralised locations and existing communities &mdash; are enormous.  The revitalisation of communities and the increased economic activity are extremely beneficial to all.</P>
    <P>I invite anyone who has any doubts about this to visit my own constituency of Kerry South &mdash; where about 140 staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are based in Killarney &mdash; to see the operation there for themselves. The facilities there are first class and no difficulty has arisen with work being done there which was previously done in Dublin.  I ask those people who have misgivings to co-operate fully with the change.</P>
    <P>If there is any doubt about the willingness of civil servants to co-operate fully with decentralisation, the fact that over 1,000 applications for transfer to Waterford were received should dispel these doubts.  It is my view that future decentralisation of parts of Government Departments from Dublin should take place and I intend to vigorously pursue opportunities for further decentralisations. Today is an extremely important and good day for Waterford.  The economic and social fabric of the city and its environs will be improved as a result of the decision to decentralise there under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the details of the Bill itself, which is a short one.  The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Registration of Title Act, 1964, to provide the necessary legislative basis for the decentralisation of part of the Land Registry to Waterford.  The law relating to the registration of land is governed by the 1964 Act, section 7 of <Col N="1148" /> which provides that there shall be a central office located in the county borough of Dublin and a local office in each county other than Dublin. This central office is to be the office for registration of all land in the State.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's decision to decentralise certain operations of the Land Registry to Waterford it becomes necessary, in order to provide a clear legal basis for the move, to amend section 7 of the 1964 Act.  The necessary amendments, which the Bill before the House will effect, will essentially provide for the establishment of constituent offices of the central office which will carry out the work currently performed by the central office under the 1964 Act.  The result of this change will be that the functions currently carried out by the central office of the Land Registry will be regionalised through the establishment of constituent offices in Dublin and outside Dublin.  While the Land Registry will continue to consist of a central office and local offices, the Bill's effect will be that the central office will not be a physical entity but will be made up of constituent offices, to be located in Dublin, and in any county so designated by an order made by me as Minister.  This will permit the designation of Waterford as an area within which a constituent office may be located.</P>
    <P>I will briefly deal with each section of the Bill. Section 1 amends section 7 of the 1964 Act in two respects.  First, it substitutes a new subsection for subsection (1) to provide that the central office of the Land Registry will consist of one or more constituent offices to be located in Dublin and in any other area which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, by order, designate. There will continue to be local offices in each county, other than Dublin, and any county where a constituent office is located.  Second, it adds a new subsection, subsection (5), which gives the Minister the necessary power to make, or revoke, an order designating any county as an area within which a constituent office will be located.  Because the Dublin office will service the greater Dublin area, there will be no need to establish a local office within any of the three administrative counties of South Dublin, Fingal or Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Neither will it be necessary to have one in any county where there is a constituent office.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with transitional provisions so that the central office of the Land Registry, currently located in Dublin in accordance with section 7 of the 1964 Act, will become a constituent office under the terms of the amended section 7.  The section states that the central office of the Land Registry, which is located in the county borough of Dublin, will become, after the passing of this Bill, a constituent office or constituent offices of the central office in the county borough.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill simply provides that the short title will be the Registration of Title (Amendment) Act, 1997, and also states that it will be construed as one with the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> Those are the terms of the Bill.  It is a short Bill but an important one.  Without it the proposed decentralisation of parts of the Land Registry to Waterford could have given rise to the need for cumbersome and expensive procedures to ensure compliance with the 1964 Act as regards the location of the central office.  That would also have raised doubts about our commitment to genuine decentralisation by requiring certain operations in relation to the registration of land in the counties to be dealt with from Waterford to otherwise remain in Dublin.  With this Bill we will ensure that there is genuine decentralisation and that there is a proper legal basis for it.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I am confident that given the commitment, expertise and vigour of the staff involved, the decentralisation of part of the Land Registry to Waterford will be a success.</P>

I know he will bring to the job his vigour, concern and considerable intellectual expertise.  I wish him well in one of the most onerous positions of Government.</P>
      <P>My only criticism of this Bill is that we are being asked to take it today.  The process which this Bill facilitates has been under way since 1992. The Bill is short and technical.  We have no quibble with its principle &mdash; decentralisation is good in itself and is welcomed by the people who avail of the chance to work in the less crowded, perhaps healthier atmosphere of large county towns. It also ensures that the users of services such as the Land Registry can avail of them closer to home.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As an auctioneer I know the long delays involved in completing sales because of the overcrowding and the amount of work dealt with by the Land Registry.  Moving offices out to the counties will reduce this delay but it is important that the main office should remain.  We in Sligo know what the decentralisation of part of the Department of Social Welfare has done for Sligo town.  Decentralisation is a good thing but it is important that there be a central Land Registry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a television programme about land registration in Florida, where it can be done on a &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; basis.  This has led to a racket &mdash; people register land they do not own and use fictitious signatures.  It costs the owners of the land a lot of money to get it back, and in the meantime the people who falsely register the land have obtained huge mortgages on it.  Thankfully we do not have that problem because of the efficient <Col N="1150" /> way the Land Registry works.  Although some people say land registration takes too long, it is extremely important and has always been done well in Ireland.  It will be done even more efficiently now in the new offices in Waterford and other counties because people will be able to go into a local office and there will be a more &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; approach, which will be to the benefit of all concerned.  I welcome and recommend the Bill.</P>

      <P>Of course, decentralisation is welcome and, in particular, decentralisation of the Land Registry offices.  For many years I have been representing people who ask to have the registration of title expedited for the simple reason that before full title to property is approved by lending agencies in most cases one finds that people must find accommodation for bridging finance.  The fact that in 1980 556 staff dealt with 222,000 cases and today 515 staff are dealing with 300,000 cases speaks for itself.  One has to ask whether that is practical.  The answer is, it is not.  In 1996 and 1997 I had occasion to have a matter expedited in the land registry because a friend of mine, in the Minister's county, asked me to do so.  I was really up against a stone wall.  It is unreasonable that little or no progress had taken place for almost 12 months.</P>
      <P>My main point, and I am sure it has been stated by others, is that Land Registry is a very important service.  I support decentralisation, preferably to Cork, and I ask the Minister to clarify the role of a constituent office.  For instance, Cork is a constituent office and Dublin will be a constituent office.  I ask him to have the importance of Land Registry dealings in regard to house purchase expedited.  I am sure he will take it on board.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have some thoughts on it which I will put to the Minister.  I hope I will be able to play a part in recognising the importance of information technology and how it could take place in this Bill.  I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  I wish him and the Bill well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fundamentally about decentralisation and moving the headquarters of the Land Registry to <Col N="1151" /> Waterford.  I strongly believe in the principle of decentralisation.  Some people might say we have been talking about decentralisation and avoiding the bureaucracy for as long as we have been talking about draining the Shannon &mdash; which is a long time before any of us came here -and let us prove it, technology has now moved decisively in favour of decentralisation.  It makes possible a level of decentralisation that nobody would have dared even to suggest ten years ago, whatever about a generation ago.  For that reason decentralisation is an idea that is finally here.  It is now realistic to talk about total decentralisation of all Government backed office operations.  When it comes to the routine work of day-to-day administration no compelling reason demands any more that this must be done.  There is no compelling reason the administration has to be done where the policy is made.  I am talking here about administration and policy.  Neither is there any compelling reason all the administration of a Government Department has to be done in the one place.  On the other hand there are tremendous advantages in moving office operations out of the capital in a way that would have not been possible only a few years ago.  Even a small section of a Department could totally regenerate and rejuvenate a small town. Apart from the morale boosts spending those salaries within the area provides a boost for many local business.</P>
    <P>I would like the new Government to set definite targets for decentralisation for the next five years.  There has never been a better time to do it and never a greater need to do it when small towns in many rural areas are on the brink of losing their whole viability.  I know that is under threat and the communities under threat (CUT) has recognised this as urgent and it needs that recognition.  Let me add a word of caution.  There is little point in embracing decentralisation except in the context of information technology.  We would have seriously failed to exploit the possibilities of decentralisation if we simply transferred 19th century administration from one part of the country to another and moving the Land Registry to Waterford is a particular place in point.  I applaud the move and support this legislation which enables that to take place.  I hope we will not end up with a nationwide network of land registries that blithely carry on their work as if information technology did not exist.  Information technology makes it possible to have the entire Land Registry fully up-to-date, available to every citizen in every public library in the country.  It is now technically possible to have a Land Registry that is directly searchable, directly from solicitors' offices.  Everybody who has gone through the trouble and the expense of buying or selling a house will appreciate we are talking about a revolution in the quality of service which can be provided to the public and a revolution in the speed at which that service can be provided.</P>
    <P>Modernising the Land Registry is something that can be made to pay for itself.  It should be <Col N="1152" /> regarded as a fully commercial project with separate investment capital and a short payback time. It is something that could even be farmed out to the private sector on a contract basis for the period of the transition and then brought back within the Government fold when it is up and running.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto in the recent general election had much to say about rural development. It also had much to say about the information technology, some of it was new but much of it was very exciting.  My hope is that the vision of the manifesto will be acted on and not forgotten. How vigorously the Government acts on decentralisation will be a good test in both these important areas.  I welcome the Bill and in doing so I hope the move to Waterford will be seen as the beginning of a new period of change in the future of the Land Registry, not the end of it.  I welcome it, I wish it well and the Minister should be congratulated on moving it.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I am deeply grateful for the very kind good wishes and expressions of congratulations from all contributors.  I suppose I would be forgiven for specifically referring to the remarks of Senator Fitzgerald who is from my constituency.  It is necessary for me to place on record my appreciation for the warmth of his support and friendship inside and outside the constituency of Kerry South.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  It is unlikely that any legislation I bring before the new Seanad will be as relatively unpretentious.  I will, of course, bring the remarks made by Senators in the course of the debate to the attention of the Registrar of Titles.  As I said at the outset, decisions remain to be taken about the future organisation of the Land Registry and its status.  This will form part of a heavy programme of administrative reform which I will undertake and will include a new court service and prison authority.  The technical nature of the measure before the House is important to see this Bill in the context of a policy of decentralisation.  Our Programme for Government contains a commitment on decentralisation.  There is a growing realisation that, as Senator Quinn pointed out, with modern technology marked barriers that existed before now can be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now deal with the points raised by Senators.  Senator Manning wondered why I introduced this legislation today.  The principal reason is that we hope to move the office to Waterford in August and to have it up and running in September.  I cannot account for why the Bill was not introduced earlier but the general election might have had a part to play in the delay.  Senator Sherlock asked what was meant by a &ldquo;constituent office&rdquo;.  It is intended that the <Col N="1153" /> constituent office will form part of the central office of the Land Registry and will deal with specific counties.  The constituent office will be interlocked, as it were, with the central office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to information technology. I agree the availability of such technology has broken down geographical barriers and opened opportunities for rural areas in terms of their economic and social enhancement.  The Government's commitment to decentralisation was outlined in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and I intend to actively pursue the policy in my Department. The Land Registry already has information technology and many major projects are currently under consideration.  I intend to introduce these projects in due course to ensure the Land Registry has the modern facilities and technology to enable it to do its job effectively for the people whom it is designed to serve.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their participation in the debate.  While this is a short Bill with limited ambitions, it is worthwhile.  I thank Senators for their support and I appreciate the Seanad sitting today to consider these important matters. Senators are in the middle of a Seanad election, which is an awesome task.  I wish them well in the election and thank them for putting the community before themselves by their presence today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Refugee Act was passed by the Oireachtas earlier this year to the acclaim of all political parties.  Indeed, some speeches by Senator Mulcahy in support of the Bill urged the Minister to be more liberal.  There was genuine support for the legislation but I am extremely anxious about the lack of progress in implementing it since it was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment of support was made long before the Act was introduced.  The interim report on applications for refugee status in the report of the interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals which was published in 1993 stated that there was a genuine public concern regarding the State's procedures for dealing with applications for asylum.  It said the concern had been highlighted earlier that year during contributions to the debate in Dáil Éireann on a Private Members' refugee protection Bill.  In her contribution to the debate the then Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, emphasised she would honour that commitment at the earliest opportunity. <Col N="1154" /> This was genuinely meant and she started work on the Refugee Bill almost immediately. The interdepartmental report, which was issued when Fianna Fáil was in Government, also said it was an essential recommendation that the existing administrative arrangements for asylum seekers and refugees should be placed on a statutory footing with the important addition of an appropriate appeals authority.</P>
    <P>I was anxious that the appeals authority should be part of the Bill and I put down an amendment, which was supported by Senator Norris and others, to provide for a suspensive period to the Dublin Convention.  This was incorporated in the Bill and the reason I take this issue so seriously. There have been newspaper reports of a huge influx of refugees in this country and there is increased public awareness that some of the refugees are not seeking political asylum but have travelled across Europe to this country apparently as a result of their favourable impression of our social welfare system.  However, a large number of these refugees have returned to their own countries.</P>
    <P>I and the general public do not fully understand the measures which were recently put in place. They appear to work to the detriment of those who might be seeking political asylum for genuine reasons.  The ministerial order which was put in place is a non-statutory instrument and might involve the refusal of entry to people genuinely seeking political asylum.  Every country has the right to decide under what criteria it will admit aliens.  However, when the Refugee Act was introduced it was not understood by Members of either House of the Oireachtas that the Act might be superseded by ministerial orders, as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the new Minister might, as was suggested by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, suspend the order so the situation could at least be examined.  It appears the non-implementation of relevant sections of the Refugee Act, which are necessary to deal with the administration of refugees, is the reason for the refugee problem in our streets and in the Eastern Health Board rather than anything wrong in the Act.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention will be introduced in September and I am concerned that we are putting another hurdle in the way of those seeking political asylum in Ireland.  After September, will the ministerial order and the Dublin Convention be in place?  Will people be forced to go through the suspensive period of the convention, which we were happy to support, because it prevents asylum seekers or refugees being left in limbo? That was the case for many years and people were sent from one EU country to another.  Will people be dealt with under the Refugee Act? Matters have been complicated enormously by the introduction of the ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Under the new procedures introduced approximately two months ago, people arriving in Ireland from Great Britain or Northern Ireland are in an <Col N="1155" /> invidious position compared to those arriving from another EU country, or a country outside the European Union, because they have an extra hurdle to cross.  I did not realise we would return to the position where a civil servant decided on whether an asylum seeker should be allowed to stay in Ireland.  There appears to be no means by which an applicant is permitted the possibility of presenting his or her case.  It does not appear possible for an applicant to get legal representation or translation services.  The only right an applicant appears to have is to receive a letter from the official, stating that he or she decided the person should not come into the country.  This is not in line with the spirit of the Act, which was supported by all parties and Independents, and it does not correspond to natural justice.</P>
    <P>Why has there been such a delay in the appointment of the refugee applications commissioner? I recall the post was advertised in February and was told interviews took place in May. I do not know if the post was offered to somebody and he or she refused it.  However, this is mid-July and an appointment has not been made. This makes me think there is a certain reluctance in the Department of Justice to implement the will of the Legislature in an Act passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We were most anxious about these areas and I recall the legislation received support from all sides.  Why has this essential part of the Act not been promoted?</P>
    <P>Until that is done, it is almost impossible to put in place the various functional aspects of the Bill which are necessary to prevent the type of scenes which occurred outside the Eastern Health Board offices.  A vast number of people arrived there, some at 7 a.m., but there was not enough staff to deal with them.  There appears to be an enormous lack of communication between the Departments of Justice, Social Welfare and Health with regard to dealing with these people.  This gives the public an appalling impression of turmoil caused by refugees in Ireland and leads to the type of stories which have been published in newspapers recently.  It makes the public feel the influx of refugees must be resisted.  Genuine political asylum seekers may be refused entry due to the lack of will to implement the legislation passed six months ago.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Act is flowing like molasses in January.  This is July and I want to know how far the Minister has moved towards planning the implementation of the legislation. Perhaps he could tell the House what he has done with regard to the refugee commissioner and about the arrangements that have been made at ports to intercept people entering from Great Britain and Northern Ireland who are being treated invidiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this important matter.  Regarding the appointment of a refugee applications commissioner, <Col N="1156" /> an injunction is in place, which was granted by the High Court, in relation to that matter.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment further on it.</P>
      <P>It is important to make a distinction between illegal immigrants and those seeking refugee status.  I will deal first with the issue of immigration. It is important to state there has been considerable public disquiet about the growing problem of illegal immigration into Ireland.  I share that disquiet.  The outgoing Government considered the situation on several occasions over recent months and decided on 25 June that immigration controls should be introduced between Ireland and the UK on 29 June.  The effect of those controls is to introduce into Irish law a requirement that non-EU citizens seeking to enter Ireland from the UK must meet the same entry requirements as non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from any other part of the world.</P>
      <P>Since those controls were introduced about ten days ago, 109 persons have been refused entry to Ireland and returned to the UK.  That so many persons have been refused entry in the first few days indicates the scale of the problem, which has been growing for some time.  I am satisfied the outgoing Government's action was correct even if it was belated.  I also pay tribute to the immigration officers, members of the Garda Síochána, who are operating the new procedure in a discreet and courteous fashion.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of those seeking refugee status, of the 109 refused entry, three applied for refugee status in Ireland.  In these three cases, the matter was considered by an officer of my Department in accordance with arrangements put in place by the outgoing Government and a decision made to return them to the UK.  In accordance with those arrangements, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the UK authorities were notified.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned at the enormous increase in the number of applications for refugee status being made in Ireland in recent months and years and at the evident rising trend in the numbers. For example, of the 2,000 or so applications made this year up to 30 June, nearly 900 were made in May and June.  By comparison, in the whole of 1992, only 39 applications were made. While it is too early to say for certain, there appears to be a link between the refusal of entry to the 109 people to which I referred and a simultaneous drop of more than 50 per cent in the number of persons applying to my Department for refugee status since the new arrangements were made.</P>
      <P>There is a very substantial and worrying backlog of applications for refugee status which must be addressed.  There are now about 2,800 applications on hand.  In fairness to those who have applied, and having regard to the social welfare and other costs involved of about £45 million, a way of dealing speedily with these applications must be found.  I am examining the situation and will bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The need for the new arrangements has been criticised by some and there is public disquiet, which I share.  There is concern about the costs involved.  If we revert to the position which obtained prior to 29 June, the costs next year will be in the order of £110 million.  The outgoing Government realised the consequences of its inaction and took the first steps necessary to deal with the problem.  I want to make it clear that these arrangements meet two objectives: first, stemming illegal immigration and, second ensuring the integrity of Ireland's refugee procedures.</P>
    <P>I repeat for Senators the statement of the outgoing Government's position in a letter of 25 June to the UNHCR, with which I agree:</P>
    <P>The Government is satisfied that these arrangements do not in any way conflict with Ireland's obligations under the 19512 UN Convention or its related Protocolumn Ireland will continue, of course, to examine requests for refugee status from individuals to whom Ireland has obligations.</P>
    <P>Any action taken by this Government will, I assure Senator Henry and the House, be fully in accordance with our international obligations.</P>

      <P>I join the congratulations to the Minister.  She has a very distinguished career behind her and I think has another in front.  I very much look forward to that.  I take very kindly that she took the trouble to come to the House to discuss this important matter.  The <i>Evening Herald</i> also considers this to be an important matter with its headline &ldquo;Hang Luas, there Mary&rdquo;.  The article is very much in favour of the proposal to run Luas underground in the city centre.</P>
      <P>There was a neat piece of political footwork in that immediately I put down this motion the Minister responded with a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a Cabinet meeting that day and it was on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  It looked like an interesting coincidence.  I was hoping it was not a slight on this House.  It has happened in the past that we have been queue jumped for <Col N="1158" /> political reasons.  I very much welcomed the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is useful for me to rehearse everything I said before.  We have had a number of important debates on this issue.  I am sure the Minister has, or will, acquaint herself with what was said in the Seanad.  There was a great deal of technical information.  I was very well briefed by Cormac Rabbitte and Rudi Monaghan who produced the unified proposal idea.  Will the Minister agree to meet them?  I am glad this Minister is in place because I know she is her own woman.  The problem with the previous two Ministers is that they were run by civil servants who are very professional people but they have a monomania about keeping Luas overground.  No matter how we argued, logic was never allowed to prevail even though there was general agreement from all sides of this House that it should be underground.</P>
      <P>People in other political parties like Dr. Garret FitzGerald, whose professional expertise the Minister would have a healthy respect for, magisterially demonstrated that the overground Luas light rail system simply could not shift the required number of people.  It is technically, mathematically impossible to do so whereas the underground can cope with the required numbers. In addition, what we are proposing links into the existing transport networks.  It struck me immediately that it was idiotic not to link-in the airport.</P>
      <P>I would like to add a few new things for the Minister to consider.  I am glad we had the public inquiry.  However, I think we should suspend or adjourn it now for the following reasons.  It is not possible to look objectively at the underground option while simultaneously holding the Luas inquiry.  The Taoiseach's commitment to the residents of Arran Quay Terrace and businesses in that area that when in Government Fianna Fáil would not permit the Luas to drive its destructive way through their area had certain consequences. The current plan has to be withdrawn, resubmitted and go through the same process of statutory periods of objection.  Other rules must be established and public consultation procedures adhered to.  That means we are subverting the public inquiry while it is taking place.</P>
      <P>In addition, the short notice of the date of the public inquiry means securing professional witnesses is problematic.  I received a form, I signed it indicating I would give oral and written testimony. The form contained a slot provided for &ldquo;will you call professional witnesses&rdquo; which I was not in a position to do.  It is difficult to contact people, to arrange to get them to Dublin and so on.  That is also a drawback.  The short notice and time of inquiry means that a number of key objectives will be unavailable because we are in the middle of the summer holidays.  That is a pity. I think it should be adjourned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the new Government's stance on the review of the underground option as set out in the Action Programme for the new Millennium. <Col N="1159" /> I give credit to Fianna Fáil for including this and giving us a commitment on it.  There will be no argument with our partners because I have the same commitment form the Progressive Democrats. The Government will be unified on this.</P>
    <P>I know this Minister is honourable and this is a decent Government.  I believe the Government will stand over its commitment as set out in Dublin &mdash; A Working Document in May 1997 which said that the lack of driving space on our central city streets, the prospect of disfiguring the city centre with tram wires and the unacceptable nightmare of ripping up those core city streets has convinced us we should fully explore the underground option.  If the costings add up over the long term then we think the Luas should on balance go underground in the city centre.  I am convinced the costings do add up.  The cost of putting in the surface connections have been seriously underestimated.  The costings are already starting to go up.  That happened with DART which is very successful but the estimates for the DART were completely out and increased a number of times.  Fianna Fáil is right in saying that to run Luas overground would disfigure the city.  The tunnelling option does not cause disruption because it is not, as the opponents of the unified proposal suggested, a cut and cover operation.  It is a tunnelling operation with a number of bore holes through which the material would be extracted and dumped.  There would be minimal disruption in the city centre.  The Government is correct in divorcing the appraisal of the underground option as proposed by the unified proposal from CIE as it is under instruction from the Department to come up with a scheme to put Luas on-street.  That was its brief.  It cannot be considered independent.  This would be tantamount to Aer Lingus being asked to appraise a scheme put forward by Ryanair.  The supposedly independent report was done by Semaly who are an excellent professional group but they are the ones who will profit from the contracts to put the system in place.  It is simply idiotic to do that.  The last Government believed in transparency.  There was a fair amount of transparency about that. Any idiot could see it was wrong.  That is what I call transparency.  The appraisal should be further divorced from the DOT as they are also proponents of the Luas.  An inspector should be appointed to report directly to the Minister's private secretary.  The inspector should have the power to appoint engineering consultants with experience in tunnelling and should have access to a data bank of information on soil in Dublin. Tunnelling costs can be established.  It is possible to tunnel in Dublin regardless of what the people on the other side say.</P>
    <P>We come then to the question of information to be made available to the public inquiry.  From inquiries to the office of the light rail the following has been established: CIE will only submit selective information to the inquiry; every submission made to the inquiry will be made available. <Col N="1160" /> The implications of this are interesting. First, CIE does not have to submit any information that it does not consider helps its cause. In other words, it promotes the on-street light rail tram.  Secondly this means the whole inquiry is inevitably skewed in CIE's favour.  I know the eminent person chairing CIE is impartial.  I am talking about the whole context in which the inquiry is being held.  Other Government bodies will inevitably, unless they are held in place by firm persons like the Minister, adopt the same approach in an effort to assist CIE.  The public is being denied access to the full information upon which decisions were made.  Professional witnesses will not get access to or knowledge of information vital to their case because CIE will withhold it.  The process is a sham.  CIE will have access to everybody else's information but will retain the privilege of its own information being withheld in any circumstances where it believes it is favourable to a proper examination of the underground option.  The ambiguity over whether people's costs in terms of adequately representing themselves at the tribunal should also be looked at.  This should be done as a matter of urgency so that ordinary people, inexperienced in such matters, can retain professional counsel.  If we are serious about the inquiry, people should be assisted in making their representations.</P>
    <P>There are no environmental reasons the rail system should not go underground.  That would be better because there would be no ripping up of streets.  Contrary to what the Luas PR people say, the underground system mentioned in the unified proposal would be a bored tunnel and completely underground; it would not involve ripping up Grafton Street and there would be no hideous street furniture.  An underground system would provide more opportunities to pedestrianise streets.  People do not amble along tram tracks, as anybody who has been to Amsterdam, Grenoble, Sheffield, Manchester or Melbourne will realise.  I go to Amsterdam from time to time and there is a very high accident rate there.  It is very unsafe to have trams on streets; people get killed.  Luas will permanently take away street space that could be pedestrianised.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is as passionate about the city of Dublin as I am, and that the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, certainly is, because he is a genuine Dubliner and a good northsider like myself, although I am one by adoption.  People are committed to the notion of bringing people back into the heart of the city by providing living accommodation and by pedestrianising the city centre.  In the 1960s the Germans ripped up the trams in Hanover and Stuttgart and put them underground so that they could pedestrianise the streets and they have the most efficient LRT system in Europe.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to also give an undertaking that they will instruct CIE to make public all the information it has relating to the Luas project and all oral, written and electronic information and correspondence generated by the <Col N="1161" /> DOF, DOE, CIE, DTI and DTO when the inquiry starts again.</P>
    <P>It would be particularly good if we had a referendum for the response of the citizens of Dublin. The Luas public relations people have said nobody wants the underground option and have produced selective questionnaires and information. Let us have a full referendum.</P>
    <P>There are no technical reasons an underground system cannot be built in Dublin so the question of costs must be the major stumbling block.  If Calcutta can afford a metro, the &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo; can afford a metro in its capital.  If Newcastle can make one run economically and make a profit, so can we.  If Cork can afford a £100 million tunnel under the River Lee to serve a population of 125,000, then we can afford to service a population of 1.2 million people in the same way.  If they can tunnel under a river in Cork, surely we are not such idiots in Dublin that we do not have the ingenuity of the Cork county engineers.  Every capital city of worth in Europe has a metro.</P>
    <P>On the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme of 8 July, Dr. Garret FitzGerald said it may cost a little more to go underground but we can afford it and the Luas tram is not the appropriate system for Dublin.  There is a Japanese consortium prepared to put this in on a 3 per cent loan over 30 years as long as they get the contract for running it.  I do not believe CIE is in love with the Luas tram but it is intent on building a system, underground or overground, which it and it alone can operate.  If this is not the case, why has it proposed underground systems in the past?  I inform the board of CIE that the underground system Dublin deserves is within its grasp.  It can have it, and with this Minister, I think they will get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for his congratulations.  I hope he has a long future in politics.  I also thank Senator Norris, an old friend from many conversations and debates on education matters when I came to this House in the past, for his good wishes.</P>
      <P>First, I want to scotch any connection between this Adjournment Matter and the announcement on the Cabinet agenda for Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>My suspicions were unworthy and I unhesitatingly withdraw them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They were unworthy but understandable.  Nevertheless, although I am going to Cork this evening, I stayed back to deal with this matter myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read and reread the Senator's passionate discourses on this matter and also listened to many people discuss this while in Opposition.  It is included in the Government programme and was the first issue I put my mind to when I took over my Department.  I do not have a great technical knowledge of many things but I have sound common sense.  It struck me that while there was excellent work done by CIE and the Luas project <Col N="1162" /> on the overground system, there was no objective study done on the underground version.  I had a vision of the streets of Dublin if this project went ahead overground and if it were underground. Both were disturbing, but it seems that this modern beautiful city of 1 million people is now thankfully regaining its elegance, thanks in part to the Senator's passion for the built environment of Dublin, which had become faded.  I want to be the Minister to make the right decision on this matter, unlike the two previous Ministers, who had closed minds and did not want to entertain the idea of looking at something else, which was extraordinary.  The Acting Chairman's party felt strongly about this matter also.</P>
    <P>It is always good to be informed to the greatest possible extent.  I would not be an ally of Dr. Garret FitzGerald, nor would he be one of mine, but, according to him, it seems to me that Luas grew because there was a block of money to be used on a proposal.  I was glad to honour this commitment as quickly as possible as we have to do something about the traffic in the city.</P>
    <P>Since I announced this, high level Opposition Deputies have come to me and said I have done the right thing.  I was amazed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  They were whipped into line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that they were unable to make an indent on the mind of the previous Minister.  There are many people who strongly support a fully on-stream system, though I have not met them yet.</P>
      <P>The debate has centred on issues such as cost, the passenger capacity and the relief of congestion. The planned study will provide an opportunity for an objective, thorough and dispassionate view of those issues.  I acknowledge the valuable contributions which existing studies have made both for and against the proposal.  The Light Rail Project Team and their consultants are very motivated and got very involved in their project. That enthusiasm is a very bright characteristic that should not be undermined.  The commissioning of this study should not be seen as negating or devaluing their work.</P>
      <P>I was speaking to the Taoiseach today on another matter and he asked me to pursue this issue briskly.  That is what I intend to do but we must conform to the EU tendering process and it is important to take the time to evaluate properly.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised some points.  I intend to meet the proponents of the unified proposal.  I do not have the power to suspend a public inquiry but my Department has been in touch with Mr. Justice O'Leary.  I understand there will be discussions within the next few days and I would not like to pre-empt them.  I am in favour of sharing information submitted.  It is only by doing so that we will reach a proper conclusion to this debate. I read the unified proposal and have read material on file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> I am glad of this formal occasion to make the proposal public, although what we will do has been in the public domain.  It is proper that such an important matter is raised in one House of the Oireachtas.  Although the citizens of Dublin are those most intrinsically influenced by and interested in this matter, it also concerns people who use Dublin which is the capital city, of which we are proud, and the centre of much administration in terms of Government, law and so on. I wish to keep this city fair for its citizens, those who use it and visitors.  Future generations will <Col N="1164" /> decide if we made the right decision.  I am glad we commissioned this study and trust it will be carried out quickly and properly and that the end result will mean future generations will say the right decision was taken in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister included compliments to the Luas team, which is very bright and energetic.  We do not propose scrapping the project but modifying it.  I am grateful for the Minister's clear, specific and welcome response.</P>
