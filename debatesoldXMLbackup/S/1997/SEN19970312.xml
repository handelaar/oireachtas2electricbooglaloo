      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction and provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Reynolds of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding in 1997 for the Drumkeerin/Manorhamilton/Dromohair water supply scheme and Lurganboy sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to sanction the new school project for Gaelscoil Mhichíl Cíosóg, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kelleher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint the necessary technical staff to ensure that Gaelscoil Peig Sayers, Cork, proceeds.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Fahey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to confirm that Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh will go to tender and commence construction in 1997.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the proposed extension of <Col N="694" /> the Tallaght regional technical college given the serious problems of overcrowding in the college.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Maloney of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to explain why transit vans which have been imported legally into Donegal should be seized by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator Finneran and Senator Daly and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will be taken until 1 p.m. and there will be sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  Item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. and item 3 from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  If item 2 has not concluded by 6 p.m. it will be taken again from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader outline arrangements until Easter so that everybody can try to keep up with the Government's intentions? Today Members will have noted with concern that workers in TEAM Aer Lingus plan to strike again.  This company has come through a turbulent number of years and I ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Government to do all they can to ensure this matter is brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we have the opportunity to debate the question of zero tolerance of crime which has recently been raised?  It is important we have such a debate on this sensitive issue.  I refer to the situation in the inner city where drunken youths pour out of public houses and night clubs night after night.  They urinate in public, vomit and cause nuisance and noise.  I reported this matter many times to the police but I am told to make notes and object to the granting of licences.  I would like the Garda and the courts to take this matter seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was raised on Pat Kenny's radio show yesterday.  Somebody purpoting to be a garda rang in to say that if we had zero tolerance of crime gardaí would have to caution people and perhaps arrest them for insignificant matters such as public urination.  Last Saturday night and early Sunday morning I walked around, as I was told to by the Garda, and saw a line of four young <Col N="695" /> men openly urinating against a shop window about ten yards from O'Connell Street.  Is this the type of behaviour we wish to tolerate in the capital city?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to debate the report of the hepatitis C tribunal?  Many important issues arise in the report which we should consider. Emerging from the report is what is described as institutional arrogance which seems to be characteristic of these institutions which believe people cannot be trusted with information and that the ordinary peasants, as they would see them, are somehow not entitled to be told the facts.</P>
      <P>The BTSB report has been referred to the DPP.  It might also be appropriate to refer it to the Commissioner of the Garda Siochána.  The collection of evidence is not a matter for the DPP but for the commissioner.  Who is to be held accountable for the appalling events which have taken place under the BTSB?  Justice Finlay is to be congratulated.  This incident demonstrates that tribunals can be held expeditiously without costing a great deal of money.</P>
      <P>The chairperson of Positive Action was the only member of that group to receive a copy of the report.  Surely anyone infected with hepatitis C who wishes should also receive a copy.  This would not add significantly to the cost.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate week to have statements on the Irish Horse Racing Authority.  How many of the experts will be in the House this evening to discuss this important matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relieved to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a debate on the report into the BTSB.  I welcome its referral to the DPP even though that may make it inappropriate to discuss certain parts of the report. However, there are aspects of the report which we could debate, in particular, the lessons which can be drawn concerning the monitoring and supervision of a body such as the BTSB.  The report contains a number of recommendations in this regard.  It calls for the establishment of a blood services consumer council, the publication of biannual reports and a structure for investigating suspicions where they arise.  There may be other institutions of State which require similar observation and public accountability.  If there are, we should not wait until it is too late as happened in the case of the BTSB.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a wider circulation of the report.  Senators have received a copy, unlike many of the women directly involved.  There are logistical problems but it is important that Senators' concerns about the circulation should be made public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Salmon River Council Bill has been laid before the House would the Leader provide Government time for its introduction and statements on the Bill next week?</P>
      <P>I do not feel competent or qualified to express any observations on the BTSB report which would reflect the views of the women in Positive Action.  We do not wish to make a political issue of this matter.  When we debate this issue would the Leader invite representatives of Positive Action to speak for themselves?  We have invited other people to speak in the Seanad.  In view of the feelings which these women have expressed and the fact that the rest of us are inadequate, it would be appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Would the Leader consider referring this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that these women could convey their views on a matter of vital interest for them?  If not enough copies of the report have been made available to Positive Action, surely the copies in the Oireachtas could be made available to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator Norris's observations on urination. Young men were urinating in weird places 50, 60, 70 and 80 years ago.  It would take a police force of a minimum of 500,000 to tackle this because these people do not give notice they will urinate at a given time in a given place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a good idea where it is going to happen.  It occurs between the hours of 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. and, if there were a few policemen at Fibber Magee's, P.J. McGrath's, Rumours nightclub and the Back Gate at these times, much of the problem would be solved.  I cannot speak for Belfast but I have no doubt they urinate all over each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>The time to get excited about urinating against a wall in the street was in the 1960s when discos were set up and the authorities thought nothing about feeding drink to young people of 12, 13 and 14 years of age.  The Senator is 30 years too late with his complaints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>My point concerns the Control of Horse Act, 1996, and efforts made by two individuals who gave their time freely and gladly and took an interest in the Cherry Orchard area. <Col N="697" /> They are Kevin Smith, a management consultant, and Eddie Harty, a highly respected member of the horse training industry.  They have spent many months trying to introduce some routine and form into the care of horses and introducing young people to a sense of responsibility.  They asked for funds from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and were told&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that matter was raised on the Adjournment last week.  Perhaps the Senator might incorporate it in his contribution to this evening's debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that gladly.  Two Ministers attempted to get this money from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry without success.  I hope this matter will be examined again.  Control of horses does not fit in with what I want to say tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions for the Leader of the House on today's Order of Business.  The Committee and Final Stages of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill, 1996, were meant to be taken today.  I want to confirm that only Committee Stage will be taken.  Is it the intention to take all Stages of the Employment Equality Bill today rather than just Committee Stage?  That would not be the right thing to do. There should be a gap between Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      <P>Will it be possible to find time soon for a discussion about Dublin traffic?  I mention this because sides are already being taken on the National Distribution Centre in Clondalkin announced yesterday.  This has an important role to play when we are looking at the problem of city traffic, particularly as Luas is being discussed at the same time and there is a possibility of some city centre streets being closed when the tunnel option is being considered.  Will the Leader find time to discuss Dublin traffic, especially with regard to the National Distribution Centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Marine to come to the House to discuss a very important matter.  Fisherman Danny &ldquo;Boy&rdquo; O'Driscoll died tragically at sea.  We should extend our sympathy to his mother, girlfriend and family on their great loss.  The tragedy is under Garda investigation and I do not want to say any more about it.  The question of net cutting and bullying at sea must be discussed in this House as well as such matters as quotas and the renewal of our fishing fleet.  We need a full discussion of this issue so that matters relating to the EU, fishing and Ireland can be highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Calnan in calling for a debate on fishing and the treatment of our fishermen.  I ask the Leader for a debate on the new agency set up a week ago on rural Ireland.  This agency and procedures for development in rural Ireland should be debated with the <Col N="698" /> Minister.  Some time ago I was taken aback when an agency for the west was established, which excluded Clare and Kerry.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, intervened, Clare was included but Kerry is omitted from everything. The Neodata factory in Kerry closed recently with the loss of 105 jobs.  Had this happened anywhere else&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator looking for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling for a debate on this agency because I want to know why none of the thousands of jobs being created are going to Kerry where unemployment is alarmingly high.  Is Kerry to be excluded from the new agency as it was from the previous one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the report of the hepatitis C inquiry, it is some consolation &mdash; if one could call it that &mdash; to Positive Action that the report is being referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The extensive use of closed circuit television and internal video cameras has resulted in strike action being served on a company using internal video cameras in Youghal.  The Leader should ask the Minister with responsibility for this area if it is intended to introduce legislation or regulations governing the use of such equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from an exchange between the Leader and Senator Wright that Report Stage of the Employment Equality Bill would possibly be taken this evening.  Senator Quinn has the same impression and I echo his concern.  Senators concerned with this legislation would oppose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the continued detention of Roisín McAliskey.  I visited her last Friday with a Labour Party delegation and she wanted me to express her deep satisfaction with the Irish public and politicians for taking an interest in her case. We all welcome her recategorisation last Friday, which was a step in the right direction.  This House should consider a debate on the detention of Irish prisoners in English jails as soon as possible. <Col N="699" /> Such a debate would give people an opportunity to express their feelings not just on the Roisín McAliskey case but on cases of other Irish prisoners being held on extremely flimsy evidence and on the whim of probably the cruellest Home Office Minister in many years.  Easter is coming, an important time in Irish history, and before or after Easter would be appropriate for such a debate.  These people played a major role in the Peace Process and now feel they are forgotten. A full debate on this matter should be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we debate the two tax systems in the Border counties?  The Minister for Finance has met deputations about this issue on at least two occasions.  This issue will always be raised before an election, as happened before the by-election in Donegal.  It is now being raised again.  Thousands of people live on one side of the Border and work on the other.  This is not unique &mdash; there are Border region workers all over Europe.  However, we have put this issue on the long finger.  It is important to establish clarity by having a debate in the House.</P>
      <P>Every matter raised in this House this morning is important.  However, the working section of the community is entitled to be told where it stands on an important matter of taxation but we have dragged our feet for a number of years.  The matter becomes a political issue at every election.  I want it cleared up once and for all and the political element removed.  The workers are not getting a fair crack at the whip.</P>

      <P>I want to raise another matter of paramount interest to my county.  The deflector system supplies television reception to thousands of homes.  I ask for a debate on the issue because the national television service subsidised by the taxpayer is not available in a large part of this county.  Why should advantage be given to someone who is charging a ransom while a deflector system is provided?</P>

      <P>I join Senator Calnan in expressing sympathy to the family and relatives of the late Dan O'Driscoll who lost his life in the tragic fishing incident last weekend.  I compliment the Minister for the Marine for setting up a speedy inquiry into the affair.  Will the Leader draw the attention of the Minister to the practice of British registered Spanish vessels fishing in Irish waters?  An obvious effort is being made to deplete Irish stocks by quota hopping and the Minister might raise the issue at the Council of Ministers.  The practice which led to this incident has been utilised for a number of years and it raises serious fears for people involved in the fishing industry off the south-west coast.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader ask the Minister for Education for information on the final list of approvals for work on new primary schools this year?  The Minister has identified a number of new primary schools which will be built this year but a number of projects are waiting to go to tender.  One of those is the new Gaelscoil in Ennis where there has already been a strike and about which there will be picketing at the gates of Leinster House today. The Minister can clarify the matter by identifying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the first item of Business for today, I feel a certain irritation about this matter.  Following consultation with the representative of the Independent Senators, it was intended to take all Stages of item 2 today.  He said it would be a good idea and he had no difficulty with the arrangement.  On that basis, I arranged with the Minister to take all Stages today.  There would be a sos, if necessary, between Committee and Report Stages.  It is irritating to be told by two Members of the same group that this arrangement is unacceptable, even though it was agreed last week.  I will discuss the matter with the Members after the Order of Business and if they object to Report Stage being taken, it will not be taken.  I wish Members would get their thinking clear on these matters.</P>

It would be inappropriate to have a debate on the matter pending the outcome of the Garda investigation which I understand is taking place at speed.  As soon as that is completed we can see revisit the matter.</P>

The matter of deflectors was discussed here two weeks ago.  Senator McGowan has an excellent record of attendance and I am the first to acknowledge that.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 41, after &ldquo;Schedule&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and in this Act referred to as the New Docks&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to submit a short title for the development in question, both for the area itself and for the authority which will be the subject of later amendment.  I do not have a preference for a particular title.  Suggestions such as <Col N="704" />&ldquo;Liffeyside&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dockside&rdquo; have been put forward. I tabled the amendment to facilitate discussion on the matter.  It would be desirable to have a short, snappy title such as &ldquo;the New Docks&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on Second Stage.  In the interest of helping the authority to market itself in the most business like manner we have to find some way of shortening the name. When I was with An Post it was called &ldquo;An Bord Poist&rdquo;.  It seemed an impossible name for an organisation.  We gave much thought to the name and came up with &ldquo;An Post&rdquo; which did not need to be translated.  I look back on that with a feeling of success as it was accepted and adopted very easily.</P>
      <P>The reason for putting down amendments was to help the authority.  One of the problems with a long name is that it tends to be shortened to its initials.  I do not know how that can be done with &ldquo;Dublin Docklands Development Authority&rdquo;: The initials would be unpronounceable.</P>
      <P>We should remove &ldquo;development&rdquo; from the title in both the Irish and English versions.  What is wrong with the &ldquo;Dublin Docklands Authority&rdquo;? It is far less of a mouthful.  An equally acceptable term would be &ldquo;Dublin Docklands Development&rdquo;.  Perhaps we can shorten it even more.</P>
      <P>The Irish version of the name has an extra word which is quite unnecessary.  There is no need for &ldquo;Baile&rdquo;.  I checked this with Dublin Corporation. In Irish it is &ldquo;Barda Átha Cliath&rdquo; and they are adamant that that is correct.  &ldquo;Bardas Baile Átha Cliath&rdquo; would mean Dublin City Corporation.</P>
      <P>There is just one docklands in Dublin.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on this effort at making sure that the authority is more marketable, pronounceable and more likely to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I agree with Senator Quinn.  It is a matter of common sense.  I am not sure about &ldquo;the New Docks&rdquo; proposed by Senator Daly because the area is 1,500 acres and it encompasses more than the docks, even though the focus is the Liffey. The development in Belfast was called &ldquo;Laganside&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a 15 year programme and the name should be simple because we are looking at an international as well as a national market. Senator Quinn gave the very good example of An Post.  Everybody knows what is being spoken about when An Post is mentioned.  We need a simple title which conveys the process that is underway.  Perhaps &ldquo;Liffeyside&rdquo; would be appropriate as the common thread is the Liffey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage Senator Quinn expressed the view that the title of the new authority was cumbersome and that a <Col N="705" /> shorter, more user friendly title should be found. Other Senators expressed similar concerns.  In the light of these comments we have considered the matter again.</P>
      <P>Although the title may be cumbersome I am still in favour of keeping the Dublin Docklands Development Authority as the authorities' formal title.  However, I sympathise with the Senators' point that this title may be too cumbersome for the authority to use in its everyday work.  I am accordingly proposing amendment No. 8 thus allowing the authority adopt a business name in accordance with the provisions of the Registration of Business Names Act, 1963.  This will place the authority in a similar position to many other entities who have a formal, corporate title but carry on business under a different name.</P>
      <P>If we are to provide for the authority to have a business name, we should leave it to the authority itself to agree on the name and to submit it for ministerial approval in due course prior to registration. This will enable the authority to take the necessary time to canvass widely and will ensure a sense of ownership by the authority of the name ultimately used.  While I am grateful to Senators Daly and Quinn for suggesting alternative names for the authority, I hope they will agree to withdraw their amendments in favour of mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain things which a committee of the House should not attempt, including devising names, and the Minister of State's amendment is an attempt to address this. It is important that we do not impose a name that is difficult to use, even in the legal or long-term sense.  The Minister of State's intentions are in the right direction and I have no difficulty in regarding the registration of business names as the correct way to establish a bright, marketing and attractive name for the new organisation.</P>
      <P>We are attempting to put life into this area.  It is a worthy objective.  The name will be important and if the organisation is straddled with a cumbersome name, even in legal terms, it will present a recurring difficulty.  I am happy to withdraw my amendments in favour of amendment No. 8.</P>

      <P>I also accept the Minister of State's position.  The purpose of my amendments was to devise a way of providing a short title to ensure that the area would be readily identifiable, especially by tourists and visitors to the city.  This will be a rejuvenated area and amendment No. 1 attempts to make it clear that it is a new development in what was the old docks system.  While the &ldquo;New Docks Authority&rdquo;, or &ldquo;NDA&rdquo;, would be an apt description, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody would agree that the overall development of this concept will be expensive.  Apart from tax incentives and other initiatives to promote and develop the area, I am sure specific Exchequer funding will be provided to enable the project get underway.  Has any consideration been given to the type of funding that will be required?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be helpful but that is a matter that must be addressed in the master plan.  It is not appropriate at this stage to cite figures.  The master plan is part and parcel of this project and it will give a clear idea of costs. The commitment is defined clearly in section 10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government announced yesterday the decision to demolish the tower blocks at Ballymun and replace them with a new development and it gave figures for costs &mdash; about £178 million.  I note that this is not necessarily the section on which to raise this point but the public would like a broad indication of the overall costs of the docklands project for the first few years.  I will not insist on specific figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the original docklands task force which set the parameters for the master plan.  The ownership of the land there is in the private sector and the State or semi-State sector.  Given the commercial remit of the semi-State sector I expect it to play a pivotal role in conjunction with the private sector.  If people expect a Temple Bar Mark II they will be disappointed. Waterside developments sell off the plans.  The project will have to be tax driven to some degree but I am sure it will be targeted to encourage specific types of development.  With the private sector, the public sector and Government involvement through tax incentives, there will be a tripartite approach which will involve the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point giving the Senator an indication of costs if they are not accurate.  At this point, prior to the master plan being drawn up, it would be premature to give an estimate.  This is a standard provision which allows for the expenses.  The Senator will have to be reasonable and accept that the master plan must be drawn up first.  The Ballymun project is a different case because it is defined clearly and a considerable amount of assessment has been carried out on specific technical and construction matters.  We have an estimate of costs for the Ballymun project but it is a different type of project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements involved &mdash; the cost to the Exchequer of the overall concept and the provisions in the section which covers the setting up of the authority.  Are there figures for <Col N="707" /> this latter element?  Before giving approval I am sure the Minister for Finance looked carefully at the costs of establishing the authority and fulfilling the provisions in the Bill.  I am prepared to waive my request for an indication of the costs of the overall project, although I am sure the Minister of State must have an idea of the likely costs. However, she must have definite figures for the likely expenditure on the administration of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no additional costs in terms of the authority itself because it is replacing the Custom House Docks Development Authority and will use its staff and accommodation.  I can get the Senator accurate figures on the cost of that but I understand it is approximately £1 million.  Additional funding will not be required at this stage but there might be funding requirements in the future.  The original structure, the Custom House Docks Development Authority, is already being funded and this new structure will draw on those resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the reason I am asking this is that substantial Government funding was provided to enable the Custom House Docks Development Authority to undertake its work and that money was to be paid back by the authority to the Government.  The taxpayer is going to have to foot the bill for much of this.  Is there any provision to protect the taxpayer if huge revenues accrue to this authority?  According to the initial task force report, the Custom House Docks Development Authority has still to repay substantial funds to the State.  That situation needs to be examined, especially in the light of the developments which will take place under this Bill.  Will the taxpayer who will provide the initial finance be in a position to recoup some of these funds when the concept is successfully operating and making substantial amounts of money, perhaps millions of pounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We are straying from the Bill.  I assure the Senator that repayments are being made and that the authority is self-financing in relation to this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is that it has far more funding than it has to pay back.  Initially it received funding which it did not have to pay back; it only had to pay back some of the funding.  If the Minister of State cannot follow what I am trying to <Col N="708" /> say there is no point in pursuing the matter. When the new authority begins to operate it will need substantial Government funding to enable the project to get off the ground.  If that is funded in the same way as the Custom House Docks Development Authority, some of the funding will be clawed back from the authority when it begins to make money.  Will the financing be provided on the same basis as that provided for the Custom House Docks Development Authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Custom House Docks Development Authority will be subsumed into what will, essentially, be a brand new authority.  The infrastructure and the cash will all come together under the new authority. The seven executive members will take control of the Custom House and the docks and will be the dock authority.  I am trying to be helpful because, as I said last week, 8 a.m. meetings tend to sharpen the mind and this was part of the overall discussion at that meeting.  The infrastructure already exists and will be new only in so far as the personnel and remit are concerned.  The matters which concern Senator Daly are all in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat myself. It has been clarified that the authority is being subsumed and is self-financing.  It is making repayments and will continue to do so.  This is a standard provision should a need arise.  We should not pre-empt the master plan by making future projections rather than including an enabling provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If matters are not clarified, we cannot complain if mistakes are made in the future. The Custom House Docks Development Authority received substantial funding when it was established.  I do not have the precise figures regarding Government financial injections but I am sure the Minister has them.  The authority repaid a certain amount of those funds but I am not sure it repaid the total amount or if it was required to do so.  However, the authority has made substantially more money than was originally envisaged.  I may be incorrect but the problem will be solved if the Minister provides precise figures.  I am trying to avoid a position where the Government advances substantial funds to the new authority to get it up and running but is unable to claw back the full amount although the authority may make substantial amounts of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to the Custom House Docks Development Authority.  The Senator is raising a red herring.  The original funding provided to the authority is being repaid and will continue to be repaid.  The Custom House Docks Development Authority is self-financing and there is no requirement for major funding to set up the new authority.  That is not the expectation.  The Bill includes an enabling provision for a certain approach but we cannot <Col N="709" /> pre-empt the requirements of the master plan.  It is not the case that money will be thrown at an authority without an expectation of a return and anybody who presumes that does not understand the ethos or principle underlying the authority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  The Chairperson shall be a person who in the opinion of the Minister has a knowledge, expertise and experience in matters connected with the management, development and operation of similar type projects.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to set down guidelines regarding the qualifications of the chairperson of the authority.  While I am sure the Minister in her wisdom will appoint the best possible person, anybody could be appointed in the absence of defined qualifications.  The amendment seeks to ensure that the chairperson would have the qualifications of experience, knowledge and expertise for the position.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the constructive intention of Senator Daly's amendment, I do not wish to unduly narrow the range of experience and expertise from which the person to be appointed as the chairperson of the authority will be chosen.  In considering the appointment of a <Col N="710" /> chairperson, a broad base of experience and expertise will be sought which will enable the person appointed to fulfil the chairperson's duty set down in section 19 to ensure the efficient discharge of the business of the authority in addition to the capacity and drive to deliver this major project.  However, there is no need to specify this in legislation.  It will be for the Minister of the day to ensure that a chairperson who meets the criteria I mentioned is appointed.  Accordingly, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I appear to be in the minority.  If the House is satisfied the amendment is unnecessary, I will not press it.  However, another important office was filled recently and I wonder whether the same position could arise in this case.  Last year, following lengthy and detailed discussion, a number of harbour authorities were appointed. The chairman of one of the authorities is a civil servant who was an employee of a semi-State organisation.  I have no difficulty with the person involved, who is eminent and highly qualified. However, the chairperson of the new authority could be an employee of the Custom House Docks centre or a semi-State body.  Is that practice desirable?  I am raising the point because an executive of a semi-State body was recently appointed chairman of a new port authority.  I have no objection to that individual but it is probably undesirable to appoint executives of semi-State bodies as chairpersons of boards.</P>

      <P>The requirement nowadays is to secure the best talent for positions.  It is wrong to set down criteria which are too narrow and which may exclude people from positions.  If people are kept on tracks and cannot move from the public to the private sector or from different areas of expertise, there is a danger that talent will be lost or will not be used most effectively.  We need to ensure that the best person ultimately gets the job.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 39 to 49, and in page 13, lines 1 to 5, to delete paragraphs (a) and (c) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) local organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are concerned with, or are representative of persons engaged in the promotion or the carrying out of small business, including manufacturing, retail, services and other local economic development in the Dublin Docklands Area,</P>
      <P>(b)  community network organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are concerned with existing local community development in the Dublin Docklands Area or with the promotion of the social, economic, finance, culture, health, sport or general interests of communities in that Area,</P>
      <P>(c)  non profit organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are concerned with the local environment, conservation of the architectural and natural heritage and sustainable use and improvement of the built and natural environment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House, not that she needs very much of a welcome.  Coming from the political background that she does, I am <Col N="712" /> sure she will find herself in sympathy with the general tenor of the amendments which I have put down.  I will confine my contribution to amendments Nos. 11 and 19 which are in my name and I will make a glancing reference to amendment No. 21.  I seconded Senator Quinn's important amendment regarding the inclusion of a member of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is no real conflict between what the Minister has already encompassed in the Bill at this point and what I am suggesting.  It is clear to me that the Minister wishes to include representatives from the local area and from various community oriented groups.  That is the common purpose we share.</P>
    <P>These amendments are important to me because they came about as a result of consultation with the very groups whom the Minister seeks to import into the Bill herself.  If these groups feel strongly that this is the way to maximise their contribution, it is incumbent on the Minister to look at what they are suggesting rather than impose something from the top down. It is an important part of the democratic process that the wishes of the people, who are in the process of being generally included in the docklands authority, should be taken into account.  There is no conflict between the Minister's aim and that of these groups.  The fact that these amendments have been prepared for, and suggested to me, by these very groups suggests that they should, at least, be carefully considered.  They do not contradict anything the Minister is proposing.  They focus very clearly on the kind of community involvement and expertise that is desired and on the kind of people who shall be included in the docklands authority.  For example, in paragraph (a) of amendment No. 11 &ldquo;...persons engaged in the promotion or the carrying out of small business, including manufacturing, retail, services and other local economic development in the Dublin Docklands Area&rdquo; are specified.</P>
    <P>If one considers the Temple Bar development, which has been very successful, there are some inbuilt problematic areas in that situation because money was poured in from the top.  Much of that money has done a great deal of good, but I am not sure how sustainable it is in the long-term because it did not take into account the interests of the existing small business and communities who are being squeezed out of the area at the moment.  It is regrettable that in spite of the great success of Temple Bar, for which I am very happy, the organic quality of that area is in danger of being substantially diluted.  By including a paragraph detailing the promotion of small businesses, manufacturing and so on, we would make specific something I am sure the Minister would find herself in sympathy with.  The same applies with regard to the community network organisations; the very people whom the Minister wishes to introduce into participation have sought to assist the Minister in focusing in on precisely what kind of organisations there are and what <Col N="713" /> kind of need there is.  I welcome the Minister's wish to include these people.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) these groups have given itemised instances of &ldquo;...the promotion of the social, economic, finance, culture, health, sport or general interest of communities in that Area&rdquo;.  I would find it difficult to argue with the ideas behind that, virtually every area of interest is covered and specified and it does not conflict with the Minister's wishes.  In paragraph (c) the groups have expressed a desire for the inclusion of &ldquo;non profit organisations which, in the opinion of the Minister, are concerned with the local environment, conservation of the architectural and natural heritage and sustainable use and improvement of the built and natural environment&rdquo;.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on this.  It may be that the precise wording is not considered appropriate by the Minister and her advisers but I am sure &mdash; if I may use a word which has been bandied about this House recently &mdash; the &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; of that paragraph will recommend itself to both the Minister and her advisers.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 is related to No. 11 and simply specifies where and what number of people, if No. 11 is accepted, shall be appointed in this manner.  I shall leave amendment No. 21 to my colleague, Senator Quinn, as it is in his name.  I will be supporting him strongly.  I have worked with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce over many years and I think they have done a lot of extremely good work for the city.  I think I am correct in saying that in a sense they emerged from the eighteenth century docklands when they were formed in response to the Ouzel Galley.  I am sure Senator Quinn may want to elaborate on that and I do not wish to steal his thunder.  I will be supporting his amendment that a representative of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce be included on the authority which, for historical and practical reasons, seems to be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for not welcoming the Minister to the House earlier.  She is very welcome, as is the Bill.  As Senators Norris and Daly have made clear, we are attempting to help the Minister to improve this Bill and tweak it if necessary to ensure that it works well.  I have always had a problem with the hands of an authority being tied by stipulating that they must have representatives of various bodies on their council. To a certain extent, I find it difficult to say that a council must have representatives.  I prefer to use the word &ldquo;reflect&rdquo;; councils should include &ldquo;people who reflect the views of...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am horrified at the very thought of a 25 person council.  It seems very difficult and unwieldy. Rather than cover all of my amendments together at this stage, I would like the Minister to respond to the strong case made by Senator Norris in regard to amendment No. 11.  Senator Norris has made the case for local representation and seeks to ensure that there would be such representation. He has included three different groups of <Col N="714" /> local representatives.  If this is going to work, it is essential that it reflects the views of many different inputs.  We have to support the case Senator Norris has made.  I would like to come back separately on each of my other amendments rather than covering them all together.  At this stage I would like to support Senator Norris in his objectives and I am sure the Minister will support them.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 12 proposes to insert the following subparagraph: &ldquo;(iii) one member shall be so appointed from among the officers of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who are established civil servants for the purposes of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The Bill provides for the appointment of two civil servants to the council, one from the Department of the Environment and the other from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Nobody from the Department of Enterprise and Employment will be appointed to an authority which will be concerned with economic regeneration.  This omission highlights a major flaw in the Bill, which is conceived by people who think in terms of local government and not economic regeneration.  The Bill reeks of a mind-set which is a long way from what the docklands need.  If there is a case for appointing civil servants to the council &mdash; I have no problem with that &mdash; to omit the Department of Enterprise and Employment is like staging Hamlet without the prince.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 propose to replace Bord Gáis Éireann with Forbairt and the ESB with IDA Ireland.  My aim is to focus on the future rather than on the past.  Bord Gáis owns a considerable amount of property in the area comprising a large derelict site where the gasometers were located.  There is a problem of contamination on this site and it will cost a small fortune to decontaminate it and make it suitable for other uses.  Bord Gáis' role is to clean up the site and get rid of it.  It has no future use for the site as part of its business since it is not a property developer. Bord Gáis should not be a property developer <Col N="715" /> or an investor in property because it needs to invest in its own industry.  Bord Gáis should get on with the job it has to do, which means getting out of the docklands as soon as possible.  It has no future in the docklands and has no place on an authority which is guiding the economic regeneration of the area.</P>
    <P>I propose to replace the Bord Gáis representative with one from Forbairt.  Forbairt is responsible for economic regeneration and for developing indigenous industries.  Not only is it madness not to have a representative from the Department of Enterprise and Employment on the council but it is madness on stilts not to directly involve Forbairt, which could stimulate new industry in the area.  The authority has a greater need for a representative from Forbairt than from Bord Gáis Éireann.  I am talking about the future rather than the past.  Fobairt is the future while Bord Gáis is the past in this instance since its involvement only comes about because it owns derelict sites.</P>
    <P>I would make a broadly similar argument as regards the ESB, which owns property in the area.  I do not see it as an engine of economic regeneration or making a worthwhile contribution to the authority's deliberations, certainly not to the extent of appointing a representative to the council.  The ESB is in a different situation to CIE, which is properly represented under the present proposal.  Traffic problems are at the heart of the challenges facing the docklands.  CIE is also the holder of a considerable amount of property which is ripe for development, but the same does not apply to the ESB.  Whoever dreamed up this subsection operates under the principle of rounding up the usual suspects even if they have no future in the area.</P>
    <P>Instead of appointing a representative from the ESB, it would be more useful to appoint one from IDA Ireland.  Just as Forbairt can help develop indigenous industries in the area, IDA Ireland can help attract overseas investors to locate there. Appointing such a representative to the council would ensure direct involvement by IDA Ireland and that it would be high on its priority list of locations.  I wonder about the mind which contemplated appointing Bord Gáis and the ESB to the council while at the same time ignoring Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  It makes me wonder if these people have heard of Forbairt or IDA Ireland.  If not, it is time they did.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 adds a further member to the already unwieldy council.  However, it is a member who cannot be done without, and I spoke about this matter on Second Stage.  The creators of the Bill have ignored the tourism and leisure potential of the docklands area.  I do not know if they have a dream of turning the docklands area into a gigantic international financial centre.  If so, it is a pipedream.  Whatever the master plan comes up with, it is inevitable that leisure and tourism will be identified as a major part of the area's future potential.  Every Tom, Dick and <Col N="716" /> Harry is represented on the council, but there is no mention of tourism.  It makes me wonder about the type of world in which those who dreamed up this Bill are living.  There is no way we can fill this area with financial institutions &mdash; a large proportion of leisure and tourism activities is required.</P>
    <P>We can make the docklands a central part of Dublin's tourism offering and attractive to visitors and Dubliners.  Tourism and leisure can be to the docklands what financial services were to the Custom House scheme.  The first step towards achieving that would be to appoint to the council the head of Dublin Tourism or perhaps Bord Fáilte, because maybe this is a national rather than a city effort.  Tourism and leisure must be represented if we are serious about this.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 proposes that the Provost of Trinity College or an officer of the college nominated by the Provost be appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment brings me back to economic regeneration.  There is an overriding need to create new jobs in the docklands area and encourage companies to set up there.  A prime source of these companies can be Trinity College. In America and increasingly in parts of Europe, universities are becoming economic powerhouses and are using their cutting edge knowledge of technology to spawn new high-tech start ups with close links to the research resources in the colleges. Trinity College is heavily involved in the business of creating campus companies but cannot locate them all on the campus.  It has an interest in having them as close to the campus as possible.  Any plan for the docklands will have as its aim that the area is designated by Trinity College as the site for its campus companies.  Trinity is already thinking in this way and we should encourage it to continue to do so and the best way to do this is to involve it directly by giving it a seat on the council.</P>
      <P>Initially, most campus companies are very small; normally they are high tech companies of the future and those that succeed can become very large.  We have seen examples of this.  The docklands offer a location where small companies can grow without having to move.  If we think about the source of potential jobs we will realise that Trinity College should be at the heart of the docklands scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the docklands will come, to a large extent, from a large number of small, private businesses which will create, innovate and generate business.  However, we are in danger of <Col N="717" /> assuming that this is a local authority.  If we omit the chamber of commerce we are suggesting that this development can be run by a centralised structure.  There is an urgent need to create an individual, enterprising mindset on the council. That will come about by ensuring representation for the chamber of commerce.</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe that this scheme was conceived without considering representation for the chamber of commerce.  The Minister will say that this will be taken into account.  However, I am worried by the mindset which offers representation to companies like Bord Gáis and the ESB yet does not include the chamber of commerce.  I am proposing representation for the chamber of commerce knowing that this scheme will only succeed if there is significant input from the private sector.  The chamber of commerce has represented private enterprise since the Ouzel Galley 250 years ago.  It is one of the successful representative bodies in the city and the Minister should ensure that it is represented on the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I agree with much of what Senator Quinn proposes.  However, I disagree with him on this issue.  I understand the ethos from which he comes but, to a large extent, he is trying to exclude the public sector.  The State is one of the major players in this 1,500 acre site. Senator Quinn has consistently urged the State sector to become commercial.  There is nothing wrong with CIE becoming involved in joint ventures with the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the undue emphasis on the triumphs of the private sector.  We would still be burning candles if we were waiting for the private sector to establish the ESB.  Similarly, we would be travelling around on donkeys and carts waiting for the development of a transport system. The private sector tried and failed in these areas.  Let us give credit where it is due.  State bodies in the docklands area are major players and their job is to maximise their assets on behalf of their company and, in turn, the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the chamber of commerce but he did not mention the Dublin Trades Council which represents hundreds of thousands of people.  Why should we appoint someone from the chamber of commerce to the council and ignore the trade union movement or congress? This is a tremendous commercial opportunity for the State.  It should take advantage of this opportunity and not simply sell sites to the private sector at less than their commercial value.  State companies <Col N="718" /> should be involved in successful joint ventures.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also mentioned Departments, such as the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  That is the key Department in this area so it makes sense to have it represented on the council.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has taken control of the entire waterways system.  The inner and outer basins in Ringsend and the canals, including Spencer Dock, are central to the development of the docklands.  This makes that Department a major player.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is, potentially, a major player in the area because of the involvement of companies such as an Bord Gáis and CIE.  Someone seemed to assume that the Bord Gáis site could be handed over to the private sector for buttons.  We know the developers on Laganside have coped with detoxifying the site in relation to the Belfast gas industry.  Senator Quinn is a fair minded man.  However, this is a case where the State sector, exercising its commercial remit in tandem with the Government and the private sector, can drive forward this development.</P>
      <P>There are fears that the executive and its chairman will not listen to the voices of the people. Those days are gone.  Any executive worthy of the title must take serious note of the community. I have admiration for the work done in Temple Bar.  However, I also have reservations.  Everyone seems to be very fond of market forces and what happened in Temple Bar was a result of those forces.  Ordinary people had property which ballooned in value and many of them sold out.</P>

The community in Ringsend and the docklands are unique and very determined.  No one will talk down to them. One either co-operates with them or this project is going nowhere.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn should recognise the State in the same way that he recognises the private sector as a major player which, potentially, could produce enormous revenue for the Exchequer and the much maligned taxpayer.</P>

I agree with Senator Magner when he says that if the new council set up under the Bill does not take full account of the problems of the local community, the exercise will be a waste of time. It is fundamentally important that account be taken by the new council of the views of local communities as expressed by their partnership organisations.</P>
      <P>In the initial task force report, chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, reference was made to the fact that almost all representations made to it spoke of the traffic chaos in the area and the urgent need to do something about it to allow the area to work economically and effectively.  The first part of my amendment allows for a superintendent from the divisional Garda headquarters or a local area Garda representative to be appointed to the council because there will be a necessity to liaise with them and obtain their views.  It is also necessary to have Garda representation on the council because the development is in an area of crime and deprivation.  It is necessary for the views and expertise of the Garda authorities who deal with the area to be represented on the council.</P>
      <P>From the Second Stage discussion and from studies carried out, it was considered vitally important for the overall regeneration of the area that as many of the local community as possible would be involved in the project from the beginning. As special training or education requirements will need to be identified and a new community college or school is proposed for Sean McDermott Street, it would be desirable to have a representative of the vocational education committee or the principal on the board to deal with the matter of training, education and incorporating the local community.  I am sure no principal has been appointed but one soon will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a drastic population reduction of 33 per cent in the area in a short time and this is reflected in the task force report.  We have not seen figures like that in west Clare and we speak constantly about depopulation and underpopulation in the west.  I was flabbergasted when I saw the depopulation which had taken place in this inner city area.  It is obvious people moved out because there were no opportunities for them. There was a shift in the pattern of trade, business and commerce which left a residue of people with no opportunities.  At the first prospect of new ones, are we to deprive of participation in this new council the people involved in the planning of their education and training to enable them to play a meaningful part?  We should not.  A case could be made for every group and organisation in Ireland, but priorities must be got right.  There is adequate cover in some organisations mentioned for the economic viewpoint to be expressed on the council.  However, the council does not adequately reflect the needs of the people of the area to allow them participate fully in this development.  As Senator Magner said, if <Col N="720" /> people are not involved in this development, it will be weaker, less effective and dead before it starts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are adding to this council every minute.  Instead, we should focus on its specific and difficult task.</P>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy with Senator Norris's amendment.  The wording makes it much more focused for those communities and I ask the Minister of State to examine it sympathetically. Legislation must be clear and if people are to be included for the next ten, 20 or 50 years of the project, they must be clued in from the start.  It is sensible that where they devise a form of wording which clearly focuses their business, community and environmental interests in the legislation, it should be examined.  None of us has a font of wisdom in terms of legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the amendment sympathetically.</P>
      <P>I also have sympathy with Senator Quinn's amendments.  It might point to the ideological strains in the Government by saying this, but there must be equality between the private and the public sectors.  I do not agree with Senator Magner's view.  We do not need to be ideologically driven on these matters.  Forbairt has a role to play.  If there is a substantial role for the public sector, there must be an equal role for the private sector.  I ask the Minister of State to examine that as well.</P>
      <P>One key issue I ask the Minister of State to address in her response is this.  If Dublin Chamber of Commerce and Dublin Tourism are to be added to the council, it should be remembered that a regional structure is already in place, the Dublin Regional Authority.  It has not given a proper lead to the four local authorities and other related agencies of which it is comprised.  This is an area where it could play a role.  We must ask whether this is a regional objective or a Dublin city objective.  This has not been addressed by the composition of the council to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad to witness the civilised nature of the debate.  I congratulate Senators on their achievement in reconciling the irreconcilable.  On the one hand, they argue for a slimmed down and efficient council and, on the other, they want to include everyone on it.  The debate shows it is difficult to strike the right balance and I am conscious of the needs of a wide range of bodies and organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing the composition of the council to be established under section 16, the Bill seeks to strike an appropriate representation and balance between the various interests, including State bodies, semi-State bodies, elected community representatives, unelected community representatives, business and professions.  The council's 25 ordinary members will comprise of two representatives of Government Departments, five from specific semi-State bodies, the Dublin City Manager or his nominee, five city councillors, eight <Col N="721" /> persons from among the selections made by various interested organisations prescribed under section 16(5) and four persons with expertise relevant to the authority's work.</P>
    <P>Of the 11 amendments in this grouping, I begin with amendment No. 16, which is my own.  This is a technical amendment which takes account of the replacement of the Dublin Port and Docks Board by the Dublin Port Company, with effect from earlier this month.  I have carefully considered the other amendments tabled for section 16 and was reminded while doing so of the Dáil debate in relation to representation on the council. I explained then that the number of organisations with an interest in the docklands area would make it impossible to give each one a place on the council.  If I were to accept all the other amendments tabled for section 16, the council, which is already large at 26, would be increased to well over 30.</P>
    <P>However, in order to ensure that the council is as broadly representative as possible, organisations within broad groupings will be prescribed in regulations under section 16(5) and will then be invited to select candidates for appointment to the council.  That is the only mechanism that can work.  Section 16 (5) has been framed in a manner that will allow a wide range of organisations to be prescribed, including organisations with a purely local focus as well as those with a wider Dublin or national focus.  That will reflect the importance of the Dublin docklands area, not just locally but to the city and country as a whole.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot accept amendment No. 11 from Senator Norris as it would narrow the range of organisations that could be prescribed and therefore narrow the breadth of representation which would be desirable for the council.  Senator Norris's amendment No. 19 is related to amendment No. 11 and would involve a radical alteration of the balance of representation which section 16 tries to achieve.  In particular, it would mean that representatives of the community organisations in the area would have greater representation on the council than the elected members of Dublin Corporation of the area.  Therefore, I cannot agree to this amendment.</P>
    <P>In amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14, 15 and 18, Senator Quinn is seeking to remove BGÉ and the ESB from the council and have representation on the council provided for employment creation interests as well as certain education and tourist interests.  As BGÉ and ESB are key property holders in the area, they will have a critical role in its regeneration and accordingly I wish to retain their representation on the council.  I have no difficulty in principle with the other aspects of Senator Quinn's amendments in so far as he seeks to have certain employment creation, education and tourism interests nominated to the council. The only practical way to provide this is through section 16(5), under which organisations can be prescribed for selecting candidates for appointment to the council.  When making regulations for <Col N="722" /> this purpose I assure the House that I will endeavour to ensure that all interests covered by Senator Quinn's amendments will be catered for and will do likewise for the interests which amendment No. 17 is concerned with.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 seeks council representation for the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and, in response to an identical amendment from Fianna Fáil in the Dáil, the Minister undertook to include the chamber among the organisations to be prescribed under section 16(5).  On that basis, perhaps this amendment could be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 is unnecessary in that the council representation for the community sector it seeks to provide is already dealt with elsewhere in section 16.  Under section 16(5)(b) community organisations will be prescribed for the purposes of selecting candidates for appointment to the council.  Under section 16(6)(g) at least two council appointments will be made from among candidates selected by these organisations.  Perhaps Senator Daly would withdraw his amendment on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister of State's reply, although I am sure it is not intended to mislead the House.  She says my amendment narrows interest but I feel it focuses interest on precisely the area in which we all want to see people involved.  This is traditionally a deprived area with high rates of unemployment.  In some recent developments jobs were created, but not for people in the area, which is true of the Irish Financial Services Centre.  If I were a long-term unemployed resident who found a lot of money was being spent on the financial services centre but that not even the menial posts were going to the local community, I would not find that encouraging but provocative.  My amendments are intended, at their request, to focus on those organisations and groups.</P>
      <P>In relation to having as many or more local community representatives than elected local government members, so what?  Those local government members have their say in Dublin City Council, which is an appropriate forum.  I would not exclude them because of their political appointment, but putting them on the board merely because they are elected representatives may not be necessary.  If there was an equal or greater number of local community representatives, is that not local democracy at work?  What are we afraid of?  Those in these organisations, with whom I have worked over a number of years, are persons for whom I, and no doubt also the Minister of State, have the greatest possible respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to see the Provost of Trinity College inserted.  I was not approached on this by Trinity, but then I am rarely approached by the college.  On occasion I have made it my business to contact them and be briefed on matters concerning them.  The universities should be more alert to the fact that they have the privilege of <Col N="723" /> representation in the House.  I do not represent the board of Trinity College or the University of Dublin.  I represent the graduates of that college and am proud to do so, but the board and officers of Trinity College would be well advised to alert themselves to the fact that they have a unique channel to the democratic process which they do not use half enough.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Quinn put this amendment down, and in a sense it demonstrates the welcome co-operation in many areas between the two university systems.  Senator Quinn, coming from the business community, made a cogent argument about campus industry which shows the substance in that issue.  I was surprised at Senator Magner's contribution; I usually agree with him, flagging myself as a champagne socialist.  There is more socialism than champagne about me these days, but perhaps circumstances will change.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn was not arguing on ideological grounds when he stated that Bord Gáis had a property holding which was not just inert but contaminated, so that they represented the past. What he wanted to do was introduce energy there.  He mentioned CIÉ.  It is not yet private enterprise, nor is Forbairt or the IDA.  Its interest is to introduce industry and energy to this area. Perhaps Senator Magner got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning because I found no strong ideological content in Senator Quinn's contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should reconsider amendments Nos. 11 and 19 on the basis that the argument I made was not narrowing but focusing. I am glad the argument was taken up on the Government benches and appeared to be accepted by a Government representative.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept some of these amendments.  The proposal of a Government amendment means the Bill will be amended in the Seanad.  There is no technical difficulty getting it through without amendment so the Bill will have to be referred back to the Dáil.  We will not reach Final Stage of the Bill today so there will inevitably be a break between Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.  We will have a sos between 1 o'clock and 2 and we will then proceed to other matters.  There may be an opportunity for the Minister of State to consult with her senior colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, in the meantime so she that can convey our views.  I await advice from the Leas-Chathaoirleach on whether I am correct in thinking it is technically unlikely that the Bill will go through all Stages today.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to rethink amendment No. 11.  I am not inclined to be prissy about the wording of the amendment.  If she feels the exact wording does not suit the Government, I have no objection to slight changes and it being proposed as a Government amendment.  I am not trying to score points against the Government by forcing amendments through.  I will not put the amendment to a vote this morning because I want to <Col N="724" /> reserve the opportunity to resubmit it on Report Stage, by which time we will have marshalled our troops.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State knows there is no increase in numbers involved in these amendments. The number is not being changed from 25. Any suggestions about who should be represented on the council does not necessarily involve an addition to the numbers.  The number is settled at 25.  In my amendment No. 17, one representative could represent CIE, Bord Gáis Éireann and the ESB.  It would be simple and sensible to include the provision that one nominee would represent the three semi-State bodies. I am sure a person on the council could represent the views of their colleague.  This is an important board and it is not fair to the other people who wish to be represented on it that semi-State bodies who already have property in the area should have nominees on the board.  There could be a huge conflict.  It would be far better for one person to represent the three bodies involved.  The same could apply to Departments.</P>
      <P>It appears that the original memo on this Bill was circulated to Departments and each Department replied they were happy with the contents of the Bill provided someone represented them on the council.  Arising from that, the Government decided Departments and the city manager would be represented.</P>
      <P>Membership of the council is heavily weighted in favour of semi-State bodies, Departments and local authorities to the detriment of local communities and bodies such as the vocational education committees or the Garda authorities, which are the subject of my amendment No. 17. I am prepared to press that amendment because it can be accommodated without changing the overall numbers by allowing one person to represent the three semi-State bodies.  There will be two vacancies which can be given to those bodies mentioned in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's response, I remain in sympathy with everything my colleagues have said.  There are a few points the Minister may wish to consider.  First, we should not get hung up about the numbers on the council, although 25 is a large number.  In my experience, the quality of the chairperson determines how effectively any number of people function.  I have seen boards consisting of five members chaired appallingly with discussions ending up in shambles.  I have also seen groups of 50 or more extremely well chaired because the chairperson knew their business.  The Minister can choose the chairperson and if the proper one is selected the numbers should not be a decisive criterion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, looking at the functions of council, the key body seems to be the executive board.  The executive board is fixed at seven people who will also be selected by the Minister.  The council makes recommendations to the executive board &mdash; it does not issue instructions.  <i>De facto</i>, we all <Col N="725" /> know that where there is an executive board on the council of any body, it is, in effect, the executive board which makes the running most of the time, unless there are major ideological, financial or personal issues involved.</P>
    <P>If we are concerned about efficiency of operation, the size of the council is not necessarily a key determinant if the proper chairperson is selected.  It is more important to get on board those who have a legitimate interest in the area, to ensure a positive attitude towards the functions of council than it is to worry whether the number is 25 or more.  The recommendations as to who should be on the board are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  I was also taken aback at Senator Magner's interjection concerning ideology.  I did not think Senator Quinn's contribution was ideological. As Senator Norris said, the fact that Trinity College does not consult him may be the highest testimony of Trinity's judgment of these matters, and therefore a stronger argument for including it on this board.</P>
    <P>The impact of Senator Quinn's proposal would be the substitution, in two cases at least, of one State body for another.  I do not mind if there are substitutions.  It is proposed to substitute private enterprise for State enterprise, for example, substituting Forbairt and the IDA for Bord Gáis and the ESB.  I do not see why they should be mutually exclusive.  If Bord Gáis and the ESB are legitimate stakeholders in property it may be wise to keep them on board.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general thrust of Senator Quinn's reasoning that one should look at the future.  What is the purpose of this Bill?  What are these individuals to do?  Whom are they to represent? The constant balance of the functions of representation and performance should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly has made a strong case for the educational provision.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to promote the provision of educational and training opportunities.  The educational and training institutions in that area should be represented effectively.  He has also made a strong argument in favour of Garda representation.  If the purpose of the Bill is social as well as economic regeneration and if crime is such a major problem in that area, it is essential that the gardaí should be represented on the council.  It may also be useful for the gardaí to hear the viewpoints of representatives of a wide range of business and residential interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was impressed by the Minister of State's words but not by her actions.  She said the right things but apparently has not acted on them. I agree with Senator Norris that this debate has been useful and I hope the Minister of State will think about what has been said and take it into account on Report Stage.  She said she will not accept amendments on this Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> I wish to correct Senator Magner.  My proposal that the seats of Bord Gáis and the ESB be given to Forbairt and IDA Ireland respectively was not ideologically based.  The proposal looked to the future rather than the past.  The drafting of this Bill has not been sufficiently well thought out.  If it was, it would accept that the future is in the hands of those who will make this venture a success and not in the hands of those who happened to own the land in the past.  Bord Gáis might own a large amount of property in the area but it is not that body's job to get involved in property development.  It has enough need for its money. It is its job to ensure it gets the best value for its land before getting out.  However, it is important that CIE remain on the council.  There was nothing ideological in my suggestion that IDA, Forbairt and CIE have seats on the council.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that one member be an officer of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment also related to the mindset of the council.  If Departments are to be represented by two civil servants it would be wrong not to take the future into account, and the future will be enterprise and employment.  If titles or tags will be accorded to members of the council, I urge the Minister of State to take that amendment on board.  If five semi-State companies are to be represented on the council, IDA and Forbairt are more sensible inclusions than representatives of bodies who were involved in the past.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the absence of representation for the Chamber of Commerce and the tourism sector.  The Minister of State said they would be asked to nominate members, but I understand the Chamber of Commerce will not have the right to nominate a member.  Perhaps she will clarify this matter.  A case can be made for the involvement of Trinity College.  It is the focus of that area and opportunities for job creation will be linked to the campus companies established there.  It would be a shame if Trinity College was not given the opportunity to become involved.</P>
    <P>The future of this area, which is as big as the Phoenix Park, will not succeed unless a definite effort is made in the tourism and leisure areas. They will be crucial.  Senator Norris made a persuasive case for local community involvement.  I hope the Minister of State will listen to and study the many points made in this regard and, on Report Stage, I hope she will take them into account and solve this conundrum.  On the one hand we say the council will be too big, but on the other hand we are asking her to add more places.  Resolving that conundrum is her task and she is capable of handling it.  I hope she will return on Report Stage with solutions to the riddles facing us.  The Bill will be improved for it.  It must be brought before the Dáil again for approval of Government amendments, so she has the opportunity to put down further amendments <Col N="727" /> on Report Stage which will satisfy most, if not all, the concerns expressed today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This formula was devised after great thought and consideration.  It is difficult to have a perfect solution and I appreciate the goodwill of Senators in their approach to constituting a council.  However, the balance in the Bill is the best balance.  The mechanism whereby community organisations can have an involvement at council level is also the best mechanism.</P>
      <P>The role of organisations such as the Chamber of Commerce has been acknowledged and will be prescribed in regulations.  The geographic area involved is large and bodies such as the ESB and BGE are major landowners there.  They are pivotal to the success of the authority.  While the proposals being put forward are intended to be helpful, I believe this is the only practical way of forming an authority and ensuring a balance among community organisations, State bodies, semi-State bodies and democratically elected representatives. Community groups have an important role, but public representatives have a democratic mandate and they must have a significant part on a council such as this on foot of that mandate.  It is important to underpin that principle. It certainly reflects the view of the Government with regard to the local government reform programme that was launched before Christmas.</P>
      <P>A number of sections in the Bill refer to job creation and its linkage with local communities. This concept is so important that I commissioned a major review of urban renewal designation. Social renewal as well as urban design and financial implications are central to the review.  The principles underpinning this Bill conform with the expressions of concern voiced by Senators.  We might have slightly different perspectives on the matter, but at heart there is no great difference in our approaches.</P>
      <P>We have arrived at a formula which I believe is the best available.  We must ensure we are as comprehensive as possible when prescribing organisations in the regulations.  It may be the case, as Senator Norris suggested, that certain organisations would not fit into the definition.  We will have to ensure they were not excluded and we will have that flexibility.  The mechanism and balance we have devised are the best.</P>

      <P>(h) the Principal of the new Community College or a person nominated by the Dublin City Vocational Education Authority shall be so appointed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I did not receive a satisfactory assurance from the Minister of State about the principle of having the Garda authorities or the CDVEC represented on the council.  I ask her to cast her mind back to the initial task force study.  Each and every one of the organisations to whom they spoke concluded from their own observations that there were serious problems as regards policing and traffic management.  While that can be managed and processed outside the area, the participation by the community college that is being established there is critical to the availability of courses to train people for positions that will become available within the centre itself.  It is essential for the Minister of State to address this.  Unless she can give me some assurance that she will look favourably at it before the next Stage, I will have no option but to press the amendment.</P>

The Minister of State has decided on the concept, but I think it could be adjusted to take into account important areas like policing, which the Minister of State knows from her own experience is a serious problem. The Minister of State also knows there are serious problems in regard to the availability of young people for meaningful jobs when this development takes place.  In that regard, I have further amendments which I will certainly press later.</P>

      <P>A letter was read out on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; on RTÉ Radio One today regarding a teacher who is seven months pregnant and is in fear of losing her job.  It is representative of the fear and concern throughout the country.  All requirements to protect ethos, private lives, schools, etc., could be achieved if the Minister accepted an amendment which excludes from discrimination all the other grounds listed in the Bill, including sexual orientation, marital status, etc.  I appeal to him to protect those who are not vociferous or prominent.</P>

      <P>The objective is to ensure that the categories of people specified in amendment No. 38 are included in the Bill and will not be discriminated against.  The amendments in the name of Senator Norris are unnecessary.  It is all right to use the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in section 37(1)(a) and the words &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; in section 37(1)(b).  However, it is essential to reconcile the problem of protecting the ethos of the school with protecting the employees within the school and it is possible to do so without difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern is with protection of young women in the teaching and nursing professions. I wish I could say that I had not known women who had had abortions because they were afraid they would lose their jobs.  I know it is not the Minister's intention that this legislation should allow for any such situations.  However, figures show that, generally, four out of five Irish women who travel to England are single and give socio-economic reasons for seeking an abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a State secret that medical terminations up to nine weeks are increasingly common in England.  As one who believes that abortion can never be the preferred end to any pregnancy, I want to ensure that women will not believe that they may lose their jobs if they continue with a pregnancy.  While it is awkward for the school or hospital where such a situation may arise, we <Col N="732" /> must be clear that tactical abortions cannot be condoned.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Winning offered money to women who reconsidered their position if they became involved in a crisis pregnancy.  However, it may have been more useful if he had said that no girl within his diocese would lose her job if he had the power to do so.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that this is a serious problem, especially within schools and hospitals. While I understand the constraints under which the Minister is operating, he should try to ensure that everything can be done to persuade women, especially those aged 20 to 30 who are fearful of losing their jobs, not to consider abortions because of lack of support.  This would be better than attempts to ensure that this is an abortion free isle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to watch the accomplished performance by the Minister and Senator McGennis on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday.  In dealing with this issue the Minister made what many would see as a reasonable point.  He asked how tenable it would be for any authority which had an ethos not to be permitted to refuse to hire, promote or engage the services of someone who deliberately undermined the ethos of that institution.  That statement introduced a shade in the argument which is not in the Bill but which represented the Minister's thinking. Will the Minister accept an amendment, which I intend to table on Report Stage, to include the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;?  This would make it clear that an accident of fate &mdash; for example, being gay, a woman, elderly or a member of the travelling community &mdash; over which one has no control could not be construed as grounds for dismissal.  The Christian Churches, if they wish to behave in a Christian manner, or the Muslim community, if it wishes to behave in accordance with the precepts of the Holy Prophet Mohammed, blessed be his name, or the Jewish community would find it difficult to resist the force of this argument on moral, ethical and humane grounds.</P>
      <P>I will table an amendment on Report Stage to add the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;.  Its acceptance would go some way to satisfy my concerns.  I cannot anticipate any strong arguments against it. Given that I am quoting the Minister back to himself, he might experience some difficulty in countering it, although I know he is a man of extraordinary intellectual agility &mdash; I do not mean that in a negative sense &mdash; who can think on his feet and provide clear answers.  I hope he will accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are approaching St. Patrick's Day and traditionally, although not this year, the St. Patrick's Day parades in New York and Boston have been the focus of attention because of the deliberate exclusion of young gay Irish people.  The opposition to them is led in New York, for example, by the likes of Cardinal O'Connell.  He led a campaign to insulate the Church against provisions <Col N="733" /> such as this.  He made it clear that it was part of the Roman Catholic ethos to exclude people from employment and housing on the basis of their sexual orientation.  If we incorporate the Roman Catholic ethos and protect it so that anybody who undermines it willy-nilly can be excluded from a job, we do so knowing that the ethos could be construed as allowing for dismissal of this kind.</P>
    <P>Without attempting to humiliate or aggravate the Church authorities, the addition of the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; would go a long way to meet the requirements.  I believe the Church of Ireland would feel able to support such a position, although I speak only as an ordinary member of that Church.  I would deprecate the use of the Church of Ireland as a convenient alibi for introducing this measure.  I could not help noticing the prominence with which the spokespersons of the other religious interest groups make use of the Church of Ireland's intervention, which I deplore, in order to indicate that their position is pluralist. I would hate to see the Church of Ireland become a Trojan horse.  There should not be denominational education paid for the State.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the rights of the employees.  What about the rights of the employers?  The management of the schools are not the employers; the employers are the taxpayers because they pay virtually all the bills.  If we are talking about the employers let us talk about the decent people of Ireland who have shown themselves to be compassionate, tolerant and deeply concerned about the implications of section 37.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the addition of the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;.  I will find it sinister if it is not possible to accept even this small step towards the protection of vulnerable sections of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an extensive airing of the policy and practical implications of this provision. It has been an honest discussion and we have seriously considered what we agree is an important, difficult and delicate subject.  Many issues have been raised and I sought in my earlier contribution to address as many of those points as possible.  I thank Senator Norris for signalling that he will table a particular amendment on Report Stage.  I look forward to examining it and considering its implications.  I will give him my response at that juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the case of a pregnant worker.  Pregnant workers are fully protected in the Bill because discrimination against them is discrimination on the grounds of gender. The protection of such workers is also derived from EU case law.  I am satisfied that the provision as it stands gives considerably more protection than exists at present under Irish law or under UK legislation.  The Eileen Flynn case was taken under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  I cannot say for certain what the outcome would have been had it arisen under the Employment <Col N="734" /> Equality Act, 1977, but it is possible that the specific protections for pregnant workers in EU equality case law may have prompted a different outcome.</P>
    <P>Strong views have been expressed about the governance of schools and the havoc which fundamentalist interests could wreak if they secured control of school boards.  I have reflected on these views and I am reassured that section 37 (1) can provide an effective protection for teachers in such circumstances.  I am satisfied that the redress procedures provided for in the Bill can be relied upon to outlaw any unreasonable and unnecessary actions by school authorities on religious ethos matters.</P>
    <P>I am impressed with Senator McGennis's perceptive observation that the teachers, parents and other citizens who comprise school boards are motivated by an ethos of public service and a personal concern to ensure the good of all concerned. Senators Dardis and O'Toole seemed to agree; and I am convinced that the parent, teacher and denominational interests which constitute the school boards are strong proof against the control of education by zealots or other extremists.  In the exceptional case where they fail, the director and the Labour Court can ensure that the proper balance of rights is applied.</P>
    <P>I note Senators have indicated that they will review their proposed amendments in the light of this debate.  I will continue to consider any proposals but I am committed to the maintenance of the delicate balance of rights which has been achieved in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says he will not upset the delicate balance, I take it that it is not his intention to accept any amendments at this point, although there are some issues which should be dealt with.  In that case, I will not press my amendment but I am unhappy with the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 36 to 39, inclusive, not moved.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 37 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was appropriate to press the amendment because I take the point that people were unhappy with certain aspects of the wording.  I am very concerned about the impression which is been given about this section. The amendments made by the Minister on Report Stage in the other House improved the Bill.  I do not object to the four quite stringent tests of what is reasonable and necessary in order to stop an undermining action.  However, I have other problems with the section which has not been amended to an extent which I can accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has to maintain a delicate balance between the different areas <Col N="735" /> and he gave a fair hearing to every argument I raised.  He did not concede to them but that is the job of Government.  However, I do not want this section to pass without registering my opposition to it so I will not agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I conceded the last day that the Minister had significantly amended and improved the Bill in the Dáil.  The only question which remained was whether it could be amended and improved even more and, in my view, it could.  I listened carefully to what the Minister said and I find his argument reasonably convincing. However, the section would be improved by the insertion of an appropriate amendment on Report Stage which takes into account the various categories of people who cannot be discriminated against including, as the Minister rightly pointed out the last day, the disabled who are not covered by the terms of the original amendment. I share the concerns of Senator O'Toole on the section because, while it has been significantly improved, there is room for further improvement.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister said in his reply that pregnant women are protected under this and other legislation.  I do not see how they are protected in institutions which have a special ethos but if the Minister says they are I must believe him.  This is my main area of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Methods of legal abortion are in use which are less and less intrusive and require a person to be away from their job for less time.  Medical abortions are widely used in England and have been in use in France and other European countries for more than ten years.  We must be realistic about this.  We hear statements being made that the Irish people are totally against abortion and we must make every effort to ensure that no one making a choice in that direction will have what they see as their interests damaged.  I will take the Minister's word that everything is being done to protect women in that situation but I am unhappy with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 37, subsection (3), line 45, to delete &ldquo;relating and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;relating&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 are in my name.  My concern arises from the lack of access to information. My understanding of the way section 40 is written is that confidential information refers to any information which relates to a particular individual, which can be identified as so relating and to the disclosure of which that individual does not agree.  My problem with that, as it is written, is that A seeking to take an equality case is arguing that he is doing exactly the same work as B but is being paid less than B.  Person A should therefore be entitled to the same salary as B.  To prove that case, they must have access to <Col N="737" /> information, some of which is not freely available. If an under-the-counter agreement has been made between the employer and employee B, it would be easy for the employer to tell B that all they need to do is describe the information as being confidential.  Therefore A, who is taking the case, will not have access to it.</P>
    <P>The interpretation of confidential is far too loose.  The individual simply has to say &ldquo;I do not agree to the disclosure of that information&rdquo; and A will not have sufficient evidence to initiate the case.  That is why I have put down amendments Nos. 40 and 41.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 41, I have tried to strengthen the provision by inserting &ldquo;and which is not reasonable for X to require&rdquo;.  For example if X, in taking the case, makes unreasonable demands, that should not be acceptable.  I believe my requirements are reasonable and it would be reasonable for the Minister to concede to them. Perhaps he will raise some point with which I am not familiar against the acceptance of these amendments but I think it is reasonable for me to say that simply allowing B to say the information is confidential is too loose.  What I am proposing achieves two things: it makes it more difficult for B to withhold information and it puts in a fail-safe to ensure that a certain element of confidentiality is protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Senators O'Toole and Henry would wish to give a prospective claimant under the Bill access to as much information as possible to assist her in bringing forward a claim. I, too, have such a concern &mdash; hence, the provision of section 40 of the Bill.  However, I did not consider that the Bill should give a right to confidential information to another employee without that employee's agreement.  This does not mean that such information cannot be accessed by the Director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court in determining the case.  That is a crucial point. There are powers for the director and the Labour Court to obtain such confidential information without the agreement of the person concerned.  They may also use this confidential material to reach a decision but they must respect its confidential nature. I consider it is sufficient that the redress bodies have access to this type of information.  I do not think it is desirable or necessary to provide access to such information to another employee who may not use it at all to pursue an equality case.  As the director and the court have this power, I hope the Senators will reconsider the need for their proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot dispute the logic of the Minister's point; I do not disagree with the way the Minister said this Bill would work.  If I may give a practical example, I have a meeting tomorrow morning at nine o'clock of a group which in our union we call the <i>prima facie</i> committee.  The meeting is being called to decide whether the union will take an equality case on behalf of a <Col N="738" /> member.  We take a very strict view of these things and weigh the evidence presented to us by the member.  That evidence will commit us, one way or another, to taking a case which could continue through many stages until it reaches its conclusion. If the information is not there or cannot be found, we may have to decide whether or not it is an equality case.  It makes it very difficult to initiate a case or protect a member if the information is not available.</P>
      <P>The Minister must know from experience that at the point at which the Director of Equality Investigations decides to start looking for information from the employer or board of management in order to decide whether or not a a case has to be taken against a teacher or another employee, it is probable that by the time the letter arrives from Dublin with a harp insignia on the envelope, word will go around that the employee in question is dragging half the Government down on top of the school, small industry or whatever.  It becomes a major issue.  I agree that the director can get access to the information. However, there is one unfailing principle of conflict resolution and that is that conflicts should be dealt with at the lowest possible level and at the first stage.  An employee who does find access to relevant information, information which it is reasonable for them to require, may prevent the entire panoply of State becoming involved.</P>
      <P>If one considers the principles of delivering better government or the Bill we will be discussing in the coming weeks with regard to the operation of the Civil Service, it is clear that we want things dealt with at local level.  I know from 25 years' experience of dealing with grievance procedures that those with the best long-term chance of success are those which are resolved at stage one.  Stage one in this is for the person to find out they do not have a grievance.  For example, I could say that I am certain that I am being discriminated against because I am being paid less than Senator McGennis for doing the same work.  I have a grievance; but when I look for certain information, I am deprived of it.  That nurses my grievance more.  By the time I reach the next stage, when I have made a decision to set the process in train, outsiders begin to get involved.  Everybody in the industrial relations area, be they employers, employees, unions or management, will always say that it is better to sort out the problem without getting outsiders involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not disagreeing with the points the Minister is making.  However, I would like him to focus in on what is wrong with what I am proposing. My proposals do not upset the integrity of the Bill and they do protect confidentiality, of which I would be very jealous.  I would be interested to hear from the Senator on the other side of the House who is a member of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I wonder what his view would be on this matter, although I know the situations are not exactly comparable.  Would it not be much easier if the information was made <Col N="739" /> available at the first stage and people would realise whether they had a case or not?</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment and will not rehash the reasons because he outlined them very cogently.  If the Minister is in a position to answer the following question, it may expedite matters.  Is my instinct correct that the Minister will not be able to accept any amendments because of the complex nature of the Bill and the political fabric which supports it, so there is no point doing more than stating the argument and returning to it again will not do any good?  Even if we were to convince the Minister, there are political reasons that will ensure no amendments are accepted, possibly because of a fear that if the situation was opened up the relationship between the parties might unravel the legislation.  Is the Minister politically in a position to accept any amendments?  Is it simply a question of going through the motions of putting our arguments on the record and then if we are can on Report Stage, assist the Minister by inserting at least one of the amendments we are considering this afternoon?</P>

      <P>I would like to pick up on a point made by the Minister about something being reasonable for X to require as proposed in amendment No. 41.  He rightly suggested that the director or the designated officer has wide powers to investigate and require people to produce books, documents and other information.  That is not the same as saying the person who is the subject of the case should not have access.  I envisage circumstances where the director may not believe certain information is required and where person X may consider it reasonable.  I take the point that we do not want to get into a vexatious area where somebody should trawl through files and information willy-nilly.  I do not believe the amendment would open up that possibility.</P>

      <P>I would welcome the opportunity to have an exchange of views on the theories of political science with Senator Norris at a future <Col N="740" /> date.  That would be a very enjoyable exercise but this is neither the time nor the place.  Anybody who knows my record over the past four and a half years as a Minister will know that I frequently accept amendments and have no hang ups in so doing if they are appropriate, reasonably placed and will add to the legislation.  I accepted amendments to legislation on many occasions, including this Bill.  If Members are patient, I may accept amendments on Report Stage; but not these two amendments.</P>
      <P>This section addresses giving the right to a person to get certain information before they bring an application.  That is a major step forward.  In a normal lawsuit, a person does not get any information, confidential or otherwise, before proceedings are underway.  When proceedings are underway, a person may make an application for discovery of documents and so on which one may or may not get.  That is not what this section deals with.  This is a request for information by a person who has not brought any proceeding and has not referred the matter to the director and perhaps never will do so.</P>
      <P>A person might like to know the earnings of employees in Senator Quinn's firm so they make a request for information about those working there because they may decide to bring a claim. Senator Quinn's employees might rightly say their earnings are a confidential matter and not to be disclosed to a person merely because they say they may bring a claim.  Taking the analogy of Senator O'Toole and Senator McGennis, Senator McGennis may not be pleased to have her earnings disclosed on the basis that Senator O'Toole may bring a claim before the director.  Salary comparisons and so on would be relevant at the hearing and that is not excluded by the legislation. On the contrary, if a person is convinced they have a claim and initiates an investigation before the director, he or she may then access all information that is necessary for the director to make an appropriate determination, whether confidential or not, which must surely be fair and reasonable.  Any argument to the contrary is totally untenable.</P>

      <P>I fundamentally disagree with the points made, although I do not disagree with points made about seeking information on other people's salaries no more than if I asked the Minister what was in his bank account, it is irrelevant. I do not believe the Minister read my amendment and I feel somewhat let down by that.  My amendment states: &ldquo;which it is not reasonable for X to require&rdquo;.&rdquo;  It would be unreasonable for anybody to seek the information the Minister used as an example.  The only way such a situation would arise is if the employees say to an employer that they believe they are being discriminated against. The only way in which they can be discriminated against is on the basis of salary where somebody in like employment is being paid more.  I do not understand how somebody could ask for a list of the salaries or wages of employees in a firm.  That <Col N="741" /> is a specious argument and this issue is worthy of closer consideration.</P>
      <P>If somebody seeks information, it must be on the basis that they feel they are being discriminated against.  The employer must decide if it is reasonable to make the information available.  If the employer decides it is not reasonable, the person thinking of bringing the case must decide if they wish to take the next step and take it to the director.  This amendment introduces another stage before lawyers, counsel and unions become involved and is sensible and worthwhile.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is asking me if it is reasonable for somebody to seek information on other employees in a firm, the answer is in my amendment.  If it is not reasonable, the person does not get the information and if it is, they do.  The person being asked for the information, the employer, decides if it is reasonable.  It is unfair to use that specious argument and it does not do justice to the point I made.  I do not disagree with the Minister's description of how the Bill will operate and with what the director may do.  If there are problems, they should be dealt with at the lowest possible level.  I made an arguable case on deciding whether information sought is reasonable, which is the best way to deal with this.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 38, lines 8 to 25, to delete subsection (5).</P>
      <P>The provisions in this section relate only to the Civil Service, the Local Appointments Commissioners, the Minister for Defence and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  The section states that &ldquo;information shall not be regarded as material information for the purposes of this section if it relates to communications with external advisers to any of the persons referred to&rdquo;.  It seems that this information does not form part of the information which would be made available through the Bill.  If it only applies to the Civil Service, the Local Appointments Commissioners, the Minister for Defence and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, then why does it appear to discriminate against their employees?  I anticipated that I might be wrong and unsuccessful in having this section deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister look again at the wording of subsection (5)?  The subsection states &ldquo;In a case where a person considers that he may have been discriminated against&rdquo;.  The Bill states that he means she and she means he.  However, it would <Col N="742" /> be preferable if the subsection was gender neutral.</P>
    <P>The 28 day period allowed for in section 41 may cause a problem if, for example, someone was away when a decision was taken.  The time limit is too short and needs to be extended to three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 42 seeks to delete the special arrangements contained in section 40 in relation to the information which must be disclosed to a person who considers that he or she may have been discriminated against in the course of an interview by the Civil Service Commission, the Local Appointments Commissioners, the Minister for Defence, in respect of recruitment to the Defence Forces or the Garda Commissioner. The Civil Service, the Local Appointments Commissioners and the Defence Forces were excluded from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  They are, for the first time, brought within the scope of equality legislation in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as the Garda Siochána is concerned, I have curtailed the exclusions which existed under the 1977 Act.  These four public service recruiting agencies deal with high numbers of prospective employees every day.  They have a strong commitment to fair recruitment practices.  Given the large number of applications they receive, there is potential for a large volume of correspondence concerning the outcome of competitions for appointments.  The special provision in subsection (5) gives these agencies the opportunity to deal with this correspondence in a reasonably systematic way.</P>
      <P>In addition, these agencies rely on purely voluntary, experienced external practitioners from the private and public sectors for most of their competitive interview programmes.  The section excludes the communications of these practitioners from the important process under section 40.</P>
      <P>These arrangements apply to the preliminary information process.  Once a formal complaint is lodged, all information necessary to the case would be available to the director and the Labour Court under the strong investigative powers provided for in sections 58 to 61.  In these circumstances I ask Senator McGennis to withdraw her amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 has the effect of making this provision gender neutral.  In drafting this Bill, the parliamentary draftsman sought to use, as far as possible, gender neutral language.  I am aware that there are a few provisions which are not couched in gender neutral terms.  In these cases the parliamentary draftsman has indicated that the use of gender neutral language would make the provision unduly cumbersome and defeat good English.  I am grateful to Senator McGennis for taking the trouble to identify this departure from gender neutral language in the Bill.  I agree with her that it would be desirable if a more politically <Col N="743" /> correct form of words was prepared.  I will look at this issue again before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 44 would extend the period which the complainant may wait before referring a claim to the Director of Equality Investigations or the Circuit Court from 28 days to three months.  The 28 day limit specified in this subsection is provided so as to allow the complainant the benefit of the 28 days he or she may have lost waiting for a response to an information request. Twenty eight days is the maximum period allowed to the Civil Service Commission and other agencies to reply to the request.  The 28 day period is a top up to the general time limit of six months for initiation of a claim provided for in section 41(6)(a).  There is provision for an extension of the six month time limit to 12 months if there are exceptional circumstances.  I am sure Senator McGennis will agree that these are generous time limits for bringing a case and will look favourably on my request to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>In drafting this provision I decided to provide that in a case where mediation fails the complainant should indicate an interest in relodging the claim before the director or the Labour Court would recommence investigation of the claim.  The reason I took this approach is <Col N="744" /> to afford the claimant an opportunity to abandon the case if they wish.  It is not uncommon for a complainant to decide not to pursue a legal remedy which fails at mediation in the light of information which became available in the course of that process.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, the employer and complainant might reach a private settlement in relation to the dispute.

      <P>This amendment deals with the size of a company. The powers conferred by subsection (4) do not apply to any business which has fewer than 50 employees.  The vast majority of businesses have fewer than that.  We do not want very small companies brought within its remit but many service industries, especially those which employ women, have fewer than 50 employees.  The limit should, therefore, be reduced.  The amendment proposes to reduce it to ten but I will wait to see what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister, replying to an earlier amendment, spoke of the need for clear language and proper English.  There is a refreshing absence of the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease in this Bill.  I have waged a war on this aspect of Bills.  There is a proliferation of the phrase &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; in legislation which is meaningless because &ldquo;for&rdquo;, &ldquo;by&rdquo;, &ldquo;with&rdquo;, etc. could be used instead.

      <P>The provision for equality reviews and action plans is a new Government initiative in the field of equality.  It is devised to target larger employers where the impact of equality reviews and action plans would be greatest.  It recognises that small firms may have difficulty becoming involved in formal mechanisms of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special treatment of small and medium sized enterprises is generally recognised as an appropriate consideration in the context of employment regulation.  In this provision, such special treatment is applied.  Senators will recall the concern expressed in this House by Senator Quinn on Second Stage that excessive regulation can adversely impact on job creation, especially by small firms.  While individual rights of employees for protection against discrimination should not be applied according to firm size, there is, in the context of equality reviews and action plans, a strong case for promotional measures such as these to be targeted at employments of a given size leaving smaller firms <Col N="746" /> exempt.  It can be argued that the targeting of such reviews and plans at smaller firms may be less effective, especially as regards representation of minorities in such employments.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have reviewed the breakdown of employment by reference to the threshold size of 50 employees.  According to CSO sources, an estimated 64 per cent of employees in Irish employments are employed in firms with more than 50 workers.  While nearly all public service employees are in this position, approximately half of private sector employees are also encompassed. I am satisfied, therefore, that a focus on firms of this size or bigger will ensure that firms employing close on two thirds of the Irish workforce will be subject to this provision.</P>
    <P>The section does not rule out involvement of smaller firms in equality reviews and action plans on a voluntary basis.  I am confident that effective application of this provision will have spin-off benefits for smaller employers as it will highlight employment equality deficiencies and best practice across many Irish firms.  Nevertheless, I have considered how I might respond to the need implied by these amendments for the authority to have an active engagement with small firms in tackling employment discrimination.  I therefore propose to take up with the authority the option of setting up a dedicated targeted service to provide ongoing support and advice for small employers.  In the case of small firms, a supportive expert service responding to their needs has a greater prospect of progressing equality than the more formal imposition of equality reviews and action plans.  These are more suitable to more adequately resourced firms, with more developed and sophisticated human resource functions, which can more easily participate in such activities.</P>

      <P>The amendment has been changed slightly to include the phrase &ldquo;medically recognised&rdquo; which is different to what we suggested on Committee Stage.  We return to the need for a more flexible definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo;.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that having consulted with the various organisations, they were happy with the definition eventually inserted in the Bill.  I understand there is still some disquiet among some of the caterers for disability as to the definition. They do not want an unduly medical definition. In some ways we have adopted a halfway house by stating, more precisely, a &ldquo;medically&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;duly&rdquo; recognised impairment.</P>
      <P>It is an important issue and it would be preferable to have a definition of this nature.  I thought there would have been a definition which would change matters compared to what was in the Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked again at the Bill's definition of disability.  I indicated on Committee Stage that the one criticism of this legal definition to which I have to respond is that it might fail to protect some category of person who might suffer prejudice on the grounds of disability, whether real or imputed.  No amendments have been put down on that basis.  All amendments tabled so far would have the opposite effect of removing protection from some group who are otherwise covered by my definition.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that other definitions put forward better fit the category of persons with more serious disabilities.  However, I am reassured that a prominent national body such as the Disability Federation of Ireland, representing persons with serious disabilities, appreciates my concern that the Bill's protection should extend beyond persons with more severe conditions and accepts the Bill's definition as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the definition contained in the Bill is not the definition of a person with a disability.  This is a very important <Col N="749" /> point.  I have confined the definition to the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; only.  This inevitably requires medical references.  All legal definitions from other jurisdictions are caught by this need, both in original statute and frequently in detailed secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>Although the medical dimension is profiled here as it is in other jurisdictions, that does not mean that unnecessary medical inclusion will result.  The Australian authorities, who rely on a similar definition, have written to us on this matter. In a letter from the office of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner of Human Rights and Equal Opportunities in Sydney, the policy officer wrote that at the time of the debates concerning the Disability Discrimination Act, he was working in the disability advocacy sector and remembers asking similar questions to those being raised by the disability sector in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our greater concern was the desire to have a definition which left no room for debate about the right of any person with any disability to have the protection of law.  Our experience of State-based law and our assessment of overseas law suggested that while the definition proposed was functional &mdash; I do not see it as a medical rather than social or political definition &mdash; it would allow for the widest possible inclusion.  The intention of the human rights commissioner at the time was to ensure the exact opposite of the concerns being raised in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Experience in Australia suggests that the definition used has been accepted in the context of this legislation and has not resulted in the introduction of inappropriate medical assessment. The definition is intended to assist in placing the emphasis on the provision of workplace accommodations rather than allow for exclusion of people following assessment.  It was our assessment that the inclusion of a definition with clauses such as &ldquo;substantially limits one or more of the major life activities&rdquo;, as in the American Disabilities Act, would lead to intrusive assessments.</P>
    <P>Senators should note the reference to the provision of workplace accommodations.  When I reviewed the definition in the Dáil, I was impressed with the case that was made for better addressing the work environment for the person with a disability.  Senator Norris referred to this point in his contribution on Committee Stage.  As a result I introduced explicit provisions in the Dáil in sections 16(3) and 35(4) to develop the concept of reasonable accommodation in employment. In this regard, I am satisfied the Bill caters for the social context of disability.  In effect, I have included in the Bill a requirement for the employer to do all that is reasonable to accommodate the needs of the person with the disability. This requirement is qualified only to the extent that it would give rise to undue hardship to the employer.</P>
    <P>There is well considered balance in this Bill with regard to disability.  On the one hand there is a broad protective definition of disability and, <Col N="750" /> on the other, there is a recognition of the needs of persons with severe disabilities and their right to expect those needs to be addressed.  In the circumstances, I appeal to Senators to support this definition and ensure this most progressive measure is available to protect a broad range of citizens who can be exposed to prejudice and discrimination in employment.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment seeks to achieve a common wording for disability in both this Bill and the Equal Status Bill, 1997.  The Equal Status Bill terminology is being adopted in this Bill as it is reckoned to be the most comprehensive.  The term &ldquo;loss&rdquo; implies that the function concerned existed at some time in the past for that individual. The term &ldquo;absence&rdquo;, however, covers persons who were born without the function as well as those who may have lost the function since birth.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(j)  that one is a member of a trade union and the other is not (&lsquo;the trade union membership&rsquo;).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I proposed two amendments on Committee Stage, one of which sought to include the ground of membership of a political party.  I told the Minister that if it came to a choice between the two I would prefer him to address the trade union membership issue as a priority.  It is important that membership of a trade union should not be used by an employer as a reason for discriminating against a potential employee.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment proposes that: &ldquo;The Minister shall review the operation of the Act, within two years of the date of the coming into operation of this section, with a view to assessing whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds set out in this section.&rdquo;  I accept this amendment but could the Minister explain why it was not possible to accept my amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment, although I accept the Minister's goodwill that he will review the operation of the Act.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to put on record other sentiments about this matter.  The Minister might have difficulty with the trade unions.  A view has been expressed that trade unions might not like a situation where, for example, one trade union in a place of employment secures in negotiations an advance in conditions of work or pay and so forth for its members, and might not wish those advantages to be passed to other employees who are not members of that trade union.  That is a dog in the manger attitude that should not be sustained. Although it is practical in terms of advancing, in the immediate future, trade union membership and of advertising its advantages to the workforce, it is a mean spirited attitude to adopt.</P>
      <P>I was employed by the College of the Sacred and Undivided Trinity near Dublin and I was a member of the Irish Federation of University Teachers.  The union secured advantages for me in terms of my conditions of work, income and so forth but they were generously and properly applied to all employees, regardless of whether they were members of a trade union.  That is proper practice.  If trade unions are seriously concerned with improving the lot of the working classes, they should not seek narrowly to confine advances they have secured to members of their trade union exclusively.  I hope the Minister will take this into account and, if he agrees, express this view to comrades in the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>Any benefits deriving to a trade union from the fact that such advantages were secured only for their members would not be long lasting.  The fact that a trade union is strong enough to secure such rights might encourage other people who had not previously joined the trade union to consider it a good idea.  Even were the system to operate in the other direction and the trade union became weakened, a natural corrective will come into force.  As the trade union becomes weaker and less able to fight, that will become obvious to those who were inclined to be just passengers and they will join or rejoin that trade union.</P>
      <P>If there are difficulties with a trade union, I hope the Minister will ensure that the public is made aware of the fact that trade unions are taking a rather narrow view of their responsibilities to the working class.  This argument would not wash with me.  I am living proof of the fact that trade unions can survive well without such a mean spirited approach.  Perhaps I am misjudging them and this is not their view.  However, I understand from speaking with people in trade unions that it is a fear.  They might have expressed it to the Minister, but it is not a sustainable argument nor is it a noble one.  If it was exposed, the Irish public would take a dim view of such a narrow attitude and it is not in the interest of the trade union members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister needs a process of consultation with the trade unions but I look forward to <Col N="752" /> the inclusion, following that process, of membership of a trade union as one of the protected categories.</P>

In accepting the Minister's amendment, which I believe to be a reasonable one, I do not see why the particular amendment we are advocating cannot be included with the list.  As I said on Committee Stage, it is either all or none. Why exclude political opinion as well as trade union membership?  I cannot understand the reason for not including trade union membership. Senator Norris has illuminated me in terms of why there might be a difficulty but I must say it had not occurred to me because I find it extraordinary. The amendment is reasonable and even if the Minister is taking a two year period to review the section, I do not see why what we are proposing cannot be included and then be subject to review rather than being excluded and subject to review.</P>

I will not repeat myself except in regard to the Minister's amendment that he will review the operation of the Bill and I welcome that.  We may need to review it because we may find some parts of it are not working, although not in the way the Minister thinks.

I would not be surprised if we needed to come back and review this, although not for the purpose the Minister stated.</P>
      <P>Given the choice I would have asked him not to include the words &ldquo;to see whether there is a need to add to the discriminatory grounds&rdquo;.

      <P>I do not think the Progressive Democrats should pre-empt what the Labour contribution might be.  In relation to this section, on Second Stage I expressed concern that it should cover the grounds of trade union membership and party political affiliation.  On the face of it they seem to be areas that should be protected, yet they are abused in practical terms every day of the week.  However, I accept the Minister has expressed the difficulties in relation to trade union membership.  Be that as it may, I was interested in Senator Norris's case concerning the benefits gained by a union being applicable to all workers involved.  The downside is that if that were the case there would be little to be gained by being a member of a trade union and that would inherently weaken the effectiveness of the trade union movement.  While there are many complications in that area I still welcome what the Minister has to say on it.  Will he also address the issue of party political affiliation?  In terms of the criteria used by employers, that has been a singular characteristic.  There should be something in the next section to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, a number of Senators pressed strongly for proposals to include political opinion and trade union membership as <Col N="754" /> additional grounds for protection under the Bill. I indicated then that I was sympathetic to such a move and that I would review the issue before Report Stage.  I have done that and, as I indicated originally, there would indeed be real difficulty in bringing forward these proposals without an in-depth examination of these grounds.  It is not, as Senator Dardis hoped, merely a question of adopting the unfair dismissals legislation model which, of course, continues to provide protection on these grounds in respect of dismissal, including constructive dismissal.</P>
      <P>Members were willing to accept there could be problem including political opinion in the Bill.  I have already mentioned a number of difficulties. Senator McGennis referred to another problem last week when she pointed to the difficulty of defining the ground.  Should it relate to political opinion, affiliation or activity?  These are matters to be carefully considered for another day.</P>
      <P>Senators McGennis and Dardis did, however, strongly press the case for including protection in respect of the ground of trade union membership. I have carefully considered this proposal.  I indicated on Committee Stage that, just as in the case of political opinion, there would also be difficulties with adding the trade union membership ground.  I cited then the potential need for exclusions for arrangements in respect of staff associations in employment such as the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána.  I also mentioned that such a ground would prevent trade unions from the currently acceptable practice of giving preference in posts to their own members.</P>
      <P>However, Senators were not swayed and highlighted the disposition of some large foreign owned firms to refuse to recognise trade unions and to discriminate against persons who are members of trade unions.  Protection against such behaviour is certainly a worthy cause.  I would very much like to pursue such an objective. However, when I looked into this issue in some detail in recent days I found that there are considerably more complexities than may appear at first glance.</P>
      <P>The discussion on Committee Stage seemed to focus attention on the plight of the trade union member who suffers discrimination at recruitment stage.  If the trade union membership ground is included, consideration would have to be given to the implications for closed shop agreements or other collective agreements.  There are constitutional issues also concerned with the right to associate and, conversely, the right to dissociate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of trade union recognition is one that has remained unresolved over the years in industrial relations.  Apart from its constitutional law aspect, it is one about which employer and trade union interests have very different views.  Anti-discrimination legislation of the kind that is before this House today may not be the appropriate vehicle to deal with this legally and historically fraught issue.  However, the greatest difficulty <Col N="755" /> arising if this ground is adopted in the Bill would be the implications for collective bargaining generally.  Where a trade union negotiated a rate of pay for work or conditions of employment in respect of a category or grade of workers, other workers not belonging to that trade union could resort to pursuing equal pay or similar conditions with the union workers on the basis that the pay rates or conditions were discriminatory. This would represent a major upheaval of collective bargaining arrangements. It would invite employers to pursue future enhancements in pay and conditions through the equality redress system rather than by collective bargaining.  Surely the essence of trade union activity is to secure better pay and conditions for members.  Is it appropriate, therefore, to leave it open to members of one trade union or those not members of a trade union to secure improvement in pay or condition solely by means of piggybacking on the efforts of another trade union?  Maybe the answer is yes but I doubt it.  The vast bulk of this kind of discrimination that occurs in collective bargaining is perfectly acceptable in legal terms.  Perhaps individuals, or groups in the case of trade unions, have a legitimate right to negotiate employment contracts and variations of them.  However, it is neither opportune nor wise to answer these questions definitively in this legislation. I do not propose to include either ground in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The consequences for the collective bargaining system must be examined in detail and the views of the social partners must be carefully considered. I accept that these grounds should be given detailed consideration.  Accordingly, I have decided to examine the case for adding new discriminatory grounds to the Bill, such as political opinion and trade union membership.  This legislative response signals the seriousness of the Government's commitment to consider the concerns of Senators on this matter and will allow the House to agree to the Bill, duly amended, on this point.</P>

      <P>The Minister has provided under section 69 to direct the authority to bring forward a code of practice.  It would be desirable that he direct the authority to bring forward a code of practice which would address not just discrimination in employment and equality of opportunity, but the problem of women-only employments, such as contract cleaning, where there is no male equivalent on which to draw a wage comparison.

      <P>I second the amendment.  I compliment Senator McGennis on the amount of work she has put into pointing out how difficult it is to get a comparator where women are involved in low paid employment.  It is sad that after 25 years of equality legislation women are still paid almost exactly the same ratio, about 70 per cent, of the average male wage.  I understand the Minister's difficulties but I wish to assure Senator McGennis that her efforts in raising this topic do not go unnoticed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGennis was anxious that I review the issue of the hypothetical comparator. As previously indicated, I have a real sympathy for what Senator McGennis wishes to achieve.  I have worked long hours on this subject but it has not been possible to forge a workable model on which to base a legislative provision of this nature.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women shared my view as to the difficulty in introducing this concept and recommended instead that the low pay of women should be tackled by other means.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out last week, I have not ignored the issue of equal pay for women in this Bill.  I have extended the scope for finding a real comparator over place and time.  That expands the availability of a real comparator over and above what was provided for in previous legislation. One no longer requires a comparator working in the same location or at the same time as was previously required.  This is a very valuable improvement. However, the greater potential for making progress, particularly in highly segregated employment, will be through the development of the codes of practice referred to be Senator McGennis and use of equality reviews and action plans provided for under the Bill.  The EU Commission has already published a code of practice on equal pay which contains useful advice on how to remove pay inequalities based on discriminatory assumptions or practices.</P>
      <P>I examined Senator McGennis's novel proposal to develop a notional comparator model and introduce it by regulation over a period of time. However, I have been advised that primary legislation would be essential to spell out the principles and parameters.  Regulations could only address matters of detail and an amendment along the lines proposed would be extremely vulnerable to constitutional challenge.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 40 in the name of Senator McGennis on Committee Stage sought to replace the gender specific personal pronoun in the subsection with gender neutral language.  In general, the Bill has been drafted in gender neutral terms.  However, there are half a dozen places apart from that identified by Senator McGennis where masculine gender personal pronouns occur.  In these cases, it has not proved possible without unduly contorting the language to provide a gender neutral text.  Following Senator McGennis's example, I approached the parliamentary draftsman on the issue who advised the use of both masculine and feminine personal pronouns in all cases but one, where a gender neutral text was devised.  I acknowledge Senator McGennis's valuable contribution on this point.</P>
      <P>Many Bills have used gender neutral language in recent years.  As far as I can ascertain, this is the first Bill to provide not only gender neutral language but gender balance in the matter of personal pronouns where gender neutral language cannot be achieved.

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 20, lines 18 and 19, to delete &ldquo;or has a propensity to engage,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I expressed concern about this on Committee Stage and am still unhappy with the use of the phrase &ldquo;or has a propensity to engage&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;engages&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister can reassure me because I am not clear how it is envisaged this can operate in a manner that does not intrude on the legitimate civil liberties of individuals.  If it were simply a question that the employer is aware on the basis of a criminal conviction that the individual engages in any form of unlawful sexual behaviour, there would be no problem.  However, I presume one cannot have a criminal conviction on a propensity to engage as distinct from engagement.  This raises the question of reliable information that the individual has a propensity to engage.  How can the informant know this unless individuals are engaged?  Much of our civilisation consists in our repressing our propensities to engage in evil behaviour.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that, given the kind of society in which we now live, this gives scope for malicious and vicious imputation of a so-called propensity to engage from motives which, on closer scrutiny, could be reprehensible.  Once there is the slightest rumour of anything to this effect, it would be very difficult for an employer to discard it because if something did go wrong it would appear irresponsible not to have credited it.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, this represents an intrusion into privacy which is difficult to justify on the basis of what is before us.  While such behaviour is revolting and while paedophiles, especially, have a capacity to conceal behaviour, behaviour rather than propensity to behaviour would be at issue in such cases.  This opens the floodgates to unjustifiable imputations and accusations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the suffering of any form of sexual harassment is appalling, it is also a traumatic experience to be unjustly accused of a propensity in that direction.  I hope there is some way of reconciling the need to protect vulnerable individuals with the need to also allow people their good name and allow them a mechanism to not just defend themselves against false accusations but for not allowing them to be entertained in the first place. <Col N="760" /> While this is a difficult issue, I hope the Minister sees my dilemma.  I also hope he accepts that the phraseology raises serious issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  This is a busybodies' charter.  It allows people to make serious allegations which may be unfounded.  I would be prepared to accept the term &ldquo;propensity to engage&rdquo;, but to use it in conjunction with &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; allows that action can be taken on the basis of information regarding a propensity.  It is a question of one or the other.  For example, monks taking a vow of chastity does not mean that they do not have a propensity to sexual activity or children's propensity for ice cream does not mean that they get ice cream.  The fact that one has a propensity does not necessarily indicate that the person is practising the activity.</P>
      <P>I concede that this is a very difficult area.  The onus must be to prevent anything from happening. However, it is a question of finding a balance. In this instance it is possible for a reputation to be destroyed or to make it extremely difficult for somebody to find employment on the basis of innuendo.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment goes some way to addressing this problem, but it does not go far enough.  If one were to leave in the phrase &ldquo;propensity to engage in any form of sexual behaviour which is unlawful&rdquo; it should be on the basis of reliable independent information.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment which identified the health board or the Garda as that source, although I am prepared to consider other voluntary or statutory agencies.  The difficulty I have is the conjunction of reliable information with the term &ldquo;propensity to engage&rdquo; because together they give a wide scope for misuse and for reputations to be destroyed.</P>

      <P>The fundamental principle, which is respected in this jurisdiction, that people are innocent until proven guilty comes into question. Under this section people would not be innocent until proven guilty because there can be a form of guilt by attainder which I do not consider acceptable.  It is worrying that the margin should be so broad in the terminology used &mdash;&ldquo;information&rdquo; that the individual has a &ldquo;propensity to engage&rdquo; in unlawful sexual activity.  That must be a matter of subjective conjecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of conviction for sexual activity which is unlawful is already covered.  We are not talking about the information derived from a <Col N="761" /> scrutiny of court records and convictions.  Thus, we are not talking about somebody who has been demonstrated to have engaged in these reprehensible acts.  Rather we are referring to somebody whom a third party may imagine has the capacity to commit these acts.  I agree strongly with my colleague, Senator Dardis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator have a propensity toward &ldquo;PD-ophilia&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do occasionally.  A reputable psychiatrist would indicate that at the core of the human personality there lies a complex area of urges which in civilised society, as Senator Lee pointed out, are held in check.  It would be possible to maintain that many people have all manner of outlandish propensities, although they are marginal.  What degree does one have to demonstrate and how is it demonstrated? How can there be reliable information that one has a propensity to engage in such activity unless that is clearly demonstrated?  If it is so demonstrated the people should be charged.</P>
      <P>I recall from some years ago the case of the actor who played Len Fairclough in &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;.  He was at the swimming baths with some children and he was supporting one of the children while teaching him or her to swim.  A busy-body reported him for sexual harassment of the child.  The story ran in the newspapers for months and his career was almost ruined.  It turned out to have been a complete misconstruction of the situation.  As this provision in the Bill stands somebody could be dismissed legitimately on the word of a third party with no criminal act having been committed.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider this principle, with which I am sure he agrees, that people are and should remain innocent until proven guilty. We should not follow the course of guilt by attainder.  I am sure the Minister agrees that if a person is not guilty he or she should not be punished. What else is the loss of one's employment except punishment?  Although the Minister's motives are worthy, the consequences may be quite different and may result in the punishment of the innocent.  It is not right for the House to pass legislation which could possibly have such results.  It is not acceptable that, in order to ensure that one potentially guilty person is punished, many innocent people should also suffer.</P>

      <P>We discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage and I supported the Minister in trying to strike a balance in favour of the vulnerable.  I understand Senators' comments that long-term damage could be caused by unfounded allegations.  There was a suggestion that this could be a charter for busybodies.  I presume the Minister is attempting to cover the case of a person who flees another jurisdiction where he or she may or may not have been charged and an employer comes into possession of information about allegations made in the other jurisdiction. <Col N="762" /> It has been repeatedly stated in the House that there must be a means of tracking people to ensure they cannot commit crimes.</P>

      <P>It is very serious to discriminate against a person on the basis of what is described as &ldquo;reliable information.&rdquo;  However, the Minister's amendment is very important with regard to access to minors.  I am relieved that he has included in the section a reference to &ldquo;other persons who are vulnerable&rdquo;.  The Minister may have read the astonishing reports of the case of the sexual harassment of patients in mental institutions. At times it can be very difficult to bring charges in such cases.  However, I think the Minister has done his best with a serious matter.  I agree with the concerns expressed by Senators Lee, Norris and Dardis about basing allegations on information.  It is a pity we could not have nominated sources for reliable information in the Bill although I understand the reasons that is not possible.  I share Senator McGennis's concerns and I will support the Minister's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, this was an extremely difficult section to frame.  It is not the normal case in which a person is innocent. We are dealing with an unusual and special situation where a particular protection is required. Had all other things been equal, the section would not have been framed in this way. However, we are addressing a very special, narrow kind of situation in which all other things are far from equal.</P>
      <P>To try to highlight and narrow down what I am addressing here, amendment No. 12 points to the direction of the ill which I am trying to contain. Does any Member seriously want to risk putting in danger any child or other disadvantaged person, as referred to by Senator Henry?  I doubt they do, including Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>Senator Lee asked if I understand his difficulty. Yes I do but, by the same token, I appeal to him to understand my difficulty and my responsibility to protect that most vulnerable section of our community &mdash; children.  They are in danger; this is not some vague concept which might happen. We know about the cases which have happened and their effects.  We cannot take risks with this and we must bend away from the normal balance which one would apply in any other case.  This is a variation on what one would apply in any other case but this is not a normal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be extraordinarily careful not to leave ourselves open at some future date to the charge that something happened to a child as a result of <Col N="763" /> our being too balanced on this issue.  I do not think any of us want to be subject to criticism or attack on that account but, if we are not extraordinarily careful about it, that could happen.</P>
    <P>In regard to the wording &ldquo;engages or has a propensity to engage&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;engages&rdquo; is in the present tense.  The amendment seeks to delete the words &ldquo;propensity to engage&rdquo;.  A person might not be engaging now and might not have engaged for some time but there might be grounds for supposing that the propensity to engage still exists. The word &ldquo;engages&rdquo; might not cover such situations.</P>
    <P>Of course, Senator Norris is correct that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  However, that has no real relevance to what we are talking about here; it has a relevance to a criminal prosecution, which this is not.</P>
    <P>I accept there can be adverse consequences for a person involved in those cases.  However, there is always the protection of a hearing before an equality officer.  It is not the case that any employer or potential employer can just state they have reliable information; that is not the end of the story.  The person may bring the employer to the equality officer who will decide whether it was reliable or adequate information.  My intention is to focus section 16(4) by the insertion of the new section 16(5), which I hope will be of assistance in enabling us to proceed in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  Amendment No. 12 clarifies the intention, in a sense, although I do not think the principle it incorporates is in any way affected.  It simply focuses the concern on a more limited group of particularly vulnerable people, which I accept.  However, I am still uneasy about the way the balance has been struck.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's difficulties.  He stressed that the word &ldquo;engages&rdquo; is in the present tense. However, the Bill states &ldquo;on the basis of a criminal conviction of the individual ... that the individual engages...&rdquo;.  By definition, a criminal conviction is in the past.  I think anybody would assume that once a person has such a criminal conviction their propensity to engage in such behaviour continues.  That is on the basis of court evidence and proof rather than suspicion, accusation, allegation or what is called reliable information. That is an entirely different category, and requires no justification or clarification, from the propensity basis, which is not based on a criminal conviction but on &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo;.  How can it be reliable information unless there is evidence of something having occurred?</P>
      <P>Senator McGennis used the phrase &ldquo;allegations in another jurisdiction&rdquo;.  I draw attention to the distinction between reliable information and allegations. It does not matter whether the allegations are made in this or another jurisdiction, the question is whether they are reliable.  That wording does not resolve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> I am sorry it does not seem possible to find a phraseology which guards against the danger of false accusation.  Once such an accusation is made it is impossible for the accused individual to escape the taint of the allegation for the rest of his or her life; such allegations linger forever in our small and incestuous society.  If it is not possible to find a superior phraseology I will have to accept the Minister's phrasing because there has to be protection for the vulnerable.  However, I am very sorry it does not seem possible to achieve a phraseology which guards more effectively against the fear I am expressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on record my appreciation of the extremely constructive debate on this provision by Senators last week.  I am also grateful to other groups, particularly the Employment Equality Agency and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which also pressed for some adjustment in the present text.</P>
      <P>I was particularly struck during last week's debate by the divergence of views on what would constitute the best way forward.  On one hand, some Senators sought to highlight the need for harassment to be defined by reference to the views of the victim.  On the other hand, other Senators sought to enshrine a more objective approach, drawing on principles of fair play and equity.  I know exactly from where Senators on both sides of this argument are coming as I wrestled with these considerations throughout the drafting process.  I have listened carefully to what Senators said and I hope the amendments I have tabled to section 23 will be welcomed as an effective response to the concerns raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first two amendments are technical amendments to subsection (1) which derive from the creation of a new subsection (2).  This substantive amendment provides more explicitly for <Col N="765" /> protection against harassment whether it occurs in the workplace in the course of employment or otherwise where, by reason of rejection or acceptance of that harassment, the victim would be treated differently in the workplace or it would be reasonable to consider that the victim would be so treated.  This strengthens the provisions of the section as regards <i>quid pro quo</i> harassment and draws on a similar provision in the Equal Status Bill.  I commend it to the House and trust it will be supported.</P>
    <P>The substantive amendment also incorporates a new subsection (3) which replaces the former subsection (2) that applied the reasonable person test.  Senators will note I have moved from the reasonable person test in this regard.  I ask Senator Norris in particular to note this, notwithstanding his suggestions about political responsibility in responding to amendments.  The description of acts of harassment in paragraphs (a) to (c) are still as outlined previously, although I have removed the term &ldquo;express&rdquo; in paragraph (b) as Senator Henry requested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The test for determining whether the acts constitute harassment is set out at the end of the new subsection.  This retains an objective test of reasonableness by application of what could reasonably be regarded as offensive, etc. However, it also ensures that what could be regarded as reasonable must take due account of the views of the victim.  This concern was emphasised by Senator McGennis in particular.  The reference to unwelcome conduct and the focus on what is offensive to A specifically encompass relevant subjective considerations.  In determining what is offensive, therefore, it is not only relevant but required to have regard to the position of A, the victim.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied this wording better reflects the Labour Court approach in this area to date.  It will also facilitate reinforcement of the importance of the victim's views by means of an approved code of practice along the lines of the current widely accepted code prepared by the Employment Equality Agency in consultation with the social partners.  This revised subsection achieves another objective.  It specifically responds to Senator Dardis' amendment No. 25 on Committee Stage which sought to broaden protection beyond what was sexually offensive to cover what is offensive on the gender ground.  The revised subsection provides protection from harassment which may not be sexual in nature but which is based on attacking the dignity of workers by reference to their gender.  I am sure everybody can think of examples where disparaging remarks relating to gender, but without a sexual connotation, can be most offensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further technical amendment arises in the old subsection (3), which would, as a consequence of my amendments, become subsection (4).  It derives from the creation of the new subsection <Col N="766" /> (2) and the need to refer to workplace in lieu of the place of employment.</P>
    <P>The amendment to subsection (4) arises because the concept of harassment beyond the workplace has been introduced in the new subsection (2).  It must be borne in mind that this section targets the employer to prevent harassment. Therefore, it is the employer against whom a remedy is available in the Bill and it need not be the employer who is perpetrating the harassment. When we try to provide protection beyond the workplace, therefore, it is necessary and only fair to give the employer some scope to defend a claim of harassment where it would not have been practicable for the employer to prevent the harassment concerned.  In the case of harassment outside work, the employer can show steps taken to prevent the victim being treated differently at work, or where different treatment has taken place, that the effects of that treatment have been reversed.</P>
    <P>We now have a finely tuned and substantially enhanced sexual harassment provision based on these amendments.  I am wholly indebted to the Senators who contributed to the debate on this matter.  I hope they will recognise all the factors on which they expressed concern have been suitably addressed in the amendments.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing a number of amendments to section 32, which follow directly from the improvements proposed for section 23 relating to sexual harassment.  Two technical amendments adopt the term &ldquo;workplace&rdquo; in lieu of place of employment.  I am introducing another amendment equivalent to the <i>quid pro quo</i> provision in section 23 which seeks to ensure that different treatment in the workplace consequent on rejection or acceptance of harassment, whether in the workplace or elsewhere, will also be prohibited. In a new subsection (3) I am providing an equivalent subsection to section 23(3) which elaborates on who might constitute a client, a customer or other business contact.  Omission of such a text in section 32 appears to have been an oversight which I am happy to rectify.</P>
    <P>I am introducing an amendment to the current text of section 32(3) to ensure that protection is afforded from harassment not only when the victim belongs to a discriminatory category covered by the Bill but also where the victim is believed by the harasser to belong to such a category although the victim does not belong to it.  This will make it unlawful to harass a person in employment on the grounds that the person was thought to be a member of the travelling community, although the person is a member of the settled community.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing an amendment to subsection (3) which removes the reasonable person test and introduces the concept of unwelcome conduct which could reasonably be regarded as offensive to the victim.  This is directly linked to the model put forward for section 23 and I hope it is acceptable to the House as a better approach. In relation to subsection (4), I am introducing an <Col N="767" /> amendment along the lines of that for section 23 which addresses the reasonable steps defence by the employer both as regards harassment in the workplace and outside it which results in discriminatory treatment at work.  I trust Senators will support these amendments and allow the harassment model in the section to adopt the improvements already proposed for sexual harassment.</P>

      <P>Reasonable Members of the House must concede that the Minister has taken on board the terms and spirit of the amendments moved on Committee Stage.  It was difficult to find a reasonable person in the Chamber last week because Members sought to achieve completely different objectives.  However, it appears the Minister has taken those points on board and considerably improved the section.  I said on Committee Stage that my objective was to ensure that the effect of sexual harassment on the victim was established in the section, while other Members wanted to ensure that a reasonable person would judge the effect.  I said I would not insist on the inclusion of the wording of my amendment.  I am glad I did so because the Minister's amendments immeasurably improve the section.  I have no hesitation withdrawing my amendment.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on a fine and comprehensive set of amendments which, as Senator McGennis said, improve the Bill.  I unhesitatingly withdraw amendment No. 17 because the Minister has met every consideration in it.  He will recall that on Second Stage I pointed out &mdash; as others did &mdash; that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;express&rdquo; omitted the more insidious and implicit type of harassment.</P>
      <P>I am also glad the Minister introduced the notion of unwelcome attention.  It is important that we are not too grim in our attitude towards this area but the Minister has balanced the position extremely well regarding the imputation of membership of a group.  This may not be dishonourable because there is nothing wrong with being a member of the travelling community or with being gay.</P>
      <P>For some people, the ludicrous attachment of labels of this kind to people in the workplace can be very humiliating and is intended to be so.  I am aware, as I am sure the Minister is, of a number of tragic cases in which, without any physical action, imputations about the sexual activity or the social background of people in the workplace have led to tragic consequences.  One young person was persecuted and mocked to such an extent that they were led to take their own life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken on board the sentiments expressed in this House, has gone away and, with his draftspersons, has come up with a very fine series of amendments.  I welcome them and I think the debate we had last week shows the value of this House.  I am sure the Minister will agree that, as a result of the work we have <Col N="768" /> done co-operatively as a Legislature, the Bill is now improved.</P>

      <P>I did not see the Minister at the conference on sexual harassment in Dublin Castle but he must have had some spies there because there is now much more of a spirit of what trouble can be resolved regarding sexual harassment in his amendment than was in the original section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am particularly glad the Minister has put in amendment No. 15 &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) in its application in relation to the workplace and the course of A's employment...&rdquo; because this is terribly important.  If one reads any of the literature the Susie Lampugh Trust has brought forward and the concerns it has had about problems which do not just arise within the workplace but within the course of the person's employment, this is most important.

      <P>As a Labour Party Senator, I cannot be the only one not to congratulate the Minister as he addresses our concerns so comprehensively, effectively and well.  This is yet another moment of congratulation for him and his staff. The issue of sexual harassment was one which hung around for many years and was touched on in terms of the formulations of codes of practice, etc.  However, as a member of the women's rights committee, we were extremely concerned that the issue would be addressed in some shape or form. <Col N="769" /> I am delighted to see it being addressed so comprehensively and thoughtfully in the response to what has been a very good debate in both Houses on the issue, particularly in the Seanad.  I congratulate all those involved in writing this into the Bill before us today.  It is effective and welcome legislation which is dealing with sexual harassment at long last.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 26, line 2, to delete &ldquo;violent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with how the Minister envisages this section operating in practice and I would like to tease out the implications of the precise phraseology and the use of the term &ldquo;violent&rdquo;. As I understand it, an officer of the Garda Síochána or a prison officer, depending on the context, has to make dispositions, presumably in advance, to cope with a situation that may arise.  When is violence presumed to have commenced or when is there a suspicion that violence may commence or a fear that violence may be potentially involved?  How does it affect the manner in which the authorities cope with, or anticipate, the implications of what may arise?  With regard to &ldquo;in order to guard, escort or control violent individuals or to quell riots or violent disturbances&rdquo;, I want to raise a technicality; what is a non-violent disturbance?  When is a disturbance violent or non-violent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;violent individuals&rdquo;, does that mean individuals have to demonstrate violence before they can be identified as violent or, if I may quote a phrase used earlier, are individuals who are known to have a propensity for violence to be eligible for treatment and disposition of the resources of the law in this manner?  Let us consider <Col N="771" /> a practical situation that may arise.  Suppose there are known subversives, drug dealers or people known to be potentially active in that area in a crowd, do the authorities have to make their dispositions on the assumption that this crowd is peaceful until such time as it actually turns violent at which stage it may be too late to take the measures necessary to control the crowd effectively? I am concerned with the operational implications of these proposals before us.</P>
    <P>The definition of violent and what the legal constraints on the authorities may be form one possible interpretation, as I see it, of the phraseology here.  I am not at all disposed to be adversarial or awkward in this.  Let me put it like this, however important equality is, security is even more important.  One cannot have equality in a State unless security is guarded in the first place.</P>

    <Title>Irish Horse Racing Industry: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SamMcAughtry" hpid="Mr. McAughtry Mr. McAughtry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I come to the House this evening after two successful days at Cheltenham, which should give me some authority on this matter. However, I was successful because I did not go.  We cannot blame the Irish Horseracing Authority if we do not back winners at Cheltenham. Overseeing the horse racing industry is not an easy job for the IHA.  Racecourses must make profits to survive and keep up with the times and other leisure industries.</P>
      <P>Horses must be trained and training must be a viable business.  There is not much in it for owners when one looks at the statistics.  It is only a fun sport for many but they deserve better prize money.  It is intended, however, that they will get an increase in prize money.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry said that the structure of thoroughbred breeding is unique and that, on the one hand, there is a relatively small number of specialised stud farms with large numbers of mares and stallions while, on the other, there is a substantial number of farmer breeders, most of whom have one or two mares producing foals and these breeders have gone through a difficult period and combine a passionate interest in horse breeding with a more traditional farm enterprise. Breeding is a difficult and complex industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IHA is responsible for the business side of racing and is supposed to come up with bright new ideas.  It was established to replace an earlier body when time caught up with the horse racing business.  It oversees an industry which provides 10,000 jobs and 25,000 incomes, of which breeding provides 5,000.  Representatives of all sectors are on the board with the exception of the racegoer. <Col N="772" /> Curiously, there is no place for the racegoer, although some may claim otherwise.  The reason is that the Racing Club of Ireland is the most highly respected organisation from the racegoers point of view.  It is articulate, informed and highly respected and was honoured by the presence of President Robinson at its annual dinner last year.  It is a pity the Racing Club of Ireland, which has been in existence for many years, is not represented on the board of the IHA.</P>
    <P>I visited the IHA headquarters to up date myself on this matter.  I was received most courteously and my questions were answered readily. People have been brooding about the IHA, but we cannot please everybody.  I spoke to it about its five year plan, which I will outline.  The plan emerged after two years and a great deal of impatience on the part of those who were to receive it.  It plans to update facilities on racecourses jointly with the racecourses.  Some £30 million will be spent under a capital development fund to attract new patrons to increase betting and sponsorship.  Some 80 per cent of the fund will be spent on eight key racecourses in Ireland while the remainder will be spent on grade two and grade three racecourses.  Looking at quality of racecourses which are not entitled to anything, people may say the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.</P>
    <P>The authority also plans an intensive marketing campaign.  By giving assistance, support and incentives to racecourses, attendances, betting and sponsorship will substantially increase.  Here I come to the aspirational part of the five year plan.  A great deal of it is aspirational, something the IHA admits.  We must accept the IHA's word and support it.  Phrases such as &ldquo;intensive marketing campaign&rdquo; are tired and well trampled and I wish the IHA luck in this regard.</P>
    <P>A merit system will be introduced in which better fixtures will be allocated to racecourses with the best performance under the headings of investment, attendances, sponsorship and betting. This classifies racecourses, and I am sure it will not be well received by grade three racecourses.</P>
    <P>The tote will also be radically transformed.  I, and I am sure other Members, could talk about nothing else but the tote this evening because it is the main bone of contention.  I cannot understand why a totalisator system does not make money; it did not make money last year.  The IHA will reduce costs substantially and upgrade technology, which is necessary.  In England tote dividends come through in two or three minutes but in Ireland, one must wait ten to 12 minutes to find out how much one is lifting, usually it is not very much because the tote pays out less than the SP on a horse which is first, second or third.</P>
    <P>The IHA intends to spread the tote to outside betting shops or what it calls the High Street. There are objections and pitfalls to this move, which I am sure will be highlighted.  Paddy Power's general manager, Mr. Stewart Kenny, said that up to January of this year, the IHA had not consulted them, yet it was talking about putting <Col N="773" /> tote outlets in betting shops.  An Irish satellite racing channel will be created so that live pictures of Irish racing will be available.  It has set a target of £5 million by the year 2001 and we wish it well in that regard.</P>
    <P>The breeding sector will be supported by the authority which sets as its objective the maintenance of the current tax exemption on stallion nomination fees, the introduction of incentives to improve the brood mare band and obtaining Government approval for a statutory foal levy scheme.  Given its substantial contribution to the economy and the fact Ireland is unique among major racing industries worldwide by not receiving any direct share of the substantial off course betting industry, the authority is seeking increased Government support for the industry and is targeting an increase in the current level of 2 per cent of 1996 off-course betting.  This would increase Government aid from £8.5 million to £12.5 million by the end of the plan, I wish it will.</P>
    <P>The IHA should not have given way by agreeing to this modified system.  Bookmakers once emptied racecourses by going on strike after which the IHA should have stood up to them. Its failure to do so led to the modification.  The authority is targeting an increase in the prize fund from £14 million to £25 million by the year 2001. This will be a difficult target to achieve.</P>
    <P>After all the agonising over the tote one wonders why suddenly there is talk of applying strict business practices.  This should have happened long ago.  It is like the Conservative Government getting excited about education now that it is on its last legs.</P>
    <P>Last November, after two years' work on the plan, the estimated figure of £20 million High Street turnover was reduced to £7 million.  This accounting alteration raised many eyebrows.  The IHA says that this year's surplus of £440,000 will rise to £2.5 million by 2001.  In January, Stewart Kenny stated that the IHA had not approached him.</P>
    <P>Aggressive marketing is an impressive sounding term.  There is no reason to believe that the IHA has not got the people to implement it.  I was impressed by its efficiency and the manner in which I was received.  However, interim reports are essential to assessing progress.  This point was made by the Racing Club of Ireland.  The only way to prove whether aggressive marketing is working is to issue interim reports, even though this may not be to the liking of those involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McAughtry and I agreed that the unwritten wording of the motion should be that the Irish Government be encouraged to make racegoing as attractive as possible to Irish punters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senator for outlining the bones of what is required as the authority sees it and I look forward to hearing Members' views.  I welcome the Minister and remind him that he and I meet every year for a convivial few drinks on the last <Col N="774" /> few days of the Listowel races.  That is where I would like to start.</P>
    <P>Racing is fun.  However, that is becoming a well kept secret.  We are building walls around racecourses. The GAA was established at a time when Ireland was fighting for its identity.  We were like those on continental beaches who put towels on the sand to mark their space.  The first thing many GAA clubs did was build a wall around the pitch so that no one could see without paying in.  Many of our racecourses are like that. When one goes to a race track the vast majority of those present are over 45 years of age; young people do not go to race meetings.  I live in north Dublin which, in many ways, is the home of horse racing.  People live and breed horses in the area and the young people enjoy horse racing.  I will tell the House why people do not go racing in the same numbers as years ago.</P>
    <P>I used to go racing as a young man.  When I married racing was still attractive to me as a pastime. Now if a couple go racing they must pay an entry fee of up to £10 each.  That was the price at Leopardstown at Christmas.  This is scandalous. This means they must pay £20 before they get in the gate.  That is a lot of money.  Most other industries would be delighted to get people in the gate and then collect revenue by selling burgers or encouraging them to bet or go on the tote, etc.</P>
    <P>It is extremely expensive to go racing.  I was racing at Navan on Sunday.  There were two adults and two children.  The entry fee was £20, and this is a lot of money for many people.  I handed over £20 of dry money yet I did not get a receipt.  Once we were inside we had difficulty getting a race card.  In addition, our children complained that a can of Coke cost 85p in comparison to 50p or 60p everywhere else.  As far as the children were concerned this was their pocket money and why should they have to pay an additional 35p for a can having paid in at the gate?</P>
    <P>At every race meeting I go to people criticise the late and low pay out by the tote.  Only occasionally does it match ring prices.  Whenever it is better than ring prices it is a matter of great interest.  The tote should always pay more than the ring.</P>
    <P>There is very little comfort at most race tracks. A football game takes two hours.  However, a race meeting can take four hours.  People need to sit down and have a certain degree of comfort, yet this is not being provided.  There is no comparison with the facilities at dog tracks.  The lack of facilities dissuades people from going to race meetings.  Old people will not go because it is not comfortable, young people will not go because they cannot afford it and those in between are asking whether it is good value.</P>
    <P>Irish people like national hunt racing, even though flat racing is more popular internationally. However, Irish people have always felt an attraction to jumps.  National hunt racehorses compete for six, seven or more years.  People get to know the horses and characters develop.  No flat horse in the last five years could have commanded the <Col N="775" /> same interest as Danoli, Imperial Call or Doran's Pride.  If one asks Irish people to name horses they will always name steeplechasers.  One would have difficulty finding one person in 15 who could name the winner of last year's Irish derby.</P>
    <P>We need to look at the commercial aspects of this issue.  This is a potentially huge tourist attraction, including for small courses.  Courses in places which are not so well known, such as Kilbeggan, Roscommon and Ballinrobe, are extraordinary attractions.  Before Kerry became a huge tourism magnet, it always had the attraction of racing.  There was Killarney in July for the fashion, Tralee in August for the fun and Listowel in September for the farmers after the harvest. They were three great racing festivals which no one could avoid.  If one wanted something to do in early August, one could go to the only decent race meeting, the Dingle race meeting, which was held under no rules except local ones. People are attracted to these meetings and there is huge international interest as well.  There is something in them for all Irish people and we should abolish the entry fee, open the gates and get people interested in racing again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the recent development programme for the racing industry.  I welcome the grants made available for racetracks, especially Roscommon, which has enjoyed much success as a result of the efforts of its hard working committee.  It has installed many new facilities and the track now has a high reputation and receives support from trainers in every corner of Ireland.  The Minister was obliged to assist the local effort.  Kilbeggan is another track in the area which has undergone considerable development.  The crowds at the evening meetings in Roscommon and Kilbeggan are huge and the meetings are going from strength to strength.</P>
      <P>It is only some years ago that small tracks were supposed to be going out of business, which was the thinking then.  That was wrong because small tracks have survived and developed and now add huge character to the racing industry.  They give the opportunity for small trainers to run their horses with a chance of success.  The policy of giving grants to these tracks has paid off and I compliment the Minister for that.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned that racing has tourism potential.  I recently met people from England who came over on racing holidays.  There are races almost on a daily basis during the summer and this is an opportunity for tourists to see the country and travel from one meeting to another. This is provided they back winners because it is not easy to travel around while backing losers.  It is important for punters to win as well as the bookies, who seem to win anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While facilities are important, the breeding industry represents an ongoing commitment and challenge to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which must facilitate and assist breeders.  It is a rapidly changing business. <Col N="776" /> Some point to point meetings have 12, 13 or 14 races which must be divided into three divisions with 15 runners in each one.  This indicates the number of horses in the country and the level of breeding.  The export to England of National Hunt horses is a huge industry.  The reputation of Irish horses, at National Hunt level or on the flat, is known around the world and must be continually developed.  Other countries have recently developed their horse industries so Ireland must keep pace with what is happening internationally.</P>
    <P>There is no better way to enjoy an evening than to attend a race meeting or a point to point.  The latter have become extremely popular and it is a section of the business the Minister might examine in future with a view to assisting those involved in it.  It is an important part of the horse industry.  The people involved put in a lot of work because organising and running a point to point is a big undertaking.  The work is generally voluntary and those involved deserve support and recognition.  People often come from abroad to watch point to points and, perhaps, to strike a deal at the end of the evening.  The owner of one of the winners today at Cheltenham was at Fairyhouse last year and bought the horse at the races there.  He said he was not sure what he was doing at the time, but the horse with which he ended up going home won for him today in Cheltenham. The Minister should keep up the good work and I ask him to examine the point to point area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I send my best wishes to the President, Mrs. Robinson, and her husband on her announcement today that she will not run for a second term.  I congratulate her for the work she has done for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the two Kilkenny people who won the two races today in Cheltenham, Aidan O'Brien and Paddy Mullins.  No mention is made in the Irish Horseracing Authority's annual report of Gowran Park.  According to the authority's plan, no funding is to be made available for that race track although it is in the heart of the best national hunt country in the world, which has produced Red Rum and 90 per cent of good national hunt horses.  It has been equally good at producing horses for flat racing and their trainers.</P>
      <P>The £30 million provided by the Government will be spent on the Curragh, Fairyhouse, Galway, Leopardstown, Limerick, Listowel, Punchestown and Mallow.  A significant part of the funding will be spent on Mallow because of Denis Brosnan's huge investment.  I ran horses there when I had money, which was before I was elected to the Seanad.  We won because our competitors could not deal with the water on the track.  I hope Denis Brosnan has dealt with that problem, but there are rumours that that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was first elected to the Seanad in 1977 I had bought a quarter share, or a leg, in a horse. We wondered what to call it.  My three partners were McNamara, Cullen and Ryan so <Col N="777" />&ldquo;Mclacurry&rdquo; was suggested as was &ldquo;The Senator Mclacurry&rdquo; because I had been elected to the Seanad.  The Senator went on to become a very good horse and was trained by John Joe Walsh near Senator Sherlock's home.  It qualified for the English National by winning a point-to-point; if a horse wins a point-to-point it does not have to win its bumper.</P>
    <P>I have been at race meetings since 1948 and seen big punters come and go.  The big punters do not last.  The people who go to race meetings for enjoyment are those who continue to go. Therefore, the racing industry must look at providing entertainment for those who do not go to break the bookmakers.  I have never seen a bookmaker leave a race meeting on a bicycle, but they enter in good cars.  A lot of punters leave on bicycles and, if they go in on bicycles, they leave without them.  Anyone who thinks they will break the bookmakers is a fool.  If the horseracing industry is to develop as an industry for the people, they should not try to satisfy the bookmakers or the tote but satisfy the people out for a great day's entertainment.  I disagree with anyone who feels it is not good value for £10 or £20.</P>
    <P>If the entertainment is to be provided, the punters must be able to see the horses.  In many cases, when the horses enter the parade ring, children have no hope of seeing them unless it is a very minor meeting.  Usually the horses cannot be seen until they are on the track.  The facilities for children to view horses are abominable.  If one goes to a race meeting in America there is a good chance the children can see the horses, which is what racing should be about.  People should be able to assess the horses and develop their interest in them.</P>
    <P>I agree that 90 per cent of those who go to horse racing are pretenders.  They are pretending they are gambling hugely; they pretend they do not lose money; and they pretend to their wives when they go home that they only took £20 to the meeting and only lost £20, as I often did.  The wife usually finds out the truth the following day.  Anyone who pretends otherwise is a fool.</P>
    <P>Senator McAughtry said there is no representative of the punter or the public among the authority members.  There are some very good friends of mine on the board but they all represent interests within the industry.  There is nobody there from outside the industry to tell them where they are going wrong.  A huge amount of money has been spent on the Curragh; and when one sees grade 1 horses running and perhaps two or three horses in a race at money on, this means there is no enjoyment for the punter.  A win increases the value of the sire of the winner when that horse goes to stud and that is what the race is for; it is not for the enjoyment of the punter.</P>
    <P>Too few people control the stallions and the mares in the flat racing industry.  Only a small number of people can get involved.  There is an occasional aberration where someone buys a cheap horse which gets through, but that does not happen very often.  The National Hunt is different, <Col N="778" /> as one may be able to go to the sales.  A friend of mine bought a horse at the sales for fun. He paid 120 guineas and sold me a leg for 120 guineas afterwards.  The horse was called &ldquo;Madness&rdquo; because we thought it was madness to invest when we learnt he had paid 120 guineas for the horse and we bought legs for 120 guineas each.  We sold that horse to the British Bloodstock Agency later and did well from the deal, but we were very lucky.</P>
    <P>This authority does not represent those who want to go racing as it represents the industry. The industry only produces money for those in that industry; it is not there to produce entertainment for spectators.  The small farmers have been great providers of animals which get on in the racing world but it is increasingly difficult for them to stay involved.  The industry will have to examine itself and provide the facilities mentioned by Senators McAughtry and O'Toole.  The general public must be able to enjoy themselves there and we must get away from the concept of eight tracks that must be supported.  If we do not support the small tracks they will close of their own accord.  Tramore would disappear and there will soon be 1,000 houses there.  What will happen to Thurles, Sligo, Tipperary and Listowel?  Without Limerick Junction this industry would be enormously deprived.  Mallow needs to be developed, but another course needs to be developed in County Cork; it is the biggest county in Ireland and there is only one racetrack there.  Denis Brosnan is putting huge amounts of money into Mallow and I assure Senator Sherlock that I hope it pays off, though I have my doubts. Listowel, Tralee, Limerick and Tipperary will not allow the Mallow track to develop to the extent that the money going into it suggests.</P>
    <P>Without Tramore, where would the National Hunt be?  It was said that once the horses went into the dip in Tramore, the jockeys decided who would come out first.  There was a lot of sense in that because at least those jockeys could have a race for themselves that owners, trainers and bookmakers knew nothing about.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator McAughtry for raising this matter.  A recent headline stated: &ldquo;A Brave New World for Horseracing&rdquo;.  I have my doubts, because that brave new world will not be produced by putting £30 million into selected tracks and not giving racing back to the people.  There were about 9,000 people at a point-to-point in Carlow last Sunday week and if one goes to Cork or Kerry one will see an average attendance of 5,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I am speaking on this matter when I hear the criticism of Mallow, one of the finest tracks in the country.  Soon it will be the only track in Ireland with a seven furlong straight.  Negotiations on this are almost complete, so Senator Lanigan can stick that in his pipe and smoke it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horse racing is both business and recreation, and its future must be addressed in this context. <Col N="779" /> The establishment of the Irish Horseracing Authority has, for the first time, given the horse racing industry both direction and focus and has provided a framework within which development can be managed.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome the confidence which the Irish Horseracing Authority has demonstrated by deciding to invest £5.6 million in the development of Mallow Racecourse, with private funding scheduled to bring the total investment to £8 million. Expenditure to date amounts to nearly £7 million, of which the IHA has spent £5 million, including £1.8 million on site purchase.  That purchase was of a racecourse that was successfully operated privately until recently, when facilities for patrons were not what they should have been. That investment is not only a vote of confidence in Mallow but in the whole east Cork region.  I remind Senators that efforts were made by groups of people in County Cork to build a racecourse, which failed.  I was justified in my prediction that Mallow would come out on top.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the continued development of Mallow Racecourse will result in long-term sustainable job creation.  The racecourse, which I hope will finally be opened in the summer, was due to open on 30 March but a technical decision was made that the turf was not fit to race on.  I have no doubt the racecourse will provide a spin-off for restaurants, hotels, bed and breakfasts and coach operators.</P>
    <P>Anyone can look up the record of Mallow Racecourse to see whether any meetings were ever abandoned because of flooding.  Recently, when races were abandoned, they could have taken place in Mallow.  The facilities for patrons are second to none.  It is a tremendous development. If anyone wishes to invest £1,000, they will receive a ten year ticket for the up-to-date stand.</P>
    <P>Horse racing has always been one of the country's main indigenous industries.  In the past it developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, without any reference to its broader economic context.  The establishment of the horseracing authority will facilitate integrated development, maximising job potential in the industry, and ensure linkages between all the relevant services.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brosnan is a capable man.  The fact that he is head of the Irish Horseracing Authority can only be good.  He saw the tremendous potential of Mallow Racecourse and that is how the IHA decided to invest in it.</P>

      <Col N="780" /> There are many well-known racehorse owners and trainers in County Limerick.  Last year, Limerick held only eight race meetings.  That is a very small number for a county that is supportive of horseracing, through ownership, training and riding. I do not live far from Mallow and I am delighted their racecourse has been upgraded. However, Limerick should not be forgotten either.  An important aspect of the racing plan is a heavy programme of investment under the newly established capital development fund, which will enable facilities and amenities at racecourses to be significantly upgraded.  The capital development fund, launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, at Adare on 30 May, 1996, was the cornerstone of the developments which occurred in 1996.  One of the first racecourses to benefit from this fund is the new Cork racecourse in Mallow.  Significant progress was made on Mallow Racecourse in 1996 and racing is scheduled to commence there in 1997.  Perhaps the Minister can send me an official invitation for the opening.  I have been at Mallow Racecourse several times and would like to be there for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I would also like him to note that while Mallow received funding last year, I would not like him to forget Limerick. There are plans to build a new racecourse in Greenmount.  The authority has grant-aided over £1.8 million towards the development of racecourse amenities in 1996.  Projects which qualified for grant assistance included work undertaken at the Curragh, Fairyhouse, Galway, Kilbeggan, Killarney, Listowel, Leopardstown, Roscommon, Tipperary, Wexford and Mallow. Limerick was not included, but I am sure that in future plans the Minister will look favourably and give it as much help as possible.  As a county so involved in all aspects of the horseracing industry, Limerick needs to be recognised.  The board of directors at Limerick racehorse track plan to build an outstanding course in Greenmount.  I ask the Minister and his Department to give it the grant aid it deserves.</P>
      <P>Many farmers have a mare or two to supplement their incomes.  These often produce good racehorses.  A neighbour of mine who died recently bred Devon Loch, who was winning the Grand National when the Queen Mother's horse collapsed.  People like these are the backbone of the racing industry.  At times they may breed a Derby or Gold Cup winner.  These winners often make their debut at point-to-points.  We have many of these in Limerick and they are important.  I would also like to see these progressing and receiving the support they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate we are discussing racing today on the second day of the <Col N="781" /> great Cheltenham festival.  I thank Senator McAughtry for initiating the debate at this opportune time.  His interest in and his enthusiasm for the racing game is infectious.  He has made an enormous contribution in furthering the development of racing in this country.  His article every Saturday in <i>The Irish Field</i> is a must for racegoers.</P>
      <P>Racing, more than any other sport in the world, has universal appeal.  No matter where one goes, what type of person one meets or what county one arrives in, there will always be someone who is prepared to talk about racing.  Racing is big business.  We are all familiar with the glory days of the Derby, the Grand National and the Aintree festival.  Much money has been invested in the bigger Irish race tracks.  Equalisation is crucially important if racing is to survive.</P>
      <P>In my county of Galway we are lucky to have the thriving Galway Racecourse at Ballybrit, which we are proud of.  It keeps the tote and racing authority going for many months of the year. The Galway Races are huge business and they bring in thousands of people, not alone from around the country but from around the world.  It is a huge festival and a huge boost to the economy of Galway city and county.  Long may it continue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will agree Listowel is a thriving racing festival. Patrons can sample the great atmosphere as they cross the river and hear the youngsters calling &ldquo;Throw me down something&rdquo;.  One immediately gets the feeling that one can relax and enjoy oneself. I compliment the executive in Listowel for the marvellous work it has done on that racecourse. It is an ideal autumn holiday and an exceptional race meeting.  A former Member of the Oireachtas, Gerry Lynch, is a member of the executive.</P>
      <P>If further money is to be invested in the larger race tracks, including Galway, it should be concentrated on areas outside the enclosures.  They are the areas where, as children, we started to follow racing.  The field, as it is called, is the location for the carnival.  In many racecourses this aspect of the industry has been neglected.  Many families go to race meetings for a day's outing but the facilities available for them at racecourses are becoming fewer and worse.  The facilities on the perimeters of the large racecourses should be examined and improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also should not lose sight of the fact that there are many small racecourses on the western seaboard.  Ballinrobe is a typical example of the wonderful interest in racing that exists in local areas.  That track was struggling to survive a few years ago; but as a result of the efforts of the energetic local committee, the supporters club and the wonderful leadership of the manager, Jimmy Tierney, it withstood the test and is now in the process of further development.  Racecourses such as those in Ballinrobe, Roscommon and Sligo must be maintained and funding must be provided to that end.  Such racecourses must <Col N="782" /> struggle to survive in the shadow of the great Galway festival meeting.</P>
    <P>The bookmakers and the tote have a large role to play in the future of the Irish horse racing industry.  I appeal to the tote to examine its dividend system.  Most Irish people who attend race meetings like to invest £1 or £5 on the tote but the dividend is usually extremely meagre.  It is in the interest of the tote to conduct an in depth study of its practices and to streamline its <i>modus operandi.</i>  Unless the dividends become more generous people will stop betting on the tote and that would be a retrograde development.</P>
    <P>Bookmakers have contributed a great deal to the development of racing, particularly in the sponsorship area.  However, huge amounts of money are wagered in the ring and invariably the bookmakers do well.  I appeal to them to invest more in the racing industry.</P>
    <P>There is an imbalance between the flat racing and national hunt sectors.  Huge money is invested in flat racing.  There are glamorous meetings in the Curragh and at other racecourses. Large scale owners and breeders are involved in this sector and there appears to be no financial limits to its success.  If money is to be invested in the industry, it should favour the National Hunt sector, which is the poor relation in the industry.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government to assist the development of the horse racing industry.  Many people have meaningful and worthwhile employment in the industry.  It is also a great tourist attraction which brings thousands of people to the country each year for the large festivals.  It promotes the name of Ireland throughout the world.  The Arkle statue, for example, has pride of place in the Cheltenham arena and few people have not heard of Vincent O'Brien and Dermot Weld.  Today, the small operators are begining to achieve fame and people are familiar with the names of Tom Foley and Fergie Sutherland.</P>
    <P>Horse racing also provides a meaningful pastime for unemployed people and those who have retired.  For a small amount of money people can spend a pleasant afternoon investing in all types of combination bets in bookmakers' shops throughout the country.  It also prevents people who have nothing to do from becoming involved in crime and other nefarious activities by giving them a meaningful endeavour.</P>
    <P>If horse racing is to survive, the Government should not forget the ordinary working person who cannot afford the corporate box or the special enclosure.  Entry fees to race meetings should be kept at a reasonable level and the small operator should be helped in every way possible. I hope that before the debate concludes the Minister of State or Senator McAughtry will give us one or two winners for tomorrow at Cheltenham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said on many occasions that fast women and slow horses put one on the road to ruin.  I do not know much about fast women but I know a great deal about slow horses because I was born and reared and still live within <Col N="783" /> a few miles of the Curragh racecourse.  I am familiar with the industry and the difficulties faced by small scale trainers and owners to stay in business at a time when expenses are significant.  Even when high training fees are paid for an animal in training, trainers do not make much money from them when all the costs are totalled.  Frequently it is only by trading the horses or by gambling on their performances that trainers can make money.</P>
      <P>The most significant event in the bloodstock business since the foundation of the State was the 1969 Finance Act which introduced the tax exemption on stallion income.  It provided that gains or profits to the owner of a stallion arising from the sale of services of mares by the stallion or to the part-owner of a stallion for the sale of such services or rights to such services would not be taken into account for any purpose of the Income Tax Acts.  That concession was extended to companies under section 11 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  In 1985 it was decided that the animals to which it applied should be ordinarily kept on land in the State, a sensible restriction.</P>
      <P>The effect of those legislative changes was to virtually double the size of the industry since 1969.  There are now 28,000 thoroughbreds in the country and a gross output of £50 million per year in the breeding industry and £257 million in live exports.  It is a hugely important industry and we must keep bearing that in mind.  It is the most important industry in County Kildare, both in terms of numbers employed and in terms of output. Frequently the industry is comprised of many small units, so while national racecourses such as the Curragh, Punchestown and Naas enjoy a high profile, the industry itself sometimes does not.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant aspects of the industry that must be addressed is the prize money.  There is a disproportionate skew in favour of flagship races, the classics.  Obviously the prize money for those events must be significant to attract top class international competition, which is most important.  Our thoroughbreds must take on top class animals from around the world and beat them.  That is what keeps the industry to the fore.  Smaller owners are suffering significantly, however, in terms of the prize money available at smaller tracks.  I will come to the issue of whether we have too many race tracks for our population later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those unfortunate people who bought an animal and put it into training for national hunt racing.  It was reasonably successful and while it did not win a race it was placed a few times, which brought great enjoyment.  Everyone tells you about the great crack in national hunt racing, which is true, but it is expensive crack.  When the horse is in training and the clock is running on a week by week basis it is not very long before you find yourself asking how you are going to fund this animal and whether you can stay in the business. That is the problem confronting most small <Col N="784" /> owners &mdash; the people who want to get into the business.</P>
    <P>Syndication has been a help and there have been some very successful syndicates of small investors.  That is one way to go but it is not the same as owning your own animal, or sharing ownership with a friend, and seeing the horse pass the post at Punchestown or even at Mallow in the rain.</P>
    <P>While I understand the financial constraints that racecourse owners are working under and how difficult it is to keep some of the courses going and to maintain facilities, as an owner I get upset and irritated at Thurles and some other tracks when I cannot park my car, cannot get a race card and find there is confusion about badges.  That is not good enough.  The Minister of State knows that if he turns up to play a GAA match basic facilities are provided and he will be accorded some status by the sporting organisation to which he belongs.  However, my experience as a small horse owner has been unsatisfactory because courses do not provide the necessary back-up, even though it would only cost a small amount of money to do so.  As a horse owner going to the race track you should be able to park your car in a favourable position, get into the track easily and receive a race card.</P>
    <P>There are two types of racing activity.  One is the big festival, which has been referred to, like Galway, Listowel and Punchestown.  Punchestown has been a hugely successful meeting due to the efforts of a few farsighted people who went to Cheltenham and persuaded people there to come to the meetings.  They built up an atmosphere. Punchestown has always been a central part of life in Kildare and everything closes down for it.  Long may it remain so.  The organisers have transformed it into a major flagship meeting for national hunt racing and sponsorship has helped to improve the prize money.</P>
    <P>The Curragh and Leopardstown are also flagships and for the industry to compete internationally those meetings are hugely important. It would be wrong to suggest that money should not be invested in those venues but channelled instead into smaller venues.  Of course, the smaller venues need support but if the industry is to survive at the forefront, the flagship meets are the ones on which that success will stand.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that horse racing is now an entertainment business.  It is part of what we are and we love it.  It is a great part of national life but it is also an entertainment business.  The courses that have taken that aspect on board are the successful ones.  There is much more to it than putting animals out to race.  There has to be an attraction for families.  We are living in an era where racecourses have to compete with immediate live entertainment on television, which is freely available to everybody.  That has been a huge problem for the industry and it is only now that places like the Curragh and Leopardstown are successfully coming to grips with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> When the Horse Racing Authority Bill was being debated, one of the questions I raised was about sponsorship of colours.  I asked why it would not be possible for every jockey coming down the straight at the Curragh to have sponsorship on their silks.  I notice that is almost becoming standard now.</P>
    <P>We will need a national course that is floodlit for night racing, and that will probably be Leopardstown. There is also the question of having an all-weather track.  In England such tracks have been of huge benefit.</P>
    <P>Small tracks are important but I wonder how sustainable they are.  Naas racecourse's facilities, for example, were not acceptable in this modern entertainment business.  It is only by selling land for building development that the course will be able to develop and attract people in competition to other sports.</P>
    <P>There must be a greater meeting of minds between the Turf Club and the Horse Racing Authority so that everybody will pull in the one direction.  I hope the National Stud continues to operate profitably.  It was great to see Indian Ridge arriving at the stud as a premier stallion.  It is a long time since the National Stud has had a stallion of that quality.  It is a flagship for the industry and it is important for the stud to be able to buy that type of animal.  It was able to acquire Indian Ridge thanks to the generosity of the animal's owner and the fact that the Oireachtas gave the stud the requisite amount of money to buy animals of that calibre.</P>
    <P>The question of a tax on betting going back into the industry was mentioned and, in my view, the money raised should go back into the industry. It should not be just another form of diverted income tax.  The other point is whether there should be betting facilities at Leopardstown.  We all know the disputes that have taken place with the bookmakers.  Coming back to the point about the entertainment nature of the industry, however, some of those matters will have to be carefully examined and taken on board.</P>
    <P>I was in Cheltenham last year, a Chathaoirligh, as I think you were.  When Imperial Call won the Gold Cup I immediately went to the saddling enclosure.  You have to get there fairly quickly to avoid being trodden on by 10,000 people who all want to be there at the same time.  On my way to the enclosure I heard two Cork men in deep conversation.  One told the other not to go home and say he had not bet on Imperial Call.  Even though neither had backed the animal, both agreed they could not return to Cork without claiming to have backed the Gold Cup winner.  I hope we will have another such winner with which to raise the roof tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad horse racing is being addressed as an industry because it is most important.  Senator Dardis gave us the figures for how many people are employed and the amount of money involved.  He pointed out that in his <Col N="786" /> county horse racing is of great importance.  If a major factory closes down we hear an enormous amount of fuss about it and everyone is called in to give support.  However, one often sees difficulties within racing and breeding, yet not much support is given.  Concern has been expressed by Senators from country areas about point to point meetings.  While they have been the training ground of so many national hunt horses over the years, point to point meetings seem to attract smaller and smaller turn outs and have increasing difficulty finding sponsorship.  I hope they will not be forgotten when we look at the major areas.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister try to get courses to look at their facilities?  Some of them are still quite primitive. Lavatory arrangements, particularly for women, are often inadequate and bar facilities can be just a wooden hut with little food provided. Despite the fact that an enormous amount of money has been spent on Leopardstown, some really terrible food was on offer when I was there. I wonder what sort of tendering process they have and whether there is good competition?  Plenty of catering firms tender to bring food to Dublin Castle and the College of Physicians so why can they not bring such food to Leopardstown?  It could be done just as easily.  I hope there is not a closed shop determining who gets to tender.  If the standard of food was improved it would be a great encouragement.  The last time I was at Leopardstown the choice seemed to be between chips, which had been fried in very old oil, and really terrible sandwiches, which are not great to have with your gin and tonic.  I can see that the Cathaoirleach shared the problem I had there.  It is all very well spending money on the infrastructure, but proper catering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have.  It is down the road from where I live.  Years ago I remember going to races in Albany and Louisville &mdash; this is to let the Senators know that I get around &mdash; and they provided a tremendous day out.  I do not know if Senators have been to either course, but they are incredible.  Both are flat courses but they are great places to go to.  Louisville erupts during race week.  They have a mammoth fireworks display to herald what they call &ldquo;Derby Week&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The advertising of our race meetings is unimaginative at times.  A card is given showing what is coming up and that is all.  The first time I went to Louisville was about 20 or 25 years ago and I thought I would never go back &mdash; there was no effort put into the occasion.  I have been there a few times over the past five years and it has been an incredible outing.  The fireworks display has almost taken over race week.  It is held over the river and they try to make it bigger each year and they are succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> While infrastructure is important we need to look at facilities, at housekeeping.  There should be no more chips fried in old oil or soggy cheese sandwiches with the corners turned up.  There is plenty of competition for entertainment.  This is an important industry and we must get people to support it.  There is not much good in having ten people and ten runners.  We need people to attend the meetings and to support the betting industry.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to aim for a standard in facilities.  Just because people say they have a champagne bar does not mean everybody is going to go there.  If it is warm champagne with sandwiches with turned up edges, why call it champagne? It becomes a down at heel outing.  There needs to be much better housekeeping.  The facilities at racecourses should be carefully monitored. If they are not found to be up to standard those in charge should be told that competition must take place in the running of them.  Otherwise people will say &ldquo;That is not going to be a great day out&rdquo;.  I will go again to Louisville, Albany or Saratoga if the Minister needs somebody for a fact finding mission.  Naturally, it would be in the interest of the country and not just for my own pleasure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is timely, but we are missing a few old heads to discuss the horse racing industry because they are in Cheltenham. Maybe for that reason we should have delayed this discussion until next week.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of issues facing the horse racing industry.  There are problems associated with trainers and owners not having enough finance available to them to pursue their investment. For example, how often do we go to National Hunt meetings?  A few hundred people attend and the prize money is paltry.  It does not even pay for transporting the horse to the course.  We have to examine the prize money in National Hunt racing.  Money raised on the tote should be reinvested and sponsorship should be increased. That gives the small trainer and owner an opportunity to make a few pounds if his horse comes good.  Very often they are dependent on the gamble at the bookie to pursue the investment.</P>
      <P>Facilities at courses was mentioned.  There is a perception that horse racing is the sport of kings. However, everybody who goes to horse racing meetings knows that it is a tough day out under difficult weather conditions and the facilities are not up to standard.  There is an image that horse racing is very glamorous, largely due to the glamorous presentation of meetings such as Ascot and the Melbourne Cup on television.  However, that impression is not factual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be more advertising of horse racing. We are still tapping into the small number of people who are very interested.  Not many other people follow racing.  Shelbourne Park dog racing has been successful because of advertising.  Young people who were previously not remotely <Col N="788" /> interested in dog racing have latched on to meetings because of the improvement in facilities and an aggressive marketing campaign.  It is now considered an exciting and enjoyable night.  We have fallen down again and again when it comes to advertising the joy of horse racing.  The perception among those who have no real interest in it is that you must be a gambler to go racing.  If they knew what it was about they might come along and enjoy it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take on board the necessity for an aggressive marketing campaign coupled with the renewal of courses and the upgrading of catering facilities in particular.  The average racer is not too concerned about these things &mdash; they can hack the rough going.  However, family members or people who are not very interested in racing could find the conditions unacceptable. It is a family sport with great potential, but most racecourses do not have the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>Mallow racecourse was mentioned.  It is a very welcome development.  I remind Senators who may have got carried away and emotional that we were on the other side of the House when that development was initially announced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Criticism came from Senator Lanigan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to my colleague from Cork, Senator Sherlock, who seemed to take credit for it.  I am glad the Government has continued to support and encourage it.  Thankfully, we will have a great racecourse in June and good racing in Mallow.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise the potential for job creation and tourism.  Good race meetings with high profile horses elevate the standard and structure of Irish horse racing abroad.  Everybody says that Irish horses are the greatest in the world for racing thoroughbreds and show jumping, but we are failing when it comes to elevating racing to the status achieved in England, Australia, France and other strong horse racing countries.  We have to examine this.</P>
      <P>The prize money at racecourses on an average day out is too small to encourage people to put effort into training and keeping a horse for the big win.  They could end up with a cheque for £1,400 on winning the race.  Everybody with a horse must be given the opportunity to win decent money.  We must also start an aggressive marketing campaign to encourage people and to point out the benefits of horse racing.  Most people look at horse racing either as the sport of kings or have a seedy image of a bookie office and a fellow losing his day's wages.  That image prevails because people are not aware of what horse racing is about.  It is an enjoyable sport which should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Mallow region will benefit substantially from the racecourse.  Mallow and Cork have strong traditions of horse racing, but the lack of courses over the past number of years has been a serious drawback.  Now that there is a <Col N="789" /> course the industry can be developed in the south.</P>
    <P>I thank all involved in the Mallow racecourse development.  They made a huge effort.  People from Mallow supported the venture.  It should be looked at as a model for other courses when raising investment.  Local businesses should be encouraged to invest because there is always a spin-off.  For example, the Galway races offer a most enjoyable week when people travel to the city even though they may not attend the races. We should organise good festivals, decent prize money and an aggressive marketing campaign to ensure that those who do not know what is involved in horseracing will be informed and encouraged to support the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to address the House on the future of the horseracing industry and I thank Senator McAughtry for introducing the debate. Since the Government assumed office there have been many significant developments in the industry. These have not happened by accident.  They are the result of hard work and commitment by a Government which recognises the importance of the industry.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has taken a personal interest in this sector.  We are providing an annual grant-in-aid to the Irish Horseracing Authority, the IHA, of £8.5 million to assist the authority in the implementation of a strategic plan for the development of the industry into the next century.</P>
      <P>We have overseen the launch by the IHA in 1996 of a capital development programme for the sector which will involve a combination of State and private investment to a total of £30 million. We have also provided special share capital funding for the National Stud over the last few years to help bring it back to profitability and allow it to continue providing its excellent service.  I am glad to note that it is projecting a significant profit for this year and this must be especially welcomed against the backdrop of the position just two to three years ago when it was sustaining annual losses of approximately £500,000.</P>
      <P>For most people who pay at the turnstiles, racing is a leisure activity.  However, for some 25,000 people who make a living in the equine sector, it is a serious business.  The fact that racing may be a sport does not take away from its economic significance to the country.</P>
      <P>While horseracing has a great tradition in Ireland, its continued success is not guaranteed or automatic.  In the ever expanding leisure sector it must compete for the discretionary spending of an ever more discerning and increasingly urbanised population.  The primary indicators for the Irish economy have been and remain positive. Excellent economic growth, low inflation and increased disposable incomes represent the favourable economic environment in which the equine industry currently operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> On the basis of the overall economic indicators one could be forgiven for assuming that the racing sector would be in a healthy state, if not booming.  Buoyancy should be the order of the day, but this is not so; the industry has problems. For any business to progress it is normally essential that a constant effort is maintained in growing income and controlling costs.  While the racing business has increased its income from the Government, it is interesting to look at other sources of finance.</P>
    <P>Betting and betting revenues are the life blood of the sport.  In the context of increasing non Exchequer sources of finance for the industry, increasing on-course betting revenue is essential as it is the main area of direct benefit to the industry.  On-course betting turnover in the six year period up to 1996 for bookmakers and the tote combined has dropped from £122 million in 1990 to approximately £96 million in 1996.  The decrease occurred mainly in bookmaker betting while tote turnover remained fairly static.</P>
    <P>This situation is poor enough in itself but when it is contrasted with the development of other forms of gambling over the same period it is disappointing. The turnover in off-course bookmaking showed solid growth over the same period, rising from £292 million in 1990 to over £400 million in 1996.  The performance of the national lottery is equally impressive.  From a standing start of £102 million in 1987 it shot forward to over £300 million last year.  We must therefore question why, contrary to this trend, the on-course bookmaker betting declined.</P>
    <P>If the punters are not at the races they cannot bet.  Ultimately, it is in the interests of all involved that more people go racing and begin betting. There will also have to be some changes to the way in which the bookmaker betting service is provided.  The IHA has already commenced with the introduction of on-course SP betting shops at some tracks.  Over time some practices have developed in the on-course bookmaker betting scene which are not conducive to facilitating or encouraging new entrants to the business.  I appreciate that change is difficult for all concerned; and while I am conscious of the dangers inherent in over simplifying the problems in this area, we must all agree that change is required if the on-course sector is to stand a chance of returning to the turnover levels of the 1980s.</P>
    <P>Turning to the tote, its financial contribution to racing could, at best, be described as modest. Currently the tote retains 21 per cent of turnover, with over 18 per cent being used to cover operating costs.  From a turnover of £19.5 million in 1996 returns would be £4.2 million with £3.6 million of this covering operating costs.  This leaves an estimated £0.6 million for reinvestment and a contribution to racing.  The tote will have to increase turnover and seek to reduce operating costs.</P>
    <P>Increasing attendances at race meetings must be a major aim of the industry.  Attendances declined from a 1989 figure of 1.1 million and bottomed <Col N="791" /> out at just over one million in 1993.  Since 1993, the attendance figures have grown slowly to a total of almost 1.1 million for 1996.  This represents an 8 per cent increase over the 1995 figure and a 10 per cent increase over the 1993 figure.</P>
    <P>However, it is not time for complacency. Recent studies have indicated that 35 per cent of all racegoers attend only one race meeting and do not attend again until the following year.  These studies also revealed three interesting facts: first, the core group of regular racegoers are males aged over 50; second, the 15 to 25 year olds were and are much under represented at racecourses; and third, Dublin dwellers were under represented at racecourses.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of work to be done to promote the sport in this city and among young people.  It is generally accepted that if people go racing when they are young there is a better chance that they will go racing later in life.  The market is there waiting to be exploited.</P>
    <P>Entry prices to racecourses pitched at levels which aim to maximise gate receipts inevitably tend to limit attendances and possibly reduce revenue from other activities &mdash; betting and otherwise &mdash; which take place on course.  At present the interests of the racecourse owners and the IHA do not readily coincide in this regard.  Common ground serving common interest must be found.  It is therefore worth looking at a more aggressive entry price policy to encourage racegoers, special promotions for students and young racegoers, both on a daily and a season basis, family tickets at all courses, and more work with Bord Fáilte to promote racing tourism packages.</P>
    <P>Turning to those who provide the entertainment, especially owners and sponsors, it is evident from the figures that most owners are not in the game to make money.  This year total prize money is expected to be £14 million from which, after deductions, owners will get £11 million.  It is estimated that the total costs of keeping 5,000 horses in training this year will be approximately £40 million, including entry fees.  Furthermore, the value of the horses in training in any one year must represent a capital investment of at least £80 million.  Accordingly, owners must be regarded as by far the main supporters of staging racing in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Prize money needs to be increased if we are to retain our current standard of racing.  There is an urgent need to establish a central sponsorship committee or group to set targets for achieving sponsorship levels for prize money and to take action to ensure these targets are achieved.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that some racecourses which were in difficulty not so long ago are now doing quite well, mainly due to local effort and commitment. For this reason there is little point in targeting any racecourse for closure.  However, minimum standards should be set down now or as early as possible for all facilities at our racecourses. The upgrading of facilities must be done on a planned rather than piecemeal basis.  Some <Col N="792" /> courses may be identified for development as flagships at which a superior standard of facilities can be made available.  There is a tremendous amount of goodwill on the ground towards the sport and local tracks in particular in all parts of the country.  Where possible a way should be found to harness this goodwill factor.</P>
    <P>A contribution towards a modest improvement in facilities together with a national programme promoting the sport could be of great help to tracks.  Furthermore assistance in finding community and local business support and sponsorship would go a long way towards putting those tracks that are facing difficulties on a sounder footing.  I would also like to see performance related incentives being introduced for tracks. Running and promoting a race meeting is an expensive business.  The incentive to attract serious sponsorship or to promote a fixture more widely can be restricted by the fact that, if a track succeeds in getting a large attendance, it only receives the admission charge and perhaps the bar profits for itself while the vibrant betting market created by its efforts yields little to it but substantial moneys to the IHA.  In order to give a track a real incentive to encourage higher attendances, greater sponsorship and bigger betting, the IHA should consider giving more generous development or maintenance grants or even special prize money grants to the racecourses that yield the better returns for the industry through the betting levies and tote profits.</P>
    <P>The development of non-racing activities at racecourses is another option.  In the greyhound industry, for example, a major development undertaken in 1995 was the provision of a grandstand restaurant, hospitality suites, new kennels and full bar facilities in Shelbourne Park at a total cost of £2.5 million.  The provision of these top class facilities has allowed Shelbourne Park to compete as a leisure and entertainment centre and to attract new customers to the sport of greyhound racing.  The results of this development, coupled with a strong marketing campaign, have been spectacular with attendances and tote betting up by over 100 per cent.  If the same ingenuity were applied in respect of horse racing I could see racecourses being used for a wide variety of events including, for example, county shows and air displays.</P>
    <P>The capital development fund which was launched in 1996 is a significant development and will lead to a planned upgrading of facilities at racecourses, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of horseracing.  The fund provides for a capital investment of £30 million.  This new initiative is a key turning point for the sector and will ensure its ability to expand and develop in a planned manner.  While major central support is now available, it is also critical that the business community invests in local racecourses.  Given the limited number of racing fixtures for each course, racecourse committees will have to look at non-racing revenue to maximise returns and assist in racecourse development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> The key points in relation to the development fund are that grants will be provided by the authority on the basis of 50 per cent of the cost of the approved projects.  The authority must be satisfied that racecourses have adequate resources to meet the balance of the cost or that necessary financing arrangements are in place.  An important objective of the fund is to assist racecourses to develop the full potential of their businesses. Therefore, the authority has stressed the importance it attaches to the use by racecourses of capital from the fund not only to provide enhanced facilities to accommodate the existing and potential market of each racecourse but also to assist in improving the revenue earning capacity of racecourses and to improve financial viability.</P>
    <P>In addition to developing facilities we must market the product.  This is a key area where substantial progress can be made quickly.  We need more focused marketing to specific groups at differential levels of pricing.  Young people are the key to the future.  Some courses have special youth promotion race days and this concept should be expanded.  Group marketing &mdash; as in the case of &ldquo;Go Racing in Kildare&rdquo;&mdash; is a welcome development.  The IHA has now begun to address these problems but much more needs to be done and a real difficulty is that most tracks do not at present have either the required skills or the resources.  It remains for the IHA to provide an anchor for this development.</P>
    <P>For all of these developments we should not forget that in order to deliver quality racing we need quality horses.  The structure of thoroughbred breeding is rather unique in this country.  On the one hand there is a relatively small number of specialised stud farms with large numbers of mares and stallions.  On the other hand there is a substantial number of farmer breeders, most of whom have one or two mares producing foals for flat or national hunt racing.  In recent years these breeders have had a difficult period with very little financial reward from the marketplace. However, their involvement is one of the strengths and stabilisers of the thoroughbred breeding sector.  They combine a passionate interest in horse breeding with a more traditional farm enterprise, such as cattle or tillage.</P>
    <P>Many breeders have acted in response to the message coming from the marketplace in recent years by reducing numbers.  With no support or safety net system in place it is vital to concentrate scarce resources on the production of quality stock which will bring long-term benefits. However, I am pleased to see that foal production numbers are beginning to expand again. In this context, I want to see a continued emphasis on the production of quality and higher prices to reward the breeders involved.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of stallion fee income has been a major factor in ensuring that Irish breeders have access to world class stallions &mdash; a vital factor in view of our reliance on exports.  The result of this and a strong marketing drive by <Col N="794" /> Irish Thoroughbred Marketing &mdash; a subsidiary company of the IHA &mdash; was that 1996 saw significant increases in yearling prices at Goffs and Tattersalls. Foal prices followed this trend.  Yearlings commanded an average price of almost £42,000 in 1996, as opposed to just under £26,000 the previous year.  Average yearling prices at Tattersalls also rose from £5,500 to £7,500.</P>
    <P>The Government is strongly committed to this industry.  This support manifests itself in a concrete fashion through the direct funding to the Irish Horseracing Authority, the operation of the National Stud and the taxation system.  In recent years most of the Exchequer funding was used for racecourse development, the provision of integrity services and to improve the level of prize money, especially at the lower end of the spectrum. While the Government is a willing helper, the future of horse racing ultimately rests in the hands of those directly involved.  The IHA has outlined its proposals in its strategic plan for the development of the thoroughbred racing industry for the period 1997-2001.  This plan deals with and sets out targets in all of the following areas: racecourse capital development, fixtures and programmes, prize money, sponsorship, attendances, the tote, bookmaker betting, on course betting shops, marketing the sport, the improvement of integrity services, satellite broadcasting, development of the breeding sector and the marketing of Irish thoroughbred horses.</P>
    <P>The IHA will require support from all sectors of the industry in the implementation of the various aspects of the plan.  I would urge all those involved in the horseracing industry to support the IHA in its efforts to provide the best possible environment for this important sector and within which racing can thrive and reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>Senators raised a number of points.  With regard to funding for tracks, the better tracks must get the funds and the fixtures as they are the only ones likely to draw the people and generate betting.  However, all tracks may qualify for some development funds but there must be a strong incentive for those which perform.  That is the commercial reality.  I agree that improved facilities make higher attendances more likely.  At present many of our larger tracks are underfunded and we have to start with the flagship tracks and, in time, move on to second and third category tracks.</P>
    <P>In regard to racegoers being represented on the IHA, it is for the Minister to decide which organisations represent racegoers.  In 1994 the then Minister picked one of the three nominees submitted by the Racing Club of Ireland, the organisation to which Senator McAughtry referred. Therefore, racegoers are represented on the IHA.</P>
    <P>I was glad the Senator was impressed by the IHA staff and the attention which he received when he looked for briefing material for this motion.  The IHA was established in 1995 with a new chief executive officer and junior management <Col N="795" /> team.  In that short time it has presented a strategic plan to the IHA board.  It is a very good staff and I am not surprised the Senator was impressed by its performance.</P>
    <P>The tote was referred to by a number of Senators.  The new management is looking at the tote and examining all the options.  In 1996, through good management, the tote yielded £600,000 for reinvestment and contribution to the industry.  This can be improved but it must be worked at, which the IHA is doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the capital development fund.  The £30 million is comprised of £15 million to be provided by the IHA and £15 million to be provided by the racecourses.  I refer the Senator to page 23 of the IHA's strategic plan.  Some £12 million of the funding will go to category one tracks, with other tracks qualifying for some assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry made a number of points about the facilities at tracks.  Almost all the tracks have submitted plans for upgrading their facilities under the capital development fund.  For example, Leopardstown is planning a further improvement along the lines of the modernisation of Shelbourne Park.  We recognise that good basic facilities are essential for our racecourses if we are to attract punters and expand our market share.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator McAughtry for moving the motion and compliment Senators for their contributions. The Irish horse racing industry is very important for the sporting and economic life of this country.  As I mentioned, a large number of people depend on the industry for their livelihoods and for recreation.  It is a very important industry with considerable potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has direct responsibility for the IHA and the horse racing industry.  I have responsibility for the greyhound industry, which, I am glad to report, is doing very well.  It is making great strides, with increased revenue from the tote, on course betting and entry fees, and its future prospects are very bright.  I am sure the same will be said in a short time of the horse racing industry.  With a very committed Minister, a very vibrant IHA and the type of support which was demonstrated this evening by numerous Senators, I am very hopeful for the future of the industry.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State again for his attendance.  One would have expected difficulties in producing a Minister this week.  If I were a Minister I would not be here but at Cheltenham, with all the ministerial perks which go along with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a warm regard for the Minister of State, as he knows.  Therefore, I take no pleasure in picking him up on the point about racegoer representation <Col N="796" /> on the board, about which there is an ongoing argument.  The representative on the board was nominated by the Racing Club of Ireland, but that representative told the club that she had no intention of being a conduit for the Racing Club of Ireland and would not put the club's concerns to the board.  I want to get off that point as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>My final point concerns the Northern race tracks of Downpatrick and Down Royal.  The Government has helped Down Royal but Downpatrick struggles along with voluntary support. There is a different ethos in racing in the North of Ireland.  Greyhound and horse racing have brought both tribes together.  It is a continual joy for me to go to Down Royal or Downpatrick and see people from west and east Belfast representing the two colours and to hear the Southern brogues of Turf Club officials and others on the gate.  That is an essential component in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The IHA covered this in a few sentences by saying that the Southern and Northern Ministers should get together, which seems a less than satisfactory approach.  I urge the Minister of State, who has fine officials who can make the necessary contact, to take up this point and see how he can help the Northern Ministry to help Northern racing. It is most important and we would hate to see Downpatrick track, which particularly brings the two sets together, close down.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise the IHA; I hope I have done so with good humour and in a constructive way.  I would be grateful if the points and asides which I made on the five year plan were conveyed to the IHA.  It is important that it knows we are not just here to talk about our local tracks, race cards and bad toilet facilities and that we have also dealt with the business rationale which lies behind the five year plan.  The Minister of State dealt with it excellently and his Department deserves the utmost congratulations.  The IHA could not be led by a better man than Mr. Brosnan, who deserves all our help and support.</P>

      <P>I trust the nature of my concern about the use of the word &ldquo;violent&rdquo; in the section emerged clearly before the debate adjourned at 6 p.m. Rather than continue in the same vein, I ask the Minister to indicate whether there is any justification for my concern that it may inhibit the operation and efficiency of the Garda Síochána in conflict situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be pedantic but the phrase &ldquo;in order, within the Garda Síochána, to disarm or <Col N="797" /> arrest violent individuals&rdquo; could be literally interpreted to mean violent individuals within the Garda Síochána.  I presume that is the converse of what it is intended.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  A small error needs to be corrected.  It was indicated during the discussion on amendment No. 16 that amendment No. 21 was being discussed with it. However, amendments Nos. 21 to 24, inclusive, are being discussed together.  It is a small point but it needs to be mentioned in case the record indicates otherwise.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lee about the need for the word &ldquo;violent&rdquo;.  Is it over restrictive?  Would it be better to delete the term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27 provides a limited exclusion for the Garda Síochána from the scope of the legislation as far as the gender ground is concerned. The purpose of the exclusions in subsection (1)(a)(ii) and (iii), which are the subject of the amendments, is to allow the Department of Justice to discriminate on the basis of sex where a preponderance of gardaí or prison officers of one sex, usually men, would be the more obvious and certain means of quelling or preventing certain violent situations.  The effect of Senator Lee's amendments would be to broaden the scope of the exclusions, thereby allowing discrimination to apply much more widely than would be necessary to deal with violent individuals or situations.</P>
      <P>However, I acknowledge Senator Lee's appropriate concern about security matters.  He indicated a concern about how the description of violent individuals would be applied and he correctly seeks to ensure that the use of the term &ldquo;violent&rdquo; should not compromise the security situations and considerations which need to be taken into account in circumstances which arise for the Garda and the prison authorities.  I included this provision, which enables the Minister for Justice to identify when this exclusion should operate, because of the importance of security considerations. The stringent application of EU law on gender equality requires a relatively narrow exclusion &mdash; hence the reference to violent persons. I am content for the Minister for Justice to determine which individuals or situations might be considered violent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must not create scope for this exclusion to be generally applicable in respect of all duties undertaken by gardaí or prison officers.  If the Senator's amendments were accepted, a wide range of duties and assignments in both the prison service and the Garda Síochána would fall outside the scope of the anti-discrimination provisions of the <Col N="798" /> legislation.  Such a position would be most disadvantageous from the point of view of employees of both sexes in these services.  For example, women prison officers would have no redress under the Bill if they were continually rostered for desk duties and excluded from the main work of a prison officer, which is to guard and escort prisoners.  Despite the likelihood that a situation similar to my example would not arise in practice, it would be most undesirable and probably contrary to EU law to allow for it by way of exclusion in the Bill.  The text in the Bill has operated successfully for the last 12 years since the Garda Síochána was brought within the scope of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Lee's point about paragraph (iii) but we do not need to be concerned about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reassured by the Minister's response.  The amendment would not open these matters to a wide range of derogations from the principle of equality because the controlling phrase states: &ldquo;applies to the assignment of a man or, as the case may require, a woman to a particular post where this is essential...&rdquo; It is under the control of the term &ldquo;essential&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; or &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  It imposes a requirement for a strong <i>prima facie</i> case before any deviation from the principle of equality occurs.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (ii) states &ldquo;in order to guard, escort or control violent individuals or to quell riots or violent disturbances.&rdquo;  However, the terms &ldquo;riots&rdquo; and &ldquo;disturbances&rdquo; imply a propensity for violence.  Paragraph (iii) states &ldquo;within the Garda Síochána, to disarm&rdquo;.  If people are armed, I presume disarming is an activity which potentially requires a deviation, given that our police force is unarmed.  The paragraph continues: &ldquo;or arrest ...individuals, to control or disperse violent crowds...&rdquo;  The whole phraseology, even without &ldquo;violent&rdquo;, is redolent of situations with potential confrontation involved.  Given the qualification of &ldquo;essential&rdquo; and given that operational judgments may have to be made on the spot, I do not see how the Minister for Justice can be called up every time a problem arises if there is a decision to be made in a potentially delicate situation. Thank goodness we have not had occasions of this sort, for the most part, in recent times. However, it is not impossible to envisage those circumstances arising.  To me, this legislation is unnecessarily restrictive and I do not believe there would be any breach of the principle of equality involved in removing the word &ldquo;violent&rdquo; and allowing the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; to be the controlling consideration for gardaí and prison officers in the exercise of their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 28, after &ldquo;special&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I entered this amendment on Committee Stage because when I first read this section I presumed it discriminated positively in favour of a disabled person.  I understood that a &ldquo;special rate of remuneration for particular work&rdquo; meant that if a disabled person was working alongside an able bodied person and was not producing the same number of goods, they would still be paid the same rate for the job.  It was only when I reread the section that I discovered it allowed for the disabled person to be paid at a lower rate.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I stated that I understood the motivation behind this section which was to ensure an increase in the employment rate for disabled people; I think they have the highest rate of unemployment nationally.  The section sought to ensure that we would not see disabled people lose out further in terms of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that he would look at the section again and his amendments address the problem.  However, instead of calling it a &ldquo;special rate of remuneration&rdquo; the Minister is calling it a &ldquo;particular rate of remuneration for work of a particular description&rdquo;.  It probably still amounts to the same thing as the original section; the Minister is indicating that it does not.  If it does not, I would be anxious to hear what the Minister has to say.  I want to ensure that my amendment would not detract from the opportunities for employment which might be available to disabled persons but I would not like an employer to read <Col N="801" /> this section, certainly as it was, and presume that they could pay a lesser rate for a job to a disabled person.  I would like the Minister to explain how his amendment achieves what I was trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage, I signalled to Senator McGennis that I would examine the issues she raised before Report Stage.  Having looked at the matter, I remain concerned about the possible implications of amending the Bill precisely in the way suggested by the Senator.</P>
      <P>Section 35 (1) is intended to facilitate the employment of persons whose capacity to do the same amount of work as other employees is restricted.  It must be accepted that, in some cases, there will be persons with a disability who, even with reasonable accommodation, will not be able to satisfy the principle of equal pay for equal work.  The NRB already recognises such circumstances and in its efforts to promote the employment of such persons, it makes arrangements to subsidise the costs of such employees.  In addition, I would be reluctant to take any steps that might reduce the frequency of cases where an employer makes a genuine effort to increase the participation of persons with a disability in employment, particularly, such persons whose capacity to perform is seriously restricted.  I can see there is merit in replacing the word &ldquo;special&rdquo; with a more sensitive and appropriate word.  Accordingly, I have had drafted amendments which replace that word with the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo; where it occurs in relation to rates of remuneration.</P>
      <P>I hope the amendments meet, in part at least, the concerns of Senator McGennis.  At the same time, I must ensure that it remains attractive for employers to seek to integrate, into the workforce, people whose capacity to do work is restricted. I know Senator McGennis realises this is a delicate area in which it is essential to achieve a realistic balance.  I put forward these amendments to section 35 in response to her concerns and in an effort to improve the text in the way that is sensitive to the concerns of the interests involved. I should, however, assure Senators that neither this provision nor my proposed amendments to it in any way preclude the application of enhanced rates of pay to persons whose capacity to work is restricted.  However, I am satisfied that the use of the term &ldquo;particular&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; would better serve the interests of persons with a disability whose capacity to perform work is restricted as envisaged in this section.</P>

Can the Minister reassure me that the protection afforded under this Bill would mean that a disabled person who felt they were being paid a lesser rate for the <Col N="802" /> job would have some way of taking a case to prove they were not getting an adequate or appropriate rate for the job, even if it were less than an able bodied person?  Is there any kind of protection for an employee in those circumstances?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 34, line 31, after &ldquo;from&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will not detain the House because I made substantial arguments on this point during the progress of the Bill.  It is difficult to understand how the Minister can make a public broadcast and tell the people that the purpose of the Bill is to prevent deliberate undermining and then refuse to accept his own words in the legislation.  It seems absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> As I said earlier, I am concerned we are accepting and incorporating something described as the religious ethos, which is not defined in the legislation.  It is either a nebulous concept or one which is generally understood.  I understand the ethos of the Roman Catholic Church as enunciated very clearly and rather nastily by people such as Cardinal Ratzinger, who said quite unequivocally that it is not only reasonable, but it is almost a moral obligation to discriminate against gay people in employment and housing. That will surely form part of the ethos being protected by the Bill unless we include the Minister's own word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo;.  In other words, being gay or a member of the travelling community, a circumstance over which the individual has no control, should not constitute sufficient grounds for discrimination.  Something additional must be included, such as a deliberate act, stance, speech or provocation which would undermine the ethos of the institution.</P>
    <P>This is a perfectly reasonable provision for which to look.  I hope the Minister will reiterate his own words instead of being forced to eat them.  I sincerely hope I do not detect visions I thought had passed of belts of croziers being delivered.  It will be interesting to see if the Minister will act, and I am sure he would like to.  If not, it may be necessary to test this in the democratic way provided by this House.  It will be an interesting exercise in ascertaining the views of individuals and parties in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's amendment, but I warned him I would not necessarily vote for it.  He made a fair point that religious ethos is not defined in the legislation and, therefore, there is an element of ambiguity as regards behaviour compatible with the religious ethos.  Is it behaviour, attitudes or beliefs?  Does it have to express itself in performance?</P>
      <P>Given the position in which we find ourselves, the greatest deviation from religious ethos which will occur in practice will arise in the case of divorce. Inevitably, there will be thousands of divorces in the near future and on the law of averages, there will be divorces among those teaching in schools at present and applicants for teaching posts.  The Minister may remember I was one of the few Members of the House who opposed the principle of no fault divorce, and I have seen nothing since to make me revise my views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, however, look at the implications of this.  Not only will there be thousands of divorced people but there will be thousands divorced against their will.  If there is a blanket injunction on the part of school or hospital authorities that somebody who is divorced is by definition subversive of the ethos of the Catholic Church, in particular, it would involve an unfair interpretation of the concept of undermining the religious ethos.  As it is virtually impossible in practice to <Col N="804" /> determine who is the innocent victim in a divorce, it would be an unacceptable intrusion into individual cases to distinguish between divorced people, although one may have views or suspicions in particular cases.  That is the reason I tabled amendment No. 37.  This amendment should be inserted, if not to define a religious ethos, at least to indicate an area which should not be open for discussion, investigation or interrogation.  It is necessary to try to give some guidance as regards the intention of the Legislature in using such phrases and to try to anticipate the most frequent situation which may conceivably arise in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume Senator Lee has tabled amendment No. 37, on which I wish to concentrate. I second his amendment in the same spirit as he seconded Senator Norris's.  I am defending his right to table an amendment rather than indicating a willingness to vote for it.  An important point is at issue here.  I envisage circumstances where the governor of a school would regard the position of a divorced teacher as being contrary to the ethos of the school.  There should be a provision whereby that person could not be excluded from employment by virtue of divorce.  From that point of view, I agree with Senator Lee.  I envisage circumstances, almost to the point of legitimacy, in which schools would regard it contrary to their ethos to employ divorced persons.  The point is that divorced people are acting within the law and from that point of view should not be discriminated against.  I and a few other Members registered opposition to section 37 and acknowledged the substantial improvements made in the Dáil.  However, it would have been appropriate to include the grounds, such as disability, age and marital status.  This is part of that same argument. I would support Senator Lee on balance, but I see a difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go over what I said before. Senator Lee and Senator Dardis were worried that people may be discriminated against because of divorce, but I worry people may be discriminated because of single parenthood and abortion. If we must look at the religious ethos of schools, we must ask them if it is more acceptable for a single mother to take a private and perhaps more tactful route by having an abortion.  I pointed out that it is more easy to have a private medical termination of pregnancy, which is internationally available.  Is this an Irish solution to an Irish problem? Although that is a hackneyed phrase, why not use it again?  The Bill does not provide any protection for women who become pregnant outside marriage and who are working within an institution which might consider this contrary to its religious ethos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pleasant to see that Senator Lee is looking after the interests of divorced people.  That is a welcome development so far as his political philosophy is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> There was considerable food for thought on the Committee Stage debate on section 37(1).  In the course of that debate I was asked a number of questions.  Could I guarantee that the Lincolnshire case of dismissal of a teacher for marrying a divorced person would be overturned under this Bill?  Would the Eileen Flynn case be repeated under this Bill?  Would the gardener of a Scottish school who was dismissed for association with gays be protected under this legislation?  I can give the same guarantees as any other Member of the Legislature.  Each case is argued separately on its own merits and redress authorities will determine each case based on the particularities in question.  It is for the Judiciary, not the Legislature, to interpret this law.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provision as it stands provides considerably more protection than exists under Irish or UK legislation.  The Eileen Flynn case was taken under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  While I cannot say what the outcome would have been if that case had arisen under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, it is possible that the specific protections for pregnant workers in EU equality case law may have prompted a different outcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris has put forward a thought provoking amendment which would involve inserting the word &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; before &ldquo;undermining&rdquo;. The text of this provision already leans some way towards the meaning which Senator Norris seeks. It does not read that action must be reasonably necessary to prevent the undermining of the religious ethos.  Rather, it requires that the action must be reasonably necessary to prevent the employee from undermining the ethos.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris's amendment would go a little further and would upset the delicate balance in the current text.  I am not convinced that his amendment is necessary.  He may be correct that I used that word in the course of a heated television debate.  I cannot recall using it, but if he says I did then I am sure he is right.  If I said that a person who deliberately undermined the ethos of an institution would have to be kept on, then <i>a fortiori</i> that would be the position.  A reasonable position is being adopted in the amended section 37(1).</P>
    <P>From the perspective of ethos, a person's activities in the course of their employment in an educational institution could fall into one of three categories.  These are not exclusive and there could be grey areas in between.  Category A is where the institution requires the employee to pro-actively work for the ethos of the institution. Many institutions require this and are disappointed that it is not provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Category B is where the employee does not pro-actively advance or work against the ethos of the institution.  They do their job and go home. Category C is where the employee undermines the ethos of the institution.  I am not saying that an employee has to pro-actively advance the ethos of the institution, nor that they may be neutral. My point is that they must not undermine <Col N="806" /> the ethos of the institution.  That is a reasonable provision.</P>
    <P>We must work from the base that we have a denominational system of education.  If one was working from the base of a secular system the position may well be very different.  Once one accepts this position then it could not be tenable that a person should be maintained in employment if they undermine the ethos which is one of the primary <i>raisons d'être</i> of the institution.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Norris's motives in this regard.  However, I must also acknowledge the concerns of denominational interests in this provision. They have expressed equal disappointment at the present text.  They have criticised this provision as a serious dilution of their need to protect, maintain and advance a religious ethos.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned that she had received many letters expressing concern that teachers' rights could be infringed as a result of this provision.  I too have received volumes of correspondence of a similar nature.  However, I received an equal, if not greater, volume of letters supporting the retention of the original section 37(1) text.  I have a balance to achieve and that is provided by the current text.</P>
    <P>A wide range of consultations took place with social partners, including all the teacher unions and denominational and parent interests, before Government agreement on the revised version of this subsection was secured.  There are significant improvements in the current version which respond to the concerns of teachers.  This has been acknowledged by Senator O'Toole.  The new text has been welcomed by the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland.  Given that disputes on section 37(1) are for adjudication by an independent Director of Equality Investigations and that the provision is also regarded as satisfying the constitutional and legal requirements of denominational education, I propose that the existing text be retained.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment on divorced people, I understand the sentiment behind Senators Dardis's and Lee's amendment.  There are a variety of other situations which might be listed in such an exercise.  The itemisation of this one issue in the subsection could reasonably leave other situations such as separation, non-marital relationships and a plethora of other private life issues open to being deemed by their exclusion to undermine the religious ethos of the institution.  I know this legal interpretation is not one the Senators had in mind when they tabled the amendment but it is a reasonable albeit unacceptable interpretation of the text.  The amendment, like others tabled on this subsection, seeks to determine the meaning of religious ethos.  I have already indicated that the decision as to what constitutes the undermining of religious ethos rests with the statutorily independent redress mechanisms established under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is.  The Minister has done his best to be fair and reasonable and I accept that he believes this section balances the absence of freedoms slightly.  It is interesting to notice how the general secretary of one of the biggest trade unions in the country representing teachers takes a completely opposite view and makes the point clearly, vigorously and firmly that by incorporating the notion of ethos into law for the first time it gives authorities a peg on which to hang their decision to discriminate and to attempt to legitimise it.</P>
      <P>The Minister answered one of my questions, whether the Eileen Flynn case would be repeated, by saying he could not say.  I also asked if people who have conscientiously left the Roman Catholic Church or are no longer practising Catholics would be discriminated against.  I am sure the Minister will again find it difficult to provide a concrete answer and will say it must be left to the equality officer or the courts to decide.  I was also asked to put a third question about non-attending Christians being allowed to teach religion.  Again, I imagine the Minister is not in a position to answer that clearly.</P>
      <P>Far be it from me to upset the delicate balance which the Minister believes himself to have achieved, but he gave the example to this House of three categories: someone who proactively supports the ethos of the school, someone who teaches mathematics and does not support or attack the ethos of the school and someone who undermines it.  However, the Minister scrupulously avoided the fourth category, which is the person who conscientiously teaches mathematics, who does not set out to undermine or advance the ethos of the school or institution, maintains a strictly neutral position and yet, by virtue of his or her human reality, is held to undermine the ethos of that school and we are now enshrining that in legislation for the first time.</P>
      <P>I have placed several times on the record of the House what the most senior figure in the Roman Catholic Church has indicated as the ethos of that Church.  Once we protect that, they can turn around and state that we had the opportunity to protect people against it and that we knew full well what was their ethos.  Cardinal Ratzinger produced the infamous Hallowe'en pastoral which advocated discrimination.  If one protects an ethos which advocates discrimination, how can one pretend one is protecting people against it? No one could accuse Cardinals Ratzinger or O'Connell of having concealed their motives or concealed or fudged what they believe to be the ethos of a Church of which they are princes.  Incidentally, princes are not an especially democratic phenomenon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced.  I recognise the Minister's considerable political difficulties, his humane outlook in these areas and the remarkable work he has done.  However, I must continue to believe <Col N="808" /> he is wrong on this matter and I will press the amendment.  However, I am a realist and have done a little homework as regards the support I might receive, which will not be great.  There will not be huge antagonism, but the principal Opposition party has not found itself in a position to support the amendment.  It will not vote against it but will not support it either.  I will call for a voice vote because it would be irritating for my colleagues and for those who have been here all day if I were to go through the rigmarole of wasting another few minutes in order to score a political point.  However, I would like the House to believe that I hold what I say to be incontrovertibly true and that there is nothing in what the Minister has said which reassures me in the slightest.</P>
    <P>An ethos which is inimical to the security of employment of a significant section of the population is for the first time being enshrined in law. Let no one say afterwards they did not know what this meant.  I pointed out there is no definition of ethos in the world so we are left with what the most senior representatives of the Roman Catholic Church have to say on this matter.  I do not want to attack them exclusively.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed.  I reassure the Minister that he did use that form of words.  Perhaps it was a little unfair of me to pin him to it, but it was not a heated debate.  Even when debates are, the Minister has shown a remarkable capacity to remain detached, clear and logical and I admire the clinical exactitude with which he enunciated the form of words which I, in an attempt to be helpful, wished to insert into this Bill.

      <P>Section 38 already provides for the appointment of a director of equality investigations under the aegis of the Labour Relations Commission.  In the section as presently drafted, the director provides the avenue of initial redress in employment equality cases.  The purpose of the present amendment is to provide, through the director, a single, publicly identifiable forum for redress both for discrimination cases arising out of this Bill and the Equal Status Bill, 1997.  To this end I am establishing an independent statutory office under the aegis of my Department to deal with discrimination cases whether in the area of employment or the provision of goods, services or facilities.  This initiative will allow a sensible concentration of resources and facilitate a high quality service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also concerned to provide one locus for initiating discrimination cases and to aid the development of consistency and coherence in the case law emerging under both Acts for complainants. I am also conscious, in providing a single locus for redress, that there are accessibility considerations, <Col N="810" /> both physical and otherwise, which will fall to be provided in order to cater for some of the minorities protected in the two Bills.  I envisage the new office providing a strong model of excellence in this area.</P>
    <P>The first amendment in this grouping is the substantive amendment.  The amendment to the definitions of equality officer and equality mediation officer in section 39 and the four amendments in sections 43, 45, 47 and 53 are technical amendments arising from the substantive amendment.  I have also decided, in the context of that substantive amendment, to amend section 69, which deals with codes of practice and it has been necessary also to make consequential amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and these amendments are achieved in the new section 69 which has been inserted in the Bill.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(7)  The provisions of this section are without prejudice to later provisions of this Part relating to the obtaining of information.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>The concerns raised by Senators with regard to the right to the information provision of section 40 prompted me to look again at how to clarify the distinct rights of information of potential claimants and the redress authorities.  It is obviously particularly essential that the redress authorities in the form of the director and the Labour Court should have comprehensive powers to access information.  Accordingly, sections 58, 59 and 60 provide explicitly strong powers to <Col N="811" /> enter premises and obtain information, require persons to provide information and impose sanctions for failure or refusal to supply information or documents.  Section 58 gives the director or his or her staff or the Labour Court the power to enter premises and obtain all information relevant to the case and to inspect books, records or computer information.  Section 59 provides powers to question individuals who may have information relevant to a case.  Section 60 sets out sanctions for failure or refusal to provide information or to attend before the director or the Labour Court.  These represent very extensive powers and ensure that in determining any case before them, the director and the Labour Court have all necessary legal backing and access to all relevant information.</P>
      <P>Senators would agree that it would not be appropriate to confer equivalent rights to information merely on potential claimants.  However, section 40 recognises there is a need for such persons to have access to information to allow them to decide whether or not to take a case under the Bill.  This right is duly qualified so as to protect the privacy of third parties.  For example, it would not be appropriate for a potential claimant to have access to details of pay of another person who did not wish such information released, or for a potential claimant to have access to details of another employees pay or bonuses or remarks of a selection board on another candidate.  On the other hand, such information would be accessible to the director or the Labour Court.  To clarify that such information, while not available to a potential claimant, is available to the authorities, I am moving an amendment to section 40 to record this.  I am sure there is no legal requirement for this amendment but I table it in the hope that it will reassure Senators and remove any doubts they may have that important facts in a case would be withheld in any case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the passage of this Bill.  The constructive nature of the contributions, particularly on Committee Stage, is reflected on the number of Government amendments proposed and I was glad to be in a position to respond in a positive manner to many of the issues raised by Senator.  The Bill has benefited from these amendments.</P>
      <P>We had a constructive and thought provoking debate on the provisions of the Bill which deal with sexual and other harassment.  The debate highlighted the difficulties associated with drafting appropriate provisions to deal with harassment. In an effort to respond to that debate, I introduced a number of amendments to the key sections 23 and 32 of the Bill.  These amendments respond well to the concerns of Senators and others.</P>
      <P>I regret I was not in a position to agree to the request by a number of Senators, in particular Senator McGennis and Senator Dardis, to extend the scope of the Bill to cover political opinion and trade union membership.  A fair compromise was reached in incorporating in section 6 of the Bill a commitment to review within two years the discriminatory grounds covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>We debated in some depth and at great length the extremely delicate religious ethos provisions in the Bill.  I appreciate there is a reluctance on the part of some of the interests to accept the text of section 37 (1).  However, I am convinced that the interests of all the parties concerned have been reasonably and fairly treated.  I thank Senators for their constructive elucidation of the issues involved and their fulsome debate on them.</P>
      <P>Listening to some commentators and critics over the past seven months, I felt insufficient recognition was given to the considerable merits of this momentous legislative proposal.  Some critics may have lost sight of the ground breaking nature of this Bill.  Others seem to suggest that Ireland should not only adopt a uniquely extensive anti-discrimination law exceeding those in most other countries but should also adopt provisions that far surpass those of the most advanced countries that have chosen to focus protective provision on a smaller number of discriminatory grounds.  That suggestion is not realistic.</P>
      <P>The vision and ambition of this and the previous Government has been to provide protection from discrimination on a wide range of grounds. In developing the proposals, I had to address many complex legal, social and economic considerations. This Bill balances those various considerations. I make no apology for seeking to introduce a measure which is sensitive to the many issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the chief Opposition spokespersons and Independent Senators for their contributions.  I am glad I was <Col N="816" /> in a position to respond to at least some of their concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank and congratulate the Minister for the way he has conducted the Bill through the House.  It is important and significant legislation and we hope it has the desired effect.  I also congratulate his officials who have worked hard and taken on board many of the points we made on Second and Committee Stages.  I welcome the fact that the spirit of many of the amendments put down was accepted.  I hope Senator Norris's fears about section 37 prove to be unfounded.</P>
      <P>It is important to state that there were several reasonably substantial Government amendments. The Clerk's office performed heroics this afternoon dealing with over 60 amendments in an hour.  It was remarkable and they should be congratulated. It teaches us that perhaps there should be a greater interval between Committee and Report Stages.  On this occasion, it worked well but it put the office under terrible pressure.  It is unfair to ask the staff to deal with amendments in that length of time.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we were dealing with some delicate, sensitive and complex issues. Even when we were clear on the intention of a section, it was difficult to find a formula of words to convey the intention.  I concede the difficulty in finding that balance in certain sections.  I hope that balance has been struck and that the legislation is successful.  I suspect the Minister will return to the House, but in the event that he does not, I wish him well when he departs.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his advisers for the patience and courtesy with which they dealt with this matter during what has been for all of us a very long day.  I accept his goodwill and good intentions.  This has been a difficult and delicate balancing act for him.  I hope my fears will not be realised.  I pin some hope on what the Minister said about the role of the equality officer.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if he had taken some of the recommendations and amendments on board we would have gone further than some of the most advanced countries in Europe.  While I understand his political difficulties in dealing with the real world, it is the responsibility of this House not just to refine legislation and put down amendments but to set a target that in future this is where we might go.  Why should this small independent republic not be more advanced than any country in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister indicated he will be looking at some questions, such as the complex matter of trade union membership and that he has given an undertaking that this will be reviewed over the next few years.  I do not care for the idea of a closed shop such as the NUJ, which is sometimes quite fraudulently maintained. The Minister's contribution on this matter was, as always, thoughtful and interesting.  He was particularly honest when I raised the jealousies in trade unions in guarding the sectional interests of <Col N="817" /> their members, as opposed to the general workers.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the text to which I will refer is in the New Testament and not in the Old Testament or in a secular text.  Although I might consider it regrettable, the preamble of the Constitution invokes Christianity and I recall being told on one occasion that a decision I was seeking could not be given because of the Christian and democratic nature of the State.  The parable I will outline is that of the owner of a vineyard who hired labourers at different times during the day. When he hired somebody at the eleventh hour the other labourers got into a snit and objected. However, the owner of the vineyard said it was his money, &ldquo;I hired you at a particular time in the day and you are being a paid a fair wage, so that is it&rdquo;.  My interpretation of the meaning of that parable is that one should not always be looking over one's shoulder.  In order to fit in with the constitutional prescription that we should be Christian and democratic, therefore, we ought to take on the mean mindedness of certain sectional interests, even within the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on keeping his patience with some of us.  We must have been quite aggravating.  It was a good debate and I am glad we had it.  I am grateful the Minister was able to include some amendments from Members of the House.  The Bill is unquestionably a better Bill for its passage through the House and I hope it works to the advantage of all citizens.</P>

      <P>Almost every Minister who comes before the House introduces legislation with the phrase: &ldquo;This is extremely important legislation&rdquo;.  Often the legislation does not live up to that claim, but in this case it does.  This is one of the most important Bills I have dealt with in this House and its effects will be felt for a long time to come.  An employer will be unable to discriminate against a potential employee on the basis of their sex, marital or family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the travelling community.  That is a huge achievement in a State where people tended to to accept that employment was dependent not on what one knew but who one knew.  It is ground breaking legislation in achieving equality for all people in employment.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, there will be major breakthroughs in terms of employment for people with disabilities and members of the travelling community, who have been given low expectations of opportunities for employment.  The problem of sexual harassment was not taken seriously before the introduction of this Bill and as a result women, who are the main victims of such harassment, have been loath to complain.  When they do, they are usually dismissed as cranks or as not being good sports.  Even during the debate on the definition, we discovered there are different views in the House about what constitutes sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to continue to work for women in low paid employment for as long as he and the Government are in office.  It was not possible to deal with that issue in this legislation, although I wish it had been.  The Minister should press in Cabinet the cause of these women.</P>
      <P>People often say the Seanad has no function apart from being a retirement facility or a springboard for Members of the Lower House.  Debate on legislation in the Seanad means a great deal, particularly when the efforts of Members from all sides of the House are recognised by a Minister. The Seanad has an important purpose and debate in this Chamber can improve legislation, as was the case with this Bill.</P>
      <P>I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister for his approach to this legislation.  I also compliment the Minister's staff for their patience and co-operation.</P>

At the time I worked in industry and saw the impact on the ground of the significant changes that were achieved.  This legislation is no less significant and advanced and no less welcome.

For the first time people in this country, despite their age, sexual orientation, marital and family status and the fact they are members of the travelling community, have the right to seek employment on an equal basis with other citizens.  That is a huge and significant achievement.  There could and should be protection against discrimination on the basis of trade union membership or political affiliation and I hope those issues will be addressed in the future.  However, I accept the Minister has explored every avenue and has, as always, pushed the parameters of the legislation as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that information on this complicated legislation is disseminated throughout the country and that notices about its provisions will be available in every place of employment to let the people whom it affects know where they stand.</P>

      <P>This motion asks the Minister for Education to sanction and provide the necessary funds for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert, County Roscommon.  The existing school facilities at Cloontuskert are totally inadequate.  The whole community, including teachers, parents and pupils, has been pressing the case for a new school there for some time.  I have been supporting their case for over three years and I wish to outline what has occurred to date.  The local community has provided £17,000 from its own efforts for the purchase of a site. The local contribution amounted to £25,000.  All <Col N="820" /> that was raised by the local community in Cloontuskert. The community has done its part and has received planning permission from Roscommon County Council for a new school.</P>
      <P>The problem is that the Minister for Education or the Department has not yet sanctioned funds to construct the school.  The case for a new school is a good one.  The existing school is totally inadequate. It has, in fact, been condemned by a number of bodies, including the Western Health Board, the fire officer of Roscommon County Council and the INTO representative.  The INTO's representative indicated the school had possibly the worst conditions he had ever inspected.  The children of Cloontuskert are not being taught in a dedicated school unit but in a building that was originally provided for shop units.  Later on it was converted for use as a school, for which purpose it has been used every since.  The classrooms are approximately two thirds of the size they should be.  There is no hot water in the school, which has only outdoor toilets, and there is no green area for children to play in.  The conditions at Cloontuskert national school are antediluvian and totally unacceptable in 1997.  The Minister should provide the necessary funds this year for the construction of a new school.</P>
      <P>Conditions at the school have received national attention.  We had an open day recently to which all public representatives and the media were invited.  The country at large saw the conditions under which pupils worked at Cloontuskert national school on a television programme. Everyone who saw the programme agreed the conditions were deplorable.  Parents and teachers have now come to the end of their tether.  I am told that in the near future children will be withdrawn from the school.  The INTO has already balloted its members to take strike action, but that has been put in abeyance.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister again to come to the assistance of parents, pupils and teachers at Cloontuskert national school.  Surely in 1997 it is totally inappropriate that people should have to teach or be taught in such conditions.  Two outside cubicles serve as toilet facilities for 60 pupils and teachers.  That is not only out of date, it constitutes a health hazard.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the facts of the case again because enough has already been said.  All the relevant authorities, including the health board, the county council and the INTO, have decided that the school is inappropriate.  I have personally inspected the school premises and I was amazed that any teachers could attempt to educate in the conditions I saw there.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, the Minister will have some good news that can be transmitted to the community at Cloontuskert so that they can in the near future have a proper facility for their children's education. I hope the Minister will say that money will be provided in 1997 for the construction of a new national school at Cloontuskert, County Roscommon.</P>

      <P>I wish to outline to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education, the current position regarding Cloontuskert national school, Lanesboro, County Longford.  At present the school has a staffing level of a principal and three assistant teachers, one of whom holds a temporary concessionary post.  The school's current enrolment is 79 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the school's existing accommodation, comprising four classrooms with detached toilets, is in poor condition.  The classrooms are considered undersized by present standards.  The Minister knows the school is in urgent need of refurbishment and it is for this reason that a building project at the school was included in the Department's 1995 capital programme for planning.  The plans provide for a new three classroom school with appropriate ancillary accommodation.  The inclusion of the project on the 1995 programme should be seen as the beginning of a process involving detailed examination of enrolment projections, assessment of the existing accommodation, preparation of contract documentation, invitation of tenders and the award and execution of a contract.</P>
      <P>The current position on the project is that planning permission has been secured and the contract documentation required to invite tenders has been prepared.  An advertisement inviting contractors and sub-contractors who wish to be included on the pre-qualification tender list for the project was placed in national and local newspapers in the week ending 24 January 1997.  The closing date for receipt of applications was Friday, 28 February 1997.  All applications received will be considered and a list of suitable tenderers will be drawn up.</P>
      <P>Due to budgetary constraints the Minister is not in a position to indicate when tenders might be invited for the project.  Recently, she approved 27 national school projects for tender and contract stages.  However, it was not possible to include all deserving projects in the first round of projects which were allowed to proceed to tender stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be keeping expenditure on the primary school building programme under review during the year.  She expects to release a number of additional projects to tender and contract on a phased basis later this year.  The number of projects to be released will be contingent on the results of the tender process for the 27 projects already announced and the overall funding position at the time.  The school management will be kept informed of developments.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that every effort will be made to ensure that the project is progressed as quickly as possible and I thank him again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of Government and Cohesion Funding for the north Leitrim regional water scheme which would take in Drumkeerin, Manorhamilton and Dromahaire. The scheme is designed to serve County Leitrim north of Lough Allen.  It will serve the three towns named and approximately 56 rural group water schemes in north Leitrim.  The source of supply will be Lough Gill from which an estimated 5,500 gallons per day will be pumped.</P>
      <P>Preliminary work on the scheme has been done in tandem with Sligo County Council which is using the same source for a supply to Sligo and its environs.  Both councils worked together to prepare and make a water extraction order and submitted a combined application for cohesion funding.  The part of the application relating to County Sligo has been successful while the County Leitrim element has not been funded to date.  The proposal from Leitrim County Council involved the provision of an intake point and an intake pump house on the Lough Gill shoreline, the provision of a water treatment plant at Moneyduff near Dromahaire, the provision of a reservoir at the treatment plant and another high level reservoir 2,000 metres away and the provision of a booster plant at Drumkeerin.  The scheme will involve the provision of approximately 40 kilometres of pipeline.  The estimated cost of the proposals is 9.779 million ECU of which 8.312 million ECU was sought from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>The rural group water schemes which it is proposed to serve are seriously deficient in most cases and fall far short of the quality of drinking water intended for human consumption regulations. This is a serious matter in the areas affected.</P>
      <P>The existing water supplies in Dromahaire and Drumkeerin are also seriously deficient.  In Manorhamilton it has been necessary over the past number of years to transport water by tanker during the summer months as the existing supply runs dry.  Leitrim County Council is in the difficult situation of trying to build ten council houses in Manorhamilton but, due to the lack of a proper water supply, are unable to do so.</P>
      <P>The lack of a suitable supply is detrimental to social and economic development.  The Cohesion Fund represents one of the last real chances of providing an acceptable, basic necessity for approximately 9,000 people in north Leitrim.  Leitrim County Council has invested almost £300,000 bringing this proposal to the current state of design and unless the scheme proceeds this expenditure will have been wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of funding for the Lurganboy sewerage scheme.  Lurganboy is a satellite town of Manorhamilton which has grown significantly in the past number of years.  It has no sewerage supply and, unfortunately, it is <Col N="823" /> unable to expand in either a business or social sense.  It is one of the most significant tourist locations in Ireland with further potential based on its scenery.  However, it cannot achieve its potential due to the absence of a proper sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister gave us good news that money will be provided for the schemes in north County Leitrim.  I wish the Minister a long and healthy retirement.  As the first Minister for Equality and Law Reform he has done some mould breaking things and he shall not be forgotten. I wish him and his family a happy and long retirement.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Reynolds for his kind comments which I appreciate.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, regrets that he is unable to be present to reply to the issues raised by the Senator due to other commitments.  However, I am glad to have the opportunity of explaining to the House the Minister's position on the proposed water scheme for Drumkeerin, Manorhamilton and Dromahaire and the sewerage scheme for Lurganboy.  Before commenting on these schemes, I wish to refer to the broader picture in relation to investment in water and sewerage services nationally and in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The provision of a modern environmental infrastructure to support economic and social development is a high priority of this Government. With the support of EU funding, we have over recent years greatly expanded the water and sewerage capital programme.  Senators will be aware that the Minister recently announced a £150 million programme for 1997, the largest in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>County Leitrim is benefiting greatly from this investment.  Of particular note is the £6 million south Leitrim regional water supply project which is being funded entirely by the Exchequer and is due to be completed shortly.  Dromod, an important stopping off point for the hire cruiser fleet, is also benefiting from Exchequer expenditure. A grant of £137,000 was approved last year for the development of a sewerage pump-out facility for cruisers and public toilets and showers for both cruiser and caravan visitors to this attractive village.  Furthermore, the proposed Dromod sewerage scheme, costing £790,000, is included in the 1997 programme with a view to commencement later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> Leitrim is set to benefit further under the INTERREG 2 European Community initiative for Border areas.  INTERREG 2 aims to protect and enhance water quality and encourage environmental protection.  Under the programme, Leitrim County Council is addressing the planning of new sewerage schemes at Newtowngore, Keshcarrigan and Carrick-on-Shannon so that they can commence construction this year.  These schemes will cost approximately £750,000.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund is providing major financial support for investment in water and sewerage projects around the country.  The Department of the Environment has submitted applications for 75 water and sewerage projects, costing well over £400 million, to the European Commission for approval.  So far 37 applications involving projects worth over £200 million have been approved.</P>
    <P>With the objective of controlling the level of nutrient input to Lough Ree and the Shannon system, the Department submitted an application to the European Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance to provide essential sewage collection and treatment systems at a number of towns and villages in Counties Leitrim, Cavan, Roscommon and Longford.  While the Commission has approved some of these schemes, no decision has been received in relation to any of those located in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Another application for Cohesion Funding for the Lough Gill regional water supply scheme providing for schemes in counties Leitrim and Sligo has been submitted to the European Commission. Included in this proposal was a major water supply scheme for Drumkeerin, Manorhamilton and Dromahaire at a cost of over £9 million. Approval has been received in respect of some of the Lough Gill schemes at an estimated cost of £10 million.  To date there has been no decision by the Commission on the County Leitrim schemes.  However, because of the particular priority attached to the proposed Manorhamilton water scheme, it has included it in the 1997 programme to be advanced through the planning phase.</P>
    <P>With regard to Lurganboy sewerage scheme which is estimated to cost in the region of £300,000, it is not possible at present, given the high level of existing commitments under the water and sewerage capital programme, to advance this scheme.  The scheme will be further examined in the context of the prioritisation of schemes for the work programme in future years.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 March 1997.</P>
