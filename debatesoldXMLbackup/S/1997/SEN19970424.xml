      <P>I have notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement on the current position relating to Kilrush community school, County Clare, and the impending danger of industrial action.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the developments in genetic engineering and the public concern in relation to same, if the Minister for the Environment will review the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>On the original list of business for this week the Bail Bill was scheduled for this afternoon.  However, thanks to the co-operation of the Opposition, all Stages were completed yesterday. This means that item 1, Report Stage of the Universities Bill, will be taken from now until 1 p.m.  I hoped to make this afternoon available for the Bill, but unfortunately the Minister is taking Committee Stage of the Education Bill in the other House.  Many Members who have been most involved in the debates on the Universities Bill have expressed their desire to try to complete it today and I hope their contributions will be brief and to the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Leader is aware, I have endeavoured as the leader of the main Opposition party in the Seanad to be as co-operative as possible in relation to necessary legislation, such as the Universities Bill, which should be <Col N="314" /> enacted before the end of the session.  I assure the Leader that the Fianna Fáil spokespersons will do all they can to ensure that the Bill is brought to a conclusion today.  I also assure the Leader that this side will co-operate in relation to other legislation he will endeavour to have enacted before the end of the session.</P>
      <P>The Leader is aware that all Members have received many representations on item 2, the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1996, and this side would like it concluded.  After all the work that has been done on the legislation, we do not want it to fall in the context of an election.  Will the Leader make time available for item 8, the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, which was introduced by my colleagues?  This is important environmental legislation and I hope the Leader will find time to deal with it between now and the end of the session.</P>
      <P>Regarding the meningitis scare, last week I asked the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to establish a national diseases surveillance centre immediately to ensure that a monitoring system is in place.  Unfortunately, meningitis has caused some tragic deaths in my constituency and there is a great desire for an early warning system.  The Minister agreed that there is a need for such a centre and I ask the Leader to request him to address this matter forthwith.</P>
      <P>Regarding the current paramedics' dispute, the Leader is aware that the people involved have no wish to be on strike.  They are completely frustrated by the fact that they are in dispute with the Government and they want an early settlement. Many people are becoming aware of the work done by paramedics and there are stories today that people who have had strokes have been without treatment for a full week.  The concern is that another week will go by and that real damage will be done to the recovery of many people who need expert treatment.  I ask the Leader to use his high office to urge the Government to do all it can to bring about an early settlement to this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent Senators are as anxious as the Leader to ensure that the Universities Bill is concluded today.  Can latitude be given on the duration of the debate to allow it go beyond 1 o'clock if necessary?  It is in everyone's interest that the contributions be brief and that if a vote is necessary it is pressed as soon as possible. We are anxious to co-operate and do not want the Bill to be caught in the <i>interregnum</i> between elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Wright's comments on the adoption legislation.  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions with the Department and am led to believe that the reason for the delay is an outstanding judgment from either the High Court or Supreme Court which was being awaited.  A related issue is that of Paraguayan adoptions.  I did not get a chance to contribute to the debate on the Bill but this issue was raised on Second Stage.  There is general agreement <Col N="315" /> in the House and the Department that children adopted in Paraguay should be protected by this legislation.  The Bill should be brought before the House and passed by it.  Let other people worry about subsequent legal difficulties.  The matter of constitutionality does not arise.  The Minister shares our view that passing the Bill is in everyone's interest.  It would relieve much pressure and worry on families.</P>
    <P>The first item on the Adjournment concerns a school in County Clare.  The Leader will recall that on at least four occasions over the past couple of months I have said that the work of the House and Department could be made easier and more efficient if the Minister produced a list of the work to be undertaken in each school year covering new school building, extensions, the replacement of prefabs and the completion of outstanding work.  This would save Members putting down such items on the Adjournment.  I want the Leader to recognise this proposal as emanating from me and that the INTO feels clarification for teachers is necessary.</P>
    <P>Kilmurray national school in Clare met with the Minister for Education and Finance yesterday. The Minister for Finance told them he would be happy to produce a list but that the INTO was not in agreement with this.  That is completely at variance with the facts.  I wish the Leader to confirm to the Minister that I have said on a number of occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make the work of the Cathaoirleach easier.  There should be a clear list and not one with biro and pencil marks changing the priority of schools for funding for the benefit of local Deputies and Senators and local newspapers.  There should be an open and transparent list, available to teachers.  Teachers are prepared to discussed this in a reasonable manner. Schools such as Kilmurray need to know where they stand and the INTO support the publication of lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We should pass the Universities Bill as a matter of urgency to facilitate its enactment. This is particularly important in the context of the University of Limerick and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  When is the Education Bill likely to come before this House and what is the timetable for discussion of it over the next fortnight, assuming we are here for a fortnight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate our priority is legislation but there are important issues which the House needs to discuss.  One such issue is economic and monetary union and our fiscal policy.  The strength of the Irish £ is creating serious difficulties for exporters and particularly for the agricultural sector.  Our currency is 9 per cent above the centre rate of ERM.  It has been suggested that if interest rates were to fall we would import inflation.  However, <Col N="316" /> we now have a global economy so that is not the case and there is expert opinion to support that view.  We should discuss these matters.  We should also discuss the crisis in the agriculture sector. The Minister last night attended a large meeting, at which the degree of difficulty within the beef sector was made clear.  That is related to the currency issue and should be tackled.</P>
    <P>Item 33, motion 24 on the Order Paper, in my name and that of Deputy Honan, concerns this.  I also sought to raise it by way of Standing Order 29 but the Chair ruled it could not be debated.  I accept that ruling but it is an important issue.  One way of dealing with it would be to allocate Government Private Members' Time to our motion and perhaps the Leader would consider that proposal,</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to hold a debate on genetic engineering, specifically genetically modified foods.  Senator Norris will raise the matter on the Adjournment this evening but more time should be given to it.  I oppose the holding of field trials for genetically engineered beet.  People do not have enough information on this area and current regulations are far too restrictive.  As a genetic engineer I have a vested interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice whether the Garda report for 1996 is available to her yet and, if so, whether she intends to publish the crime statistics before the general election?  If she does, will the Leader make time available to debate the report before the House is dissolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment to review the age restrictions for recruitment to county councils?  The Employment Equality Bill has been sent to the Supreme Court but its provisions on age discrimination are Government policy and could be introduced now.  Recently, a 51 year old man applied to Limerick County Council to become a driver of a mobile library but was one year too old.  In the spirit of Government policy on the Employment Equality Bill, that matter could be dealt with now and does not impact on the President's decision to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wanted to make was raised by Senator O'Toole.  Some of us stayed here until 3 a.m. the other morning &mdash; that was largely our own fault but it showed our interest in the Universities Bill.  I hope there will be flexibility to allow us to debate the issue after lunchtime because I would like to see the Bill completed by close of business today.</P>
      <P>I am glad my friend and colleague Senator Naughten expressed an interest in my Adjournment matter.  I am happy to give him some of my time if it suits him.  I support his call for a full debate and this would be a prelude to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's call for a debate on agriculture and appeal to the Leader to find time before the Seanad dissolves. There is a crisis in this sector.  The Senator has a motion on the Order Paper and we should discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all sides for their promised co-operation on the Universities Bill. Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole made requests about the timing today.  When the business was ordered last week we thought the House would take the Bail Bill this afternoon.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Education has to be in the other House for Committee Stage of the Education Bill this afternoon.  As the Minister has taken all Stages of the Universities Bill up to now herself, she would want to be present in this House for the entire Report Stage.  Perhaps we can speed up matters this morning if we get co-operation from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity it is not an agriculture matter &mdash; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, could be in both Houses at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill is coming to a close at 1 p.m. we will try to have as much flexibility as possible.  I thank Senators Wright and Fitzgerald for their co-operation on the Universities Bill.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that a very real legal difficulty has arisen with the Adoption (No. 2) Bill over the question of some of the Paraguayan children who were adopted.  In appears that, in some cases, the adoption processes were legal but not in others.  Bearing in mind the views which have been expressed on both sides of the House, this is primarily a human problem where enormous hardship may yet be inflicted, both on the adoptive parents and the children.  I have asked that every urgent attempt be made to find a resolution of this problem so that we can take the remaining Stages of the Bill.  There is no question of bureaucratic digging in of heels or bad will &mdash; it is a question of trying to find a formula which will achieve the end we all want.  I ask Members to bear with me a little longer on that matter.</P>
      <P>I have ordered time next Thursday for the Shannon River Council Bill so that we can at least complete Second Stage and then see where we go from there.  I take the point made by Senator Wright on the need for a surveillance centre to monitor meningitis.  I have already conveyed his views on that matter to the Department.  I agree with him in hoping the paramedics' dispute can be resolved.  It is sad that it takes a strike to bring home to the wider public the enormous amount of quiet, vital work these people do, which we all appreciate.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Toole for his promise of co-operation on the Universities Bill.  I trust the party whip will be exercised among his group.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked about a list of proposed work to be done in schools, which he has raised for some time.  I see no problem with that perfectly reasonable request.  I am not sure, however, that Deputies and Senators feel burdened by having to raise constituency matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about a debate on the Education Bill.  Such a debate is not scheduled in the next two weeks in this House because the Bill has not been passed by the Dáil yet.  I suspect we could look at it in the middle of June.</P>
      <P>On the question of a debate on agriculture and economic and monetary union, next week's schedule is already very crowded.  I have allowed time for Senator O'Kennedy's Bill.  We will be sitting the following week and I will make time available then for that debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten received a generous offer from Senator Norris, which I am sure he will accept.  In regard to Senator Mulcahy's question, I am sure the Minister will follow normal procedures in publishing the Garda report.  Many of us will have sympathy with Senator Neville's point on age limits and I will refer that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Business is ordered until 1 p.m. If perchance we are coming to the end of the Bill at that stage we will continue for a short while longer.  However, bearing in mind the Minister has to be in the other House this afternoon, if we do not conclude the Bill I have provisionally ordered time on Tuesday at 6 p.m. to conclude it then.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>A Senator may only speak once on Report Stage except the proposer to an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  Each amendment must be seconded.  Due to a printing error, the asterisk denoting Government amendments was omitted from amendments Nos. 2, 3, and 7.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 35 are related to Government amendment No. 1 and all may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  in relation to the appointment of a new governing authority after the suspension of a governing authority of a university under section 20 (4), the Visitor of that university,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>These amendments deal with the suspension of <Col N="319" /> the governing authority and address concerns expressed on Committee Stage.  The effects of these amendments are twofold.  First, the visitor will now consult persons within the university as well as the Minister on the person or persons to act as the governing authority until the new governing authority is appointed.  Second, the visitor will ensure that a new governing authority is put in place as soon as is practicable after a suspension. The period of suspension, however, cannot exceed one year.  Following the period of suspension the visitor will perform the functions of the commission in determining the composition of the new governing authority and will consult within the university while acting in this capacity.</P>

The first amendment provides that the Higher Education Authority would take the initiative in recommending that an educational institution be incorporated into a university.

      <P>Amendment No. 15 is in response to concerns expressed and amendments proposed by a number of Senators to include a separate section after section 13 to deal with academic freedom and institutional autonomy.  It states that a university in performing its functions shall have the right and responsibility to preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its internal and external affairs.</P>
      <P>I consider that the explicit statements in my amendment address the concerns raised in amendments Nos. 13 and 16 and the new section is a much reinforced statement of academic freedom, particularly of university staff, and it is given a prominent position in a separate section of the Bill.</P>

It recognises the academic primacy of the registrar or the person who holds the equivalent position.

      <P>I welcome what the Minister has done in amendment No. 20.  I tables the amendment without intending it to be restrictive and I take her point.  Perhaps I should have included the words &ldquo;in both official languages&rdquo;.  The reason I tabled this amendment is that the section as it stands is chock-a-block with interests.  As the Minister must ensure that business interests will feature among those interests, that reduces further the likelihood, in almost a lottery situation, of the Irish language and Gaeltacht organisations <Col N="327" /> emerging on the boards.  They may &mdash; and one could imagine that they have a better chance in one particular institution than in others &mdash; but I thought that because they might not have emerged along the line, if section 15(4)(a) was to be activated, including &ldquo;in both official languages&rdquo;, it would provide a nudge that one keeps the two languages in mind when one is thinking of &ldquo;artistic and cultural interests&rdquo;.  The amendment was not meant to be exclusive in any way but to keep another possibility open.  It is not contrary to the spirit of anything the Minister has taken on board in the course of what we are doing and, unless it would delay the Bill, I ask her to accept it as a well intentioned and perhaps useful additional reference to the Irish tradition. It is a way of ensuring that it is not lost sight of when we are talking about these matters.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 3, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is simply an attempt on my part to meet the argument I made that I felt it was much better in the case of universities that acceptance of somebody on the board should be volitional.  There should be a choice.  If the Minister can recommend somebody, no doubt in almost all cases the board will accept it, but they should be left the dignity of choice.</P>
      <P>I framed this only in the case of Trinity College because the other universities did not seem to worry about it.  Trinity College should be left with the option of accepting the Minister's nominees. It removes the element of coercion.  For that reason I strongly urge the Minister to take this on board.  It does not offend the other universities.</P>
      <P>I will not make any further arguments because we went at it hammer and tongs at a late hour the other evening.  The Minister knows my thinking and the strong feeling in the university.  I would welcome the acceptance of the amendments. I noticed there is no asterisk beside the amendment on the list of amendments.  Perhaps that was another accident, a Chathaoirligh.

Where an educational institution is formally associated by agreement with a university, the governing authority of the university will have as members employees and students of the institution as the agreement provides.  This means there will be a requirement for all agreements which universities might have with other institutions to be implemented under this new subsection.  It has the advantage of not setting in stone any present arrangements specifically in the legislation and will allow the universities and institutions involved the freedom to enter into new arrangements.

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 22, to delete line 21.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment which I resubmitted as a result of the Minister's reply on Committee Stage.  Concerns have been expressed about the implications of her reply.  The amendment refers to section 48 and the deletion of the reference therein.  It is fair to state that this section is crucial to the willingness of the universities to accept many other provisions in the Bill about which they might have raised further queries.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, the Minister referred to the guidelines and her comments were additional to what was understood previously.  She stated that, while they are not mandatory, universities will have to have regard to such guidelines when deciding appointments by statute and may be challenged if it is felt they did not pay due regard to them.  As I understand it, this is the first occasion on which the concept of the universities being challenged has been introduced.  Challenged by whom?  How will the result of such a challenge be determined?</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated that the dissemination of good practice should not be limited and guidelines should be universal.  I referred to this matter on Committee Stage and I speak as someone who worked in several university institutions.  There is great diversity among universities and it is ironic that a Bill which proclaims the advantages of diversity should suggest a narrowing of focus.  The term &ldquo;universal&rdquo; can be easily mistaken for that of &ldquo;uniformity&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can guidelines be identical for institutions with varying capital-labour ratios?  For example, institutions can be more or less technologically oriented and the percentages to be spent on staff or equipment ought to vary between those institutions. <Col N="335" /> The concept that guidelines would not take into account the diversity of the type of institutions in which the legislation rejoices seems to run contrary to one of the core values of the legislation. Unity in diversity is a concept on which I hope we agree.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, and I hope it is the case, I am imputing an intention which is not present.  What do &ldquo;universal&rdquo; and &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; mean in the provisions? This is an important issue in terms of the extent to which universities will welcome the legislation.</P>

      <P>When we had this debate on Committee Stage it was late in the evening.  When one looks back over one's own words one thinks it might have been easier to remain silent.  The Senator proposes that the requirement that a university must have regard to guidelines issued under section 4 be deleted.  Section 48 deals with non-binding guidelines which may be issued by the Higher Education Authority related to the number or grades of employees of the university or the proportion of the budget of the university to be applied to the different activities of the university. These guidelines are non-binding and universities are not required to follow them.  Nevertheless, it is necessary that a university must have regard to them in performing its important functions in appointing staff.  The guidelines will provide a university with an easy mechanism for comparison with practice in the sector generally. This would be without prejudice to the right of an institution to act contrary to guidelines having regard to its particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Should the Higher Education Authority seek to review issues relating to the guidelines it may do so under section 47.  Following consultation with the universities it may publish a report on the outcome of such a review.  However, the Bill, in making the guidelines non-binding, implies clearly that the Higher Education Authority cannot require the universities to follow the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that helpful clarification.  May I take it that whatever &ldquo;may be challenged&rdquo; means, it does not allow the Higher Education Authority to override the decision of a university?  It may complain, criticise and remonstrate, but it cannot override or reject the university's decision.  It can publish its reasons as to why it is unhappy with the decision &mdash; the Minister will recall our exchange about Latin tags which was not meant to be facetious but as a positive contribution to enhancing the quality of public debate on these issues.  However, &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; does not mean that the Higher Education Authority can direct a university to do something about guidelines which are not mandatory.  The worst case scenario interpretation of the words the Minister used might have interpreted the <Col N="336" /> guidelines as binding, whatever the difference between &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;binding&rdquo; might be.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the heads of the universities were foolish to buy into this, so to speak.  I foresee quite an amount of potential aggravation in the future.  From a tactical point of view, it may be better to have that aggravation within the framework of the legislation than otherwise. However, I see difficulties in the implementation of this provision.  I do not know what the HEA's attitude is on this matter.  The Higher Education Authority officials I know do not have a selfimage of omniscience, infallibility or superiority. They realise we are all on a learning curve.</P>
      <P>The paragraph in the Minister's otherwise excellent contribution to which I referred, had the Higher Education Authority presiding over and drawing on the unlimited horizons of their comparative wisdom to tell individual institutions what it meant to behave like a university.  That is a counterproductive way to approach the improvement of the university system.  Such improvement should take place on a discussion and exchange basis.</P>
      <P>As long as that counterproductive mindset exists it is contrary to improving the quality of higher education, which is an aim we share.  It is a most unfortunate mindset.  If &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; cannot be implemented as an expression of that mindset, the Minister's clarification is welcome.  I foresee difficulties in due course but I imagine neither the Minister nor I will be involved in them.</P>

      <P>The section indicates that the university must have regard to the guidelines, but they are not binding.  There can be no fine. However, they must make their decisions having regard to the guidelines.  They may decide that they will not accept the guidelines and that is quite in order.  This is where the term &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; arose.  It would involve a consideration of whether the university had looked at the guidelines and it could show that it had arrived at its decision having done so.  The term &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; was used in the sense of being critical in a positive way.  A university can reach a decision having had regard to the guidelines.  If that decision is contrary to the guidelines there can be no penalties. The early hour of the morning on the last occasion may have led to my not being as eloquent as I might have been.</P>

      <P>This issue was discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  Given the concerns expressed at that stage, I have proposed that a governing authority shall establish procedures for the resolution of disputes other than industrial relations disputes or exam appeals.  I consider that this process would be utilised only in exceptional circumstances.  Trivial matters should not be dealt with in this way, nor should matters which could be dealt with through a properly functioning personnel or human resources department.  Such a <Col N="339" /> department should continue to have the primary role in resolving most issues which would arise.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there are established industrial relations practices in place and these should not be affected by this proposal.  The dispute resolution procedures provided for shall be specified in a statute and shall be established following consultation with trade unions and staff associations representing employees of the university and with the students' union or other student representative body.  In addition, the procedures will provide for consideration of issues in dispute by an independent person or persons, one of whom, in the case of a constituent university, shall be a nominee of the Chancellor of the National University of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Senators have proposed that &ldquo;only&rdquo; be deleted in line 8.  I inserted &ldquo;only&rdquo; to emphasise the requirement of consultation.  However, if the Senators seek its deletion, I will not oppose that. I do not consider that faculties need to be consulted, given that the employees' representatives will be consulted.  The final amendment to amendment No. 42 proposes that the independent person would not be a member of the university. The main category of persons excluded by this provision would be graduates of the university. It seems to me that to make this amendment could unnecessarily restrict the pool of people which could be drawn from in setting up procedures.  I would, therefore, ask the Senators to reconsider this issue.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. (i) to amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In line 8, to delete &ldquo;only&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking on board our concerns on this matter.  I do not disagree with anything she said.  Her contribution was admirably drafted and articulated and constitutes a major step forward for those of us who had anxieties about this matter.  I agree with the Minister that this kind of procedure should only be invoked on rare occasions.  It would be a sad reflection on the quality of personnel management and human relations within institutions if this procedure had to be invoked regularly.  I agree totally with the Minister's concept of how this kind of procedure should operate.</P>
      <P>I thought the inclusion of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; might imply that if the governing authority did not choose to implement consultation, consultation might not occur at all.  Perhaps that is an extreme interpretation.  Saying &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo; does not weaken the prospect of consultation but rather obliges it to take place.  We rarely use the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; before the phrase &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo;.  The phrase &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo; appears in many places in the Bill.  I would be grateful if this could be removed as I think it introduces a scintilla of doubt that consultation will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> In relation to amendment (ii) the proposed deletion of the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; is merely a grammatical consequence of adding in &ldquo;faculties&rdquo; in amendment (iii).  The reason I propose the insertion of &ldquo;faculties&rdquo; is that, as I envisage it, this procedure, in so far as it would be activated at all, would be activated mainly in the resolution of academic disputes and personnel problems in university departments which cannot be resolved through the normal channels or where those are inappropriate.  It is important that knowledge of the procedure, the mechanisms of its implementation, its potential and limitations should be as widely diffused as possible.  This refers to faculty discussion rather than an industrial relations tribunal atmosphere.  It may be possible to tease out issues through faculty discussion.  People who may be involved in disputes can learn about this procedure in an atmosphere which would make them receptive to the message.  I am not saying that staff associations should be excluded.  As I see it, the diffusion of information is simply a practical matter in terms of the operational efficiency of a university.  There is no ideology involved in this proposal.  The sooner information about this procedure is diffused, the sooner it will become part of peoples' thought processes.</P>
    <P>With regard to &ldquo;members&rdquo; in amendment (iii), the Minister is correct in saying that its use would prove restrictive.  That was a drafting error on my part; I should have used the word &ldquo;employees&rdquo;. My reasoning in proposing this amendment was very simple.  The type of problem which may arise is likely to be one where friends of both parties in the dispute may be scattered among the employees of the institution.  I want to ensure that there is no possibility, on the basis of random association within an institution, of parties to a dispute beginning to feel a further grievance because of somebody with whom they may have a gripe, being invoked as an arbitrator in this process. I should have used the word &ldquo;employees&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;members&rdquo;.  I suspect it would be extremely difficult to find a visitor who would not be a graduate of the constituent university or of the university system as a whole.  I have tabled these amendments from an operational point of view and I am entirely in agreement with, and appreciative of, the Ministerial amendment.</P>

    <P>I attempted to have Trinity excluded from the provision regarding the introduction of members of the board.  However, the Minister did not accept this.  Now she is excluding Trinity College from something that seems to be positive.  I have not been briefed by the university on this matter so I do not know their position.  However, the mechanism proposed seems useful.  Is Trinity College being excluded on the basis that something of this nature may form part of the Private Bill when introduced?  A dispute resolution mechanism is very useful and in framing the Private Bill Trinity College should consider the inclusion of <Col N="341" /> such a mechanism.  Perhaps it is because of the Private Bill that the Minister is not seeking to apply this valuable machinery to the University of Dublin.</P>

I hope those making decisions will heed the Minister's interpretation of &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have just spoken with the Provost and the difficulty is that section 43(1)(a), if part of the Bill, would mean that because of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; Trinity would have 80 heads of department entitled to sit on the academic council.  The problem would be solved if the Minister amended the amendment to read &ldquo;for each academic faculty, or if the governing body so decides, discipline&rdquo;.  This would allow governing bodies in other universities to include all disciplines if they so wished.  The Minister will appreciate the problems which an academic council of more than 80 members, including <i>ex officio</i> and elected members, would cause.  Even Trinity College would find it difficult to cope if every discipline was included.</P>

This issue raises a chief concern of mine.  I do not object to Trinity College looking for whatever suits it.  Special provision is made for <Col N="343" /> Trinity College in a variety of ways in the Bill.  It is unacceptable that the conventions of a single institution should be used to override what is desirable in the case of other institutions.  I hope a phraseology can be arrived at which will allow Trinity whatever it wants but which will not impinge on decisions regarding the requirements of other institutions.  Otherwise we will enter a serious situation of potential conflict.</P>

We managed this by the skin of our teeth but on matters of this seriousness it would be good if the university sent a liaison officer because it is not always possible for us to contact them.  If this had not been changed it would have grossly swollen that august body, the board, to about 120 members.  Up to 70 or 80 people would have been entitled to be on the board as well as the heads of faculties.

The importance of this issue was clearly signalled early in the Second Stage debate a couple of weeks ago and on Committee Stage.  I was under the impression that senior members of the universities were doing nothing but perusing the reports of the debate.

      <P>In page 37, line 36, to delete &ldquo;the Chairperson&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage. The Minister will recall that she did not feel able to accept it then because of what she saw as operational difficulties if a meeting needed to be called quickly.  I did not envisage my proposal as intruding in any way on the operational efficiency of the governing authority.  Any sensible governing authority would delegate to the chairperson the right to call meetings on urgent matters as part of standing orders.</P>
      <P>However, the principle of where the authority resides is an important one.  In the course of this debate it has become quite clear that, despite the authority which is specifically allocated to presidents, provosts and chief officers, almost all of these operate on the authority of the governing authority.  It seems incongruous that the authority to call the governing authority into operation should not reside with the governing authority.</P>
      <P>Most of the time that does not matter. However, this can become a tactical or political matter in a case of potential tension or dispute rather than simply an operational one.  It should be clearly spelled out in the Bill that the governing authority is the authority, and that anybody else who calls the governing authority is doing so on its authority.</P>

      <P>Senators Lee and O'Toole are proposing in this amendment that the governing authority rather than the chairperson would decide when governing authority meetings are to be held.  I ask them to look at the section in detail. <Col N="347" /> It clearly states the chairperson must convene a meeting when asked to do so by a quorum of governing authority members.  Accordingly, the Bill already provides that a governing authority may call meetings.  I expect this is what will happen in practice, as the governing authority determines at each meeting when it will next meet.</P>
      <P>There is merit in leaving the provision as it stands as it gives flexibility.  Should an issue arise three weeks before the next scheduled meeting, for example, there would be no mechanism for arranging a meeting at short notice, except by way of getting a quorum of the governing authority together.  By leaving the provision as it stands there is greater flexibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeLee" hpid="Professor Lee Professor Lee">
      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am proposing does not interfere with the flexibility, <i>de facto.</i>  Almost invariably, a governing authority will determine the dates of a meeting at the start of an academic year because 40 very busy people with varying schedules cannot be expected to decide on the date of the next meeting at each meeting.  It would be impossible to do that because the entire meeting would be taken up trying to co-ordinate dates.</P>
      <P>The governing authority can delegate to the chairperson the right to call a meeting if a matter of urgency, of the type to which the Minister referred, arises.  That is different from a number of members of the governing authority requesting a special meeting.  They are framed to cover different eventualities.  Paragraph 10(2) does not meet the case I have in mind, which is where ultimately the locus of authority resides.  While everything the Minister says is correct as far as it goes, it is not excluded in the context of my proposal, which has potential in other directions which the way things stand at present does not allow.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides that should it be subsequently discovered that a member or members of a governing authority are appointed or elected in an incorrect manner, the <Col N="348" /> decisions made by the governing authority while they were members do not become invalid.  The purpose of the provision is to safeguard the decisions and deliberations of a governing authority from a challenge of illegality which is technical only.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendment.  It is a sensible and prudent provision.  We are moving into a new appointments arena with a series of mechanisms to be invoked for constituencies, some of which have never existed previously.  It is not inconceivable that something could happen, however inadvertently and especially in the early stages of implementation, which was technically in breach of the elaborate and complex provisions spelt out.  Once experience is gained in this area the requirement will not need to invoked.  It is wise, therefore, to have it included, because otherwise the entire work of a governing body or authority could be invalidated as a result of an inadvertent oversight.</P>

      <P>Relevant to pensions for Trinity College?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It could well be, especially since the genetically engineered Higher Education Authority has tried to stick its genetically engineered nose into our pension scheme.  I feel strongly about this issue because I am in receipt of a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> The Minister indicated on an earlier Stage that the existing arrangements would be untouched and that this would only affect things afterwards. However, I feel strongly that it is important to respect the integrity of the pension scheme.  The pension scheme in Trinity College is funded from moneys taken from salaries.  I pay into that scheme.  The university also pays into the scheme and I suppose it will be argued that the Government at a second remove pays because it may come from the block grant.</P>
    <P>However, that is a decision of Trinity College and it is one which the university is autonomously entitled to arrive at.  It is always possible that it may decide to fund it exclusively from its investments. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is a situation almost impossible to imagine where the Higher Education Authority would intervene and overturn a decision received by the trustees of a pension fund.  It seems to me that it is the Department of Finance and the Higher Education Authority wanting to have their little names in print and wanting the power to interfere, which they will never use and where it would be scandalous if they attempted to use it.  They just want to flex their muscles.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to exempt such interference.  What expertise has the HEA?  Is it composed of actuaries?  Are they particularly mathematically qualified?  Have they risen through the ranks of the insurance industry in Ireland that they should so presume to interfere?  I cannot imagine what expertise they have.  Perhaps we are lucky that we do not have a panel of eight county councillors empowered to intervene, but perhaps it is unwise for me to make this suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am sorry I did not frame the amendment to provide that eight county councillors should have the opportunity.  Perhaps I am being slightly light hearted at this point since we seem to be achieving a successful conclusion to the Bill.  It is appropriate that the pension fund should be left intact and immune from interference from the HEA, of whose qualifications in this area I am sceptical, and the Department of Finance, which is a notoriously cheese paring and penny pinching arm of Government.  As a recipient of a pension I would not like the Department to have too much say over it.</P>

      <P>In seconding the amendment, I am thinking of the Minister's mental and physical health, because to draw disputes on oneself is unwise.  It would be far better that, rather than have matters capable of going to ministerial level, disputes regarding pensions, many of which arise, should be solved at the level of the trustees of the pension fund.  The present proposal could result in a great deal of time being wasted on referring minor disputes which take place within pension funds.</P>

      <P>The Fifth Schedule will apply to the superannuation of arrangements of people who are employed by the universities after the passing of the Bill.  The effect of the amendment would be to provide that where a university has a funded pensions scheme with appointed trustees, the provision of subsection (5) relating to the resolution of disputes would not apply.</P>
      <P>It is normal practice that for schemes largely funded by public funds the determination of disputes would be submitted to the relevant State agency, subject to the approval of the Department of Finance.  In practice it would be hoped that there would be very few such disputes, given the duties of trustees to comply with the relevant pensions legislation in any case.</P>
      <P>I would not favour an option whereby the resolution of disputes for all such schemes would not be subject to the agreement of Minister of Finance or the Minister for Education.  The involvement of the Minister for Finance ensures a coordinated approach to the resolution of disputes for all pensions schemes that are funded largely from the public purse.  It is of note that over £20 million per annum is provided by the State for superannuation payments in the case of the universities and the total of accumulated funds is over £400 million.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Higher Education Authority that, for the academic year 1995-6 State expenditure on pension payments to the relevant schemes and pension superannuation, which ensures that those in receipt of pensions get pension increases when pay is increased for employees, was £6.6 million in respect of Trinity College.  No private funds were paid by the college for these purposes.  This accounts for nearly 15 per cent of State investment in the college for that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the extraordinary consensus that the Bill has been improved, there is still principled opposition to it, not because of the &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; but because it is a fundamentally retrograde step in the seizure of State control over one of the great facets of Irish life.  I do not accept that amendments made on Committee and Report Stages are necessarily an improvement because one cannot improve something that is inherently bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is flawed because of the principles behind it.  On balance it gives more control to the Minister and political parties than they had previously. I acknowledge fully that it is better than it was last July when it was published.  At that time it was so horrific that it would not have received a safe passage through the House.  We <Col N="351" /> should recognise the intention of those who drafted the Bill initially &mdash; that the State should have greater control over third level education. They have not got their way because of the numbers in the House.  It is a great tribute to the House that it can have such influence and is an example of the Seanad working effectively.  I pay tribute to the university Senators who have taken a great deal of trouble and time to improve the Bill immeasurably but at the end of the day it is bad for education and the State.  It was initially called Thatcherite by Dr. Garret Fitzgerald who has been quoted so often here and I agree.  I always regard Thatcherite as a term of insult.</P>

      <P>Some of the independence of universities has been removed.  The boards of the universities have settled for it.  We should not pretend that this Bill is what they wanted or that they drafted or initiated it, an impression being created by certain people.  They said that this package is as good as they could hope for.  There is a fear that they might get a worse package from a future Government.</P>
      <P>There is a threat to academic freedom; of political appointments to boards; of party and ministerial control in university life.  I do not regard the improvements as adequate and regard the Bill as flawed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to reopen a Second Stage debate but I cannot allow Senator Ross's comments to go on record without challenge. He, as is his wont in his claim to occupy the high moral ground, referred to his principled opposition to the Bill.  Nobody questioned his commitment to principle but those of us who support the Bill are also doing so from a principled position and a position of knowledge of what universities are about, what they might be about, what they should be about and on the basis of great experience of how universities operate.  Our support for the Bill, even where we disagree with the Senator, has been equally principled in all aspects.  I do not like people selectively choosing to regard their position as principled while casting doubts on the good faith of others.  Those who support the Bill feel as passionately about the good of the universities as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross referred to the Bill as a matter of the State taking over universities.  The State has less control.  It has given back to universities a great deal more power to manage their affairs than was the case before.  The Bill is good for education.  The provisions relating to academic freedom are strengthened, not that there has been any great threat to it over the past number of years.  Part of the problem in universities is getting people to publish a paper that might excite opposition or to say something that is worthy of controversy.  From within, there is little evidence <Col N="352" /> of a threat to freedom and there is no evidence that the Minister sought to threaten this.</P>
    <P>The idea of party control of universities is ludicrous. The governing bodies of some colleges in the national universities have been changed in a certain direction, which the House welcomed. The notion that issues within the university are discussed along party lines is a nonsense.  Senator Ross did us a great service by setting out many of the issues with a starkness that at least allowed a certain reality when we debated them.  His opposition is not based on electoral considerations as he is far too high minded to allow anything like that to enter his thinking.  It is based on what he believes is good for universities.  However, he is caught in a time warp.  He is thinking of universities in the 1920s and he would not have been out of place in this Chamber then when some of his colleagues on the Opposition benches would have been the Earl of Mayo and Sir John Keane.</P>
    <P>In a debate in 1925 Labour Senators wanted increased wages for those working on the Shannon scheme.  The Earl of Mayo said that he did not know what these chaps were about.  He passed by them frequently and saw &ldquo;happy navvies frying their beef steaks on a shovel&rdquo;.  In the same debate, Sir John Keane, Governor of the Bank of Ireland said that he had sympathy for them &ldquo;but there are inexorable laws of economics that you cannot get away from without ruin to the State&rdquo;.  This 1920s mindset was a feature of Senator Ross' contributions.  Perhaps the 1920s were a good time to be alive if one was the Earl of Mayo or Governor of the Bank of Ireland.  The Bill is honestly trying to meet the needs of universities as we enter a new century.  I warmly welcome this fine Bill which will stand the test of time.  I compliment the Minister.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning is right.  The 1920s were a wonderful time although I am shocked to hear of the dietary habits of the labouring classes.  I hope that beef steaks are no longer being fried on shovels without at least ascertaining its origin and that it is free of contaminants, BSE or antibiotics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill has passed, though I had been anxious it would not.  I took this Bill extremely seriously, as it deserved to be taken.  I came home a week early from the US in order to participate in the debate and did everything I could to make sure the debate finished today. Now I can reveal I leave for the Far East on a human rights mission tomorrow, and I would have hated not being able to claim seven or eight amendments that were included in the Bill with the support of my colleagues.  Those amendments include all the matters that the Provost, Fellows <Col N="353" /> and board of Trinity College indicated that they required to make the Bill satisfactory.  I thank the Minister and her advisers for including those amendments, as we now have everything that Trinity informed us it required.  That is important, and it happened in this House.  The Dáil failed to have the amendments the universities required accepted, but we have had a considerable number of amendments accepted.  If they had not been accepted, Trinity had advised us to pull the Bill down.</P>
    <P>We have behaved responsibly, although some sharp things were said.  We fought hard and produced a better Bill.  Some of us were worried about academic freedom, but this morning the Minister has gone a huge way towards copper-fastening that.  Government amendment No. 15 took some of the language of my amendment and strengthened it, though Senator Lee, who seconded it, may not agree.  Academic freedom is now protected.</P>
    <P>I regret the introduction of members to the board of Trinity College, as it would have been better had this been volitional rather than coerced.  However, I am sure that that board will absorb a small number of outside representatives, whom I hope will be of a very high calibre and without a political tinge.</P>
    <P>I did not mention one side effect of this Bill as I did not want to arouse any suspicions.  The growing power of the Higher Education Authority has been cut back by this Bill.  That body was showing a nasty habit of trying to regulate everything.  It is now a statutory provision that it cannot go beyond certain powers, and the universities are now freer in practice.  I did not say this in the debate as I did not want anyone to say: &ldquo;That is a pity, let us stick the Higher Education Authority all over the Bill and copperfasten its powers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A fair amount of hysteria was whipped up, some of which expressed justified concern.  I received a small volume of intemperate mail which I ignored.  I am glad I saved thousands of envelopes and did not use them to communicate my fears to my constituents.  I can now use them to communicate my sense of triumph and achievement on this Bill during the election.  I am happy to have won as much as could have been conceded, and the Bill is better for the changes that have been made to it.</P>
    <P>There was another matter I intended to raise, which I have forgotten.</P>

    <P>Nowadays, very large sums of money are contributed to universities by taxpayers, and the universities have to accept a degree of accountability. We feel that accountability is already there, but it has not been increased too dangerously. <Col N="354" /> The Minister accepted an amendment she felt was hypothetical, though I fought hard for it, which shows goodwill on her part.  It related to the possibility of the universities becoming self-financing. If that happened, they could float away from the shackles of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the passage of the Bill and the goodwill of the Minister and her advisers.  A small number of us were here until 3 a.m. on Wednesday.  There was an unattributed remark from a colleague in the newspapers that the Seanad was bored by the waffling of the university Senators, which I doubt.  Most of those who would have been bored were not here and the small hard core left here worked extremely hard.

I was worried about the Dublin Institute of Technology becoming a university, and the Minister took that concern on board.  In relation to section 12, which referred to academic freedom, the Minister listened carefully to concerns and I welcome her views.</P>
      <P>I was also concerned about visitation, but the Minister considered those areas also.  I do not want to go over old ground, but she recognised the role of councillors within the governing body.  I am delighted to sit at table any day of the week with councillors because I know their worth.  The fact that the Minister increased the number from 38 to 40 to create a balance shows her concern to reflect the views of all of us.  It is a good Bill and it will be an excellent Act.  I feel very comfortable with it now.</P>
      <P>I appreciate all the listening by the Minister's staff engaged during those long, tiring hours last Wednesday morning.  My colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, who is unable to be with us, also wishes to be associated with the points I have made.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister recognised clearly the diversity between the universities because one of the great assets of our universities is that they are so different and the Bill has gone as far as possible in trying to ensure the recognition of the mission, ethos and tradition of these universities.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ormonde, I am glad that the Dublin Institute of Technology is now in a better position to be recognised as a university through the proper procedures.  I took to heart her point that one sees universities of this, that and the other in foreign cities while Irish universities have a special status.

      <P>Mrs. Justice McGuinness, who put such effort into the forum, is another possibility, as is Senator Ormonde because she has a distinguished academic career.  One thing we, within the universities, know is that more emphasis must be put on encouraging children to get into the right discipline in the first place.  I am a little anxious about Senator Fitzgerald because, first, one could not snatch him from the NUI and, second, a reading of the history of Trinity College would reveal terrible trouble with a Kerryman called Foley at one stage.  Specific parts of the history of Trinity College state &ldquo;watch Kerrymen&rdquo; so I might have to be careful about putting him forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trinity College has many distinguished graduates: Christopher Haskins has done so much for Irish industry by promoting the buying of Irish products, Mike Bogdanov is trying to encourage <Col N="356" /> the performing arts in Trinity College and Michael Colgan, who is present.  Then there are honorary graduates, such as Hugh Leonard. There are vast numbers of people who would be assets to the board.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, the only thing I worried about was the member of the board who spoke about what the academic minds could do to those from outside.  I sincerely hope they will treat gently the first member who is put on the board.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have another woman in my sights, the Clerk of the Seanad, Ms Lane, because she is the one who will have to deal with the Private Bill which the Minister so kindly said Trinity College can bring forward to make the changes which will not disrupt the university's charter or statutes.  I am most grateful for that.  The Minister will be relieved to know that she will not be hearing from me any more; it is, unfortunately, Ms Lane who will be hearing from me from now on.</P>

      <P>I also thank the officials of the Department.  I have come to know them better during the passage of this Bill.  We are not in a position to relate the full history of the Bill but the original Bill was flawed philosophically.  I share Senator Ross's disdain for much of what was before us originally.  I do not sustain that degree of disdain because I think the Bill has been improved greatly.  It has been improved in this House and it is a better Bill as a result.  I thank the Minister for the manner in which she met the legitimate concerns.  It is at least partly due to her willingness to consider the proposals from this House that it is a better Bill. I would go so far as to say &mdash; I did not think I would ever hear myself saying this &mdash; that the fundamental principles of university freedom may have stronger defenders in some parts of the Department of Education than in some parts of universities.  My respect for the Department has risen greatly in the course of this debate.</P>

When I discussed this Bill with Senator Henry seven or eight months ago we both wondered why the Minister would grab hold of this nettle.  I congratulate her for doing so because it would have been an easy one to avoid and there may have been times in the past few months when it was tempting not to push ahead with it.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I spoke about the need for change.  The universities do not recognise the opportunities or challenges which exist or the great need for change in the years ahead.  This Bill has given them the opportunity to change.</P>
      <P>I take credit on behalf of Seanad Éireann, which is challenged by claims that it is not relevant, that this Bill has been changed and improved since it came into this House and, in spite of what Senator Ross says, this Bill is now welcomed as far as I can see by every university and institute, including the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The Bill has also protected the future of universities which do not yet exist.  Senator Kelly spoke of institutions in parts of Europe which were not worthy of being called universities and which had become universities almost be freak chance.  This Bill includes a safeguard for the whole university system.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and her team and we, in Seanad Éireann, must also accept congratulations.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Seanad.  As the only piece of legislation passed to date, the relevance of what happened in this House has made the content of the Bill all the better.  My commitment to move forward in a spirit of consultation and partnership has benefited the education system, but particularly the university sector.  That is because Senators were willing to be consulted and to speak as well as allowing me to listen.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and his officials who have worked with us through thick and thin.  I particularly thank the Leader of the House and Members of the Government parties, the Leader of the Opposition and the spokespersons on Education for their contributions at different stages of this journey.  I did wonder, as Senator Quinn mentioned, why I ever started it but when I start I am not short of breath on the straight.  We have galloped in with extraordinary rapidity this morning to conclude a journey that started a long time ago.</P>

      <i>Charting our Education Future</i> was the title I gave to the White Paper that I brought to Government.  I gave quite a lot of thought to the title.  As regards the development of the university and regional technical college sectors, the role of third education and the Higher Education Authority itself, there were indications in the White Paper that we would put in place a structure that would open up any cul-de-sac that existed in the past.  That framework for development indicated the need for legislation.  We have charted the education future of our young people well.  To the university Senators I say it is particularly noteworthy that the Government has worked together with elected politicians who are proud of their political affiliations.  We referred to Senator Ross earlier, in his absence, and agreed that his at times strident opposition allowed us to put on the record our differing points of view in a way and in a language that would not antagonise even Senator Ross.</P>
    <P>University institutions now have a fine framework for development and their contribution is acknowledged.  They have not just accepted the Bill because it is the best they can get; they have conveyed to Senators that they strongly welcome it.  I am glad they have been able to do so.  It goes back to the work they put in.</P>
    <P>I was a gardener but I do not have time to garden now.  I am not planning to make the time to do so either, but I will try celery at some stage. I acknowledge the work of the officials of the Department of Education.  I say that because some people accused the Bill of coming from Marxist theses.  The Bill began with core principles which we laid down.  We were then prepared to move on and take on board the recommendations of the NUI to have governing bodies reflect a society that now expects universities to be centre stage in our economic and intellectual development.  We will be able to balance the huge investment of the State by allowing universities to retain some autonomy while getting transparency. That is how we started out when the officials went about their business.</P>
    <P>I will conclude where the Bill started &mdash; with the acceptance of those core principles, the acknowledgement of the officials' work, the work of the universities and of those who remained in the Public Gallery.  We have contributed more than a little to education history.  We have made an important contribution to the future of Irish education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment thereby bringing you, Sir, from the lofty realms of university education to the more mundane matters of second level education.  The Cathaoirleach has had his fill of lectures from the lecturers and professors in recent days and nights.  I am sure the realities of second level school buildings will bring him back to normality.</P>
      <P>This issue is one that has been in the political domain for over five years when it was agreed to proceed with a single site community school at Kilrush.  The CBS boys secondary school and the Convent of Mercy secondary school agreed to amalgamate on a single site.  Since then, various developments have taken place and properties have been acquired by the Department of Education. In February 1996 the Department allocated £1.2 million to build this school but no building work has yet commenced.  The issue has become extremely serious because, as I indicated in the house some months ago, the girls' convent secondary school must provide vacant possession by 1 June 1997.  To date, however, we have not been notified of a commencement date, which is extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The parents, pupils and teachers concerned have been patient and understanding given what has occurred in Kilrush over the past five years. They are now at the point of desperation, however.  It was decided last November that parents would remove their children from the school if a commencement date for the building was not provided by the Department of Education.  The principal of the school has notified all parents that teachers in the ASTI and TUI unions have decided to proceed with providing educational facilities next Monday on one site only, namely the CBS site in Kilrush, unless a commencement date is announced.</P>
      <P>Parents have agreed to withdraw their children and the only classes that will be provided are those for pupils sitting examinations and for special classes.  They want to find out exactly when the building will commence, its completion date and the classroom accommodation arrangements for next September.  As five years have elapsed since this matter commenced, it is a reasonable request from parents, teachers and the board of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of management fully understands and appreciates the position taken by the ASTI and TUI.  It views this with great concern.  In fairness to all concerned, because the plans were laid before Kilrush Urban District Council earlier this year and because of the urgency involved, it was arranged that the planning process would be expedited as quickly as possible.  Planning permission was granted but to date we are still stuck <Col N="360" /> on stage three, which is most unsatisfactory.  I request the Minister to give us a commencement date for this school.</P>
    <P>These children deserve a proper building in which to be educated.  It takes approximately ten minutes for teachers and children to go from one school to another and if they are caught in the rain, they must sit in wet clothes for the rest of the day.  These children cannot achieve their full educational potential if this situation is allowed to continue.  Teachers should not be expected to provide classes in two schools.  I ask the Minister to announce a commencement and completion date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed extension to Kilrush community school, County Clare.  I thank Senator Taylor-Quinn for raising this matter.  I would like to give details of the background to this case.</P>
      <P>In 1989 it was decided that the three post-primary schools in Kilrush, the Convent of Mercy, the Christian Brothers' school and the vocational school, should be amalgamated into a single school to cater for 550 pupils in the long term.  In 1995 the planning and building unit of the Department of Education purchased property from the Christian Brothers in Kilrush for the provision of the new community school.  The property comprised approximately 6.5 acres, a number of buildings used by the Christian Brothers' primary and secondary schools and a playing field consisting of approximately nine acres. In September 1995 phase one of the project, which involved the refurbishment of the existing Christian Brothers' post-primary buildings, was completed.  Currently, there are ten general classrooms, a physics room and a science laboratory located on the Christian Brothers' campus.</P>
      <P>At present, Kilrush community school operates on a split site in the town while awaiting the construction of phase two of the proposed development. The architectural planning for phase two, which involves the provision of approximately 2,373 sq.m. of additional accommodation, is proceeding and the design team has submitted the developed sketch scheme for the project in the past two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the architectural planning of a project this size and complexity, involving expenditure in the region of £2 million, takes a considerable length of time. However, it is accepted that there were delays at the initial planning stages due to problems associated with incorporating the Christian Brothers' primary school as part of the overall community school development.  Following various proposals for the inclusion of the primary school as part of the project, it was decided after lengthy deliberations that it would be more economically and architecturally feasible to demolish the Christian <Col N="361" /> Brothers' primary school instead of renovating it. I understand that the examination of the stage three documentation has already commenced and will be completed in a matter of days.  The next stage of planning is the preparation of the detail design and tender documentation.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the Minister for Education is fully aware of the urgent need for accommodation at the school and it was for this reason that last year the project was designated as a priority to facilitate its inclusion in the 1997 building programme.  As I have already said, processing of the stage three documentation is already under way after which the design team will be asked to expedite the remaining work.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to give a definite date for commencement of work on site.  However, the Department will continue to ensure that delays in providing the new buildings are minimised to the greatest extent possible and there will be no delay by the building unit in processing the remaining stages of architectural planning.  When the tender documentation has been completed, tenders will be invited immediately to enable construction of the extension to commence at the earliest possible date.  In so far as it is possible, it is the Department's intention to have construction work started by late August or early September of this year.</P>

      <P>In view of the developments in genetic engineering and the public concern in relation to same, I ask the Minister for the Environment to review the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994.  There are plans to introduce genetically altered material into the agricultural landscape.  There is provision for the Minister to intervene under the regulations of the Environmental Protection Act but so far he has not done so.  He has left it in the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency so there is a continuing series of Chinese boxes or smoke-screens. Recently the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> My Department has not carried out any research on the introduction of genetically modified organisms in the agricultural sector. Issues in relation to agricultural research are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated:</P>
    <P>My Department has not carried out any research into the introduction of genetically modified organisms.  Teagasc is the national body with responsibility for agricultural research, and some limited research in this area is part of the Teagasc Research Programme.</P>
    <P>Mr. Liam Downey, the Director of Teagasc stated:</P>
    <P>Teagasc keeps abreast of developments in gene transfer (genetic engineering) in plants but, to date, has not tested such plants either in the laboratory or field.</P>
    <P>In other words, we have done nothing except shuffle the responsibility from one Department and agency to another.  That is not acceptable because of the dangers involved.</P>
    <P>Genetic engineering transfers genes from the DNA of one species to another.  Genes from a fish, for example, are spliced to the DNA of a tomato to produce a new tomato with delayed ripening.  Other manipulations to soya or sugar beet make them resistant to some herbicides.  The process is interfering with the building blocks of nature and opening the doors to the unknown. One of the most worrying things is that these genetically altered materials are not contained; they can spread into the wild population of similar or related plants or organisms.  It is not possible to control them or to predict the results in terms of resistance to herbicides or weedkillers or the production of toxins within the plants.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about an experiment to genetically engineer beet.  A company called Monsanto proposes to conduct such experiments in this country.  I warn the House and the Minister about the track record of Monsanto.  I have a copy of a detailed affidavit by a distinguished research scientist, Dr. Cate Jenkins, on recent scientific evidence developed after 1984 supporting a causal relationship between dioxin and human health effects.  Monsanto was involved in the production of Agent Orange and attempted to deny its carcinogenic effects on the workers in its various plants who produced it.  Paragraph 393 of the affidavit states:</P>
    <P>The studies that Monsanto Company had conducted on the health effects among its workers exposed to dioxin during the manufacture of 2, 4, 5-T were relied upon heavily in earlier litigation by Vietnam veterans to deny a link between dioxin exposures and increased risk of human cancers.  In 1985, court testimony <Col N="363" /> delivered by Monsanto officials, as well as scientists who had been under contract to Monsanto, cast serious doubts on the credibility of these studies.</P>
    <P>Testimony produced evidence of international misclassification of exposed and non-exposed workers, arbitrary deletion from the study of several key soft tissue sarcoma cases, unverified classification of chlorance subjects by common industrial dermatitis criteria, lack of assurance of untampered records delivered and used by consultants, false statements about dioxin contamination in Monsanto products, etc.  A jury delivered a verdict against Monsanto based on this evidence of scientific fraud, granting the plaintiffs over $16 million in punitive damages.</P>
    <P>That $16 million was subsequently reduced but the conviction stood.  Apparently, we are happily going to permit this company to conduct genetic experiments in our fields without carrying out tests or research or operating the existing regulations. That is an extremely dangerous path on which to embark.</P>
    <P>As already stated, genes do not necessarily remain where they are placed.  In field tests for genetically engineered potatoes, 72 per cent of the plants grown close to the transgenic ones contained the resistance gene.  In other words, it had spread beyond the initial population that had been experimented upon.  Crops genetically engineered to destroy damage-causing insects can actually generate resistance in these insects and thus there is a limited timespan in which these crops will be effective.  The original belief that a gene with a particular function would perform only this function no matter where it was inserted into the new plant no longer holds.  Examples of experiments with petunia flowers to change the coloration of petals, etc., show that the gene was not limited to the original plants and extended into other areas.</P>
    <P>These products are being manufactured in order to increase production output, they are not designed for the welfare of the general population. They are inimicable to the welfare of many populations in deprived areas of the world.  This is not the only fraudulent research carried out by Monsanto.  That company is currently being sued in the United States in respect of fraudulent research on the safety of IUDs, and in the mid-1980s they happily bought out G.D. Searle, a company which at the time was the subject of senate hearings in the USA into fraudulent research being presented to the Food and Drugs Administration. On that occasion, a number of rats being tested with NutraSweet had brain tumours operated on during the trial period &mdash; information on this was excluded from the trial results presented to the FDA.  The FDA commissioner who allowed ongoing use of NutraSweet subsequently <Col N="364" /> took a job with Searle, and there is generally a disturbing revolving door of scientists leaving Monsanto to work for regulators, etc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue.  As Senator Naughten stated on the Order of Business, I look forward to a full debate on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing time.  As a genetic engineer, I take a slightly different view on this issue.  I believe that the regulations are too strict.  When a genetically engineered food product is being assessed in the US, the product, not the process involved, is assessed.  However, in the EU, the process, not the product, is assessed.  The US method is much safer because the end product to be passed on to the consumer is assessed.</P>
      <P>The reason behind the genetic modification of foods is to improve their quality and shelf life by decreasing the additives involved, which means that the consumer will benefit.  EU research in this area is less competitive than US research.  If a food is genetically modified in the EU, the company involved must still make the food naturally which increases expenses and means that the process is much slower.  Therefore, scarce research funding is employed in producing foods through the natural process rather than companies being allowed to use genetically modified processes utilised in the US.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris about genetic field trials on beet, which were introduced for purely commercial purposes.  This product will not benefit the consumer and will only be of use to the company carrying out the trials, which are designed to make the beet more resistant to a weed killer the company produces.  The EU should clamp down on such activity.  This will not be easily done because of the number of regulations involved.  The field trials are rigorously monitored and a four to five year approval process must be undertaken.  Such field trials have been carried out in the US for many years.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions laid down in the regulations is that there must be some way to stop a gene transfer so that it cannot jump from one organism to another.  It is also recommended that if a gene is lost, a kill mechanism must be in place to ensure that it cannot take over the entire population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but at an early stage.  I am referring to the EU regulations while the examples to which Senator Norris referred occurred in the US.  The European regulations are more stringent.  To begin a field trial and place a product on the market in the EU, approval must be obtained from the regulating <Col N="365" /> bodies in all 15 member states not just the Irish Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>There are genuine public fears about this issue which originated with the controversy about Dolly, the genetically modified sheep.  That affair has given people in my profession a bad name. There is a need for further debate on this issue, both in the public arena and in the Oireachtas. People must be given the proper information. There are few risks involved with most foods but, as in the instance to which Senator Norris referred, such risks do exist.  Genetically modified foods have major advantages for consumers because there is no need for additives.  Will the Minister ensure that there is a full debate on this issue in the Oireachtas and that an information campaign is put in place to allow people reach their own conclusions on this matter?</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Norris and Naughten for raising this important issue which relates to the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994.  It was interesting to hear the Senators argue from two perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my responsibility to decide whether a debate on this subject should be held in this House but, on the basis of what I heard, such a debate would be extremely interesting. When it occurs, I look forward to the opportunity to observe.  On Saturday last, during a walkabout in my constituency, two people living in different housing estates referred to this subject which highlights the public's interest.</P>
      <P>I must clarify two points.  First, the 1994 regulations were made primarily for the purpose of transposing two EU directives into Irish law &mdash; Directive 580/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms and Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency is the national competent authority for the purpose of the regulations and directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, only two notifications for consent to deliberately release genetically modified organisms have been submitted in this country since the directives and the regulations came into force.  Those notifications, which relate to field trials of genetically modified sugar beet plants, were submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency by Monsanto plc in December 1996, in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the 1994 regulations.  As competent authority for the purposes of the regulations, it is a matter for the agency to determine the notifications and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the case.  The Minister for the Environment must be conscious of the provisions <Col N="366" /> of section 79(3) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, which preclude him from seeking to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance of agency functions in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>In relation to the issues raised by Senator Norris and Senator Naughton, the Minister for the Environment has plans to amend the 1994 regulations in the light of a number of developments. During Ireland's Presidency of the EU last year, he was pleased, in his capacity as Chairman of the Council of Environment Ministers, to lead and successfully conclude negotiations within the Council on a Commission proposal to amend Directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organims.  The objective of the amendment is to simplify and strengthen control provisions, having regard to scientific knowledge and technical advancement since the directive was adopted in 1990 and practical operational experience gained under it.  The proposal is currently being considered by the European Parliament in accordance with Community co-operation procedures.  When the amended directive is formally adopted, our 1994 regulations will be amended to incorporate the amended provisions.</P>
    <P>In addition to the impending amendment of the contained use directive, the European Commission has also initiated a review of Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.  In view of the increasing level of public concern regarding the release of genetically modified organisms, particularly on the labelling of genetically modified products intended for general release on the open market, the Environment Commissioner has indicated her intention to bring forward an amendment as soon as possible.  The Government welcomes and supports the Commissioner's proposal to amend the directive and will stress the need to ensure that the fundamental objective of protecting human health and the environment is not compromised in the process.  We will also seek maximum transparency in the amended directive, particularly on labelling provisions.</P>
    <P>Pending full amendment of the directive, a technical amendment has now been proposed for the purpose of strengthening current labelling requirements.  We also welcome this interim initiative and intend to maximise this opportunity for greater transparency.  The proposal to amend the directive and the interim measure on better labelling will give rise to amendments to the 1994 regulations to bring them into line with Community legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Senators' attention to the recently adopted EU regulation concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for the implementation of this regulation which comes into force next month.  This regulation represents a major extension of the statutory provisions on the marketing <Col N="367" /> of genetically engineered food products. The Department of Health and the Department of the Environment will consult closely on the parallel implementation of the novel food regulation and the directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  In particular, I welcome the introduction of provisions for labelling.  People are entitled to know what they are eating and the commercial interests have strongly resisted any labelling that <Col N="368" /> indicates the presence of genetically altered material.  There should be a moratorium on the introduction of any new genetic material pending debate on the issue.  Will the Minister of State indicate to the Minister for the Environment that many Members support the efforts of our EU partners, Austria and France, to maintain the right not to allow genetically engineered seeds to be grown in their countries?</P>
