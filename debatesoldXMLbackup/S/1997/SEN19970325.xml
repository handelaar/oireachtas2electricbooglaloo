      <P>I have notice from Senator Kelly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to appoint a remedial teacher to Scoil Mhuire is Íde, Newcastlewest, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to request the Higher Education Authority to reconsider its proposed reduction of grants for research equipment to the universities.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's business is items 1 and 2.  We will take all Stages of item 1 and I thank the Opposition for its co-operation in making that possible.  Item 2 is an earlier signature motion for the Dublin Docklands Bill.  That Bill has been returned to the Dáil so that the &ldquo;Fitzgerald amendment&rdquo; can be inserted; otherwise it is the Bill as passed by this House.  I ask that we move item 2 when that amendment has been made by the other House</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I thank the Leader.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have great difficulty rejecting the Order of Business given how nicely the Leader has expressed himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is he looking for I wonder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Perhaps he could indicate what else he intends putting through the House before the Easter recess.  The Leader is aware <Col N="1062" /> that Fianna Fáil launched a policy document on drugs yesterday and I am sure he will wish to afford the House an opportunity to debate the issues involved after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the subject of information technology in the past, in particular how it might be used in the Houses.  The Leader gave an undertaking to investigate the possibility of making information technology communications facilities available to Members to contact their constituency offices.  Every Member should have an E-mail address at home and in the Houses.  The system has been set up in our offices and it should be extended. The Government has had a positive approach to information technology and public representatives should set a good example by being willing to use it.  Schools need similar links using information technology.  The Leader should raise the matter with the appropriate Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume item 2 will be taken without debate.  The programme of business may be quite congested after Easter but it will be important to discuss the issue of economic and monetary union.  In the context of the fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome it would be appropriate to examine the overall progress of the EU and its future.  The leading article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> says that there has not been sufficient public or political attention to the constitutional changes which will take place.  It states: &ldquo;They should, but probably will not, figure prominently in the forthcoming election.&rdquo;  Those of us who stood for election to the European Parliament will recall similar lectures from <i>The Irish Times</i> to the effect that we should confine ourselves to European issues during the course of that campaign.  However, those of us who did so found that we got no coverage from <i>The Irish Times</i> which has forgotten what it said and moved on to the issues of crime and taxation, which will dominate the general election campaign.  I find it difficult to take that newspaper's posturing which asks us to conduct European debates and when we do so gives us no coverage.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs our deep concern about events in Palestine and Israel and ask him to exert whatever pressure can be brought to bear at EU level to ensure the peace process there is maintained?  He should also express our distaste at the settlements being built in Jerusalem on Palestinian lands.  We condemn acts of violence by Hamas and other extreme Palestinian groups and we also condemn the conduct which can lead to terrorist actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the last few months several Members have sought a debate on the funding and structures of local authorities.  I ask the Leader to treat these requests urgently.  I am a member of a county enterprise board and I have received a document which indicates that the county enterprise boards are to be restructured. <Col N="1063" /> The strategy groups are to be replaced by community enterprise groups; the groups are renamed every other week.  These are groups without funding which can deliver nothing.  The document says that local authorities will become the focus for the delivery of local development initiatives and programmes.  Delivery of what? This House has a responsibility to local authorities. Most of us are elected by local authority members and we have an obligation to debate the matters concerning them.  Piecemeal decisions are being made regarding them.  I ask the Leader to provide us with an opportunity to discharge our responsibilities.  We have a responsibility to debate this matter.  No other House of Parliament has a similar obligation.</P>
      <P>The document also says that community enterprise groups are to be chaired by a local authority member.  This is a complete reversal of earlier regulations when a local authority member could not be chairman.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make a case which I have made on a number of occasions but I am getting nowhere.  We have used and ignored local authorities and I am appealing to the Leader and Members to recognise our responsibilities. We should debate and make a recommendation on this issue which is fundamental to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the sentiments expressed by Senator Dardis regarding <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The Eamon Dunphy principle now applies to <i>The Irish Times</i>, namely, the more it is against one the more popular and successful one is likely to become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not work in politics.  The more they are against someone the fewer votes they receive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader have any information on or plan to debate the future of the tobacco industry given the recent settlement by 22 States in the USA with a major tobacco company? The issues arising regarding health service expenses in Ireland also arose in America.  A number of issues need to be examined including the risk to health of smoking, the financial issues, advertising of cigarettes and the employment of those in the tobacco industry.  We should have a clear statement from the Government whether they intend to issue legal proceedings against the tobacco companies to recoup losses to the State and the health service arising from the promotion of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Dardis in asking the Government to do whatever is possible to alleviate the problems being encountered by the Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere <Col N="1064" /> in Palestine and to ask the Israeli Government to desist from placing a ring of steel around Jerusalem.  The Israeli State is one of only two states established by vote of the UN and it is going against the wishes of the UN.  If it reflected upon the ring of steel that caused the ghettoisation of the Jewish population in Europe during the Second World War, they would appreciate the consequences of it.  They should be aware that what they are doing was done to them and they should have learned a lesson.  The ring of steel that has been put around Jerusalem is a deliberate act and will cause friction in the area.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has worked extremely diligently on this particular issue.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the peace process in the Middle East has come to an end and that we are back to an Intifada type situation which is of no benefit to anyone.  We, in Europe, should be cogniscent of the fact that what happened in Europe caused major problems in the Middle East and we should forget about asking the United States to solve the problems there.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as part of the Troika, to become more involved.  The European Union should try to resolve the problems that seem to be on the way to resolution. Unfortunately, the situation is getting out of hand; we must appeal to everybody to do their best to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Marian Finucane on her election bid.  I have just listened to Minister Howlin announce changes made at Cabinet this morning on her programme.  If the Dáil and the Seanad are to be sidelined, it may as well happen on the Marian Finucane programme.  I congratulate the people in the West, the rural people who put sufficient pressure on the Minister to backtrack on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As we celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, it is appropriate to acknowledge the significance of the achievement which brought peace and stability to Europe.  Hopefully, it can be an instrument for peace and stability throughout the world.  It is important to recognise, however, that, on the borders of Europe, we are seeing a gangster led &mdash; one could not even call it a regime &mdash; reign of terror, intimidation and oppression in Albania. This is happening on the perimeter of the European Community.  Europe does not simply mean the members of the European Community at any <Col N="1065" /> one time.  If we tolerate this kind of inhumanity, cruelty and oppression by gangsters who have no right to, or role in, democracy, then we are weakening and diminishing ourselves.  Will the Tánaiste convey to our European Community partners our total and utter frustration and dissatisfaction with the indolent attitude towards this extraordinary repression of the most fundamental human rights?</P>
      <P>I suggest the House should adjourn and go to the Marian Finucane show as it seems to be far more relevant than what we are doing here.  I acknowledge that the Government have made a very considered decision on the basis of the strong reactions they were receiving to their initial ill considered one.  As the Minister for Social Welfare is coming in shortly, I would like to ask him to confirm that the statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will have a unique opportunity to address this House as distinct from the audience of the Marian Finucane show and to confirm to us that he was gravely mistaken or misled when he said that rural Ireland did not deserve to be treated in the same manner as cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now going to explain to us a decision he has considered with his colleagues which he refused to consider at the time he made that statement.  He must have attended some of the same meetings as I over the past weeks and months to get a feeling of how outraged rural Ireland was by his attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's request to the Leader to debate monetary union because it has widespread implications for employment and income, especially for farmers.  In that regard some aid was provided for Ireland at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry how that finance will be broken down?</P>
      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the plight of small dairy farmers, many of whom have suffered a severe reduction in income because of the restrictions on milk quotas.  He will be aware from previous discussions here that there is a crisis in the dairy sector.  In my county 1,000 small farmers have ceased milk production in the past five or six years and another 1,000 will cease production in the next few years unless something is done about the situation, which is getting worse by the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ascertain if reports from the meetings of the Council of Ministers that the <Col N="1066" /> Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry humiliated this country by going down on his knees are accurate?  I ask that the Minister desist from that type of behaviour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to find out if this is the way Ireland is being represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a row?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must have been out of here too long.</P>
      <P>All sides of the House would agree that the representative aspect of the work of both Houses in relation to the St. Patrick's week celebrations across the world should be recorded by this House.  Politicians get a bad press generally whenever they leave the country but, in the context of the St. Patrick's week celebrations, I, like many of my colleagues from all sides of both Houses, had the pleasure and honour of representing my county, County Leitrim, at a number of functions on the east coast of the United States.  I had the opportunity of meeting a number of Ministers, whom I compliment for the representative way in which they carried out their duties.  Like the American President, we might all disagree politically at home but when people go abroad representing their country, we stand behind them and we should be, and are, proud of them.</P>
      <P>It is in that context and because of the opportunities I had to meet with a number of emigrant groups in the US that I ask the Leader to consider giving Government time to a debate on the continuing issues which are facing emigrants, especially in the US.  I had been of the opinion that the question of illegal emigrants was dead and buried but it is still a live issue.  Since impending legislation in the US Senate and the House of Representatives will have a direct impact on many families in the US who have connections in Ireland, the issue crosses party and regional considerations.  If, due to the alleged lack of time between now and the calling of a general election, the Leader does not have sufficient Government time available, Fianna Fáil will formulate a motion to put before the House and I hope all sides will contribute to it.  I ask the Leader to consider this, especially in light of the publication of the Finance Bill and the gross under-funding of emigrant welfare organisations, particularly in the US &mdash; in Boston and New York &mdash; which are struggling on a mere pittance.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the negative response from Fianna Fáil.  It is a real issue in rural Ireland and I, as a member of a group water scheme, am glad that these groups have been recognised by the Government.  I am surprised the Fianna Fáil Party is so concerned about this because I thought it was in favour of it; I also thought it was in favour of removing water charges.  Reference was made to a big mistake having been made.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister and to the Government the appreciation of the people of rural Ireland for the decision that has been made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaloney" hpid="Mr. Maloney Mr. Maloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, on seeking a meeting with the chief executive of the Tesco group in relation to the takeover of Quinnsworth-Crazy Prices last weekend. Concerns have been expressed by workers, consumers and suppliers about what might happen when this takeover takes place.  Tesco is coming in to take over 20 per cent of the Irish retail market.  The company has excellent industrial relations but there are major concerns among workers in the companies that are being taken over.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister not just our concerns but also those of people supplying these organisations?  A large number of jobs are involved.</P>
      <P>I would also like to raise the case of Danny McNamee who has been a prisoner in Full Sutton Prison in England for the last 11 years.  He has been held in a special secure unit and has been treated abysmally by the British authorities. There is a major push on at the moment to have his case heard in the Court of Appeal before 31 March.  I would ask all party leaders to put as much pressure as possible on both the British and Irish Governments to have his case heard.  If his case does not make it to the Court of Appeal before 31 March it may well be held up for another year.  Danny McNamee's mental state is far from good at the moment.  One can imagine how he feels having been stuck for 11 years in a special secure unit.  I would ask all parties to apply as much pressure as possible to have something done to help him.</P>

      <P>As to the points raised on the Order of Business, the Leader of the Opposition kindly offered a facility if there are other Bills which may need to processed rather quickly.  On Second Stage of the Cancer Screening Bill the Minister promised he would include an amendment envisaged by Senator Finneran.  That is being done in the Dáil today so I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage through this House tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of information technology.  This is a matter on which we should be giving a lead and hopefully we will.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the question of having a debate on economic and monetary union.  If there is time after Easter &mdash; and which I believe there will be &mdash; that debate will take place.  I will convey his views and those of Senator Lanigan on the situation in the Middle East to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  All sides would agree with the points made by both Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan raised the question of local authorities.  He is right in saying there is a special relationship between this House and the local authorities.  We will try to reflect that in a debate after Easter.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith anseo agus tá siúl agam go n-éirí go maith linn inniú leis an mBille. I am pleased to be here in the Seanad today to introduce the Social Welfare Bill, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bills which are enacted each year in the aftermath of the budget will always be among the most significant legislation to come before the Oireachtas.  This is because they serve the vital purpose of protecting and improving the living standards of so many people &mdash; pensioners, people with disabilities, the sick, the unemployed and families &mdash; by giving legislative effect to the increases in the various rates of social welfare payments announced at budget <Col N="1070" /> time.  While this Bill is no different in that respect, it, allied to other social welfare legislation introduced by this Government over the past few years, carries an added significance.</P>
    <P>This legislation effectively underpins the radical transformation of the social welfare system which has been undertaken in recent years.  It also reflects the change in focus and ethos of the Department of Social Welfare which has stemmed from a recognition of the fact that alongside the provision of critical income support there is a need to ensure that the social welfare system is able to actively support the aspirations of people to participate in a full and meaningful way in society by facilitating them in gaining access to training, education and employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill exemplifies this two pronged approach.  It comprises a wide ranging and comprehensive package of measures which provides for an improvement in the living standards of all who receive social welfare through increases in weekly rates of payment which are double the projected rate of inflation for the year; it continues and enhances the pro-work and pro-family policies which have been central to the Government's work; it completes the process of ensuring equal treatment of men and women in all social welfare schemes; it brings about further significant reform of our social welfare system through the introduction of new <i>pro rata</i> pensions and it introduces a new payment entitled sickness allowance to provide a more appropriate response to the needs of certain social welfare recipients and strengthens the social insurance system by enhancing the benefits available to all workers who pay social insurance.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding to set out the purpose of various sections, I wish to draw attention to specific measures in this Bill of particular importance in the development of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>First, I am pleased the Bill provides for the introduction of improved <i>pro rata</i> contributory pensions.  No doubt many Senators will have been witnesses to the frustration of people who, for a variety of reasons, may have a broken or sporadic social insurance contribution record over their working lifetime, and find that when they reach the relevant age they have no entitlement to a contributory pension.  This group includes women who may have worked for a number of years prior to getting married, then spent a long period outside of the paid workforce, for example, on home duties, and who may have later returned to paid employment.  The group may also include self-employed people who started on their own before 1988 when PRSI for the self-employed was introduced.  It may also include returned emigrants whose work period abroad cannot be reckoned for pension purposes in Ireland.  The provisions contained in section 12 will greatly benefit those people.</P>
    <P>The present conditions require a minimum average of 20 contributions over a working lifetime in order to qualify for the minimum rate of pension.  Under the new arrangements, reduced <Col N="1071" /> rate old age contributory pension will be payable to persons who have a yearly average of between 10 and 19 contributions from when they first became insured until the end of the contribution year before reaching age 66.  Regulations under this section will provide that people with a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions will qualify for 75 per cent of the maximum rate while those with an average of 10 to 14 contributions will qualify for 50 per cent of the maximum rate, provided they have a minimum of 260 paid contributions. As the current minimum rate of pension is 92 per cent of the maximum rate, the rates of pro-rata pension payable are reasonable by reference to the low averages required.  These new arrangements will come into effect in November 1997.</P>
    <P>In line with the recommendations in the final report of the National Pensions Board, section 12 also provides for an increase in the number of paid contributions required for entitlement to old age contributory pension from 156, that is, three years to 520, that is, ten years.</P>
    <P>Given that this represents a fundamental change to state pension provision, the increase is being introduced in two phases &mdash; an increase to 260 paid contributions in the case of a person who reaches pension age on or after 6 April 2002 and an increase to 520 in the case of person who reaches pension age on or after 6 April 2012.  The ten years of contributions may comprise an aggregate of 520 qualifying and voluntary contributions of which at least 260 must be qualifying contributions. In addition, a person who is a voluntary contributor on or before 6 April 1997 may qualify on the basis of an aggregate of 520 qualifying or voluntary contributions of which at least 156 must be qualifying contributions.  Similar changes in the contributions required for retirement pension are also provided for in this section.  The number of paid contributions required for the purpose of becoming a voluntary contributor is being increased from 156 to 260 with effect from 6 April 2002.</P>
    <P>The second issue I want to highlight is contained in section 13.  It involves a change in the rules relating to requalification for unemployment benefit.  It will have a substantial beneficial effect on the incomes of many workers, particularly seasonal and casual workers, such as dockers, firefighters, creamery workers, hotel staff and people in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, such workers were precluded from requalifying for unemployment benefit until they had a further 13 PRSI contributions paid after they had exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit.  That meant that until such time as they acquired the necessary 13 contributions they had to have recourse to unemployment assistance which was means tested and took account of their earnings from casual employment. The method by which those earnings were assessed caused particular difficulties in areas where the volume of casual work available was <Col N="1072" /> declining.  Thus many workers found themselves on a reduced rate of unemployment assistance or no payment at all on the basis of projected earnings which had not materialised.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that a person can requalify for unemployment benefit by having the necessary 13 PRSI contributions paid at any time after the 156th day of unemployment, that is, six months.  This means that where 13 requalifying contributions are paid between the 156th day and the 390th day, the claimant can requalify for unemployment benefit immediately after the 390 days have been exhausted.  Instead, therefore, of having to have recourse to unemployment assistance, a claimant in those circumstances will requalify for a further 15 months of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>It is expected that at least 5,000 casual workers who are currently receiving reduced rates of unemployment assistance will benefit by an average of £11 per week under the new arrangements. This is, I believe, an important improvement which further strengthens the social insurance system and makes it even more worthwhile for people to work and pay PRSI.</P>
    <P>A third notable feature of the Bill involves the introduction of a new social assistance scheme, which will be known as sickness allowance.  Under the existing arrangements, people who are incapable of work due to illness but do not satisfy the contribution conditions for disability benefit or the qualifying conditions for receipt of disability allowance must have recourse to supplementary welfare allowance in order to secure income support.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, supplementary welfare allowance is a safety net mechanism for people who do not qualify for a social welfare payment or whose special needs are not covered by social welfare payments generally.  During 1995 there were over 12,000 cases where SWA was paid to people who were unable to work due to illness but had no entitlement to either disability allowance or disability benefit.  SWA was never intended as a sickness payment.  Consequently, I am providing for the introduction of the new sickness allowance which will complete the cover available under the social welfare system for those who are unable to work due to illness or injury.</P>
    <P>Sickness allowance will be payable at the same rate as unemployment assistance, that is, at the short term rate of assistance for the first 15 months and at the long-term rate thereafter.  To qualify for the allowance a person must be aged 18 years or over and under age 66 years, be incapable of work and satisfy a means test.  The provisions as to the assessment of means will be specified in regulations.  I envisage that sickness allowance will provide for an estimated 13,500 people per year who are incapable of work due to illness and currently seek SWA.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> Sections 1 and 2 contain the usual provisions relating to the short title, construction and definitions used throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>The increases in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social insurance and social assistance payments announced in the budget are provided for in sections 3 and 4.  All personal rates are going up by £3 a week and all adult dependant allowances by £1.50 a week, thus providing all social welfare recipients with substantial increases of between 4 and 4.8 per cent, which is about twice the expected rate of inflation for this year.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for increases of £1 in the lower rate and £5 in the higher rate of child benefit, with effect from 1 September 1997.  These increases will bring the rates to £30 per month for each of the first two children and to £39 per month for each subsequent child.  In the past three years, child benefit has increased by 52 per cent for a three child family and 54 per cent for a five child family.  In 1991, a four child family got about £70 a month; this year they will get £138, which is nearly double that.  The dedication of substantial resources to child benefit in recent years represents part of our planned strategy of reforming income support for children, removing disincentives to employment and working towards putting in place a system of basic income for children.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase of £10 at each point in the weekly income thresholds used to determine entitlement to family income supplement. The effect of this threshold increase is that virtually all current recipients will get an extra £6 in their weekly payments from mid-June next.</P>
    <P>The new weekly thresholds range from £205 for a one child family to £344 for a family with eight children or more.  This section also provides that from 12 June 1997 the rate of FIS payable will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any superannuation, PRSI and levies which may be payable.  This revised calculation method is an important first step towards meeting the commitment we made in Partnership 2000 to base FIS entitlement on net rather than gross income.  The measure introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act which provided for the continued payment of child dependant allowances for up to 13 weeks to people who have been unemployed for a minimum of 12 months and who take up employment which is expected to last for at least four weeks, has helped to overcome the disincentives facing unemployed people with families who have the opportunity to take up work.</P>
    <P>Section 7 extends these provisions to cater for other groups, namely, people on community employment immediately before taking up employment and people on the live register or on community employment who take up employment under the &ldquo;jobs initiatives&rdquo; announced last year.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 reflect the changes announced in the budget last January with regard to PRSI. <Col N="1074" /> Section 8 provides for a reduction of 1 per cent, from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, in the standard employee contribution rate.  This section also increases from £22,300 to £23,200 the annual earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by employees and increases from £26,800 to £27,900 the earnings ceiling up to which contributions are payable by employers.</P>
    <P>The weekly earnings limit for the lower &mdash; 8.5 per cent &mdash; rate of employer's contributions is being increased from £250 to £260 per week. Section 9 increases from £22,300 to £23,200 the income ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable by the self-employed.  All of these changes are to come into effect on 6 April 1997.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 provide for the extension of maternity benefits and adoptive benefit to women in insurable self-employment along the same lines as currently available to women in insurable employment.  These sections also provide for a consequential amendment to section 18(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which extends the benefits covered by self-employment contributions to include maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.</P>
    <P>I described earlier the introduction of reduced old age contributory pensions.  Section 12 gives legislative effect to this measure.  I also referred earlier to the reform of the arrangements for requalifying for unemployment benefit, and the relevant legislative changes are provided for in section 13.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 14 is to provide for two improvements in relation to the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  First, it removes the more restrictive conditions applying to widowers in the case of widower's pension payable under the scheme, thus ensuring that widows and widowers are treated equally.  It also abolishes the requirement that the claimant must have been living with, or have been wholly or mainly mainly maintained by, the deceased.  This brings the conditions of entitlement into line with those applying to widow's and widower's contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Second, this section extends the scope of the scheme to provide for payment of pensions to widows and widowers and to the surviving spouse and recipient of disablement benefit whose degree of disablement is assessed at 50 per cent or more, irrespective of the cause of death.  The purpose of this provision is to overcome a problem which arises with the existing arrangements in cases where the cause of death cannot be attributed directly to the occupational injury or disease.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the introduction of a new social assistance payment to be known as sickness allowance.  The relevant legislative provisions are contained in sections 15 to 18.  Section 17 provides for disability benefit to be renamed sickness benefit and invalidity pension to be renamed disability <Col N="1075" /> pension to more accurately reflect the contingencies these payments are designed to meet.</P>
    <P>The completion of our programme of implementing equal treatment of men and women across the social welfare code will be achieved by virtue of the provisions contained in sections 19 to 21 which introduce a new scheme which will be known as the widower's non-contributory pension scheme.  This new payment is designed to meet the needs of widowers who are not rearing children; those who are will continue to receive the one-parent family payment.  It will be available to widowers on the same basis as the existing widow's non-contributory pension.  This part of the Bill also extends entitlement to the new widower's pension to divorced men on the death of their former spouse, provided that they have not remarried and that they continue to satisfy the other conditions of entitlement.  Similar provisions have already been put in place for widows in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for a number of important improvements to disability allowance.  It provides for regulatory powers to extend entitlement to disability allowance to persons who reside in an institution on a part-time basis and otherwise reside at home.  The allowance will be payable to such people at half of the standard rate, subject to means.</P>
    <P>Section 22 also provides that where one of a couple is in receipt of disability allowance and the other is in receipt of old age non-contributory pension or invalidity pension each of the couple may receive the full personal rate of payment. This section also provides that the cost of medical certificates issued for the purpose of claiming disability allowance and the new sickness allowance scheme will be met by the Department.</P>
    <P>Two notable improvements to the carer's allowance are provided for in section 23.  First, provision is being made for the payment of an additional amount, equivalent to 50 per cent of the existing personal rate, to carers who are providing full-time care and attention to more than one person.  This measure aims to recognise the particular difficulties faced by those caring for more than one person and could benefit as many as 2,000 recipients of the allowance.  Second, this section provides regulatory powers to relax the condition requiring full-time care and attention so as to entitle carers of incapacitated people attending rehabilitation training or day care centres on a limited basis to the allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that people who cease to be entitled to the one parent family payment or the carer's allowance may qualify for pre-retirement allowance without first having to have been in receipt of unemployment payments for 15 months as would ordinarily be the case.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in section 25 represent an important step towards the achievement of a more uniform, consistent and even handed treatment of capital and savings for means test purposes across the range of social assistance <Col N="1076" /> schemes by applying new and more generous rules to all means tested pensions and to carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 26 consolidates the provisions relating to amounts disregarded in the assessment of means for social assistance payments.  It also makes provision for disregarding rental income from the assessment of means for old age non-contributory pension where the income involved is in respect of a person who lives with and pays rent to the pensioner.  Section 27 states that the measures contained in sections 22 to 26, inclusive, will be brought into effect by way of commencement order.</P>
    <P>The provision of section 28 are being introduced as a result of measures announced in the budget to deal with the poverty and unemployment trap created by the withdrawal of the adult dependant allowance &mdash; ADA &mdash; and half the child dependant allowance once the earnings of the spouse of a claimant exceeds £60 per week. This problem is being tackled by the introduction of a tapered withdrawal of the ADA in the case of recipients of a number of social welfare payments. Under existing provisions, where the spouse of a claimant to a social assistance payment is not his or her dependant, the claimant is assessed with the joint means of the couple.  The purpose of section 28 is to amend these provisions to provide that, on the introduction of the tapered rates of ADA, a person in receipt of a reduced rate ADA will only be assessed with half the joint means of the couple.</P>
    <P>Section 28, with Schedule F, also replaces the term &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; used for the purposes of paying an increase of benefit or assistance in respect of a spouse or partner with the term &ldquo;qualified adult&rdquo;.  This change in terminology is in line with a commitment I gave during the debate on last year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for a strengthening of the rights of citizens in circumstances where decisions relating to what are known as &ldquo;liable relatives&rdquo; are made by the Department or the health boards.  The position at present is that where one parent family payment or supplementary welfare allowance is paid to a person, any other person who is liable to maintain the beneficiary and any child in respect of whom an increase is payable, is liable to contribute such amount as may be determined by the Department, or the health boards in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, towards the benefit or assistance payment in question.  As these decisions are made on an administrative basis, in that they are not formal decisions made by deciding officers appointed under the Social Welfare Acts, the person concerned does not at present have the right to appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that these decisions will now become a deciding officer function and will thus afford the person concerned the right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.  In addition, it provides for regulatory powers to specify the basis on which the contribution <Col N="1077" /> which a person is required to pay is to be calculated. Section 29 also provides that a divorced person will remain liable to contribute towards the cost of the benefit or assistance paid to their former spouse and extends the definition of order of the court to include maintenance, lump sum, variation and interim orders in respect of maintenance made by any court.  These provisions will be brought into effect by way of a commencement order.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions relating to unemployment payments are contained in section 30.  First, it provides that the provisions under which a person is not paid for the first three days of a claim for unemployment benefit, known as waiting days, will not apply in the case of a claim for benefit made following a claim for disability benefit in the same period of interruption of employment.  Second, it provides for regulatory powers which will be used to eliminate the requirement to serve waiting days for unemployment assistance purposes, in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Third, it enables the Minister for Social Welfare to make regulations specifying the circumstances under which an unemployed person will be regarded as being available for and genuinely seeking employment for the purposes of entitlement to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  Finally, section 30 provides that people who, prior to their participation in the European voluntary service pilot action programme, were in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance can resume such entitlement on completion of the programme. This programme, which was recently launched by the Commission of the European Union, is open to young people between the ages of 18 and 25 and is administered on behalf of the Department of Education by Léargas.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 31 of the Bill state that where a person who receives a social welfare payment by way of personation is subsequently convicted of the criminal offence of larceny, the amount of the payment to which the offence applies may be recovered from any social welfare payments to which the person is or becomes entitled.</P>
    <P>Section 32 incorporates into primary legislation existing regulatory provisions governing the payment of arrears on foot of late claims for the various social welfare payments into primary legislation. Under existing provisions, the payment of arrears to people who fail to claim within the prescribed time is generally limited to six months the this section extends from six to 12 months the period in respect of which arrears of old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's contributory pension, widower's contributory pension and orphan's contributory allowance may be paid.  It also provides for payment of arrears of up to six months in the case of late claims for family income supplement.  Under the present arrangements, there are no provisions whatsoever for payment of arrears of FIS.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> The opportunity was taken to introduce an amendment to this section in the Dáil, the effect of which is to make the current arrangements more flexible and responsive where claims are made outside the prescribed time.  Senators will be aware that the whole issue of arrears in respect of late claims has given rise to a certain amount of criticism over the years, particularly in so far as claims for old age contributory pension and widow's and widower's contributory pensions are concerned.  A number of complaints against my Department have been made to the Ombudsman over the years and the issue has been highlighted in several of the Ombudsman's annual reports. The issue is currently the subject of an investigation under section 4 (2) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, and the provisions of section 32, as now amended, arise from some of the issues raised by the Ombudsman in the various consultations which have taken place with my Department during the course of the investigation.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides for regulatory powers under which arrears may be paid for periods in excess of the six and 12 month limits specified in subsection (2) subject to conditions and in circumstances to be specified in the regulations. These decisions will be made by officers appointed by the Minister for this specific purpose. I believe that these powers will prove to be sufficiently broad to provide the flexibility required to address the issues arising from the Ombudsman's investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 33 of the Bill provides for the collection of PRSI by my Department from certain categories of self-employed contributors.  PRSI is normally collected by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of my Department but there is a need for my Department to have powers in this area to enable PRSI to be collected from people who are exempt from tax liability, such as certain artists. I am not referring here to particular artists.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that a person who became insured as a self-employed contributor after reaching age 56, and who was previously insured as an employee, will be entitled to a refund in respect of the old age contributory pension element of their self-employment contribution in cases where they do not qualify for old age contributory or non-contributory pension. Finally, section 32 also provides for regulatory powers to refund part of the employer's portion of contributions paid in respect of seafarers.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is a new section introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil.  Its purpose is to provide that social welfare appeals may, in certain circumstances, be referred for hearing to the Circuit Court rather than to an appeals officer.  Senators will be aware of the appeals procedure in the case of social welfare claims.  Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision on their claim, they may appeal against it to the chief appeals officer in the social welfare appeals office.  The appeals service provided by that office is independent and impartial and is provided in an informal manner in <Col N="1079" /> keeping with the needs of social welfare claimants.</P>
    <P>The administration of the social welfare system inevitably involves having to deal from time to time with difficult and potentially dangerous situations where staff of the Department could be subject to threats or intimidation.  Senators will recall that it was necessary last year to provide in some instances for investigations and decisions on social welfare entitlement to be carried out by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, I may refer cases to the bureau for investigation and determination where there are reasonable grounds for believing that such threats may exist.  In this way the investigation and deciding functions are taken from Department officials and given to the bureau. The functions of the bureau are carried out with necessary safeguards for the staff of the bureau.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is intended to apply a similar level of protection to appeals officers.  Having considered how best this might be done, I have concluded that the most reasonable approach, which will preserve the right to an independent appeal, is to provide for an appeal to the Circuit Court in such cases.  The service provided by the social welfare appeals office would not be adequate to cope with appeals which might require, for example, special arrangements for the anonymity of witnesses at an appeal hearing; neither would it be possible, under existing arrangements, to provide necessary safeguards similar to those available to officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau for the appeals officer hearing such appeals.</P>
    <P>The procedure envisaged in this section is straightforward.  In relevant cases, the chief appeals officer may direct that the person submit the appeal to the Circuit Court which will determine the appeal in accordance with social welfare legislation and on the same evidence available to the appeals officer.  The decision of the court would, as is the case with appeals officers, be final and conclusive except, of course, for the general right of appeal to a higher court on a point of law. I emphasise that this process will be used sparingly and will not affect the vast bulk of normal appeals made to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides for the amendment of a number of references to regulatory provisions contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as a result of the consolidation, in 1996, of regulatory provisions relating to contributions and insurability.  This section also provides for the deletion of subsection 212(7) of the 1993 Act which provides that a person shall not be required to give any evidence or answer questions tending to incriminate himself.  This provision is regarded as unnecessary in that there is a recognised common law right against self-incrimination and it would be more appropriate for a court to decide whether the right may be relied upon in the particular circumstances of a case.</P>
    <P>Section 36 is a technical measure which provides for the continuity of regulations made <Col N="1080" /> under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which are being amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for the amendment of the functions of the National Social Service Board, which were bestowed on the board when it was originally established under the aegis of the Department of Health in 1984.  In 1995, responsibility for the board transferred to my Department and, consequently, it is appropriate that its functions should be reviewed in light of that transfer of responsibility.  The revised functions are designed to reflect more accurately the important role played by the National Social Service Board in promoting and supporting independent information, advice and advocacy services throughout the country to ensure that all citizens have access to accurate, comprehensive and clear information on the full range of social services.</P>
    <P>Sections 38 and 39 provide for a number of changes relating to health contributions and the employment and training levy and are introduced at the request of the Ministers for Health and Employment and Enterprise.</P>
    <P>Section 40 introduces an amendment to the Pensions Act, 1990, to provide legal certainty in respect of the power in the Act to make regulations in respect of external pension schemes, that is, those schemes established in another jurisdiction which have members in Ireland.  The amendment arises as a result of concern expressed by pension practitioners in Ireland and the UK regarding the situation that will arise when the UK Pensions Act comes into force in April of this year, particularly as it relates to schemes with members in both Ireland and the UK.</P>
    <P>Existing pensions schemes established in the UK, but with members in Ireland, may, from April 1997, technically be subject to the laws of two jurisdictions as will be the case for Irish schemes with UK members.  While the legislation of both countries in regard to pensions will be broadly similar, there are some differences which will cause difficulties to schemes and practitioners dealing with them.  For example, members of Irish schemes based in the UK could be liable to the indexation requirements of the UK which are different from the revaluation provisions in Ireland.  Accordingly, pension practitioners are pressing for legal certainty in regard to such schemes.</P>
    <P>This Bill forms an integral part of our strategy to make the social welfare system more equitable, dynamic and responsive to the ever changing needs of Irish society.  The provisions in the Bill will have the effect of further enhancing the social welfare system and demonstrate the desire of the Government to ensure that it is capable of providing the best possible service to all those who, for one reason or another, are reliant upon it.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third time I have sat on this side of the House for the introduction of a Social Welfare Bill.  One's arguments at times <Col N="1081" /> become repetitive when trying to decide whether these Bills represent a transformation of the social welfare system or are a continuation of a transformation which began many years ago.  At the outset, I welcome the positive provisions in the Bill.  However, in times of high economic growth, many individuals claim that not enough action has been taken in respect of those who most require social welfare payments.  That has been borne out by various commentators and agencies in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill merely inserts into legislation the measures introduced in the budget. During the budget debate there were many positive speeches about the booming economy and the wonderful transformation in our society.  Having listened to the Minister's contribution, it is apparent that the Bill is all hype because, while it contains many worthy measures, a large number of people will only benefit from paltry financial increases.  When in Opposition, some members of the Government claimed they would change the world when they came to office.  However, after three budgets, nothing much has been done. There have been a number of percentage increases in some areas but society has not fundamentally benefited.  In the past, because of the lack of resources, budgets and Social Welfare Bills could only try to maintain living standards but people dependent on social welfare should be entitled to the fruits of a booming and buoyant economy.</P>
      <P>If we are to adjudicate the Government's performance on social solidarity, we must highlight the fact that, under three Social Welfare Bills, this Minister has increased old age pension payments by a mere £7.  The Government has made continuous statements about exceptional growth, increased revenue intake and the great prospects that lie ahead.  However, it is difficult to explain that to a person under 80 years of age on a widow's contributory pension who will now receive £71.10 per week.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge some of the positive aspects of the Bill, the reality is that the elderly in society have again been let down.  The Minister will point out that the rates of pay are above those recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, but is it not time to ask whether a new review body should be established to analyse social welfare payments in light of the fact that this country has turned the economic corner and has more resources at its disposal for those in most need?  It is time to consider the setting up of a new commission, given that we are entering a new era and economic indicators suggest that the county is moving forward in a financial sense. While payments may be in excess of those recommended by the commission, even taking account of inflation, the consumer price index, etc., they may not necessarily be considered adequate to support a decent standard of living in the current climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue highlighted on numerous occasions in debates on social welfare in the <Col N="1082" /> House is the assessment of board and lodgings against parents' income.  Any unemployed young person who wants to have independent means and is living with parents who work is forced by the system to leave the family home and live in rented accommodation.  They then receive social welfare payments and the State is obliged to pay their rent allowance.  This is a gross waste of taxpayers' money and forces young people, who may still be vulnerable, to live in accommodation and a climate which may not be conducive to their personal development.  I urge the Minister to consider this whole area as it is not only a waste of revenue but is contributing to social problems.  It is also putting pressure on the rented housing sector and costing us more in rent allowance.  Everyone is aware that there are young people who will not remain at home for £5 per week but they will leave home and receive £67.50 in addition to a rent allowance.  The logic of this must be seriously questioned.  This issue has been highlighted by many Members in the past.</P>
    <P>This Minister has continually highlighted the substantial increases in child benefit which are very welcome &mdash; I concur with his statement that the doubling of child benefit for a family of four since 1991 is a good development &mdash; but the Government has been very unfair to the children of the most disadvantaged in our society who are dependent on social welfare.  However, it must be clearly stated that there has been no increase in the child dependent allowance paid to social welfare recipients.  Regardless of socio-economic background, the same rate of child benefit payment applies.  In other words, a child whose father is unemployed and living on a day to day basis receives the same payment as a child whose parents are working in highly paid professional employment, yet this Minister did not think it necessary to increase the child dependant allowance. Again we must question this Government's commitment to social solidarity.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the operation of the social insurance fund.  I accept some employers and employees view PRSI as a form of income tax but the social welfare fund is being squeezed and diluted.  The PRSI system was introduced some years ago as an insurance fund into which people can pay and claim benefit when sick or unemployed.  However, we do not respect the dignity of those who pay into the fund.  When they make a claim they are seen as sponging on the system.  We do not treat those who have paid into the fund all their lives differently from those on assistance.  If I pay into an income continuance scheme and am out of work because of illness, no-one would suggest that, in drawing down my insurance fund, I would be sponging on the system, but such a perception exists in regard to the social insurance fund.  That is regrettable because it has damaged people's views about PRSI and the fund.  The Minister is probably as conscious of this as I am.</P>
    <P>The introduction of social security for the self-employed in 1988 by Fianna Fáil was a major <Col N="1083" /> breakthrough.  It provided many thousands of people with old age and widow's pensions for the first time.  Great concern was expressed about the collection of contributions and the solvency of the fund.  Contributions increased from £46 million in 1989 to £93 million in 1996 and to date the self-employed have contributed £587 million to the social insurance fund.  The scheme is working well and funds are available to improve benefits.</P>
    <P>There are two priorities for improvements. First, the benefits should be extended to include occupational injury benefit and invalidity pension because contract workers on buildings sites must have cover for occupational injury.  Farmers and fishermen should also be covered as should other categories of the self-employed.  Second, pensions should be provided for those who were over 56 years of age when they were brought into the system, because since they have fewer than 10 contributions, they cannot receive old age pensions unless they were previously insured.  Taking into account the success of this cash rich scheme, the Government failed to take the necessary and feasible steps and instead raided the scheme to gain popularity in an election year.</P>
    <P>This was also a year when the Government could have advanced the date of payment of social welfare increases to 6 April in line with the new tax year.  The Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government delayed the payment of social welfare increases until September, purely to balance the books.  Fianna Fáil moved the date to July and more recently this Government moved it to June.  Last year the Minister indicated the might bring the increases forward to April but, alas, this has not happened.  Widows, unemployed people and thousands of pensioners expected that the pay date for increases would be restored to April. This has been another disappointment.  It was stated publicly last year that the policy of bringing the date forward would be continued.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister undertaken any review of the cost of the carer's allowance and its attendant means testing in comparison with the cost of nursing home accommodation?  This issue will haunt us for years to come.  In many nursing homes it costs £250 per week to maintain a person.  In the case of an elderly person in receipt of an old age pension this will necessitate the maximum subvention of £120 with a resulting deficit of anything between £50 and £100 depending on the type of nursing home.  There is a fundamental need to reassess the support we give to carers of the elderly and there are many positive economic advantages to giving decent financial assistance to people who are willing to care for the elderly and disabled.</P>
    <P>While an elderly person retains a degree of good health the last thing he or she wants to do is go into a nursing home.  Most prefer to remain at home within their local community.  However, due to the means testing of the carer's allowance, many young people who might other wise maintain an elderly parent or relative at home refrain <Col N="1084" /> from doing so.  The cost of paying a person who decides to care for an elderly relative and maintain them in their home environment would be considerably less than a nursing home subvention and would be of greater benefit to society and the community in general.  The care and attention the family gives an elderly relative in their home would be rewarded.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to review this area and the present means testing system, bearing in mind the demographic changes and the projection that, by the year 2025, we will have an elderly population and the present system of care for the elderly will not be sufficient.  If we are serious about planning for the future, it is incumbent on us to encourage and develop a system that will give our elderly maximum care and attention.  If there was an assessment of the carer's allowance and if extra nursing resources were provided in the community, people would be encouraged to care for their elderly and disabled relatives at home.</P>
    <P>Apart from being paid their weekly unemployment assistance or benefit, many of the long-term unemployed seem to have been forgotten by the system.  If we are serious about ensuring that the wealth and prosperity currently enjoyed by some will also be benefit those in need, we must undertake a fundamental review of the tax and social welfare systems coupled with additional resources for adult education and training programmes so that in the event of a job opportunity arising for a person on long-term unemployment, not only would it be financially advantageous to take up the work but there would be an element of State support, through training, to ensure that the person could take full advantage of any such opportunity. I acknowledge there have been some positive improvements whereby a person on long-term unemployment who finds work is allowed to retain some of his or her social welfare benefits. However, many of the long-term unemployed no longer have the confidence or training to enable them avail of work opportunities.  Sadly, in many areas particularly in cities, many people do not know what it is like to go to work and their children are brought up in an environment where work is almost alien to them.  This can no longer be tolerated.  Massive resources must be injected into these areas to provide the necessary training and social infrastructure to give them hope.</P>
    <P>To date, our approach to long term unemployment has been <i>ad hoc</i> with no clear long term vision.  In times of high economic growth it is incumbent on us to ensure that the social evil of long-term unemployment is firmly tackled because, if we have not addressed this problem when the economic pendulum swings, we will have reneged on another generation and consigned them to the economic dustbin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the provisions of the Social Welfare Act and this Bill have transformed the Social Welfare system as we know it.  That is an invitation to Members of the House to adjudicate on his performance over the past three years. <Col N="1085" /> When Deputy De Rossa was appointed Minister for Social Welfare there were high expectations that he would transform the social welfare system and, in turn, society.  This perception arose because of his years in Opposition when he continually attacked successive Ministers for their lack of understanding and commitment to those on welfare.  However, it can safely be said that there has been no radical transformation, only a tinkering with and adjustment of the system.  It is true that the expectations of many were short lived.  Given the unprecedented economic growth and buoyant revenue, this Minister has squandered an opportunity to make a real difference so that people on social welfare receive a decent income and those seeking work have the incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>Recent ESRI studies suggest that long-term unemployment will continue to be a persistent social problem.  This will lead to a high demand for unemployment payments, notwithstanding rapid economic growth.  In this context radical changes are required.  Initiatives such as family income supplement and the back to work allowance scheme have been introduced but much remains to be done.  There is no evidence to date to suggest that the Minister has fundamentally changed the social welfare system to benefit those most in need.  This is not surprising, considering the Government's overall performance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House after his marathon and unfair battles elsewhere. I compliment him on his dedication in discussions with senior counsel; it shows he is well able to debate.</P>
      <P>I also compliment him on the Bill.  I agree with Senator Kelleher that there should be changes in many areas but over the last seven to ten years we have seen changes in the Department of Social Welfare, irrespective of who was Minister.  We see new structures this years also and I am happy that many of them were introduced as a result of long discussions in both Houses.  We could discuss every year where the £4.4 billion should be spent. Senators like myself feel that some people are not getting enough and some of those paying into the fund wonder whether it is being spend in the right places.  From a social welfare point of view are we focusing on the right people?  We must examine it with a view to simplifying it.  Many elements have been simplified.  Child benefits have been reduced to six or eight payments when at one stage there were 32 different payments for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is concentrating on the increases in rates.  He talked about a rate of inflation of 2 per cent for 1997.  I think inflation will be less than that; therefore, the increase in social welfare rates of 4 per cent will be over twice the rate of inflation.  In the past year or two we complained that the increase was only 3 per cent but that has been increased to 4 per cent.  I have argued for a long time that we should concentrate on increase in terms of amounts of <Col N="1086" /> money and not percentages and I am glad the Bill takes this approach.  This is a welcome development for those who wish to be informed about their social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of short-term contributions is to be welcomed for the casual workers who lost out in the past.  These workers can now go back to work and have their casual contributions taken into account.  It was most unfair that they were not entitled to certain benefits.</P>
    <P>When we discussed the Pensions Act, 1995, we considered what might be the best way to ensure people could receive the most benefit and section 12 will ensure we get value for money and that the benefits will go to those who most need them. These aims must be our priority.  In this era of economic growth we must ensure that people gain from the welfare system.  In my view not enough people are gaining from it.  This and earlier Social Welfare Bills have examined many payments. The new sickness allowance is a subject we have considered in the past and this Bill simplifies the allowance and benefit provisions.  I welcome this measure.</P>
    <P>The general increases in the rates of child benefit and adult dependant payments are between 4 per cent and 4.8 per cent, levels of increase we have not seen for a long time.  Those increases are welcome.  However, we must ask ourselves if the social welfare recipients are getting enough, particularly the elderly.  The elderly are doing well from the social welfare system but they will do even better if we pay for home care.</P>
    <P>The Minister deserves credit for the carer's allowance which has been increased greatly this year.  This indicates our commitment to caring for the elderly in their homes.  The carer's allowance should be availed of wherever possible because it fulfills a social need.  It is a compassionate allowance.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is to be increased, another indication that those in lower paid employment will benefit.  The new weekly thresholds range from £205 for a one child family to £344 for a family with eight or more children. In accordance with the commitment given in Partnership 2000, this relates to the net rather than the gross income and deals with amounts rather than percentages.  The Minister is to be complimented on this increase.  I wonder if the family income supplement scheme is getting the attention it deserves so that the low paid are aware that they are entitled to benefit from the scheme.  However, some people may not wish to avail of the scheme because of the way the supplement is paid.  I will speak in detail on this point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increases.  They prove that the money being spent is benefiting the family unit and not just individuals.  There are other areas in which individuals are not getting enough, for example, young people who have to leave home. I agree with Senator Kelleher that, although the amount of their entitlements has increased, a large number of young people leave home in <Col N="1087" /> order to qualify for increased benefits.  We must examine this matter because it causes social havoc and undermines young people.  I was shocked to find that there were over 10,000 people, between the ages of 18 and 21 years, who have left the family home just to get the extra money.  This causes increased costs in benefits and rent allowances.  I know the Minister is aware of the problems in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill looks at areas where we can spend more and provide benefits to get people back to work.  There were 50,000 extra jobs created last years and although I will not argue that they have solved the unemployment problem, it means 50,000 people are no longer unemployed.  I wonder if enough recognition is given to the problems of the long-term unemployed.  Last week I had an argument with a person who has been unemployed for seven years.  He has a family of three and if he was to accept the job offered to him he would be getting an extra £10.50 per day.  I see his point.  It does not necessarily mean he was being offered a low wage.  However, the structure of social welfare benefits meant he was working for £10 per day extra.  It is very easy to get into a rut after being unemployed for seven years.  We should debate the issues involved in such cases and face up to them.</P>
    <P>The faster we amalgamate PRSI and PAYE the better.  The commission investigating the operation of the Department of Social Welfare and the future structures of tax and PRSI made a recommendation along this line.  There should be one form of taxation.  I do not understand how a person who earns over £23,000 is exempt from further PRSI contributions while the person earning under £23,000 and over £9,000 has to pay.  An employer who pays over £26,000 or £27,000 pays no further PRSI contributions.  We should base arguments on how best to spend the available money having compared the earnings and benefits of those in the high and low income categories. I understand the Minister's provisions regarding PRSI as outlined in sections 8 and 9.  I do not normally speak to simply compliment people but I compliment the Minister on these provisions.</P>
    <P>The other areas being recognised in the Bill are maternity and adoption benefit, <i>pro rata</i> pensions, unemployment benefit and occupational injury benefit.  I am particularly delighted about the <i>pro rata</i> pensions benefits.  All these benefits are being recognised by the Department as being in need of change.</P>
    <P>Widowers did not get the same recognition as widows but the same benefits are now provided because of EU equality regulations.  There is no area now where a widower does not enjoy the same benefit as a widow.  We should discuss a carer's benefit or allowance in the context of the widow's and widower's benefit if they want to bring somebody in to look after their children.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the long-term unemployed. There is a category of people, particularly <Col N="1088" /> men, whom we do not seem to be able to help sufficiently to enable them re-enter the work force no matter what we do to the social welfare structures.  What are we doing wrong?  We can help short-term unemployed and young women to get work; we can also help young men but there is a category of men in particular for whom we should show more concern because there is a tendency to think they will never again be in gainful employment.  In Cork there are families where two generations are unemployed.  There are men of 35 or 40 years who have never worked; there are 45 year old men with 20 year old children who have never worked.  This is a sad reflection on society, especially in the context of how the economy is growing.  We are not facing up to the problem.</P>
    <P>We should ask people who are doing well whether enough is being done and we should ask employers how we can all help these people. PRSI rates have been reduced and benefits have been given to employers, but there seems to be a lack of priority in providing employment for men who are long-term unemployed.  It is a sad reflection on society because they have much to contribute. It is also sad for men to see their spouse going to work when they have never worked.  We are failing in addressing this issue.  However, we should not admit defeat.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in money provided for the Department &mdash; and the Minister has argued at Cabinet for this &mdash; and this can be used to help young people who leave home at an early age and the long-term unemployed who do not enjoy the benefits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>Section 29 raises the liability to maintain the family.  This is an opportunity for us to say that we are committed to the family which is the backbone of society.  The Department has not only expressed its view on the necessity of keeping the family unit together but it has proven its concern by providing an enormous increase in benefit for the third and subsequent children.  Next year the increase should be for the second and subsequent children.  Each child should be provided for equally.  Benefit should not be denied because both spouses are working as that is regulated by taxation.  That is why I would never argue that a review of the 48 per cent tax band should be a priority.  If a person is making money they should pay tax.  However, the bands should be broadened.</P>
    <P>When we look at the carer's allowance and child benefit we see there is an obvious commitment by the Department of Social Welfare and the Government to the family unit.  Many people have commented about how loose our definition of family is becoming in the context of one parent families and common law spouses.  Demands for stringency should not be made when we are dealing with children.  All children are equal.  The review of unemployment benefit and waiting days is also welcome.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says that section 31 provides that: &ldquo;where a person who <Col N="1089" /> receives a social welfare payment by way of personation is subsequently convicted of the criminal offence of larceny....&rdquo;  How will personation be stopped?  People should not be allowed to what they like but we should be compassionate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at long last recognised the problem of late claims, a problem which has existed for years.  He is even prepared to back date this provision and he is to be complimented on that.  I would like the carer's allowance, child benefit, supplementary rent allowance and supplementary allowance for low paid workers to be promoted thus ensuring that each person is well informed about the benefits to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Like the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare has become more open in the way it promotes its services.  That has happened to a great degree over the past few years. The opportunity to publicise the new benefits in relation to back payments of contributions, late claims, carer's allowance and so on should be availed of to a greater extent in the media although the Minister and his officials are to be complimented on the manner in which these changes have been publicised thus far and on the simplification of the Bill and areas of social welfare generally.  The Minister can be assured that if this trend continues, people will continue to benefit.  However, there are particular areas which remain to be examined in order to ensure that unemployed people get sufficient recognition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is important as it affords the Minister and the Government the opportunity to redistribute some of the national finances in order to provide for people who find it difficult to provide for themselves.  In so far as the Bill contains some welcome improvements and meets some of the shortcomings which have been noted in social welfare legislation over a number of years, it is very welcome and we will support it.</P>
      <P>There is an underlying fear that, although we are moving in an important direction, it is happening at a very slow pace.  The vast majority of people in receipt of the benefits we are discussing have an underlying dissatisfaction with the overall social welfare system.  It is not that they find fault with the system's operation because this is very successful but when they compare the amount they receive to the incomes of professional and other people, they are dissatisfied. This is not something which has happened recently; I will not lay the blame at the Minister's door for that.  However, in areas of high unemployment where people, owing to disabilities or whatever, find it difficult to survive it may be that they feel they are not getting a fair share of the finances.  In view of the demands placed on them, many families are under pressure to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not go far enough to ensure that the less well off sections of society are adequately catered for.  That is a complaint which has been <Col N="1090" /> levelled not only at this Administration but at Administrations in which I was involved.  Having been involved in the preparation of the Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare and having held that office for a short time, I fully recognise the work which the Minister has done and the professionalism of his Department.  Difficult and painstaking decisions have to be made to identify the various priorities among competing demands.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record my appreciation of the work of the regional offices in the delivery of social welfare services.  There has been a revolution in recent years in the administration of the Department.  It is important that we continue to provide good customer service and that the queries that arise in this complex area are dealt with adequately and speedily.  The appeals procedure continues to be criticised.  It is regarded as being cumbersome and slow and has left some people in a very unsatisfactory situation.  The establishment of the appeals office and its reorganisation has improved matters but there is still much scope for improvement in the speeding up of appeals decisions.  I do not agree with the section, which suggests that appeals should be dealt with in the Circuit Court.  I am sure the Minister has had enough of courts at this stage.  The appeals procedure could be more efficiently dealt with in the District Court.  Everyone is aware that it would be very expensive to deal with issues of this nature in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I recently met a couple who have been at the receiving end of an unsatisfactory appeals decisions.  As they appear to be residing together, they are assessed as a family but as they have claimed to be living separately, they are separately assessed with regard to incomes. Perhaps the divorce legislation will resolve some of these matters in the coming years. However, there is much confusion about the way in which income tax is calculated compared to the manner in which assessments are made on social welfare.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to streamline the appeals procedure. Perhaps the appeals office could be regionalised as is the case with the rest of the service. The eight regional officer are very effective. I compliment the staff in the Ennis office and in the mid-west region on their efficiency which has been greatly assisted by the introduction of information technology.  People can now walk into their social welfare office and the information they seek is available on screen within a matter of minutes.  This is totally different from the position where people had to make representations to politicians to get information.  Politicians have seen a huge reduction in the volume of complaints received in the area of social welfare. While I welcome the administrative improvements in the regional offices, there is room for improvement in the area of appeals.  The Minister might usefully look at this.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the obvious link between people in poor health, those with disabilities and unemployment.  I am not certain <Col N="1091" /> whether unemployment results in poor health or whether poor health results in unemployment. The situation is chronic for many social welfare recipients.  They suffer as a result of their health and unemployment problems.  Perhaps the Minister has already carried out some research in this area; I am not up to speed with the latest developments. However, it is necessary to carry out some research into the link between long-term unemployment and health and disability problems. Unemployment is creating problems in the health area for many people, particularly with regard to depression.  The problem is worse in cities but it is beginning to affect rural towns.  The unavailability of employment in rural areas is becoming a serious problem.  Isolation is a factor too in that many people are living alone and they have little prospect of gaining employment in rural areas, especially if they are between the ages of 45 and 55 and, as a result, more people are becoming ill and depressed.  There is a need for research to identify how this problem can be addressed.</P>
    <P>People in remote areas encounter particular difficulties, and Senator Kelleher will be tabling amendments on the availability and cost of transport for people with disabilities or illnesses who seek medical attention.  A few days ago a woman showed me bills for £90 for two trips from Kilrush, County Clare, to Limerick, she had to make for medical attention.  This was almost the equivalent of her weekly social welfare payment.  There is no public transport system to cater for these people.  The Minister might identify measures to assist people who are ill and unemployed in the context of innovations in social welfare.</P>
    <P>He might also examine the link between poverty and domestic violence.  There is evidence of an increase in violent attacks on women in the home.  The Clare Haven House project in my constituency provides facilities for women and children who have been attacked and have nowhere to go.  The project is finding it extremely difficult to get necessary funding to provides these services. The health board provides money for some of these projects but, by and large, funding is scarce and the health boards find it particularly difficult to fund such projects.  It is important that the Minister examine this in the context of his grant scheme for voluntary bodies and organisations which I welcome and support.</P>
    <P>The amount of money available to voluntary bodies has been increased consistently over the past few budgets.  The Minister made some changes in that he confined the payments to activities of a social welfare nature.  Perhaps there is a need to examine that again and expand the scope of that scheme, even if it means redirecting some of the funds from the health boards to the Minister's voluntary funding schemes.  I say this because I want to record the valuable work which has been done by a section of the Department on the identification of opportunities and funding of training for the unemployed for alternative <Col N="1092" /> enterprises.  This work to retrain people using part of their welfare payments was mentioned in the Minister's diary and it is worthy of further examination.  The Minister might have a section of his Department deal with that area.</P>
    <P>Although I never really knew what was done by the Social Services Board, which has tremendous powers and responsibilities under the Bill, much advice is available from Fr. Healy's organisation and a huge range of voluntary organisations. I do not know whether that board is now necessary.  I am not competent to criticise it because I do not know much about its activities but the system would improve if there was less bureaucracy and more direct payments.  The Minister has several professional advisers in the Department and other advisers who can direct his attention to the areas where it is needed. Although I am not too familiar with its work, I believe this board has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made some important changes to the carer's allowances which I welcome wholeheartedly.  The expectations for the carer's allowance were greatly exaggerated initially and this led to a certain amount of frustration and criticism of the scheme.  Nevertheless, anybody who has been dealing with the public will know the cost of keeping people in institutions and the burden that places on health boards and families. The investment made in the carer's allowance has been worthwhile and I welcome the extension of it because many families are caring for more than one relative.  Perhaps further adjustments can be made to it because it is desirable to encourage elderly people to remain in the family environment as much as possible.  It would be far cheaper and more sensible from the point of view of families to have their elderly relatives live with them or nearby.  I welcome the improvement and hope it can be expanded further as the scheme develops.</P>
    <P>I have never been a great admirer of the family income supplement scheme.  It is very cumbersome and complicated and the volume of uncollected payments year after year indicate clearly that there is a lack of awareness and understanding of how the scheme works.  Last year we endeavoured on Committee Stage to extend the scheme to small farmers, many of whom are in receipt of unemployment assistance and whose incomes were eroded severely over the past number of years, especially with the introduction of milk quotas, levies and super levies.  The amount of money required to extend FIS to small farmers in receipt of assistance would not put an enormous burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could find a mechanism to simplify that scheme it would be welcomed and there would be a greater uptake.  A sizeable amount of money was not drawn down for a number of years and, at the same time, research indicated that a sizeable number of people are entitled to claim it.  This lack of take up may be due to the cumbersome way the FIS is calculated.  I cannot advise the Minister how to adjust it but I am sure <Col N="1093" /> he has his own ideas.  Would it be better to redirect the FIS budget?</P>
    <P>I support Senator Cregan's views on the desirability of supporting the family.  This is a family Bill and all the indications are that this money is being directed in the proper way but FIS should be examined.  The Minister should undertake to provide a report to the Houses on the operation and impact of the FIS scheme.  Research undertaken on small farmers' assistance in the early days showed that the bulk of the money was put back into production.  A research project in my constituency indicated clearly that there was a substantial increase in production in the areas which were receiving that assistance; this indicated that the money was being invested in improvements to the farms.  There is no comparable report on the impact the FIS has on economic circumstances of the families involved.  Perhaps some work should be done there by the Combat Poverty Agency or other groups.</P>
    <P>In relation to family income support, education needs to be carefully looked at by the Minister, perhaps in consultation with the Minister for Education.  Everyone recognises the link between a lack of educational qualifications and the difficulty of getting employment.  Many families in the lower income group and people depending on welfare payments of one kind or another find it extremely difficult to keep their children at school or college.  This problem is particularly acute in rural areas because of the added burden of travel and subsistence expenses for those who must leave home to attend college.  While the situation may be deteriorating in the cities, in rural areas one now finds a far greater percentage of children from less well off sections of the community and people dependent on unemployment assistance benefits or welfare disabilities going on to second and third level education.</P>
    <P>At the weekend I spoke to a woman who is on unemployment assistance, as is her husband. They have two children attending the University of Limerick.  The cost of keeping children in an exceedingly expensive university city such as Limerick is an extraordinary burden to carry.  The remainder of the family are suffering severely as their lifestyles are curtailed.  The Minister could do something in such a case through voluntary schemes.  I am not saying it is necessary to introduce a broad and expensive multi-million pound scheme, but he might look at the initial voluntary fund which is doing an excellent job having started off from small beginnings.  Hundreds of voluntary organisations have been assisted around the country providing excellent services and facilities for people who are in need.  If some attention was given to how family education support might be built into the welfare system it would alleviate some of the long-term problems the Minister has with more and more people with less education coming onto the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> I compliment the work that has been done by welfare officers working on this new initiative which has taken off in the past few years.  They identified people in areas of unemployment and deprivation, supported them and helped them to get out of the unemployment trap into meaningful employment.  This is a welcome development which I would like to see expanded and developed further.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill would be a further effort to make the system more equitable.  It is probably going along those lines, although I would like to see more fundamental investment in this area.  Any Minister will have the problem of trying to convince colleagues in Government of the necessity for sizeable investment in this area if we are to do a meaningful and positive job. In the short time that is available to the Minister, perhaps he could introduce some new dynamics into the areas I have mentioned, including the link between health and unemployment problems, education and unemployment, and deprivation and small incomes.  He might also look at bringing closer into this system the voluntary organisations that have been helping out greatly.</P>
    <P>I wish to compliment Fr. Seán Healy's organisation on the valuable work it is doing.  It has made positive criticism, which is welcome in this area, of other Ministers.  The Bill is useful in so far as it goes.  It could go a lot further but we will take it as it is.  It is welcome and we support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a ritualistic and almost tribal tradition in the Houses of the Oireachtas that when speaking on a Bill such as the Social Welfare Bill or the Finance Bill in any year but particularly in an election year, Government Deputies and Senators welcome the Bills while Opposition Members acknowledge that they are good in spots, like the proverbial curate's egg, but overall they lack vision and a strategic approach.</P>
      <P>As a first term Members of Seanad Éireann it would be a bit impertinent of me to fly in the face of that tradition.  I do not intend to but I sincerely hope that in this debate we shall give credit to the Minister where credit is due and provide a constructive input on every aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I genuinely believe that the Minister, in formulating this Bill which, among other things, gives legislative effect to the social welfare provisions of the budget and to certain aspects of the Partnership 2000 agreement, has been innovative, thoughtful and caring.  I congratulate him on the social progress he has incorporated in the Bill. Certain steps have been taken in the Bill which any sensible public representative must applaud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare payment increases in the Bill are between 4 per cent and 4.8 per cent, which is approximately twice the expected rate of inflation for this year.  Most recipients of social insurance and social assistance payments are now at or very close to the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  To any representative who puts people before politics that must be a landmark development which we should all <Col N="1095" /> welcome.  I would have liked more generous increases in the rates of social welfare payments. I am sure that every Members of this House would join with me in that and I am sure the Minister would fully share and, indeed, lead us in that aspiration.  The Minister and the Government have, however, to achieve a balance in relation to the varying demands on them.  In my view they have struck a very good balance in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A further aspect which I warmly welcome is the increase in child benefit.  This is particularly targeted at supporting families and is largely relied on by mothers.  The Minister and this Government can validly claim credit for transforming the child benefit system in a strategic approach to reforming income support for children. In the past three years child benefit has increased by 52 per cent for a three child family and slightly more for a four child family.  In 1991, a four child family received approximately £70 a month.  This year it will increase to £138, virtually double the amount in 1991.  The Minister has worked hard and effectively at greatly improving such payments to mothers of young children.  I have little doubt that the transformation in this area is fully appreciated by people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I regard the sickness allowance being introduced by the Minister as an important innovation. We have all come across cases over a number of years where people who were ill did not qualify for either disability allowance or disability benefit because they did not satisfy the contribution conditions. Such persons had, in the past, to resort to supplementary welfare allowance, paid through the health boards, which was never intended as a sickness payment.  The sickness allowance will be paid at the same rate as unemployment assistance, both short and long-term.  The introduction of this allowance fills a void in our social support system and its introduction will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Another innovative feature of the Bill, and arguably its most important provision, is the introduction of the <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension. Under this provision in section 12 reduced rate old age contributory pensions will be payable to persons who have a yearly average of between ten and 19 contributions over the period from when they first became insured until they reach the age of 66 years.  This pension will have a particular applicability and attractiveness to married women who return to the workforce having reared a family; to returned emigrants whose work period abroad cannot be reckoned for pension purposes in Ireland; and to certain categories of self-employed people.</P>
    <P>Over the years many public representatives have pressed for a change in this aspect of our social welfare and the Minister is to be congratulated on making this significant advance.  It is to be welcomed not just as a progressive social measure but also as a matter of justice.  If people make significant contributions to the social <Col N="1096" /> insurance fund, even if they are not continuous, they should expect a return from them, particularly in their later years.  This innovation responds to that requirement.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see progressive social measures being introduced in this Bill.  The Minister will be regarded in the future as an innovative, caring and effective holder of a difficult portfolio.  This is a time of progressive social developments in our country.  Our economy is going through a period of unprecedented prosperity. We have been assured over the years that the rising tide will lift all boats.  However, that will not happen without intervention.  The prosperity does not trickle down unless someone makes it happen.</P>
    <P>Poor and disadvantaged people in our society have had to wait a long time for some of the developments incorporated in this Bill.  For example, the Minister is introducing a new non-contributory pension scheme for widowers which is a long overdue aspect of equality legislation. He is extending entitlement to disability allowance to persons who reside in an institution on a part-time basis or at home, as recommended in the recent report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  It is sometimes claimed that the work of such commissions is a pretext for doing nothing.  However, with good government they can act as a guide to effective action.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, which the Minister inherited, is also a successful measure.  Any Government which claims to have a monopoly on innovation and intelligence, even if it is made in an election year, is flying in the face of history and reality.  This Bill greatly improves the carer's allowance.  It relaxes the conditions on people requiring full-time care so that the person caring for them will get the carer's allowance even if the incapacitated person is attending rehabilitation training or day care centres on a limited basis. That is a practical and imaginative approach to the problems of people whom the rest of society should support.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from a number of groups which are faced with special problems as a result of current administrative practices. Separated persons in receipt of maintenance payments, for example, are barred from participating in various FÁS schemes, such as the SES, because of administrative decisions.  I ask the Minister to review this approach so that these groups are given an equal opportunity to participate in such FÁS schemes.</P>
    <P>I have also had representations from the INOU in relation to section 30(4)(b).  The INOU wants this subsection, which deals with the regulations specifying the circumstances in which a person is or is not regarded as being available for or genuinely seeking employment, deleted.  This is a highly technical matter with which I and other Senators may not be able to deal.  I presume the subsection was drafted in response to the Department's experience in this regard.  I would be <Col N="1097" /> grateful if the Minister referred to the concerns expressed by the INOU in his reply.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the beginning of my speech that I would take the predictable stance of a Government Senator in support of this Bill.  However, even by objective standards it will be regarded as a progressive and reforming Bill which has made pioneering and worthwhile improvements to our social legislation.  It is vital that we protect the most vulnerable groups in our society and that there is social cohesion and solidarity across the generations and income groups.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government for taking important steps in that direction and I am proud to support these measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only does this Bill mean a lot to the people who will benefit from its provisions, but it also shows that social welfare has a more meaningful role than it had in the past.  It is important to win people's confidence in that regard.  We seemed to be going in the wrong direction for a while as people believed it was right to be on social welfare.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill is often seen as routine legislation which gives effect to the budget.  Its effects, however, will be felt by thousands of households who depend on the social welfare system to maintain and improve their quality of life. Social welfare is not simply about providing assistance to people in times of need.  It encompasses a comprehensive social insurance system which is under assault from certain political elements but which Democratic Left is determined to maintain and enhance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions for <i>pro rata</i> pensions which will enable many people with atypical employment histories to benefit from the social insurance system.  As well as a general increase in social welfare rates, the Bill targets families for particular assistance.  Child benefit is being increased, bringing the total increase to over 50 per cent in the past three years.  Provisions is also made for a substantial increase in the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>Evidence shows that families, particularly large families, are most likely to live in poverty.  Democratic Left and this Government have made a conscious decisions to target poverty by targeting those most at risk from it.  That decision has not always been popular.  Some people believe that social welfare improvements should be implemented in a scatter-gun fashion.  However, effectiveness rather than popularity should be the test of good government.  The family friendly thrust of this Government's social welfare policies will be felt long after its critics have been reduced to historical footnotes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fundamental cause of poverty is unemployment and low paid work.  The measures presented in the budget and given statutory effect in this Bill are designed to make the transition from dole to work easier and to alleviate the circumstances of those in low paid work.  Measures ranging from the change in the way adult dependant <Col N="1098" /> allowance is assessed to the improvements in family income supplement are designed to encourage people to take up employment and, in the case of family income supplement, to improve the standard of living for those on low pay.  These measures are necessary and welcome.</P>
    <P>Low pay, however, cannot be addressed in the long term by subsidising low wage employers through initiatives such as family income supplement. Democratic Left has long argued that the current sectoral minimum wage agreements should be extended to include all sectors where low pay is a problem, with the eventual aim of moving towards a general minimum wage. Approximately £23 million has been paid in family income supplement.  We should examine why workers in some statutory bodies qualify for family income supplement.  If a person does not qualify for disability benefit, although they have a medical certificate, they must go to a community welfare officer.  However, these officers do not make uniform decisions.  Consequently, I wish that uniformity be built in.  Will a medical certificate be required before a person qualifies for the sickness allowance?</P>
    <P>Two thousand people could benefit from the carer's allowance.  People are very interested in it and I welcome it.  I promote it as much as I can in my local area.  While one must be clinical in his or her appraisal of any issue, one must be sympathetic in his or her approach and decision on this matter.  Sometimes a person caring for an individual may not be residing in the same house but could be living nearby.  This care and attention means the individuals involved can stay in their own homes.  However, very often an individual cannot be looked after at home and in some instances are handed application forms for private nursing home subvention and subsequently admitted.  They find their home is taken into consideration when applying and their savings are gone before any decision is made to provide the subvention.  That needs to be looked at as I am sure the Minister is aware of the percentage of the population that is aging.  In some instances relatives claim for parents.  That did not happen years ago but it is a sign of the times and must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the liability to maintain family under section 29?  Single parents qualify for benefit, but the other half is not far away. Is that person liable to provide maintenance?  If not, it should be provided.  Reference was made to a person who must prove he or she is available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The section concerned is archaic, but under its regulations there will be more flexibility in its interpretation. There is a doubt in people's minds as to how it will be applied.  They feel it could be used against them.</P>
    <P>I refer to decisions on late claims.  Cases occur where an individual in receipt of a widow's pension suddenly realises after a number of years she is over the pension age.  She is told she is entitled to a pension in her own right because she has the <Col N="1099" /> necessary qualifications, yet she is restricted for six months.  I welcome the increase.  No matter how clinical one is in his or her appraisal of the situation, one should be sympathetic.</P>
    <P>Why is it necessary to refer to the Circuit Court?  Social welfare appeals officers are always very amenable to medical representations where individuals apply for disability benefit or the sickness allowance.  Referral to the Circuit Court should not be encouraged.  I welcome the Bill and the Government will be returned to office to implement its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have a query which was brought to my attention by Mrs. Devaney from Castlebar.  Where two people draw contributory pensions and one dies, the other person is not entitled to the six weeks pension.  I would welcome a change in the law in regard to this.  I will raise it again on Committee Stage and ask the Minister to give it consideration in the meantime.  I have no doubt, as Senator Sherlock said, that this Government will be returned to implement the many attractive aspects of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I ask for some common sense from the Opposition benches in regard to social welfare and the innovation it requires. There is no doubt that payments to social welfare recipients are inadequate.  I am on record in this House as a member of the Opposition and Government that we need to do a great deal more in regard to the rate of payments to people <Col N="1100" /> whose sole income is from social welfare payments. If we want more expenditure, we must find the money to pay for it.  We will not find that by abolishing the social insurance system as proposed by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>In relation to innovation, in the next couple of weeks we are publishing a Green Paper on the voluntary sector and its relationship with the statutory sector.  We have developed, and are on the point of approving, a national anti-poverty strategy, which is the first time a Government has addressed the question of poverty in a strategic way.</P>
      <P>We have introduced in this Bill new and improved <i>pro rata</i> pensions which will solve considerable problems for many people who have very large gaps in their social insurance contributions. It will also solve some, although not all, problems for people on fairly low occupational pensions who have made mixed insurance contributions over the years, such as CIÉ workers who have been caught in that trap.  We are introducing reform in regard to late claims and a new sickness allowance.  We have made significant improvements in what was formerly known as the disabled person's maintenance allowance and which is now referred to as the disability allowance.</P>
      <P>We have introduced a new one parent family payment which gives significant incentives to single parents to enter the labour market.  This is available to every one parent family which needs support, regardless of whether they are separated, deserted, divorced or unmarried parents and whether they are men or women, which is a significant development.  We have completed the process of equality in the social welfare system. There is no scheme in the Department of Social Welfare which discriminates between men and women on the basis of gender.</P>
      <P>We have increased child benefit by an average of 50 per cent in the last three budgets.  It is important to bear in mind that that is a strategic policy decision.  It is not simply a question of locating some money and seeing into what it can be put; it is put into child benefit for very real, policy based reasons.  All the research indicates that families with children are at a greater risk of poverty and families with large numbers of children are at the greatest risk.  That is why we have given significant increases to families with three and more children.</P>
      <P>We will continue to develop that child benefit approach.  That is directly linked to one of the criticisms which was made of child dependant allowance, which is paid in tandem with an adult allowance to a person on social welfare who has a child under a certain age.  It is recognised by all researchers that child dependent allowances are a very real disincentive to the unemployed to take up work.  In the last three budgets we have frozen the child dependent allowance, for which we make no apologies, and loaded all the increases for children into the child benefit system.  That is the best way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> Child benefit is not taxed and is not withdrawn from those on differential rents or if one is means tested for any scheme under the Department of Social Welfare, health boards or any other Department.  It is a payment which every parent with a dependant child receives regardless of their income, which has led to some criticism. However, a point that is missed is that less than 7 per cent of child benefit goes to families with incomes in excess of £25,000 a year.  There is a very good reason for that statistical reality &mdash; when the vast majority of people move into the higher levels of income their children are already reared.  Child benefit is one of the most important schemes and benefit every child, regardless of their class, where they live or whether they have good or bad parents.  A million children and 500,000 households receive child benefit.</P>
    <P>A question was asked about what could be done for the long-term unemployed, particularly men.  That is somewhat ironic because when I was first elected to the other House in 1982 one would have been laughed out of the House if one had complained about discrimination against men as the discrimination was all against women at that stage.  There is a growing perception that certain categories of men are not being treated fairly under the social welfare system.  To some extent that derives from the fact that the Department of Social Welfare, in constructing certain schemes, targets particular categories of people for assistance, of which child benefit is an obvious example where payment is made for a child regardless of the income of the household.  It could be argued on equity grounds whether that money is well spent; I argue it is.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement could also be described as discriminatory because it only goes to people who work and have children to support. We are currently paying in the region of 13,000 people who are working and supporting children £25 million under the family income supplement scheme.  Questions have been asked about family income supplement, whether it is working effectively and if enough people know about it, about which a number of points need to be made.</P>
    <P>In a public survey carried out by the MRBI on behalf of my Department last year it was found that 76 per cent of people are aware of the family income supplement, which is a fairly high level of awareness.  It is clear there must be other reasons for eligible people not claiming that allowance. We do not know what those reasons are but there is a range of theories on it.</P>
    <P>I know people who have taken jobs and will not apply for family income supplement, for which they are eligible, because they do not want to be in receipt of a social welfare payment.  They feel that because they are now working they should be finished with social welfare payments. There is a range of other attitudes which need to be examined to identify whether we can improve the take-up rate of that allowance.</P>
    <P>There is also a reverse psychology involved.  I am not suggesting this is widespread, but I know <Col N="1102" /> of cases where employers use the family income supplement as a means of depressing wages.  An employee might be reluctant to apply for FIS, which must be stamped by the employer, because they might not get the raise they are due in six or 12 months' time.</P>
    <P>There is a range of issues relating to family income supplement which must be addressed. However, there is a commitment in Partnership 2000 that we will convert assessment for family income supplement on a net basis, in other words, the income which will be taken into account will be the income after tax, levies and PRSI have been deducted.  At the moment, it is calculated on the basis of gross income, although we introduced a disregard for PRSI and levies this year.</P>
    <P>The changes we have made to unemployment assistance for part-time workers is of benefit to men and women without discrimination.  The retention of the child dependant allowance for 13 weeks after a person takes up employment is available to men and women without discrimination. The back to work allowance scheme, where a person can retain 75 per cent of their unemployment assistance on a reducing basis to 25 per cent over three years, is available to men and women.  FÁS training is also available and we provide support for child care through various schemes.</P>
    <P>The back to work allowance scheme, one of the most successful re-employment schemes introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, is simple to operate and understand and has enabled 17,000 to come off the live register and into work.  We are expanding the numbers to 22,000 this year and &mdash; a unique innovation &mdash; are setting aside 1,000 of those places on a pilot basis for people with disabilities who are on disability allowance.  They would not have been entitled to do this in previous years because they were not on the live register.</P>
    <P>We have taken on board the representations made regarding late claims and have extended the scheme from six to 12 months.  We are also incorporating into the legislation regulations which allowed flexibility regarding late claims, together with a ministerial prerogative which could have been used or abused by any Minister, although I am sure that never happened.  It will now be a prerogative for officials appointed by the Minister to ensure that any decisions made will be above board.</P>
    <P>We are providing that the chief appeals officer can refer an appeal to the Circuit Court in certain cases to deal with situations referred to us by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Circumstances have arisen where we have allocated deciding officers to the Criminal Assets Bureau.  They have certain protections under legislation, given the nature of the work they are dealing with.  We have made this provision because there may be cases where the appeals officer would not be in a position to decide a case due to the risk of threat or intimidation. It is an unfortunate reality; nevertheless, I do not expect it will be used widely.  Arrangements <Col N="1103" /> are being made to ensure that the procedures are simple and straightforward in the Circuit Court and it will not be clogged up with such cases.</P>
    <P>The INOU requested that the section dealing with regulations regarding availability for work should be dropped.  This is not acceptable.  There is a two way contract involved in unemployment assistance.  Those making social insurance contributions insure themselves against unemployment, sickness, maternity, old age, orphans, widowhood, etc.  Certain conditions apply to these schemes &mdash; for example, a claimant for widow's pension must prove that her spouse died and a claimant for an unemployment payment must prove that he or she is unemployed.  Employers and employees make contributions to the social insurance scheme; but where the contributions are not adequate the State, through the taxpayer, makes a contribution to those who are unemployed in the form of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation, as does the recipient, to ensure that only those entitled receive payment. That is why we are looking at the question of availability for work.  The right to receive an unemployment payment is balanced by the concomitant responsibility to seek work if one is fit for work and to take up training or available work that is suitable to one's talents, abilities, etc. It does not have to be any kind of work; it has to be available within reasonable proximity of one's home.  While we do not expect people living in south Kerry to travel to north Donegal to find work, there are criteria that must be complied with to qualify for unemployment assistance or benefit.</P>
    <P>We are taking this power in the Bill to look again at the question of availability for work.  The INOU is concerned that this will become a way of denying unemployment assistance to those entitled to it.  That is not the case.  I have already undertaken to consult with the INOU before the regulations are finalised in an attempt to ensure that they will not present it with problems.</P>
    <P>Approximately 8,000 people are in receipt of a carers allowance.  It has been suggested that we undertake a review of the allowance and the needs of carers, etc.  In tandem with the Department of Health, I undertook such a review, which revealed that one in four carers currently in receipt of the allowance care for more than one person.  That is why we have introduced a 50 per cent increase for people in that category.</P>
    <P>As in all schemes, a fixed amount of funding raises questions of priorities &mdash; for example, are more people to be included, is more to be provided to those already covered, or is combination of both approaches to be adopted?  In the past number of years, I have increased the amount of money that a cared for person may have while still qualifying for the carers allowance, provided a companion pass for the carer, a substantial £5 increase last year on the carers allowance and maintained such an increase this year.  I have also <Col N="1104" /> introduced the 50 per cent bonus this year for those who care for more than one person and have eased to some extent the criteria for full-time care where a person is training on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>As in other areas, I am conscious of the fact that many more than 8,000 people care full-time for relatives in the home.  It is estimated that approximately 30,000 people care on a full-time basis.  Depending on how one counts them, some organisations argue that the figure is closer to 100,000.  If we are to fund a scheme that will provide an income for such numbers we must look seriously at how we will find the funds.  Senator Sherlock's suggestion, that we vary the requirement that the person providing the care live in-house, is attractive.  In my own constituency, for example, a daughter caring for her parent living in the house next to her does not qualify.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances where sons or daughters are living in cottages on small farms and their parents are living in even older cottages on the same land but they do not qualify.  The problem is this.  If there is a certain amount of money available, should the scheme be expanded to include people in those circumstances or extended in another way?  Choices must be made in terms of the most urgent need.  This year the most urgent need was to assist those who are caring for more than one person.  That is the judgment I made and I stand by it.  However, this does not mean the reforms suggested by Senator Sherlock and others should not be implemented.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a debate on my suggestion that a carers' benefit which would not be means tested should be considered.  At current levels this would cost approximately £50 million a year, an increase of approximately 0.5 per cent in PRSI. This is the choice we must make.  Do we want to provide that type of benefit and pay for it through PRSI or another way?  The issue of carers must be addressed not only in terms of giving them a basic rate of income similar to unemployment assistance but also in terms of a rate for the job.</P>
    <P>Respite care must also be considered.  A person cannot give care for 18 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year without a break.  They will die before the person for whom they are caring. Other aspects which must be examined are nursing back up, transport and other services.  This major issue must be addressed because Ireland is an ageing society and people are living longer.  It will not become a major problem in the foreseeable future but it is growing and needs to be addressed.  If the current Government, as I expect, returns to office by the end of this year, I will promote this issue.</P>
    <P>The review of the carers' allowance carried out by my Department and the Department of Health found there would be little difference between the cost of what carers should receive in terms of back up services compared to the cost of institutional care.  However, the quality of care, in terms of the responsiveness of the person who is being cared for, is much better when they are <Col N="1105" /> cared for at home rather than in an institution.  I do not suggest the quality of care in institutions is not good but it is a different type of care.</P>
    <P>There will always be a need for institutional care because some people are so ill and disabled that they cannot be cared for at home.  It is not humanly possible for a son or a daughter or a husband or wife to care for such people at home. It is a question of getting the balance right between providing the best possible quality of care and ensuring that the service of those who provide care is recognised.  I would not mind if Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael or the Labour Party robbed my idea of a carers' benefit and made it their policy in the next election.  They would have my full support in that regard.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  The Minister shall consider the possibility of increasing the personal rates of benefit of Widows and Widowers over age 66, over the course of three years, to the level of the personal rate of old age contributory pension, and place a report on this matter on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial increase this year in any event.  My main priority in the area of increasing the basic rates of payments is to bring all rates up to the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in keeping with the commitment in Partnership 2000.  The cost of the improvements in rates provided for in the Bill is almost £83 million in 1997 and more than £148 million in a full year.  This represents significant progress in meeting the commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most social insurance payments are now at or well above the main rate, recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  For example, old age and retirement pensions are now 113 per cent of the CSW rate, while unemployment and disability benefit will increase from 95 to 98 per cent of the main rate.  Similarly, all long-term social assistance payments are being increased from 95 to 98 per cent while short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance payments are being increased from 92 to 95 per <Col N="1106" /> cent.  The extent of the Government's achievements in this area is illustrated by the fact that the cost of increasing all rates to the Commission on Social Welfare rate when it took office was £150 million.  However, following this year's increases, the cost will have been reduced to under £60 million.</P>
    <P>Bringing all rates up to the main rate means that additional resources must be allocated to those payments currently below the main rate. This is the approach I adopted this year.  Providing additional increases to payments which are already above the CSW rate would inevitably mean that those in greatest need would have to wait longer before their payment reached the rate recommended by the commission.  The flat rate increase of £3, which I have provided for this year, represents a much more balanced approach in that it provides an increase in real terms to all recipients &mdash; for example, 4.4 per cent in the case of widows and widowers on contributory pensions and 4.7 per cent in the case of non-contributory pensions &mdash; while at the same time making significant progress in achieving the objective of bringing all payments up to the Commission on Social Welfare rate.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;4.  In the case where a person who is in receipt of a Social Welfare benefit or assistance payment, and either that person or an adult dependant of that person dies, the Minister shall consider the implications of continuing the current payment in full for a period of six months during the first year of bereavement, and he shall place a report on this matter on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas within three months.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  The recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in relation to a common basic payment or minimally adequate payment shall be reviewed in the context of the projected growth in the economy, and the Minister will consider whether the payments are adequate for the needs of pensioners and he shall place a report on this matter on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas within 6 months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this matter on Second Stage.  The recommendations of the Commission on Social <Col N="1107" /> Welfare are used as a yardstick to analyse payments to social welfare recipients, but it is time to establish a new commission to review payments. Ten years have passed and the country has experienced huge economic growth; revenue is at an all time high.  If we are serious about ensuring social welfare recipients receive the payments considered necessary to survive in today's terms, it is essential to upgrade the commission's findings. They were reached against the backdrop of harsh economic times when the country was in a poor financial state due to political ineptitude.</P>
    <P>The amendment is timely because it is important to set a precedent over the next five or six years to ensure all social welfare payments are maintained at a proper level, given that the country now enjoys a buoyant economy compared to the period when the Commission on Social Welfare reached its findings, and which have not been updated since.  The Minister should consider the amendment and accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias de Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias de Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kelleher mentioned a new commission in his contribution.  The amendment does not refer to a commission but to, presumably, the 1985 Commission on Social Welfare's recommendation in relation to basic minimum payments. He went on to say that there should be a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare ranged far and wide on the question of social welfare rates. It made major recommendations; many have been implemented while others have not.  Attention has been focused on the rates.  When coming into Government in December 1994, Fine Gael, Democratic Left and Labour agreed to review the commission's recommendations.  My Department commissioned the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate payment rates and to bring a report forward on that. The report was launched last January, along with another ESRI report on poverty in the 1990s.  I strongly recommend discussion of both reports to Senators.</P>
      <P>They raise a lot of issues relating to poverty in Irish society and the question of rates.  What is an adequate income and how does one measure the rate of money a person should have?  Should it be 60 per cent, 50 per cent or 40 per cent of an average industrial wage?  It is a major document I hope to discuss with the Social Affairs Committee soon.</P>
      <P>We also have the report of the expert group on the integration of tax and social welfare.  One cannot ignore the matter of income and tax, especially the latter's impact on social welfare.  In reality, there are people who are paying tax on very low incomes; if they were on social welfare they would not be paying tax.  There appear to be anomalies here that need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> My Department also published a social insurance discussion document which is a major review of the social insurance system.  That report, the ESRI's reports on social welfare reports and poverty in Ireland in the 1990s, the report on the integration of tax and social welfare and the national antipoverty strategy being developed are all major initiatives by this Government that seek to ensure that every person in this society has an adequate income to live on.</P>
    <P>That income should not be adequate just to buy barely enough food or schoolbooks, or to barely pay the rent.  An income that will give a good quality of life should be the objective.  There may be a need for a new Commission on Social Welfare in the future, but now it would put decisions on the long finger.  We must put our national anti-poverty strategy, which is about to be agreed by Government, in place.  We also need to take on board the ESRI's recommendations on social welfare rates and the survey on poverty in Ireland.  This research must be ongoing; it should not happen every ten years.  My Department is heavily involved in seeking to ensure that that is the case.  There is no need for the amendment because what is recommended is already being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, what were the findings of the ESRI report on payments to social welfare recipients?  Are the payments enough or should there be increases to the rates struck by the Commission on Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Proinsias de Rossa Proinsias de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the cliché goes, I am glad the Senator asked that question.  The Commission on Social Welfare addressed the question of income in two ways, coming up with £50 and £60.  Many people thought they could not come to a conclusion on whether it should be £50 or £60 and felt that a figure between those two should be taken.  In fact, those recommendations derived from two different ways of measuring what the income ought to be.  The ESRI report, which is available in the Library, examined the matter of adequate income using the two measurements employed by the commission.  The ESRI brought them up to date and found the way the rates were being raised &mdash; in accordance with the consumer price index &mdash; was keeping them ahead of inflation.  However, because living standards were growing faster than the consumer price index or inflation, there was a growing gap in living standards between those on social welfare and those who were not.  It draws attention to the fact that if we want to close the gap and provide an adequate income relative to living standards, as distinct from the capacity to buy the bare necessities of life, we have to find a mechanism for raising social welfare rates in a way that links them to living standards and not inflation.  There are a range of mechanisms in the report, any one of which could be implemented by the Government. Clearly there are political choices involved that <Col N="1110" /> relate to how we want to expend our resources and I hope those decisions will derive from the debate on those reports.  I have never pretended to have all the answers or that my choice would be the correct one.  The value of the system in the Oireachtas is that there is an interaction of ideas out of which comes a clear decision.  I recommend that the Seanad examine this report and, if feasible, I would be happy to discuss it further.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;4.  The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a detailed report on the implications of the extension of the Family Income Supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at some length on family income supplement on Second Stage and I do not propose to take up much more of the House's time in connection with it.  A number of improvements to family income supplement were introduced over the past three budgets.  I already indicated that there are questions about the take-up of the supplement which must be considered. I am aware that the Revenue Commissioners give notice to everyone who receives a tax free allowance form of the availability of family income supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of converting the assessment of family income supplement from a gross basis to a net basis has already begun.  This year people's income will be assessed on the amount remaining following the deduction of PRSI and other levies. In future budgets it is hoped that we will be able to move toward a net basis for assessment, in other words, income after tax will be considered to be people's basic income.  That would mean a substantial increase in the numbers of people <Col N="1111" /> eligible to claim family income supplement.  It is estimated that those claiming the supplement would double to approximately 26,000 with that kind of change.  This would also mean a doubling of the expenditure involved.  It is a costly initiative but one to which the Government gave a commitment in Partnership 2000 and I do not see the necessity for the amendment.</P>
    <P>I must inform Senator Kelleher that the ESRI carried out research on FIS and it would be worthwhile to consider its findings.  These schemes are not perfect in any sense.  Regardless of the type of scheme put in place to assist families with children, anomalies arise at various stages.  There are American and British systems designed to deal with this problem; but we have chosen the family income supplement system, which works reasonably well, although not as well as I would like.</P>
    <P>As the leader of Democratic Left, I have reservations about how far we can go toward subsidising low pay before realising that there is a need to introduce a minimum rate of pay.  This would mean that an employer could not exploit an employee to the point where most of their income originates from family income supplement, not their work.  This matter must be addressed.  I am aware that reference to minimum wages can send some parties running for the front or back door. However, when discussing family income supplement and subsidising people in employment, we must address the question of at what point we decide to establish a basic minimum wage below which a person in employment will not be subsidised. It must also be recognised that, in addition to the State, employers have an obligation to ensure that people are paid adequate incomes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is relevant to a point I wish to make on section 8, so I will raise it at this time.  The Minister stated that over 75 per cent of people are aware of the existence of the family income supplement but only 13,000 avail of it at present.  However, as he stated on Second Stage, there are over 13,000 people employed in low income jobs who do not avail of the supplement.</P>
      <P>We are discussing ensuring that the State should not always be obliged to subsidise low paid workers or give the impression that they should remain in their present income bracket. However, female spouses are provided with the family income supplement, which they are obliged to collect at their local post office each Friday.  I made this argument on previous occasions and I will continue to do so.  How can the Department of Social Welfare or the Revenue Commissioners state that a person should pay tax and PRSI on Thursday while receiving an income supplement the next day?  I am mystified by this.  Why is the State taxing people's wages and paying supplements to their spouses?  That is an insult and it is one of the reasons only 13,000 people claim FIS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The Minister admitted that more people should claim family income supplement, but they do not want to give the impression that they are collecting social welfare benefits while in employment. It is correct that we should encourage pride in those who wish to work, but we should not give the impression that we like the way the system works.  The structure and the system can be changed and we should not be afraid to do so. The Minister amended several sections of the Bill and former Ministers, such as Deputy Woods, changed preceding legislation.  However, we should not sit back and simply state that 26,000 people may avail of family income supplement. We should not state that people should not remain on low incomes while such individuals are reluctant to apply for family income supplement. They should receive this money in their wage packets and their spouses should not be obliged to collect it at post offices.  Why should employers and employees pay PRSI and tax when this money is paid back at the end of the week?  There is no logic in that.  Will the Minister explain the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how early the Senator wishes to conclude business this evening but it would take a long time to explain this matter.  He acknowledged that I am willing to make the necessary changes.  I made the point that the system in place is not perfect and indicated the reasons that, to some extent, there is a low take-up of family income supplement.  I accept that people's pride prevents their wanting to be in receipt of a social welfare payment and they also do not want their employers to know that they are applying for such benefits.  We must take account of these issues.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Department's taking with one hand what it gives with the other, that is a feature of virtually every social welfare scheme. There are many schemes where one member of a family may be paying tax while another may be in receipt of a medical card from the health board.  Under other schemes, people may have paid tax while in employment and are now seeking a third level grant from their local authority. The theory is that the State collects taxes on the basis of people's ability to pay and reallocates some of these moneys to those who are not in a position to pay tax or whose income is below a certain level.  There are no clear cut divisions, overlaps occur and people may pay PRSI while receiving a family income supplement.  That will not be the case from this point on.</P>

Hopefully, in the near future the figure <Col N="1113" /> will also take account of net tax paid.  People will continue to pay tax but their supplement will be assessed on the net, not the gross, amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to raise this matter later but perhaps we can conclude the debate on family income supplement now.  My point relates to self-employed small farmers who are in receipt of social welfare assistance.  I raised this issue on Second Stage and I endeavoured to have last year's Social Welfare Bill amended, but I was unsuccessful.  A later amendment intended to deal with this matter will be ruled out of order as acceptance would involve the provision of additional finance.</P>
      <P>The case of self-employed small farmers has been exacerbated by the current situation obtaining in the dairy industry.  Small dairy producers are being constrained and confined by the system.  They have been in receipt of unemployment assistance and have used it well, as I indicated on Second Stage.  Self-employed farmers &mdash; not large farmers but those who qualify for unemployment assistance &mdash; constantly ask to be brought into the system and I ask the Minister to keep that in mind in any review of its operation. I agree with Senator Cregan that it is cumbersome and bureaucratic that people should pay tax while receiving an income supplement, although I appreciate it is a difficult matter to tackle.  Perhaps the Minister could take small farmer's assistance into account or at least keep the matter on the agenda.</P>

      <P>My experience of family income supplement in Cork North-Central is similar to that of other Senators from urban areas.  Families do not claim the supplement because, if the husband is working and the wife collects it, other people feel they are finding the system.  Is there any way we can get around this unwieldy structure? The vast majority of people entitled to the supplement do not claim it because of the perception which would be created; the husband is working, yet the family is drawing the dole and if someone is collecting social welfare, other people wonder why.  As Senator Cregan says every year &mdash; I hope he does not have to say it next year &mdash; it is cumbersome to take money from a person on a Thursday and ask them to collect a similar sum in the post office on a Friday.  The family income supplement has great benefits but it is awkward as it stands and we must ask why it is not claimed by the people who are entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.  The Minister shall establish a register of women working full-time in the home who wish to return to the workforce, to be known as the back to work register.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The related amendment would insert another new section:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall reserve 10 per cent. of the educational, training and other back to work options for women in the home whose names are included in the back to work register.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is a positive amendment because it legitimises a woman who currently works in the home but is interested in furthering her education and possibly finding work at a later stage.  At present, when a woman's youngest child enters second level and no longer has to be cared for full time, she finds herself completely on her own.  She may have been out of work and out of the social scene surrounding work and training programmes for many years.  If we had a register of women working full-time in the home who express a wish to further their education or return to the workplace, we could furnish them with information and channel opportunities their way, once they have time on their hands following their years of child-rearing.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 is even better.  It provides that 10 per cent of educational, training and back to work option places shall be reserved for women on the register.  It is positive discrimination which would provide many women with opportunities.  Women will have families reared at an earlier stage in their lives than used to be the case because they now have fewer children and, therefore, have many more years in which to contribute through education and work.  I ask the Minister to accept these amendments and provide a register for women so that they could be furnished with information on the various training schemes and opportunities available to them when they have time after rearing their children.</P>

      <P>It is not generally known that the most recent labour force survey found that 70 per cent of new jobs created by the Government last year were taken up by women. Most of the jobs were full time and most of the women were not on the live register and did not have a previous attachment to the labour force. That is not to say women do not have difficulties taking up paid employment.  The CE schemes require participants to be on the live register, in receipt of a lone parent's allowance or on the NRV register.  These criteria were established not by the Department of Social Welfare but by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, for the good reason that the CE scheme is intended to encourage the long term unemployed on the live register into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> I have taken a number of steps.  The spouses of the unemployed have been actively encouraged to avail of their entitlement to sign on the live register when they are unemployed.  This would also give them access to CE and other opportunities in their own right.  I have made available, to all those who wish to sign on the live register, an explanatory leaflet entitled <i>Signing on the Live Register</i> which details the various entitlements.  I have allowed for full access to the job facilitation service to all who wish to inquire about the various options available to them &mdash; that is done through the job facilitation programme run by my Department.  I promoted what is inelegantly referred to as the &ldquo;spouse swap&rdquo;, a facility under which a person with a CE entitlement can swap that place with a spouse if he or she does not have that entitlement.</P>
    <P>As part of our enhanced programme of social inclusion, the Government aims to develop a strategy which enhances equality and counters discrimination in employment and unemployment alike.  Equity in access to labour market opportunities requires that women should not be penalised when it comes to the availability of employment supports, including training.  On foot of my recommendation the Government agreed in December 1996 that the issue of women's participation in mainstream vocational education, training and employment programmes should be reviewed.  Both social partners, IBEC and ICTU, the National Women's Council and the INOU have been invited to participate in this review.  A specific commitment in this regard was included in Partnership 2000.  It should be evident, therefore, that the difficulties faced by women who wish to take up paid employment are already being tackled in a direct way and in ongoing consultation with all relevant parties.  I hope to have the review group established in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's remarks, particularly the reference to the number of women now entering the workforce.  However, these amendments are directed at women who would find it difficult to enter the workforce regardless of how many jobs are available, because they might not be knowledgeable about the training programmes and opportunities available to them.  A register of women working full-time in the home would provide a database and a means of channelling information to them about the available educational and training schemes.  They could then advance their education when they finish working full-time in the home.  The women currently taking up employment are not those at whom I aim this amendment. They are aware of training programmes, have been involved in the past, entered the workforce and found work.  If these amendments were accepted, the Minister would have a register of women who would find it difficult to gain employment <Col N="1116" /> no matter how many jobs there are.  They have been out of the workplace for a long time and they have often been in the home without any social contact or work experience.  I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 6 and we can then discuss the percentage indicated in amendment No. 7.</P>

      <P>I have put in place proposals to deal with the issues raised by the Senator.  The review group I mentioned will be in operation soon and it will involve the social partners, the INOU and the National Women's Council, all of whom have campaigned on this issue.  There are large numbers of women working in the home who do not have a right to sign on the live register and, therefore, are excluded from community employment schemes.  To accept the Senator's proposal would be to pre-empt the work the group will do.  I do not know what the group's recommendations will be but their recommendations will have the consensus of my Department, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, IBEC, INOU, ICTU and the National Women's Council.  It will be worth waiting for that group's conclusions before considering the action the Senator proposes.</P>

      <P>We must recognise the work of the person in the home.  We are taking account of those who want to go into the workplace but we must recognise the men and women who work in the home.  We should consider introducing a benefit for those who work in the home; they are the backbone of society.  It is important to society that as many people as possible work in the home.  That is not to say that women who want to work outside the home should not do so &mdash; everybody is entitled to do so if they wish. However, it is important that people work in the home if we want to ensure that we have a proper society in which our young people are looked after.  It is mostly women who work in the home and their role is very important.</P>
      <P>Any report should consider giving a financial contribution in some form to those who work in the home.  A tax credit system was considered in the past and such a system might allow those who are really looking for work to get it because, unfortunately, many women have to go out to work because of financial circumstances.  They should not have to work out of the home to have a proper standard of living.  We must recognise their importance because those who work full time in the home are vital to society and we should not undermine them.</P>

      <P>Is it still the case that young people who are in temporary employment pay contributions?  It is hard to understand why young people engaged in temporary jobs should be forced to pay PRSI and levies.  We should this to encourage young people into employment rather than penalise them.  It is more than likely that many of them will receive no benefits for their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways to encourage young people to take up available employment.  We have taken steps to make the PRSI system more flexible &mdash; the first £80 of income is no longer liable to PRSI, we have reduced the employee's contribution from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, we have reduced the employer's contribution from 12.2 per cent to 12 per cent and there is a new rate of 8.5 per cent for low income employments.  We have also provided a two year exemption from PRSI for employers to encourage job creation.  We are providing for an exemption for seafarers to encourage the development of an Irish shipping fleet and the employment of Irish seafarers on ships plying routes in Irish waters and using Irish ports. We have taken a range of measures related to PRSI which have improved flexibility.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that we must retain the integrity of the social insurance system.  We must balance whatever flexibility is introduced with a commitment to the underlying need to have a system based on an employer's contribution, an employee's contribution and a contribution from the taxpayer to top up what is required to pay pensions and other payments.  It is simplistic to identify PRSI as a source of funds we can do away with to provide an incentive to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the incentives we have introduced through PRSI, the take up for PRSI exemption for employers is pitiful &mdash; they are simply not interested in it.  One would imagine that a two year exemption from PRSI would have them queueing up in their thousands to avail of it yet <Col N="1118" /> there has been virtually no interest in it.  I have attended a number of EU Social Affairs Council meetings at which the contribution social insurance contributions can make to the maintenance and creation of jobs was raised.  There is no research or evidence from EU states which supports the thesis that cutting back significantly on PRSI assists job creation or maintenance.  One must look at other incentives.</P>
    <P>The most important incentive for young people starting work is to be offered a good job and a good income with training and prospects of advancement.  We must try to reach a point where such jobs are on offer to them.  Many young people will not take jobs serving hamburgers; there is no future in it so why should they do it? Will they be able to rear a family on the income they will get from frying hamburgers?  I am not suggesting that nobody should take up such jobs, but if we really want to provide an incentive for young people we must ensure they stay in school as long as is possible.  We must also ensure the provision of decent jobs with good wages and prospects and a tax system which does not penalise them to the extent that it is not worth their while working.  This is what the Government is doing.  Fiddling around with a few pence here or a few pence there or with PRSI is not going to solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have misunderstood the purpose of the amendment.  He is aware that the most difficult time for young people is the initial period of transition from school to work.  There should be a relaxation of the system for those taking up temporary employment to supplement the funding of their education.  This is particularly aimed at young people who would come within the definition of the young persons' employment legislation and who may be in low paid, temporary jobs endeavouring to put a few pounds together to finish their education in order to qualify for meaningful employment.  We should provide an incentive for those young people.  Can the Minister give an indication of the amount of revenue deducted from the salaries of these people?</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the reduction in PRSI in the hope of creating employment did not have the desired result.  However, we are talking here about young people who take up temporary or summer jobs to supplement their incomes and enable them to continue their education.  Can special provision be made for them until such time as they cease to come under the young persons' employment legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 provides for a general reduction of 1 per cent from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent in employees PRSI contribution. This is a significant decrease.  The first £80 of everybody's income is already exempt from PRSI and the employer will have to pay only 8.5 per cent PRSI in the case of those earning less that £260 per week compared to 12 per cent for those <Col N="1119" /> earning over that.  It is likely that summer work will be remunerated at a level where the lower rate applies.  In addition, those earning less than £197 per week will be exempt from health contributions and the employment levy.  Therefore, there are a range of incentives for low paid employment.</P>
      <P>We have to balance these incentives with the need to generate support for the concept of social insurance and solidarity between the employer, employee and the State, which that system depends upon.  Rather than arguing that social insurance is a tax, we should be pointing out that it is insurance.  By building up contributions, even if it is only 100, young people will benefit in later years if they seek sick benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity benefit or old age pension. There are many people who are just outside the contribution criteria for an old age contributory pension who would be delighted if they could have earned 100 contributions in the summer of 1961 or 1962.</P>
      <P>We must balance incentives with maintaining the very good system of social insurance which we have and continue to guarantee that that system ensures nobody is without sick benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity benefit, widows pension, etc.  These are critical services which are only appreciated when people get older.  I do not expect an 18 or 19 year old to appreciate the value of social insurance, but we should maintain the line in terms of the value of social insurance contributions.  We should cultivate the view among young people that this system is important rather than saying it is a burden which should be abolished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two queries on section 12. What happens to the contributions of persons who were employed and paid contributions for eight or nine years and subsequently established their own business, which did not provide enough for their personal pension?  Do they qualify for a reduced pension and, if not, what would they have to do to ensure qualification?</P>
      <P>It is unfair, if both spouses qualify for a non-contributory pension and one dies, that the other is not entitled to the six weeks pension.  The Minister should introduce legislation to change this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine the six weeks pension.  I will not address the matter in this Bill but we will do whatever is possible to modify the present situation.  I have no idea of the cost of such modification.  I will return to the <Col N="1120" /> House following my investigations into the matter.</P>
      <P>The Senator raised the issue of an employee who makes contributions for eight or nine years and then becomes self-employed.  Much depends on the length of time on which those eight or nine years are averaged out.  For example, eight years would mean 416 contributions and would therefore meet the criteria of a minimum of 260 contributions. To qualify for a pension there would have to be a minimum of ten years contributions, so two years contributions would have to be added to the original eight years.  If the person had eight years contributions as an employee and two years as a self-employed contributor they would qualify for the minimum 50 per cent pension.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 13, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.  The Minister shall make every possible effort and take all steps open to him to ensure that the EU subsidised butter scheme is restored to its pre-December, 1996 level.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled this amendment was to bring to the attention of the House the fact that the scheme has effectively been halved since December 1996.  I am at a loss to see how the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry could have agreed to the halving of the subsidised butter scheme.  The scheme was a very successful one, in spite of the talk about the levels of consumption of butter.  Many people are now worse off, regardless of the social welfare increases implemented by the Minister, because of the halving of this scheme.  We are talking about a 52p loss per month per person in some cases. That is a substantial amount of money to people who are already living in difficult circumstances. As far as I am aware, there was no cost on the Exchequer for the scheme as the cost was borne by the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme was administered by the Department of Social Welfare even thought it was the Council of Agriculture Ministers who introduced the scheme.  The halving of the scheme was a deplorable act for which there was no necessity. The scheme had been complimented and praised as a great method of keeping butter consumption at a reasonable level and encouraging people to <Col N="1121" /> eat a natural food product.  Health experts are now advertising the fact that butter is good for a person's health.  Yet, here we have a Government Minister allowing a decision to be taken which reduces the level of butter vouchers by one half &mdash; 52p per person per month is being lost.  That is an unacceptable situation.  I know this is not exactly in the Minister for Social Welfare's remit but the amendment is intended to draw attention to the issue.  Perhaps the Minister will talk to his colleague and seek to ensure that the Council of Ministers reverse this appalling decision.  While 52 p per month might sound paltry, it may be a severe financial setback to a person who is already on a meagre income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The butter voucher scheme is administered on behalf of the EU by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. The Department of Social Welfare acts as an agent for that Department in distributing the vouchers to social welfare recipients.  The scheme is provided for in regulations of the European Union which provide for the sale of butter at a subsidised rate to social assistance beneficiaries. Therefore, it operates as a market intervention mechanism under the Common Agricultural Policy. The scheme benefits 450,000 social assistance beneficiaries and their 405,000 dependants. Ireland is the only member state still operating the scheme, which was due to expire in December of 1996.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelleher should consult with his senior party colleagues to find out why Minister Joe Walsh agreed some years ago that the scheme would be abolished in December 1996.  Minister Yates successfully negotiated the retention of the scheme, albeit at half the rate.  Given that the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture agreed to the abolition of the scheme, it seems to me ironic for any Fianna Fáil Member of the Oireachtas to criticise me or Minister Yates for saving the scheme and ensuring that the EU continues to provide butter vouchers for people in receipt of social assistance in Ireland.  It takes a hard neck to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>It might take a hard neck to raise this issue but it would take a lot of hard neck to ensure that the scheme would be restored to its former level.  It is a little disingenuous for the Minister to suggest that a Fianna Fáil Minister decided &mdash; given that we have been in opposition for the past two and a half years &mdash; that the scheme should be scrapped.  The Council of Ministers negotiate on a yearly basis, we are all aware of that.  The reality is that the scheme has been halved at a time when people were taking it up in great numbers.  The Minister's Department was praised by EU officials for the manner in which it handled the application of the butter voucher scheme.  The scheme is a tragic loss to the people, who were availing of it in large numbers.  The <Col N="1122" /> scheme costs the EU only £6 or £7 million.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture would have been able to reverse the decision.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Senator's confidence in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The Senator clearly does not have the same level of confidence in the former Fianna Fáil Minister who agreed to the abolition of the scheme shortly before this Government came into office.  The scheme was due to cease in December 1996, but Minister Yates negotiated with the EU Council of Ministers and the Commission and managed to ensure its continuance for a further two years.  That is a success, not a failure.</P>
      <P>We have to face reality.  No matter how tough a negotiator one is, the fact is that the level of butter consumption in Ireland over the past 15 years has collapsed.  People no longer eat butter to the same extent they used to in the past.  I myself use spreads.  The scheme was introduced in the first place to shift the butter mountain.  The EU were not particularly bothered about whether people needed butter or not, or whether butter was good or bad for one's health.  The simple fact was the EU wanted to get rid of the butter mountain, which was costing thousands of millions of pounds to store.  It was better to give it away free to European member states.  Ireland is the only member state which still has the scheme; it has been abolished everywhere else.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;25.

      <P>I have tabled another amendment along similar lines to this one.  One of the major problems with people who require medical attention &mdash; this was pointed out on Second Stage &mdash; is that they are obliged to avail of private transport or make alternative arrangements to travel to hospitals, physiotherapists, chiropodists and so on.  Unfortunately, many of these people are incurring the cost.  For that reason, this is a timely amendment. This is a big problem.  I have come across several cases &mdash; and I am sure many Senators have also &mdash; where people must travel to a hospital but since no bus route passes their house, they are unable to travel by public transport.  That is placing a huge financial burden on many individuals.</P>

      <P>As the Senator will know, the free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as to incapacitated people under that age who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.  The purpose of the scheme is to encourage such people to remain active in the community by providing them with access to spare capacity on a range to services provided by the CIÉ group of companies as well as by 56 private transport operators who also participate in the scheme.  My Department is willing to consider further applications from licensed private operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme and, indeed, the number of new private transport operators participating in the scheme has grown significantly in recent years, but I have no plans <Col N="1124" /> to widen the scheme along the lines suggested by the Senator.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 40, to delete lines 35 to 43.</P>
      <P>Section 30 states:</P>
      <P>... the Minister shall make regulations specifying the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as being available for or genuinely seeking employment and these circumstances may vary in relation to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the person's previous work experience,</P>
      <P>(b) the period for which he has been unemployed, and</P>
      <P>(c) the prevailing employment conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister went to great lengths to develop that in his speech on Second Stage and he voiced the INOU's concern that if we did not have such a caring, considerate, decent Minister for Social Welfare and somebody else was making the regulations, there could be problems because they could be interpreted in a different manner.  That is the concern of the INOU and I am of that opinion also.</P>
      <P>We may not always have caring people in the Department of Social Welfare and they may make a regulation which could have a drastic effect on what would deem a person to be available for work.  While 90 per cent of the people might fall into that category and it would not create a problem, a small percentage of people could be in breach of the regulations and that could have disastrous consequences for them. The words to be deleted could be included elsewhere after a little more thought.  The Minister should be obliged to discuss and negotiate the matter with the social partners, who are tied into Programme 2000, for example.  This matter concerns the INOU and ordinary people, who are on the live register at present and actively seeking work and who are afraid that the regulations could jeopardise their position with regard to social assistance.</P>

      <P>The Senator made the point that I have dealt with this issue to some extent in my Second Stage reply.  The criteria applied to being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work are not covered by regulation <Col N="1125" /> at present.  They are fairly vague and they are governed by guidelines which have been developed by the Department over the years taking account of prevailing economic and social conditions and a range of other factors.  It is felt that clear, up front regulations are needed which will make the law clear to everybody concerned, that is, the deciding officer who must make a decision and the claimant who will be governed by that decision.  We are seeking to clarify a person's situation and it has always been the case in law that it is for the claimant to prove that he or she is capable of, available for and actively seeking work.  The proposal to bring forward regulations is to clarify that and not to make it more draconian.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that a different Minister might take a different approach.  All he would have to do is write a letter changing the guidelines and nobody need be any the wiser.  When there are regulations in place, the Minister, the deciding officer and the claimant are bound by them.  I have already given an undertaking to arrange for my officials to sit down and talk with the INOU to make sure its fears and concerns are taken into account.  This is not an attempt to apply draconian tests to people who are genuinely unemployed. It is simply to provide for clarity in how these conditions are applied to people who are unemployed.</P>
      <P>We must also take into account the fact that this is not the 1980s; this is the 1990s.  In the three years this Government will have been in office, we will have created 150,000 new jobs, there will be more people at work here than ever and we will have ended emigration.  I can go through the whole shebang for the Senator but the fact is that it is not the 1980s when jobs were being lost faster than they could be created.  We now have employers crying out that they cannot get enough workers to fill vacancies.  There are many reasons for that, questions of skills, wages, distance and travel, but conditions are not the same as in the 1980s.  People are not being denied unemployment assistance when there are no jobs available. That is the reality.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister that he is in Government with the two parties which were in power during the 1980s so I am delighted he is taking all the credit for all the good work of the 1990s without giving credit to Fine Gael or the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>There were only three applicants for jobs advertised in a boutique window in the middle of Patrick's Street in Cork before Christmas and there are more than 10,000 unemployed in Cork.

      <P>What the Senator is seeking, as I understand it, is an instalment procedure. I might draw the Senator's attention to the code of practice on the recovery of overpayments &mdash; which is available to Senators from the Department if they wish to get copies &mdash; and also a leaflet which provides information on recovery of social welfare payments.  An instalment arrangement is almost always available and no one will be obliged to pay an instalment which brings them below the supplementary welfare rate of payment; we are obliged by law not to bring them below the supplementary welfare allowance rate. If someone wants to pay more than that, if they have more income, that is fine.  However, there is already an arrangement whereby instalments can be deducted and it seems a fair system.  I have been criticised by members of the Senator's party for being too lenient on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons I tabled this amendment concerns equality payments.  Several hundred thousand pounds were overpaid and letters demanding immediate repayment were sent out by the Department of Social Welfare, which <Col N="1127" /> put the fear of God into some women who received the payments.  I brought one case in particular to the attention of the Minister who responded.  It concerned a demand for immediate payment of over £3,000.  Where would someone on an old age contributory pension get £3,000? After receiving the payments a long time ago they invested the money in their house.  That is why I wanted to clarify the point.</P>
      <P>There are circumstances where the Department sends out threatening letters.  I understand that we cannot be throwing out money willy nilly and I would not suggest that someone who has been overpaid should not repay the money. However, intimidating letters have been sent out by the Department, particularly to women whose equality arrears were overpaid.  That should have been acknowledged.  I brought the matter to the Minister's attention and it was aired publicly at the time.  I am glad to say it has been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly dispute that the Department of Social Welfare ever sends intimidating letters to anybody.  It does not.  A person who is not used to receiving a claim for an overpayment may be frightened by it, but that does not mean my Department is attempting to intimidate anybody.</P>
      <P>The Senator said equality payments were the basis of the issue he has raised.  This Government, and my Department, undertook to pay out close to £300 million to 70,000 married women who had been denied equal treatment under the social welfare code by successive Administrations going back to 1983.  We undertook to do it within a matter of 18 months.  It was inevitable that some errors would occur as a result of trying to process that number of applications, bearing in mind that the vast majority of those claims had to be traced back to the 1984-86 period.  The conditions of receipt of payments of the time had to be applied and they are not the same conditions that apply now.  Therefore, people had to be trained and close to 300 staff had to be brought in to process the claims.  Errors were inevitable but I am happy to say that, as far as I know, there are no unhappy social welfare customers out there at this point. All the women who were entitled to payments have now received them.  In many cases they have received substantial amounts of money.  I am happy to have been part of a Government that was willing to face up to its responsibilities in dealing with these payments.</P>
      <P>I regret any discomfort that may have been caused to any women who may have received a request to refund overpayments, but all those matters were dealt with in a humane and fair way. The criteria we have in relation to overpayment recovery applies in all cases.  Anybody who reads it will see that it is a fair and humane approach to a situation which we recognise in the vast majority of cases can be due to human error, sometimes on the part of the Department and more often on the part of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> Unfortunately, we have to deal with serious cases of fraud as well, which in some cases have to be brought to court.  However, for the vast majority of people we apply the code of practice which is published and available to whoever wants to look at it.  It is part of the openness, transparency and accountability for which this Government is proud to be responsible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 44, line 27, to delete &ldquo;Circuit&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;District&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  If a person is to appeal a decision they must go to the Circuit Court which involves much expense.  That provision should be examined.  I wonder how a person who is appealing a decision can afford to take that particular measure on board.  If it was in the District Court it would not cost as much and one would not require as much legal representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General looked closely at this proposal and is of the opinion that the Circuit Court is a better option than the District Court for a number of reasons. First, the Circuit Court is a court of record while a District Court is not.  In other words, all decisions made in the Circuit Court are recorded whereas they are not necessarily recorded in the District Court.  In addition, the proof required for or against is not as stringent as in the Circuit Court. It may well be in the interests of the person who is appealing to have a Circuit Court hearing rather than a District Court one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, there is no reason it should be any more costly than going to the appeals office itself. Currently, a person may employ a solicitor or a representative of some kind in an appeal to the appeals office if they wish.  There is no reason for them to do so if they do not want to and there will be no reason for them to do so in the Circuit Court situation either if they do not want to.  The <Col N="1129" /> nature of the decisions and the evidence presented on either side will be exactly the same as if it was before an appeals officer.  In any event, only in exceptional circumstances will the chief appeals officer refer cases to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>For those reasons it is better to leave the proposal in the Bill as it stands.  If we find the matter is not working as well as it ought, we will come back to it.  However, at this point it seems that, having looked at all the options, this is the one which best serves the interests both of the person who seeks to make an appeal and of the Department who will seek to present their side of the case as well.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to bring the National Social Services Board into contact with those who work in community and social services.  It should consult with those at the coalface about social welfare issues so that everyone has an input.  This means the Minister would have the best possible advice.  It would give statutory recognition to social services and voluntary groups which make great efforts on behalf of the State to ensure that people know their rights and are receiving proper education through training programmes, etc.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I will not accept the amendment because it is gilding the lily.  The National Social Services Board is now under the aegis of my Department following negotiations with the Department of Health.  It was more appropriate to transfer it to my Department because of the services it provides.

The board will be committed to co-operating and working with the voluntary sector and providing information.</P>

    <P>Although the Senator's proposal is well meant, it is superfluous in the context of the functions I <Col N="1130" /> am confirming and the new functions I am providing for the NSSB, which have been developed in consultation with it.  Its existence and operation depend on a close relationship with the voluntary sector.  The community information centres could not exist without the voluntary organisers who do the work.  They will inevitably provide a feedback for the NSSB in terms of any advice they might give me as a Minister.  This is provided for in the functions.  The amendment is well meant but it is superfluous in view of what I am already proposing to do in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  Last week we debated the Universities Bill during which I devoted a considerable length of time to the problems being experienced due to a lack of funds for research in universities.  I thought the Department was going to solve this situation.  I barely got back to my office when I received fresh representations regarding the proposed cuts in capital equipment grants to universities.  This is an appalling attack on the capability of these colleges to produce world class graduates.  The two pronged proposal to cut the allocation for continuing capital costs by 50 per cent and to eliminate the large capital item programme will mean a cut of 60 per cent in the total allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995 the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council report and the Higher Education Authority's CIRCA report were adamant on the need to provide adequate resources to equip colleges to a level approaching that of most modern States.  SITAC recommended an emergency re-equipment programme of £5 million per annum for five years.  The recent White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation, though disgracefully <Col N="1132" /> thin on capital equipment, acknowledged that it needed to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In light of this, it is astounding that the Higher Education Authority could be so far out of touch with reality that it could justify such a proposal. Irish researchers are rightly outraged at what can only be described as a cavalier disregard for the future of research.  Once again the Department of Education, through the HEA, has underlined its complete lack of understanding of research and what constitutes advanced technological education. We have heard much over the past few years about shortages of technically skilled graduates for industry.  Software, electronics, computer and pharmaceutical industries among others are crying out for skilled people.  The shortages in some areas are so bad that it is beginning to compromise our ability to establish these types of companies here.</P>
    <P>To produce a technically skilled graduate, one needs to be able to educate students to provide understanding and to train them in the most modern techniques.  Educating and training require as an essential, access to modern research facilities. It must be part of the contract between the Government and the universities to make every effort to ensure this type of equipment is available. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council reported that the quality of Irish university research is rising more rapidly than in any other country despite the paltry amounts of public money available to support it. However, over the last few years research is becoming more and more equipment or technique driven.  This means availability of equipment is a determining factor in whether a particular piece of work can be done.  In the continuing absence of a realistic provision for capital equipment, the decision to further reduce the allowance makes no sense.</P>
    <P>The hard work done by Irish researchers to be among the best in the world will be entirely negated unless the proposed equipment cut is reversed and dealt with in an intelligent and comprehensive manner, once and for all.  The first step must be to move responsibility for the large capital item programme to the National Research Support Fund Board.  One might ask whether the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Education communicate with each other, or whether the Department of Enterprise and Employment's need to make science and technology a central plank in economic growth and jobs is simply ignored by the Department of Education, which is supposed to be responsible for producing the staff to fill these jobs.</P>
    <P>Apart from compromising Ireland's ability to undertake major research programmes, its ability to train and educate technically competent people, the role of the universities in the innovation process and Ireland's expertise pools, the lack of adequate support for capital equipment, even prior to the proposed cuts, has several serious consequences.  These include increased <Col N="1133" /> concerns for the health and safety of our young research postgraduates; increased costs of maintenance of old or antiquated equipment; degenerating innovation links between industry, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, and the colleges; degenerating access to international research networks and degenerating access to the global knowledge base, both as producers and consumers.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I look at health and safety very carefully. Concern has already been expressed by Irish researchers, through the Irish Research Scientists' Association, about the threat to the health and safety of researchers, particularly postgraduates, who carry on more than 60 per cent of the research done in the State.  Antiquated equipment was not designed to meet modern health and safety standards.  Coupled with that, as the piece of machinery gets older it starts to fail even the health and safety standards it originally met. However, Irish universities are forced to keep antiquated equipment in place until the last possible moment.</P>
    <P>Industry sources have said equipment in Irish academic laboratories is expected to perform more intensely and for much longer than equivalent equipment in most other countries.  A recent study in one of the universities concluded that two thirds of the research equipment in the college was more than 15 years old, as opposed to an industrial average of five years.  It is only a matter of time before a catastrophic equipment failure causes injury or death to a researcher.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense to run equipment into the ground.  Industry will write down equipment after five years for several reasons, chief among which is the escalating cost of maintaining the equipment at peak performance levels.  Once the point is passed where it costs more to maintain than the value of the results obtained, equipment will be replaced.</P>
    <P>However, the same does not hold in academic laboratories.  In our universities equipment will be maintained, almost regardless of cost, until it cannot be insured, the supplier has gone out of business, there are no more parts available &mdash; even from cannibalised machines &mdash; or some combination of the three.  There is an example in this city of an item of equipment that is 34 years old. The supplier has been swallowed up not once but twice, the machine and its parts are no longer made and only the inventiveness of the staff keeps the machine going.  The insurance company has baulked at covering it, but without it or a replacement all research in that department would cease.  This is not the worst story.</P>
    <P>While one has to admire the tenacity of the researchers involved, this sort of activity diverts staff from their more productive duties, slows down research while the latest problem gets sorted out and, most damning of all, diverts money that could more profitably be used in other areas to keeping antiquated, dangerous, less flexible, essential equipment on the road. <Col N="1134" /> This is a flagrant waste of taxpayers money; it is a false economy to restrict access to proper equipment.</P>
    <P>The recent White Paper on Science, Technology and Innovation although, as I have said, unacceptably thin on the matter of capital equipment, does underline the essential need for industry to be more involved in research and development. It particularly draws attention to the small and medium enterprises sector.  We have a problem here because two thirds of industrial research and development expenditure in Ireland is spent by one quarter of the foreign companies based here.  In short, with a few notable exceptions, Irish industry spends very little on research.</P>
    <P>While large corporations may be able to absorb the cost of research, it is very difficult to justify the cost of research in a small company where this cost is not immediately and directly productive. Small companies cannot support a research infrastructure, but they are the ones that most need to be innovative and to develop new products to secure their futures.  The solution is obvious.  Some 80 per cent of research activity in the State is done in the third level.  That represents a huge resource waiting to be tapped.  To make use of this resource it is essential that the small company can have confidence in the colleges, that the techniques, equipment and staff are up to the job and can carry out the research efficiently and in a cost effective manner.  It is difficult to imagine a less inspiring prospect than commissioning research in a place where the most essential piece of equipment is nearly 30 years old.  Last year I spoke very strongly about how important our small, vital firms are to industry.</P>
    <P>If the colleges are to continue to play their role in the innovation process they must be supported in that regard.  Access to the required equipment and facilities must be ensured.  Irish knowledge based industry providing Irish jobs for Irish technical graduates, in conjunction with Irish colleges which can hold their place with the best in the world, is the key to continued economic growth and a society that provides for all.  Do we want to remain a technological backwater, or do we want to invest in a brighter future?  We must make that decision now.</P>
    <P>Research networks are also of importance. While I recognise they are not available to everyone, they are such an important facet of research that they must not be overlooked.  Research, particularly academic research, depends on the free exchange of information between researchers.  While much of this exchange goes on through the research journals &mdash; which the Government also penally taxes &mdash; personal contact is almost as important.</P>
    <P>The risk comes from the fact that as the technological capability of researchers in other countries gets further ahead of Irish groups, there is less incentive for foreign groups to interact with their Irish colleagues.  At the moment we are <Col N="1135" /> compensating for this by forcing our postgraduates to emigrate and make contacts abroad, but as the demand for graduates increases here this conduit of knowledge will be restricted.  The personal networking of researchers is vital for the exchange of ideas, techniques and the little bits knowledge that can make the difference between success or failure.</P>
    <P>The rationable behind these cuts is very strange. The Higher Education Authority has completely ignored the advice given to it by its own CIRCA report.  While individual members of the authority, including John Hayden, who is the secretary and chief executive, have been trying to raise the issue of capital equipment, the Higher Education Authority as a whole must be decried for this incomprehensible proposal.  It makes no sense to the colleges, the researchers, most Senators and Deputies or the Irish Research Scientists' Association.  The IRSA was told by the Higher Education Authority that this was part of a three year plan &mdash; a sort of &ldquo;no bread this year but bread and jam next year&rdquo; strategy.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has budgeted £6 million for capital equipment over the next three years, which is a derisory amount by any standards.  It now proposes to spend nothing this year so that it can spend more next year.  Of course, it might be marginally less offensive if the money for these three years was in the bank already, but it is not.  This proposal to cut the capital expenditure is predicated on the Department of Education and, ultimately, the Department of Finance being prepared to hand over the cash next year and in subsequent years.  I find it never works like that &mdash; what has gone tends to remain gone.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Education, the Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, Science and Technology and the Minister for Finance to immediately reinstate the capital equipment fund at its former level, to examine ways it can be boosted to adequately reflect our national needs in this regard and, more importantly, to address the existing structures to determine whether the Higher Education Authority is the correct body to be administering a research budget.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senator Henry for raising this matter and I am glad of the opportunity to advise the House on the matter.  I must declare my interest in this, as I spent many happy, fruitful, productive years in the research laboratories of a university.  I have a special interest in, and knowledge of, this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99, an amount of £10 million is being provided for the replacement and enhancement of research and teaching equipment in the universities.  This provision is part of an overall £120 million capital <Col N="1136" /> investment programme designed primarily for the purpose of supporting the third level sector, especially in areas of research and teaching related to economic growth and job creation.  Of this amount, £46.5 million has been set aside for capital projects in the Higher Education Authority sector.</P>
    <P>The dedicated provision of £10 million within the European Regional Development Fund programme for equipment has already been complemented by a further £2 million of Exchequer funds, bringing at this stage the total provision for equipment for the Higher Education Authority sector to £12 million over the period of the plan. In addition, the £46.5 million programme includes elements of funding for new equipment.  A further £60 million capital investment programme, comprising £30 million from the private sector with matching funds from the Exchequer, was approved by the Minister for the Education in 1995.  This programme provides for the construction and equipping of new facilities.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise that there is no question of a reduction in the allocation for capital equipment under these programmes.  Of the £12 million for replacement capital, £6 million has already been allocated to the universities through the funding provided to the Higher Education Authority in the three years 1994, 1995 and 1996.  There is a commitment to providing the balance of £6 million over the period of the plan.  While the average annual amount to be allocated is £2 million, the actual amount in any one year varies depending on building expenditure commitments in that year.  For example, the original allocation for capital equipment in 1995 was £2 million, which was subsequently increased to £4 million when the position regarding building commitments became clearer.  On the other hand, all available capital was devoted to building works in 1996.</P>
    <P>For 1997, £1 million was targeted for replacement equipment in the £15.25 million capital allocation made to the HEA.  In the normal way this figure will be kept under review during the year, and in the light of building commitments and depending on progress, it may be increased as appropriate within the framework of the overall capital allocation of £76.5 million for the European Regional Development Fund and additional numbers programmes.  Let me stress again, however, that there is an absolute commitment to allocating sufficient funds to the Higher Education Authority over the period of the national plan to enable the balance of £6 million for replacement equipment to be paid to the universities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education is at present considering introducing a number of further initiatives that contribute to the funding of new equipment for the university sector to ensure its effectiveness both in terms of meeting the recommendations <Col N="1137" /> of the Science Technology and Innovation Advisory Council and the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>

      <P>Scoil Mhuire is Íde serves Newcastlewest and surrounding district for an approximate seven mile radius.  At present in excess of 700 students, boys and girls, attend the school, but there is no remedial teacher.  The principal is concerned that, because of this, at least ten students who are studying for the leaving certificate examinations are underachieving.  He cited to me an example of one student, not yet studying for these examinations, who has difficulties counting his money and an inability with figures, although he is good at English and languages.</P>
      <P>The school and school management is trying to overcome this problem by asking one of the part-time teachers to take some of the students for extra time during the day and at the close of school business.  However, although doing her best, she is not a properly qualified remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>Another vocational school in the town provides the services of a remedial teacher.  Children from primary schools in the catchment area who realise they have learning difficulties are almost forced to go to the vocational school, thus limiting their choices.  Furthermore, there is no remedial teacher to service the primary schools within the catchment area of Scoil Mhuire is Íde.  This means that some pupils fail to avail of a remedial service not only at primary level but also at secondary level.</P>
      <P>An assumption is made that students requiring the services of remedial teachers are underachievers or are not as well gifted academically as others.  However, I know of one student who obtained remedial attention when he was young and subsequently obtained a very good leaving certificate.  He is now aiming for a silver medal in his university studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be said, therefore, that those requiring remedial help are less likely to achieve academically and it is erroneous to suggest that children <Col N="1138" /> would not benefit from the services of a remedial teacher in a school such as Scoil Mhuire is Íde, which has a more academic kind of teaching. I ask the Minister of State to allow the school appoint a remedial teacher in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The education of pupils with difficulties in literacy or who are underachieving is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  Each teacher would be expected to adapt his or her teaching approach and the material which he or she presents to pupils to cater for the needs, abilities and aptitudes of the pupils.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would therefore be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in schools.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated in this area in recent years.  In 1994 an additional 25 ex-quota remedial posts were allocated to second level schools.  A further 73 posts were allocated in 1995, bringing the total number of ex-quota posts at second level to 350.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need and having regard to existing provision. Regard was also had to the recommendations of my Department's psychological service.  Given the limited number of posts available, the Minister for Education was not in a position to allocate a post to Scoil Mhuire is Íde.</P>
      <P>In addition to the provision which has been made in the remedial area, additional resource posts have been allocated to cater for the needs of special needs pupils attending second level schools.  In 1995, 55 resource posts were allocated to second level schools.  Schools were invited to apply for the posts.  A specially designed application form was used for this purpose.  The posts were allocated on the basis of the information contained in those forms and more than 130 such posts have been allocated to second level schools in the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the allocation of remedial posts to schools, steps have been taken since 1994 to increase significantly the number of teachers being trained as remedial teachers.  In the 1997-98 school year training in remedial education will be provided in the following six centres: Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines; Department of Education, University College, Cork; Department of Education, University College, Galway; Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick; St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra and St. Angela's College of Education, Sligo.  All these courses are funded by the Department of Education with support from the European Social Fund.  The appropriate circular announcing the programme of training for 1997-8 was issued to all schools recently.  The content of the courses will include theoretical and <Col N="1139" /> practical inputs on all aspects of provision for remedial education.</P>
    <P>A range of new programmes has been introduced at second level in the past number of years to cater for the needs of pupils with varying interests, abilities and aptitudes.  These include the junior certificate elementary programme, the transition year programme, the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.  Additional resources have been provided to schools in respect of these programmes.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Minister for Education is fully committed to improving the provision <Col N="1140" /> in the education area and, in particular, for children with special needs.  Unfortunately, the resources available to the Minister are not unlimited and priorities must be established.  The Minister is not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial posts to second level schools. However, the position of Scoil Mhuire agus Íde, Newcastlewest, will receive every consideration when the Minister is in a position to further extend the remedial service.</P>
