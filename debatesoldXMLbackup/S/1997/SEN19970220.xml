      <P>I have notice from Senator Maloney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for a new fire station in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make an early decision against locating a dump in the Coolbeg/Ballynagran area of County Wicklow in view of the local opposition to its location.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to Ballingarry boys' national school, County Limerick, is completed in 1997.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Maloney's and Senator Ross's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  The other Senator may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be taken until 1 p.m., there will be a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and item 2 will be taken from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m..  I suggest 15 minutes per speaker on item 1 and 20 minutes per speaker on item 2.  I confirm to the House that the debate on sports policy will take place on Wednesday, 5 March.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  I welcome the proposed debate on the <Col N="258" /> sports document.  That document has not been circulated to Members; it would be nice if we could have it as soon as possible.  I thank the Leader for the updated list of forthcoming legislation. It is very helpful and useful and gives us a chance to plan ahead.</P>
      <P>We have had very inclement, stormy weather over the past few days which brings to mind an issue very close to my heart &mdash; safety at sea.  A document was published on this about six months ago which needs to be discussed.  The need for safety must be emphasised to fishermen because, as Senator Magner knows, we are our own worst enemies at times.  Fishermen must take due care and ensure their boats are seaworthy.  I do not want to treat this as an urgent matter but I would be grateful if we could discuss the document on safety at sea as soon as possible.  It is a good document.</P>

      <P>Last week we raised the question of the Buckley report on salaries and allowances for public representatives and others in the public sector.  That report has been widely debated in the media but we still have not seen it, which is an absolute disgrace.  I have been involved in industrial relations and negotiations for 25 years and this is the first occasion in that time that a report following the outcome of negotiations was made available to only one side.</P>
      <P>That is bad in terms of open government and delivering better government.  It goes against everything I understand about industrial relations.  It is grossly unfair to the Members of these Houses, which is the only group which has been asked to defend itself publicly.  Members are attempting to do that without having access to the facts.  It is unfair and the Leader should raise it. We will endure all the hassle again next week when the report is finally made available.  It will be headline news again, as if we were to get another 30 per cent on top of last week's 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Leader indicated that a debate on the sports report would take place on 5 March.  I understand that Committee Stage of the Employment Equality Bill is scheduled for that date.  Are both items to be taken on the same day?</P>
      <P>We discussed the possibility of providing additional debating time to cover a number of outstanding issues.  Has the Leader made any progress with this?  It is important that Members receive adequate notice of any developments.</P>
      <P>I raised previously the importance of mandatory reporting.  Since we last discussed this issue the Government has published a report on the mandatory reporting of disclosures or allegations of child sexual abuse or child abuse.  It is important that we have another balanced debate because many Senators had much to contribute on the last occasion.  There is too much polarisation on this issue among members of the public. The report will allow them to reach a consensus. Members of the Oireachtas need to be well informed on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory that on many occasions we must ask for reports to be circulated. Reports produced by Departments should be circulated to Members of the Seanad as a matter of routine.  I may be wrong in suggesting that the sports report has not been circulated, but I have not seen it.  There was one occasion when we debated an issue while relying on photocopies. Will the Leader look into this with a view to ensuring that we get reports?</P>
      <P>There is a need for statements on agriculture, especially in view of the latest development in the BSE crisis where the European Parliament has indicated lack of confidence in the way the EU Commission has dealt with the matter.  It is listed as item 14 on the Order Paper.  Will the Leader ensure that when there is such a debate Members who have already spoken will be able to do so again?</P>
      <P>The same procedure should apply to statements on economic and monetary union, which is item 16 on the Order Paper.  I referred yesterday to exchange rate policy and its impact on farming and business.  The ESRI has issued a report on the impact of economic and monetary union and whether or not we should participate if Britain decides to stay out.  There are now suggestions that if there is a Labour Government in Britain, it will not join the first group participating in economic and monetary union.  At a conference before Christmas in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, the Taoiseach said that the debate on economic and monetary union is over.  We have not even had a debate.  It is necessary to hold one which concentrates on the implications for Ireland if Britain decides to stay out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Fitzgerald for a debate on the safety at sea document, especially before the start of the season for amateur boatmen, who are usually the cause of problems as opposed to the professional fishermen.</P>
      <P>Last week, &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, referring to the day's proceedings in the Dáil and the Seanad, covered some aspects of the Dáil and the committees but nothing on the Seanad.  We complained about this before and there have been some improvements.  However, we are a long way from a satisfactory coverage by the controllers of the franchise for this House.  I suggest to the Leader that we meet again with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Broadcasting and those who operate the system so that we at least get our share of coverage.  It is time to protest when no coverage is provided.  By contrast, Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i> has provided very good coverage of the Seanad since he started his column and I pay tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will support the timely action of the Tánaiste in calling in the British Ambassador yesterday. The treatment of Róisín McAliskey has been raised by many Members on both sides.  If the British ever learn anything it is that if they treat people decently they will get a decent <Col N="260" /> response.  Perhaps in time they will learn that lesson.</P>

      <P>The cost of domestic water supplies is being widely discussed at present.  I have already asked that we discuss the quality of tapwater. The report of the Environmental Protection Agency was not circulated to everybody; I had to ask for it.  Many such reports have to be asked for nowadays.</P>
      <P>The December edition of <i>Consumer Choice</i> included a damning report on tapwater supplies. This month, another report indicates that the smaller the source of supply the more likely the prospect of heavy contamination.  Many Senators are from parts of the country where there is heavy faecal, especially animal, contamination of water supplies.  This is an increasing phenomenon due to changed methods of agriculture.  We need to debate the issue.  It is not simply a question of cost; practice is also involved.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to look at the interpretation and operation of the Protection of Animals during Transport Order?  Live exporters are frustrated with the red tape involved in these regulations and consider that the interpretation of the order is causing inefficiency. They are frustrated that they cannot export cattle because of ensuing delays.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader also ask the Minister when he expects P&amp;O, the parent company of Pandoro, to make a decision on the export of steer cattle? These two issues are causing much frustration among farmers throughout the west.  While live exporters tell them there is a market in Europe for these cattle, they cannot export them because of the regulations and the lack of transport facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when (1) the licensing laws in Dublin and (2) Luas will be debated?  During the recent debate on Northern Ireland, I and other Senators called on Mr. John Hume to turn his face against an electoral pact with Sinn Féin.  I am sure the House will welcome the firm announcement by Mr. Hume that he will not contemplate any such electoral pact because he realises, as does this House, that when one has an armalite in one hand and a ballot box in the other, the electorate who vote for Sinn Féin must ask themselves was it their vote that pulled the trigger?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the milk quota system as soon as possible and will he ensure that any such debate be confined to this issue?  We can produce milk much more cheaply than most other EU countries. The demand for milk products has grown, yet farmers are unable to produce more milk because of the quota system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the controller of the Government Publications Office why there is such a discrepancy in the prices charged for Government reports, legislation and so on?  For example, the rather flimsy 52 page Ethics in Public Office Bill costs the citizen £10 to purchase.  Where is the justification for that cost?  I ask the Leader to take up this matter as the pricing structure is not just an issue for researchers or lobby groups but one of access to information.  There should be a simple explanation for that divergence in pricing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Townsend referred to muddying the waters.  Slurry pollution is a serious problem in Cavan and Monaghan.  I strongly support Senator Henry's call for a debate on water quality in Ireland because it is an issue that affects everybody.  We should uphold the right of every citizen to clean water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's remarks and I ask the Leader to send the congratulations of the House to Mr. John Hume, leader of the SDLP, for realising he has been supping with the devil for the last six to seven years.  His late conversion is very welcome; he must realise that if one clasps a serpent to one's heart, one gets stung.  Mr. Hume has now apparently come back into the fold and joined the rest of us in ostracising Sinn Féin.  The Leader should convey the congratulations of the House to him on coming back to the land of the living and politically sane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald on safety at sea and I will give him a definite date for that debate, as I have promised one for some time.  Senator Fitzgerald also requested a debate on sport.  I spoke to the Minister this morning and he will circulate a copy of the report to all Seanad Members, but Senators Dardis and Henry have raised a bigger question on the circulation of official reports.  I understood that all such reports would be automatically circulated to Members of both Houses, but that may not be the case.  I will ask the Clerk of the Seanad what the regulations are and if she will take steps to ensure that Members of the Seanad are automatically furnished with all such reports.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the Buckley report and I compliment him on behalf of the House for the fine way he handled this in the media over the weekend.  I agree with him that it is outrageous that we have to defend ourselves on the basis of a leaked fragment of a report we have not seen. That is an appalling way to do business and we should now have the report in front of us so we can see the basis for the decisions that were or were not made.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the question of having other issues debated.  Tuesday afternoons might be appropriate for these debates but I will need co-operation from Members because there is no point in having debates if nobody is here.  I need to be sure that this experiment would work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> Senator Dardis raised the question of agriculture. That will be a new debate and not just a continuation of the old one.  Senator Magner raised the question of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.  The group leaders should have a meeting with its editor to express our concerns on the matter. Senators Henry and Gallagher raised the question of water quality.  That is a very serious issue, and when we get the Environmental Protection Agency report it could form the basis of a short debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten raised the question of the protection of animals.  The Minister is looking into problems with the regulations on the transport of animals and hopes to make an announcement on that issue soon.  The Senator also raised the question of P &amp; O, who are considering the transport of breeding heifers and a decision on that matter is to be made within a week.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned two debates he would like to have and I agree with his comments on Mr. John Hume's article.  That is the subject of a Martyn Turner cartoon in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> that sums up the reality of the situation better than any of our speeches.</P>
    <P>Senator Townsend raised the possibility of a debate on the milk quota system and I will try to arrange one.  Senator Hayes raised the interesting question of the cost of some Government publications and in principle he is right.  Excessive cost should not be an impediment to the right of access to these publications and I will try to get information on that matter.  I do not have to comment on Senator Ross's contribution.</P>

    <Title>Decommissioning Bill, 1996: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the report of the international body which was presented to the Irish and British Governments in January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international body was established to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  It was also asked to report on the arrangements necessary for the removal from the political equation of illegally held arms and, to that end, to identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning and report whether there was a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve that.  Its report, presented to both Governments on 22 January 1996, is a model of its kind and a reflection of the eminence and calibre of its three members &mdash; former US Senator George Mitchell, its chairman, former Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkeri and General John de Chastelain.  The Government had no hesitation on receiving the report in accepting it without <Col N="263" /> reservation.  It was equally welcomed by all the parties represented in this House.</P>
    <P>The peace which prevailed in January 1996 has been broken without cause or justification by the actions of the Provisional IRA.  That in itself does not invalidate the report.  Nothing that has happened since the report was presented undermines the relevance of its central thesis or the coherence of its argument.  That is why the Government remains committed to all aspects of the report and why the Government believes that it continues to offer the best possible framework for taking forward the issue of decommissioning as part of a twin track process in which progress can be made in parallel on that issue and political negotiations.  That is also why the Government is committed to giving effect to the report's recommendations and to work with others to that end.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important first step in that direction. Its enactment will also be an important demonstration of our good faith in that regard.  Central to the recommendations contained in the international body's report is the principle, which has guided the approach of successive Irish Governments, that a resolution of the Northern Ireland issue must be sought and established by exclusively democratic means.  The international body accordingly recommended that the participants to all-party negotiations should affirm their total and absolute commitment to six fundamental principles of democracy and non-violence, including the principles that all paramilitary organisations be totally disarmed in a manner which will be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent commission.</P>
    <P>The international body equally recognised that decommissioning, in the sense in which that term is used in their report, can only be effected by those in actual possession of arms and in circumstances where they will be prepared to decommission.  The body acknowledged that decommissioning could not be expected to happen in isolation and that, given the way in which the decommissioning debate had evolved, its resolution would require reassurance to be provided not only to those who previously sought prior decommissioning but also to those who had been persuaded to abandon violence. That is also reflected in the conclusion they reached that what was essential if the gun was to be taken out of Irish politics was an agreed political settlement and the total and verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.</P>
    <P>The essentially voluntary nature of decommissioning is also reflected in the detailed recommendations which the international body made on the means of resolving the various practical problems associated with a process of total and verifiable decommissioning.  It is also to be seen in their conclusion that many of the details of those recommendations should be left for future negotiation and agreement.  This is a very important point because the Bill is not prescriptive <Col N="264" /> in the way in which the terms of the legislation have been set down.</P>
    <P>The essentially voluntary nature of any decommissioning was not only a key consideration for the international body but was also an important consideration in terms of drafting the Bill.  It explains why certain important provisions of the Bill are enabling in character.  The details of decommissioning, as recognised by the international body, will have to be determined by the parties themselves within the framework of all-party negotiations.  In that connection the body specifically suggested that methods or modalities of decommissioning would need to be subject to negotiation and that the independent commission established to oversee the decommissioning process, whose precise role will crucially depend on the method of decommissioning eventually adopted, should be acceptable to all parties and appointed by the Governments on the basis of consultation with them.  The enabling character of those provisions of the Bill concerned with the modalities of decommissioning and the commission reflect this aspect of the international body's report.  I ask Senators to respect that the purpose of this Bill is to provide enabling legislation recognising the contents of the commission's report.  There were some doubts in the Dáil about the purpose of this legislation, which by the time the legislation was debated were allayed.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is one such enabling section and provides for the regulation power in regard to decommissioning by means of which I, as Minister for Justice, will have the power to make provision for the decommissioning of arms in this jurisdiction.  In addition, it will permit the introduction by regulation of the four methods of decommissioning identified by the international body.  These are:</P>
    <P>the transfer of arms to a commission to be established by an agreement between the two Governments, or to the designated representatives of either Government, for destruction;</P>
    <P>the provision of information to the commission, or to designated representatives of either Governments, leading to the discovery of arms for subsequent destruction;</P>
    <P>the depositing of arms for collection and subsequent destruction by the commission or by designated representatives of either Government; and</P>
    <P>the destruction of arms by those in possession of them.</P>
    <P>The effect of the provision will be that I will be able to give effect to any combination of these methods of decommissioning or to other methods identified by the parties or any variation of them which may be agreed.  The section will also permit the transfer of arms from one jurisdiction to the other for the purpose of decommissioning.  The corresponding UK Bill &mdash; the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Bill &mdash; makes the same <Col N="265" /> provision.  Provision is also made in the section for regulations to deal with other matters relating to decommissioning, such as the locations at which decommissioning is to take place, the timing of that decommissioning and the procedures to be followed either generally or by reference to particular methods of decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the international body was that the decommissioning process should take place to the satisfaction of an independent commission to be appointed by the Irish and British Governments on the basis of consultation with the other parties to the negotiating process.  It also recommended that the commission should be able to operate independently in both jurisdictions and enjoy appropriate legal status and immunity.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes provision for such a commission which it is intended will be established by agreement between the two Governments.  As recommended by the international body, the section guarantees the independence of the commission by providing that it will be independent in the performance of its functions and provides that it will have the legal capacity of a body corporate. It also deals with the issue of immunity for the commission, which will be another important aspect guaranteeing its independence.</P>
    <P>Section 4 will enable regulations to be made by the Minister regarding the commission.  The precise nature of those regulations will depend on the role which the commission will be required to perform in the context of whatever modalities of decommissioning are agreed.  Such a role under the section could include the making of arrangements for, and joining or assisting in, the decommissioning of arms; the taking possession of arms decommissioned; the observation, verification and supervision of the decommissioning of arms; the recording of information relating to the decommissioning of arms; the making of reports; and the facilitating and securing of the safe and secure movement, handling and storage of arms during and after decommissioning.  The section also provides that the regulations may also provide for such matters as the membership of the commission, the terms and conditions under which members of the commission may hold office and staff may be employed, the provision of moneys, premises, etc., to the commission and other related matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 are different from the earlier provisions of the Bill in that they contain substantive provisions directed to the position of those in possession of illegally held arms who participate in the decommissioning process.  They provide protection for them in keeping with the recommendations contained in the international body's report.  The body recommended that individuals involved in the decommissioning process should not be prosecuted for the possession of those arms; that amnesties should be established in law in both jurisdictions; that arms made available for decommissioning should be exempt under law from forensic examination; and that information <Col N="266" /> obtained as a result of the decommissioning process should be inadmissible as evidence in courts of law in either jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will introduce an amnesty linked to the decommissioning process by prohibiting the taking of legal proceedings by the State in respect of an offence in relation to any particular arms, provided that at the time of the commission of the offence the person concerned was engaged in the process of the decommissioning of those arms in accordance with regulations or arrangements; the regulations or arrangements were satisfied as respects both the person and the decommissioning; the decommissioning was taking or took place at a time or during a period specified in the regulations; and the act constituting the offence, or an act that is an ingredient of the offence, was a part of the process of decommissioning and was done in pursuance of regulations or arrangements under which decommissioning was taking place.  These conditions are cumulative.  All four conditions will have to be satisfied before the prohibition on proceedings can apply.  This is to ensure that the section is not misused for unlawful purposes inconsistent with the purpose of decommissioning and to avoid doubt as to the circumstances in which the prohibition on the taking of proceedings will have application.  The precise nature of the requirements which will have to be met before the prohibition will apply will, however, be a function of the regulations and arrangements made under the Act and therefore a matter for discussion with the parties.</P>
    <P>The section also makes provision for regulations which may specify particular offences to which it applies should this be considered either necessary or desirable.  It further provides that the prohibition on proceedings will not apply to an offence alleged to have been committed by the use of arms after they have been decommissioned. This latter provision is intended to meet the possibility of decommissioned arms being misappropriated and misused after their decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Section 6 prohibits the forensic examination or the testing of arms or related material made available for decommissioning in accordance with regulations or arrangements.  The prohibition will apply not only to arms themselves, but to anything resulting from the process of decommissioning; any substance or thing found on or in arms decommissioned; and anything on or in which arms were when they were decommissioned; or any substance or other thing found on or in such a thing.  That prohibition is subject to certain specified and limited exceptions which are principally directed to ensuring that: (i) decommissioned arms or other substances can be handled safely, by allowing for testing for the presence, quantity and stability of ammunition, explosives or explosive substances and (ii) that the prohibition will not prevent the examination or testing of arms for the purpose of discovering information concerning an offence alleged to <Col N="267" /> have been committed by the use of arms after they had been decommissioned.</P>
    <P>The section will also prohibit the use by, or on behalf of, the State of arms or information, obtained in the course of, or as the result of, decommissioning, in criminal proceedings or in any appeal in relation to such proceedings.  Also prohibited is the use by, or on behalf of, the State of evidence of anything done for the purposes of decommissioning in such proceedings or appeals. Again, the only exception to those prohibitions is where the arms, information, etc., would be relevant to proceedings in the case of an offence alleged to have been committed after the decommissioning concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the core provisions of the Bill which are linked to the recommendations in the report of the international body.  The other provisions of the Bill are in standard form.  Section 1 contains the definitions and section 7 contains the general provisions in relation to the regulations which, in accordance with our standard practice, will require that regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and provides for a negative resolution procedure.  Section 8 contains the standard form of expenses and section 9 contains the Short Title and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>These then are the provisions of the Bill which is the product of close consultation between my Department and the Northern Ireland Office, both of which have benefited from the valuable assistance of the Law Offices in each jurisdiction at all stages.  That means the enactment of this Bill and the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Bill by the British Parliament will create a legislative framework capable of permitting a co-ordinated approach and admitted of mutually reinforcing provisions.</P>
    <P>Its enactment, therefore, will represent an important step in creating conditions whereby the report of the international body can be translated into reality.  Neither Bill will achieve that of itself and neither purports to do so.  Much remains to be done not only to create the conditions where decommissioning will once again be possible, but also to translate the framework which both Bills create into practical schemes which will enable decommissioning to become a practical reality.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the officials in my Department and the Northern Ireland Office for the detailed and dedicated work they have done over many months to bring these Bills to fruition.  Sometimes it is harder to bring an enabling Bill to fruition than when policy is laid out to be put in legislative form.  I assure the House that a great deal of detailed work was done and I pay tribute to the officials in this State and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Much of that work should be taking place in the Northern Ireland talks, that is, doing the ground work so this Bill will be of practical use. The Government's approach to the decommissioning issue within the talks is based upon the international body's report and the approach it recommended.  We have argued, and will continue <Col N="268" /> to argue, that the issue must be informed by those key aspects of the report to which I adverted earlier.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret to me, as a Minister centrally involved in the process, along with the Tánaiste and Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, that agreement on the manner in which the decommissioning issue is to be addressed within the talks framework continues to elude us.  More regrettable still is that this has held up the transition to substantive negotiations which are so important to the future of this island.  The Government will not be deflected or deterred from pursuing such an agreement and I hope the enactment of this Bill will assist the process of seeking a resolution of that issue.  This Bill was sought by those participating in the talks and who wanted to know why it was being delayed.  It is now being passed through this House and will become law shortly.  It is critically important that we find a means to make progress on both decommissioning and substantive negotiations simultaneously in accordance with the approach which the international body suggested and recognised as necessary.</P>
    <P>Beyond what is happening within the talks, the most significant step that could be taken now which would open the way for progress to be made both in the political process and on decommissioning would, of course, be the reinstatement of the Provisional IRA's cessation of August 1994.  The unequivocal restoration of the cessation would pave the way for Sinn Féin to enter the talks in accordance with the agreed basis for the participation of all parties set out by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of Great Britain in the joint communiqué of 28 February 1996 and reiterated in the ground rules for substantive all-party negotiations of 26 April last.  This Bill will not create new preconditions for the involvement of Sinn Féin in the talks.</P>
    <P>What it does do is create a framework, consistent with the recommendations of the international body, which will enable the gun to be removed from Irish politics forever.  The Bill, therefore, can play its part in achieving progress towards a comprehensive political settlement of the Northern Ireland issue which will ensure that violence is never again used for political ends.</P>
    <P>In the past few days excellent police work was done and serious bomb-making equipment was taken out of commission.  I commend the Garda Síochána, which was involved in that.  I would like to send a message to those who continue, despite the talks process, to prepare for and engage in violent activity by making bomb-making equipment and to prepare for a war which should have come to an end during the ceasefire.  The time has come for such people to recognise that 27 years of violence did not achieve the ends they sought and will never do so.  It is time for the cessation to be restored to allow Sinn Féin to enter the talks so that the work we are doing today in passing this legislation can be used to bring about substantive <Col N="269" /> negotiations, the removal of guns, bombing-making equipment, Semtex and weapons from the equation and an end to punishment beatings and the threat of violence to many in Northern Ireland.  If those with guns, bullets and bombs do not put them aside forever and involve themselves in the democratic process, the work we are doing in the talks and today will have little effect.</P>

      <P>Everybody in this House is committed to democratic politics and to using peaceful means to pursue whatever political objective in which they believe.  We are discussing a Decommissioning Bill in circumstances where we are perhaps a million miles away from ever realising the decommissioning of arms in Northern Ireland.  Why is that so?</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this is a fairly thin and threadbare Bill which contains only nine sections and is little of substance.  It only permits the introduction of regulations to set up a commission. By and large, this is the shell without crab or the outline without the substance.  I am not surprised by that.  Taking into account the period that has elapsed between the ceasefire in August 1994 and the amount of progress made since then, it would be virtually impossible for the Minister to introduce a realistic Bill on decommissioning. This begs the further question, what is the point of the Bill at this stage?  The Mitchell report was published on 22 January 1996; why has it taken until now to produce the Decommissioning Bill?  It was presented to the Dáil on 9 December but no one can say that 12 months' work went into this Bill &mdash; if it has, the Office of the Attorney General and the Minister's office must be on a go-slow.  A Bill such as this could be drafted in a matter of weeks, if not days.  Last year the Minister introduced and passed more complex legislation within weeks.  This threadbare document represents the low water mark of this Government's contribution to the peace process.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it could introduce such a Bill when we are a million miles from decommissioning. Why are we so far from the decommissioning of arms, which we would all welcome? Paragraph 4 of the Downing Street Declaration states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prime Minister, on behalf of the British Government, reaffirms that they will uphold the democratic wish of the greater number of the people of Northern Ireland on the issue of whether they support the Union or a sovereign <Col N="270" /> united Ireland.  On this basis, he reiterates, on behalf of the British Government, that they have no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland.  Their primary interest is to see peace, stability and reconciliation established by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island, and they will work together with the Irish Government to achieve such an agreement which will embrace the totality of relationships.</P>
    <P>This solemn declaration by the two Governments, which took a long time to prepare through tortuous negotiations, formed the basis of and created the atmosphere for the IRA ceasefire of August 1994 and the loyalist ceasefire some months later. There can be no dispute about that.  It is interesting to note that this document makes no reference to the decommissioning of arms.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is prepared to accept that Mr. John Major significantly shifted the goalposts after the IRA ceasefire.  The first obstacle he put in the way of the peace process was that the IRA must use the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;; the second was the decommissioning hurdle.  These points are laudable in themselves.  Everyone wants a permanent IRA ceasefire and the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons.  We also want peace. The IRA exists because a certain atmosphere, a series of relationships and a cultural/historical mix exist in Northern Ireland which can fuel and enflame such an organisation.  It does not exist in a vacuum.  The genius of the Downing Street Declaration was that it was capable of smothering the flames of violence by offering everyone light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The question which must be put to Mr. Major is, if the decommissioning hurdle is jumped, what will be the next obstacle?  I will be surprised if people who have been expected to jump these two hurdles will be happy to jump them and any others put in their way.  We need a sense of realism about this Bill and decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Concerning the resolution of other international conflicts, two examples in particular are not similar but worth quoting nevertheless &mdash; the conflicts in South Africa and in Israel and the Lebanon.  I never heard Mr. De Klerk tell Mr. Mandela that he would only speak to him if he first decommissioned his arms nor did I hear any Israeli Prime Minister say something similar to Mr. Arafat.  Those words were never spoken, perhaps because those people had a greater sense of realism than we do.  It is naive in the extreme to think that people who have been enemies and who have been engaged in the cycle of violence for so long will lay down their arms in advance of what they see as a compromise.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister's intentions are good and I cast no aspersions on them but even at face value this Bill does not represent an adequate response to the Mitchell principles.  Once progress is made a proper decommissioning structure can be put in place and a proper Decommissioning Bill enacted, but is this not a case of putting the cart before the horse?  What is the <Col N="271" /> point of bringing to this House a skimpy, threadbare document with little detail when there is no progress to report on the substantive question?</P>
    <P>In December 1994, Deputy Reynolds clearly stated on the record of the other House that if his Government was brought down the peace process would be endangered.  He was correct.  We all know that Mr. Major depends on Unionist votes in the House of Commons and is, therefore, unwilling, unable and incapable of displaying the courageous involvement in an all-inclusive peace process which will actively engage the men of violence.  That is what it is all about.  Once they have been engaged and once there is a process, that is the time for a comprehensive Decommissioning Bill.  I regret the delay in bringing this Bill before the Oireachtas in the first place.  I regret the fact that this is a threadbare and skimpy Bill.  I think the fact that this Bill is so ill thought out and inadequate does no honour to this Government's involvement in the peace process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>The Senator's Leader said something very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I congratulate here on bringing the Bill before the House and on her work on the peace process.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with the thrust of Senator Mulcahy's statement.  The Senator referred to this Bill as a flimsy one without a lot of content and said that the Bill is too simplistic in its approach. Deputy O'Donoghue made the same points in Dáil Éireann in his initial speech.  Perhaps if Senator Mulcahy had read the debate in the Dáil in its entirety, he would see that his own party leader, Deputy Ahern, had quite the opposite point of view.  Deputy Ahern recognised the absolute need for a non-prescriptive Bill, a Bill without any preconditions whatsoever, a simple Bill that would facilitate the commencement of decommissioning and which would place the report of the international body on a statutory basis.  Thankfully, Deputy O'Donoghue, at the end of the Dáil debate, agreed that it was a good and useful Bill and that the correct approach was being taken on it.  Perhaps Senator Mulcahy should consult with his party leader rather than reading the earlier stages of the debate in Dáil Éireann.  I compliment Deputy O'Donoghue for listening to and considering the views of his leader and the other contributions made in the Dáil and for agreeing that the Bill is a useful and progressive one in the circumstances.  As the situation stands at present, it would be unhelpful and negative to lay down detailed regulations with regard to decommissioning.  Hopefully, by the time this debate is completed, Senator Mulcahy will also see the light and recognise the objectives of the Bill and the need for the type of Bill we have before the House at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> I welcome the Bill which gives effect to the report of the international body which was presented to the Irish Government on 22 January 1996.  I would like to pay tribute to the work of the members of the international body &mdash; former US Senator George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and former Finnish Prime Minister Harri Holkari &mdash; who provided an independent assessment on the decommissioning issue.  The international body also dealt with the vital and delicate areas around decommissioning.  The report of the international body gave decommissioning a basis from which to move forward on the political track.  It is disappointing, frustrating and very sad that the basis of the report and the hope of a political development towards lasting peace has not occurred; but I think we must continue to strive for peace and ensure that the decommissioning of illegally held arms in the Republic, the six counties and Britain is secured. Such decommissioning would underpin the peace process, but it is only one aspect of the securing and maintenance of permanent peace.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from section 23 of the international body's report because it puts in context the whole need for decommissioning and the role and political impact that decommissioning would have, were it to take place:</P>
    <P>These commitments when made in honour will remove the threat of force before, during and after all-party negotiations.  They would focus all concerns on what is ultimately essential if the gun is to be taken out of Irish politics; an agreed political settlement and the total and verifiable disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  That should encourage the belief that the peace process will truly be an exercise in democracy not one influenced by the threats of violence.</P>
    <P>I think that is the way forward.  It might seem at this juncture to be impossible; much has happened since the Mitchell report but we must continue to work for peace as a prerequisite to a solution to the problems of this island.  We must continue to endeavour to persuade the IRA and Sinn Féin that the only way forward is to give peace a chance.  Peace must be based on trust and on an understanding of the positions of all sides. Peace must not necessarily be based on agreement, but there must be genuine dialogue and understanding of the deeply felt aspirations on all sides.</P>
    <P>Trust must be the foundation on which decommissioning will take place.  The killing and maiming must stop and discussions must take place. Much discussion will have to take place before trust between the sides is reached.  It is only then that there will be an intent to resolve the political differences by peaceful and democratic means.  It may seem vague and, as Senator Mulcahy said, a little irrelevant; but we must strive for a peaceful solution because that is the only kind of solution there can be.  Each side must look at the other's positions and try to accommodate and understand <Col N="273" /> those positions.  Trust will only come with mutual understanding, even if the differences prevail.</P>
    <P>A week after the killing of a 23 year old man in Northern Ireland, we may seem very far away from that; but we must continue to appeal to, persuade and challenge the IRA and Sinn Féin. Their present means is not the way forward; it leads to destruction, suffering and loss of human life.  We must condemn their present actions in the hope that the realisation will eventually come within the IRA and Sinn Féin that peace is the way forward.  I believe there is a considerable number of people within Sinn Féin and the IRA who believe that this is the case.  We must strive to ensure that their aspirations and their approach to the future prevails.  One of the ways of doing this is to introduce legislation like the Decommissioning Bill in order to put on record the approach the Government will take to all aspects of a situation following a declaration of peace and an agreement to enter into talks.  There is no ambiguity about decommissioning and no ambiguity about this Government's approach. This Bill is making a clear statement as to what will take place when a ceasefire occurs and when decommissioning is agreed.</P>
    <P>I believe the report of the international body must continue to command a central role in the search for peace in Northern Ireland.  It may seem irrelevant under the present conditions but we must not despair of peace.  That is why the international report must remain central to our thinking and discussions in our work for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  It must continue to be given a high priority in all party negotiations.  The Bill before the House provides a legislative framework to facilitate decommissioning, while recognising the basic and inescapable reality that decommissioning can only be effected by parties who have possession of the arms and in circumstances where they are prepared to decommission them.  These require that the process suggests neither victory nor defeat; that it takes place to the satisfaction of an independent commission; that it results in the complete destruction of armaments in a manner that contributes to public safety and is fully verifiable, and does not expose individuals to prosecution; and that it is mutual.</P>
    <P>Section 2 outlines regulations on decommissioning. It makes provision for the location, times and methods of decommissioning, the transfer of arms to the commission, or to a person designated by the Minister or the Secretary of State for the destruction of arms.  In other words, it clearly outlines what will take place in the event of an agreement and a decision to decommission. From that point of view it is important that this be enshrined in legislation.  We must have a belief, hope and aspiration that by working towards peace it will eventually come.  To say that such legislation is irrelevant and is not contributing to the peace process is giving in to despair, and we must not do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> As the Minister said, the Government must not be deflected or deterred from pursuing an agreement on peace.  It is hoped that this Bill will assist the process of seeking a resolution to the issue. At this juncture it will contribute in a small way towards doing so.  At a later juncture, however, it may contribute in a significant way when progress is made.</P>
    <P>We must place on the record of the House our call for the reinstatement of the Provisional IRA's cessation of August 1994.  The unequivocal restoration of the cessation would pave the way for Sinn Féin to enter talks in accordance with the agreed basis for the participation of all parties as set out by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in February 1996.  We appeal to the IRA and Sinn Féin to enter into talks and facilitate a situation by reinstating the ceasefire.  They should move the situation forward by talking to each other, building up trust, removing arms and progressing towards a lasting political solution to the difficulties which have impacted upon this country since the foundation of the State, and especially over the last 26 years.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to section 53 of the report of the international body, which states:</P>
    <P>Continued action by the Government on prisoners would bolster trust.  So would early implementation of the proposed review of emergency legislation consistent with an evolving security situation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the work her Department is doing on the repatriation of prisoners. This important aspect of the peace process must continue to receive attention.  I urge the British Home Office to accept that repatriating prisoners to the Republic from Britain can assist in building trust and in moving the situation forward.</P>
    <P>While this is a minor aspect of the whole process in present circumstances, it was very important during the ceasefire.  Unfortunately, however, we did not get the same assistance or understanding from the British Government that we should have at the time.  While it is of less importance now that the ceasefire is over, it is still important in the context of building trust.  It is also important from a humanitarian point of view in facilitating families' access to prisoners.</P>
    <P>It is extremely expensive and difficult for some prisoners' families to visit them.  It is impossible for others, because of their medical condition or age, to visit prisoners in Britain.  This is an important issue in the context of the peace process and it is crucial from a humanitarian point of view.</P>
    <P>Prisoners who have been sentenced for subversive activities in Britain should be allowed to return to Ireland so their families can visit them more easily.  In that way they will continue to have some relationship with their partners or wives, and children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.</P>
    <Col N="275" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a progressive one and the Minister is to be congratulated on taking this difficult legislation through the House.  I hope it will stand any constitutional or other tests that may be brought against it.  It is a tricky operation to try to get a commission in place which will be compatible with the laws of both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>I welcome and support the Bill.  Over the last couple of years we have seen a variety of examples around the world which justify this kind of legislation.  In one form or another, we have seen arms decommissioning in many trouble spots around the world, including South Africa and the Middle East.  More recently we saw it happen in England, where the State approached the problem by offering to take in any privately held arms over a period without asking any questions. People were simply asked to hand in the weapons.  The weapons amnesty came about after the horrific incident in Dunblane, Scotland, last year when a man went riot and killed children and a teacher in a primary school.</P>
      <P>The debate on arms began at that time, yet the importance people attach to carrying weapons is extraordinary.  Although it may appear to be a sexist remark, the issue seems to have more to do with men than with women.  I always hear men defending the right to carry arms in different parts of the world, although not particularly in this country.  Perhaps we men should look into our hearts and souls to find what is it about the power and destructive potential of arms that makes them boys' toys.</P>
      <P>Whereas arms are often presented in some parts of the world as being a justifiable method of defending oneself, in other areas they are seen as a past-time, leisure or sports activity.  The fact is, however, that their potential is lethal.  The recent killings in New Zealand are yet another instance of what happens when people have easy access to arms.</P>
      <P>A major debate on the right to own and use weapons has taken place over the past three or four years in the United States where the National Rifle Association have put up all sorts of arguments in favour of bearing arms.  In Britain recently even the Duke of Edinburgh managed to offer some words on the subject at a time when he would have been better off saying nothing.  As has been said about many of us on occasions, he missed another great opportunity of keeping his mouth shut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country there has never been easy access to arms, which have always been well controlled. The decision to establish an unarmed Garda force was a significant and fundamental reflection of the views of the founding fathers of the State.  The fact that we have managed to survive more or less intact with an unarmed police force is an argument in itself that much peace-keeping and law enforcement activities can be undertaken without carrying arms.  I am not suggesting for a moment that all such work can be done in this way.  There is a place for arms.  The State has a duty to defend itself and its citizens and, on occasion, that will <Col N="276" /> require the use of arms, so I am not approaching this matter from a pacifist point of view.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5 of the Bill but wonder how it will work.  The section offers an amnesty to people who put themselves in a position where they could, perhaps, be charged with an offence. Could the Minister outline how that would work? The provisions of the section are clear but how will it operate?  Does the Minister have particular offences in mind?  Obviously it is a crime to have arms in one's possession or to carry arms in a public place and, if somebody is bringing a gun to be decommissioned, it would be nonsensical if that person were to be charged with illegal possession of arms ten yards from the Garda station or office where the weapon is to be handed in for decommissioning.  That is understandable. However, let us suppose a person conducted an armed robbery while on his way to hand in a weapon for decommissioning.  It is probably a ridiculous example but can the Minister reassure me that such an event will not be covered by the amnesty?  What will be the basis for including some offences and excluding others?</P>
    <P>I disagree with section 6 of the Bill.  It provides that there will be no forensic examination of weapons handed in for decommissioning.  There is a group of people in Northern Ireland who still do not know what happened to missing relatives. They suspect they are dead.  Other people have recovered the bodies of their loved ones but they cannot be sure of who or what killed them or why they were killed.  The problem for these groups is that not knowing what happened creates a continuing sense of grievance.  The process of grieving is inhibited and cannot be terminated while people are unsure of the circumstance of the death.  This problem is encountered many times. &ldquo;If only we knew what happened&rdquo;, is the common refrain.  If they knew what happened they could get on with the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>I am worried about section 6 in that regard.  If, for example, a splinter group of the IRA decides to participate in this scheme and decommission its arms, I can live with the amnesty it will receive.  I can even accept the extension of the amnesty to the extent that forensic evidence will not be used against the group.  However, I dislike something which denies citizens information which is crucial and fundamental to their understanding of what happened to dead relatives.  Forensic evidence could answer many such questions. There is no need to provide that forensic examination will not be conducted on arms deposited for decommissioning.  Where is the danger if an amnesty is part of the process and if the evidence will not be used to open cases?</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is an obverse reason for what the Minister is doing in this section in that it does not prevent the State from pursuing cases with available evidence.  It would be wrong if somebody, having committed a crime two years ago and believing the forces of law to be closing in on him or her, thought the smart way to get out of his or her predicament would be to hand in the <Col N="277" /> weapon that committed the act of destruction or the lethal killing and in that way secure protection. That could still happen.  Somebody might be under suspicion for having carried out a terrorist act with a rifle and, following a long investigation, this person might believe the forces of law are closing in on him.  He will be aware that an important part of the evidence against him will be the forensic examination of the weapon.  That person could decide to have the weapon handed in for decommissioning, which would effectively deprive the State of the evidence.  I am confused by section 6.  I cannot claim to be an expert on this matter and I will be guided by the views of the parliamentary draftsman and the advisers who drafted the Bill.  However, I am anxious to hear the reasons for including this provision.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to control arms and different parts of the world have learned the importance of doing so.  It is also important that people are invited to hand up their weapons of death to the State or to destroy them.  In offering such an invitation we must be prepared to give an amnesty for certain offences.  However, the Minister should describe the offences that will be eligible for amnesty.  I hope the number will be restrictive. I also wish to hear further explanation of the provisions in section 6 and why it is a good thing that the legislation contains a commitment that no forensic examination will be carried out on weapons handed in for decommissioning.</P>
    <P>Finally, although the parliamentary draftsman always does it to Ministers, the fact that regulations can only be annulled by negative resolution is a deterioration of the democratic process. Statutory instruments of this type should always be brought to the House for positive resolution. Nobody will take any notice of my sentiments but they are important to some Members.  I ask the Minister to keep that in mind.  I welcome and support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that the Government and the Oireachtas press on with what we can do to assist the peace process through this legislation when so much else detracts from the process.</P>
      <P>Two incidents in the past week show the appalling hatred that exists on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland.  The first was the BBC television programme on the ongoing saga at Harryville. It was a horrific reminder, if one were needed, of the dark age mindset of some loyalists and Unionists.  The abuse being hurled at people attending mass was disgraceful.  Most depressing was the sight of young people and children shouting slogans that would put Adolf Hitler to shame. Is it under the guise of freedom of speech that exhibitions worthy of the Third Reich are permitted by the authorities in Northern Ireland?  It is blatant racism and sectarianism and UK laws must be enforced to end this animalism before the marching season leads this type of action into disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same week I watched the news reports on the death of the young soldier, Stephen Restorick, <Col N="278" /> in Bessbrook.  I have a brother of the same age.  This was a young man doing his job, probably knowing little of the history of Northern Ireland but earning a crust in the best way he could.  He was also looking forward to returning home soon.  His killer is probably strutting around, proud of the status this murder gives him in the sick minds of the IRA and those who support it.  How cowardly.  What is brave about not being able to handle something when one does not get one's way?  What is brave about not being able to discuss differences and debate what could be done to accommodate each view?  What is brave about standing behind a hedge and shooting a bullet into the back of a young person's head?</P>
    <P>Those who carry out such deeds are sick and sorry cowards and cannot claim to act on behalf of right minded Irish citizens.  They are mé féiners acting by their own by-laws and going on ego trips, grasping an ill-founded status which Sinn Féin and the IRA attempt to give these despicable criminals.  Then anti-democratic Sinn Féin has the cheek to continue to talk about a peace process and to seek inclusion in talks.  Either it is part and parcel of murders, racketeering and victimisation of people or it is not.  It is time for it to get off the fence and, for that reason, I welcome what John Hume said on this.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we continue talking about decommissioning and introduce this legislation to honour the recommendations of the report of the international body.  The Bill addresses Unionists' concern that the issue would be addressed at an early stage in the peace process.  It is part of the twin track process agreed by the British and Irish Governments and provides the framework by which decommissioning might take place.  The Bill is enabling in character and must be so, as the Minister explained.  It, therefore, does not prescribe in detail how and when weapons may be handed in or destroyed.  It allows for four different forms of decommissioning and gives the Minister power to introduce regulations to enforce the necessary provisions when and where agreed.  It provides an amnesty for those involved, prohibits certain forms of testing of decommissioned weapons and prohibits the use by the State of information gained from the decommissioning of such weapons as evidence thereafter. Like Senator O'Toole, I too would welcome clarification of the section covering the inadmissibility at a later stage of forensic evidence.</P>
    <P>The Bill is sensible and practical in those aspects and I welcome it.  However, there are two points I wish to make about the general issue of decommissioning.  The first relates to the South African peace process.  I listened to Mr. de Klerk address the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin Castle where he pointed out that decommissioning was not seen as the be all and end all or as an important part of their peace process; it was introduced at a much later stage. <Col N="279" /> However, it has been used here as an excuse to stall real talks.  It is, therefore, all the more important that we remove that obstacle, perceived or real, and allow those who are interested in proceeding with real negotiations to do so.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we are fooling ourselves to some extent.  The recent brilliant work of the Garda in finding arms is very helpful, but I believe weapons are being made close to where I live.  Who will stop that?  Decommissioning can only ever be a theoretical supposition.  We are not to know that every weapon will be handed in or that others are not being made as those weapons are handed in.  The issue of decommissioning is very far from the minds of the IRA.  We must remember that real peace comes from the minds and hearts of men and not from legislation. However, contributions such as Senator Mulcahy's self-contradicting one, do not help.</P>
    <P>I have said that I am depressed about what is happening with the peace process, especially the ending of the ceasefire.  I have also expressed my opinion that decommissioning should not be the be all and end all.  However, contrary to other references, this legislation is vitally important because the issue of decommissioning has stalled talks in Northern Ireland.  Those entrenched on both sides should have no excuses to prevent the peace process proceeding.  For that reason it is important that this Government does what it can to remove real or fabricated obstacles to talks. We have today removed the excuse of the decommissioning issue from the Unionists and others who have raised it as a concern.  It is a real concern for many people, but it is one more problem which has been removed in that we have dealt with it so far as we can.  It is now more important than ever that the IRA reinstates its ceasefire and that all communities in the North sit down to real talks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAughtry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to take part in this debate having heard Senator Mulcahy's contribution. I have enormous reservations about the form of wording he used in putting together his discussion on decommissioning.</P>
      <P>I have never agreed that decommissioning should be top of the agenda.  As an ex-serviceman and someone who fought in a war for six years, it has been my experience that such matters tend to end in an untidy but satisfactory manner and not in the neat and orderly manner set out in this legislation.  I am sure experienced politicians will agree that these matters do not end in this way. There will be pockets of trouble here and there and we will have to think on our feet, particularly the Minister for Justice for whom I have the highest regard.  However, that is only if we are lucky enough to reach that position.  That is my position on decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to talk about the way this State discusses the subject of decommissioning. This is happening where I live, not here.  Maybe that is why so many mistakes are made addressing <Col N="280" /> it.  The last time Senator Mulcahy talked about Northern Ireland he said he was a member of a republican party which does not accept the British have any right to be in Northern Ireland but which made that protest by constitutional and peaceful means.  I would like to tell him that I am British, intend to stay British and intend to work as hard as I possibly can to keep Northern Ireland British.  At a rough guess, I am joined in this by 900,000 Protestants and an approximate 200,000 Northern Catholics who, like me, want to be Irish but want to remain under the United Kingdom system of government.  That is written into the Downing Street Declaration.  There is no jiggery-pokery about that because I would not support it if there were.</P>
    <P>It is no good Senators standing up here pretending that, on the one hand, they are opposed to the IRA's violence while, on the other, repeatedly laying blame at the door of the British Prime Minister.  They neglect to condemn the IRA for doing nothing for more than 12 months during the ceasefire except increase its intelligence and take part in vicious punishment beatings.  Even worse &mdash; I stand to be corrected on this by the IRA or anyone else &mdash; it blooded its new members by showing them how to kill petty criminals who deserved at most six months in jail. It taught them how to put a gun in a person's mouth and pull the trigger because they might need them for bigger killings later on.  This is the way the IRA operates.  Not a word about this has been heard from the other side of the Seanad. Either they believe in the consent principle or they do not.</P>
    <P>There were further examples from Senator Mulcahy today.  He said the IRA exists because of a certain atmosphere and social-historical mix which influences its actions.  I thought it existed to coerce me and people like me into a united Ireland by force of arms.</P>
    <P>The situation in Northern Ireland has been compared to South Africa and Israel, a ludicrous comparison.  The scale of deaths and killings in Northern Ireland is minuscule compared to those areas and the issues are totally different and much more complex.  The reason international attention is focused on Northern Ireland is domestic; it happens to suit certain Irish-Americans to be interested in it.  Another reason the situation interests people is that it is a sort of intellectual Rubik's cube.  It has an intellectual attraction for people and has therefore attracted academics, politicians, onlookers, etc.</P>
    <P>The issues which brought the civil rights people onto the streets have been and are being addressed.  The voting and housing issues have been addressed and the employment issue is slowly but surely being corrected.  It is now a criminal offence not to observe the measures introduced in these three areas.  That ought to be remembered here.  The people of Northern Ireland who have lost loved ones know all about living with the killing and I am not trying to dismiss that in the least.  However, if all the countries <Col N="281" /> considered by Amnesty International to be oppressed were set out in its annual report in league tables, Northern Ireland would be in a long queue to get into the bottom of the third division.  That is the scale of the problem there. By saying that, I hope to persuade the IRA that it is not worth using armed force and the Unionists that it is not worth using neo-fascist tactics to get their way.  I emphasise that for no other reason.  I am no apologist for either side.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success in this testing and onerous task.  I admire her for the fortitude and composure she has shown and I believe that this Government is the most suited to combating the difficulties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments.  I am glad that Senator McAughtry contributed to the debate because I too was concerned at the tone taken by Senator Mulcahy.  This House must not suggest that the slowness of the political process is justification for the use of violence.  Prime Minister John Major, Taoiseach John Bruton or any of the democratic politicians did not end the ceasefire; it was ended by the IRA who exploded a bomb at Canary Wharf, killing two people and leaving an entire area of London devastated.</P>
      <P>The political process is slow because democracy can be frustrating.  There are spurious advantages to dictatorship, but democracy involves trying to bring people together.  Everything the Government is doing, and everything done by Deputy Reynolds, is predicated on the basis of consent without coercion.  Throughout the ceasefire the IRA continued to teach people how to make bombs, to train and to practice for violence. The Taoiseach has been at his strongest in expressing his disappointment that during the ceasefire there was no effort the change the mindsets of those involved in violence.</P>
      <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, gained great kudos from all parties for his role in securing the peace process.  However, Senator Mulcahy seemed to suggest that we did not have a ceasefire because Deputy Reynolds was no longer Taoiseach.  That is a dangerous message.  The peace process continued for many months after the change of Government in December 1994.  The ceasefire did not end because John Major was Prime Minister or John Bruton was Taoiseach; it ended because the IRA set off a bomb, and no amount of political delay can be offered as justification for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government has moved from the Washington Three pre-condition.  Much progress has been made in the peace process since the Canary Wharf bomb.  The joint communiqué of 28 February 1996 agreed that all parties, including Sinn Féin, could enter talks as soon as they expressed a commitment to exclusively peaceful means and the democratic process.  A credible IRA ceasefire will allow Sinn Féin into talks for the first time.  The ground rules for substantive all-party negotiations were agreed by the two <Col N="282" /> Governments on 16 April 1996.  Those rules reaffirmed the conditions under which Sinn Féin could enter the talks.</P>
    <P>The talks process opened on 10 June 1996 and I was honoured to be part of the Government delegation.  All parties are eligible to participate in those talks under the same conditions &mdash; there is no discrimination against Sinn Féin.  As long as it declares itself to be part of a democratic and peaceful process it can sit at the table.  The loyalist paramilitaries have done so.  They ended their violent campaign and they are still at the talks.  I commend them for their fortitude and courage in sustaining the peace process and I hope they will continue to do so despite provocation.</P>
    <P>Rules of procedure for the talks, agreed by the participants, protect the rights of all the parties, particularly the minority parties.  No frustration with the pace of the talks can justify the IRA's actions.  Inclusive negotiations, which Sinn Féin demands, are taking place and it can enter them as soon as it secures a credible, unequivocal ceasefire.  We should not offer succour to those who feel that the actions of Prime Minister John Major, Taoiseach John Bruton, Tánaiste Dick Spring or any other politician justifies a return to violence.</P>

      <P>When the Government took over in December 1994 all that existed was the ceasefire. That was important, but there was no talks process or any mechanism to advance the situation. By February 1996 the talks process was agreed and it began in June of that year.  That is what is needed to make substantive progress, not a particular figure in one place or another.  That is not to take away from the good work done by Deputy Albert Reynolds, but we should not offer any justification for violence.</P>
      <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the Bill as a &ldquo;shell&rdquo; and used this as a stick to beat me.  I am used to it.  I have broad shoulders and have been beaten by enough sticks in the last two years to sustain Senator's Mulcahy's attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has missed the point, as did Deputy O'Donoghue at the beginning of the decommissioning debate.  By the end of the debate, Deputy O'Donoghue magnanimously said he was glad the Bill was now in place.  I make no apology for this Bill being an enabling measure.  It will allow further substantive talks to take place.  There are people sitting at the talks table who have never taken up arms &mdash; the Unionist Party and the SDLP.  It was a good decision by the British and Irish Governments to consider this enabling legislation as another vehicle by which we can make progress without creating conditions to stop Sinn Féin from entering talks.  I make no apologies for the fact that it is enabling because it gives power to the Minister for Justice to make the regulations which will flow from the agreement to bring about decommissioning.  That has to be the case if we are to follow the international body's report. They, after taking submissions, came to the conclusion that if prescriptive methods of decommissioning are set down, either in their report or in legislation, prior to Sinn Féin being part of the talks, one would not even get off first base.  The Senator can beat me all he wants, but I will continue to say he has missed the point of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recognised that decommissioning will only come about as a result of negotiations between the parties who have weapons, in parallel with the discussions on political progress.  We may want it differently.  I would like if there was no chance of weapons being whipped up from under the table.  However, I recognise the reality. <Col N="284" /> I have nothing to decommission nor does the Senator or anyone else in this House.  The people who have weapons to decommission are the IRA and the former loyalist paramilitaries.  The latter have put them to one side.  They have not decommissioned their weapons, but that will come about through negotiations following agreement among the parties.  Hence the necessity to have arrangements in place whereby those regulations can be made.  We do not want to wait until we get that agreement and there is a a long gap while the legislation is written and put through the two Houses of Parliament here and in Britain.  We want to be ready and able to bring about the regulations when the agreement has been reached.  If there is any case for this legislation it is to make sure it does not become another roadblock.</P>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy referred to the delay in introducing the Bill.  He was having another go at me and perhaps hoping to get a line in the newspaper because having a lash at the Minister for Justice is like a bloodsport.</P>

      <P>He does not understand what has been going on in the last year as regards decommissioning and the efforts to bring Sinn Féin on side.  The reality is that bringing a Decommissioning Bill forward at an early stage would have been seen by Senator Mulcahy's party and many others as a roadblock created over and above the condition of an unequivocal ceasefire. If the Government, on June 10, had not only set up talks but set down a decommissioning process, Fianna Fáil would have been the first party into the fray to say we were ruining the possibility for peace.  All parties in this State would have been concerned that it was a hurdle.  That is why the Washington Three condition by the British caused a problem and why I welcomed that condition being taken off the table by the British Government.  They had to face some hard political debate in their Parliament in order to remove that condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mulcahy's contribution is inconsistent. On the one hand he says the Bill took too long to be introduced and on the other he is concerned about creating hurdles for Sinn Féin entering the talks.  He cannot have it both ways.  The Bill is now being introduced at a time considered wise and propitious by the two Governments.  We <Col N="285" /> made a judgment at the talks &mdash; at which I was part &mdash; that it was the right time to introduce this enabling Bill in the hope that it would contribute to progress.  As Senator Neville said, the transfer of sentenced persons was also seen as progress.  I assure Senator Neville we are progressing all the time although we are also conscious that the agreement of three parties &mdash; the prisoner, the receiving state and the holding state &mdash; is essential in the transfer.</P>
    <P>It is not an exact science.  If there was an exact prescription by which we could bring about peace in Northern Ireland, some other wise person would have found it by now.  It is a step by step process.  One might take one step forward and find oneself back where one started two steps back.  Careful and wise decision making has brought us this far.  We still have huge problems. Senator Mulcahy will have to accept the bona fides of both the British and Irish Governments that the reason why the Bill is in this form and is only coming now is that we feel it may take another problem off the table.</P>
    <P>The Unionist Party would have liked this Bill to be introduced six, eight, or nine months ago; but it might have stopped progress in talks and perhaps allowed time for a ceasefire to be restored.  Sadly, this has not happened, but there was good method in giving the parties to the talks some succour that the two Governments were serious about putting a decommissioning process in place without the modalities laid out.</P>
    <P>I hope by the time the Bill is law that Senator Mulcahy will have changed his mind about it.  His party leader did not need to change his.  I listened to Deputy Bertie Ahern's speech and recognised he was showing his experience and involvement in Government in the earlier days of the peace process.  He understood why this Bill is in the form it is and why it is being introduced now rather than earlier.  Then, Deputy O'Donoghue made an appalling speech, full of his usual colourful phrases, saying this was the worst legislation etc.  By the time the Bill was finished, he also recognised what it was about.  I hope Senator Mulcahy will reach that stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville raised the convention on the transfer of prisoners.  We are pleased we have already managed to bring back some prisoners and will continue to do so as speedily as possible. There are court procedures involved, similar to the extradition procedure.  It is not a case of saying if the prisoner wants to be transferred, he can be and everything is fine.  We have to obtain court orders and make sure the sentence can continue to operate in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised a number of valid issues as regards sections 5 and 6 of the Bill.  It was important we drafted those sections to acknowledge that the kind of circumstances which the Senator mentioned would not be allowed.  If somebody bringing weapons to be decommissioned &mdash; there is a process and regulation which lays down how and where they are <Col N="286" /> brought etc. &mdash; used the opportunity to carry out a robbery on their way, that crime would not be covered under any amnesty.  The requirement focuses on what the person was doing at the time the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>Somebody caught in possession of a firearm will not be able to escape prosecution simply because the decommissioning process is in existence, but only if they are engaged in the process of decommissioning that firearm in accordance with the regulations.  Thus, somebody caught in possession of a firearm which they were pointing at a bank teller or shopkeeper will not be able to escape prosecution for possession of a firearm by simply saying he was on his way to decommission it.  The converse of that is that someone caught in possession of a firearm while legitimately on their way to decommission it will be covered by the prohibition, as the definition of decommissioning extends to an act leading to decommissioning.</P>
    <P>It is very important for the message to go out loud and clear that the cover of decommissioning cannot be used to commit an offence on one's way to decommission a firearm, and will not be accepted as a defence for stopping to commit an offence while on the way to decommission a firearm. It will not be possible for such a weapon to be just thrown onto a pile of decommissioned weapons without being forensically tested.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the amnesty. The Mitchell commission discussed this element. They concluded in paragraph 48 of their report that it was their considered opinion there was no chance of decommissing weapons without an amnesty.  That is the reality.  As I said on Committee Stage in the Dáil, we might like it to be different but there would be no chance of getting any weapons, apart from a few pea shooters which had not been used, if those weapons could be forensically tested and used to convict people for crimes committed many years earlier.  That is the price we might have to pay.</P>
    <P>However, Senator O'Toole indicated he understood that forensic testing is not the only evidence which can be used to convict somebody.  Just because a weapon is handed in and cannot be forensically tested for a crime committed five years earlier does not mean the RUC will stop investigating that crime.  It has other ways of getting evidence and can continue to do so.  It is important to realise that the handing in of a weapon used in a crime does not negate the investigation of that crime.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of what has gone on during the ceasefire and since then.  She is absolutely correct that there are people making bombs in her and neighbouring counties.  People are continuing to practise for war, even if they are not actively carrying out operations at this time. Those people will have to understand that if there is to be an unequivocal ceasefire they will have to cease that kind of training and mind-set.  They will have to go back to being ordinary citizens like the rest of us by training to be carpenters, <Col N="287" /> scientists, nurses or whatever.  They will have to retrain for a democratic way of life because they cannot continue to &ldquo;work&rdquo; at learning how to make bombs, kill people, carry out punishment beatings and other heinous crimes which are being committed all the time.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  It was useful to raise some of the issues. There is no doubt that 27 years of violence has had an effect on the proliferation of illegal weapons in the State.  My job, and that of the police force, is to get as many as possible of those weapons out of the system so that they are not used for aggravated burglaries.  I am glad to say that the number of aggravated burglaries using firearms is down; unfortunately, the number of aggravated burglaries without the use of firearms is still growing.</P>
    <P>I have resisted a very strong lobby, of which Members may not be aware, for the licensing of hand guns in this State, particularly for sporting purposes.  I believe we need to have fewer guns available in this State rather than more.  We must work to get as many as possible of the weapons in the hands of the IRA and others out of the system.  That can be done thorough a decommissioning process.</P>
    <P>I hope it is understood that this legislation has been very carefully drafted and that the timing of the Bill was an issue.  It was not a case of us having to take a whole year to prepare the Bill.  The preparations for the Bill were done carefully and with great commitment.  Senator Mulcahy will be able to criticise certain elements of it.  However, the wording of the Bill, its enabling nature, the commitment to matching the international body's report, the timing of when the Bill would be announced as being in preparation, the timing of when it would be prepared and the timing of when it would pass through the two Parliaments were all part and parcel of the peace talks in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I say that as a sign of the bona fides of the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who have been closely involved in the process.  It is because of their progress and commitment, and that shown by others, that we still have a talks process, which is available for Sinn Féin if it wants to be there &mdash; it knows how it can participate in the talks.  I urge it to find a way to bring about an unequivocal ceasefire which will allow it to take its place and be part of those discussions.</P>

The ball is now in the court of the IRA to reinstate its ceasefire.</P>

    <Title>Employment Equality Bill, 1996: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the most significant contribution to the fight against discrimination in employment since the first Anti-Discrimination Act of more than 23 years ago.  When enacted, the Bill will give Ireland one of the most modern equality codes in Europe.</P>
      <P>There is an obligation on all of us, Government, employers and trades unions, to work towards the development of social justice. Equality is a fundamental human right, which is especially important in the economic sphere. Individuals in society have a basic right to seek gainful employment and to advance in that employment, without being discriminated against because of personal characteristics unconnected with their work performance.  The Bill fulfils the Government's commitment to introduce broad-ranging legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment on the grounds of gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>The scope of the Bill is comprehensive, and deals with all employment-related areas, from vocational training to access to employment and employment conditions generally, including training, work experience and promotion.  It also imposes obligations on trade and professional bodies, on advertisers and on placement agencies to act in a non-discriminatory way.  It draws on the developments, experience and practice that have informed the work towards gender equality over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>The Bill responds to the radical change that has been taking place, and continues to take place, in Irish society.  Our society, which until recently had adopted a relatively closed and homogeneous outlook, is rapidly taking on a new open, pluralist and strongly European identity.  This new identity is increasingly evident in working life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world of work is no longer peopled predominantly by married men with full-time permanent jobs.  The emerging work environment includes many employment options, from part-time employment to job-sharing and teleworking. It is peopled by men and women, some of whom are the sole breadwinners, while others contribute, in equal measure with a partner, to the economic support of home and family.  Increasingly, people with disabilities are demanding their right to a full role in economic life, including a place in this more flexible world of work.  A more open approach to issues of sexual orientation, changes in family status, and an increase in ethnic and <Col N="290" /> religious diversity, leave members of some of our minority groups more visible and perhaps more vulnerable in the workplace.  The fact that few people are guaranteed a job for life, coupled with the high levels of unemployment, means that more older people than ever before are seeking work.</P>
    <P>In the emerging employment market, equality of opportunity represents a fundamental element in labour protection legislation.  Discrimination is not a theoretical problem.  For too many people, it is an unacceptable reality.  Take discrimination on the grounds of age.  A quick scan of the situations vacant columns in any daily newspaper provides ample evidence of outright discrimination. Labour force statistics show that older workers once unemployed are likely to remain unemployed for longer than their younger counterparts. The report of the task force on long-term unemployment shows that alongside the increasing incidence of long-term unemployment among older workers, other motivational factors are at work.  A study in Tallaght by Ronayne and Creedon in 1992 reported that only one out of every three long-term unemployed people over the age of 45 had an expectation of ever getting a job again.  The perceptions of these individuals are more than confirmed by the reality.  Statistics show that a man aged over 45 and out of work for two years or more has only one chance in ten of being re-employed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is widespread discrimination on the grounds of disability.  In its recent report, <i>A Strategy for Equality,</i> the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities estimated that some 360,000 Irish people, or 10 per cent of the population, have a disability.  The National Rehabilitation Board, together with other agencies, has been working over the years to ensure the integration of people with disabilities into employment. An EC Labour Force Survey in 1989 indicated that &ldquo;the chances of someone with a disability being unemployed are significantly higher than someone without a disability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a view that equal opportunities in the workplace represent a cost to business.  Success in today's internationally competitive business environment involves utilising the talents of all employees, without regard to ability-neutral characteristics such as sex, disability or sexual orientation.  Employers and managers who overlook able employees because of traditional prejudices are guilty both of injustice and of waste in deploying the human resources available to them. They may even jeopardise the viability of their enterprise, because there is nothing more certain than that there are other enterprises that have succeeded in tapping the energies and abilities of their employees.  It is past time that we relinquish outmoded preferences that perpetuate narrow discriminatory practices, so that our society can prosper and work towards greater social equity.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in employment often weighs disproportionately on those who are already marginalised <Col N="291" /> in our society &mdash; members of the travelling community, older people and people with disabilities.  Employment equality legislation is one essential tool to help redress disadvantage. Experience to date in relation to gender equality well illustrates both the limitations and the importance of legislative action.</P>
    <P>Employment equality legislation for women has been on the statute books for 23 years.  We live in a far more equality conscious environment than we did in 1974.  Employment equality legislation is partly responsible for that change in outlook. The days are long past when it is socially or politically acceptable to justify unequal treatment by reference to differences in biological or social function.  However, acceptance of the principle of equality does not appear to have been matched with practical action to achieve it.  To illustrate the point, I would like to outline the state of play in relation to three key equality issues &mdash; pay, labour market participation and segregation in employment.  Each of these issues fundamentally affects women's economic power and earning potential.</P>
    <P>Looking at the issue of pay first, across the EU today we see that women earn substantially less than men.  In Ireland, the average hourly earnings of women who work in manufacturing industry is only 74 per cent of that earned by their male counterparts.  The situation outside the manufacturing industry is not much better.  An ESRI study published in 1994 entitled <i>Male-Female Wage Differentials: Analysis and Policy Issues</i> examined the earnings of men and women workers in all sectors.  The study found that women's earnings were only 80 per cent of those of men.  The study also found that half of the 20 per cent difference could be attributed to factors such as skill, hours worked, length of service and experience.  It is possible that the remaining 10 per cent of the discrepancy is the result of pay discrimination.</P>
    <P>Regarding women's share in the labour market it is evident that, like other European countries, Ireland has experienced a strong increase in labour market growth.  Employment in Ireland has grown by 8.5 per cent in the period 1991-95.  The increase in female employment has been even higher, with growth of 20 per cent.  There are more jobs for women.  The participation rate for women in the labour market has increased from 32.9 per cent to 38.5 per cent in the last five years. However, many of these jobs are concentrated in low paid, part-time and other atypical work and it is to these jobs that many of the new entrants to the workforce, primarily women, are recruited.</P>
    <P>Finally, women's economic power and earnings potential are affected because the world of work is segregated both vertically and horizontally.  The number of women in key decision making roles in our public and private organisations is conspicuously low.  Women are under-represented at board level in our major manufacturing and <Col N="292" /> industrial concerns and on the boards of our service and financial institutions.  Men occupy the majority of management, professional and supervisory positions and women, by and large, are responsible for the delivery of routine, clerical and support services.  Women are also segregated in the low paid sectors of the economy such as the clothing, assembly and services.</P>
    <P>I know from meeting the two sides of industry that employers and trades unions support the principle of employment equality.  Despite this support, there has been a falling short in the achievement of equality of opportunities in practice. I am convinced that if real progress is to be made in the future we must focus on positive action to integrate women and other disadvantaged workers into the labour market.  The Bill provides significant legislative arrangements for the pro-active management of equal opportunities programmes at the level of the firm. These are contained in section 70 which establishes arrangements for equality reviews and action plans.</P>
    <P>I have also provided in sections 24 and 33 an opportunity for employers to put in place positive action measures to help women workers, workers with disabilities, older workers and workers from the travelling community.  Trades unions have a serious obligation to assist in putting in place these equal opportunities initiatives and in exploiting their benefits in practice.</P>
    <P>I would like employers to seize the occasion of this Bill to conduct an equality audit of their workplaces and put in place targets to ensure the removal of remaining barriers to equal opportunities. I am hopeful too that some employers will avail of the opportunity afforded for the first time by this Bill to introduce schemes of positive action geared to help eliminate existing inequalities.</P>
    <P>Trades unions must intensify efforts to help women and other disadvantaged workers collectively and individually to attain equal pay and equal treatment.  I am confident that this Bill will give the issue of equality in the workplace a considerably greater profile.  Following its enactment, I look forward to an increasingly active role being taken by more and more individual women and other disadvantaged workers in defending and advancing their own interests and rights in the workplace, either in the trades union movement or in other ways.</P>
    <P>The issues involved in the development of full gender equality at work are complex and can only be addressed over time and in response to a broad based programme.  In 1974 the first piece of employment equality legislation was presented to Dáil Éireann.  Deputy Michael O'Leary, the then Minister for Labour, in presenting the Bill stated that &ldquo;much needs to be done to improve the status of women in employment&rdquo;.  It is disquieting to note that, despite some significant achievements in the intervening years, this statement remains true today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Nonetheless there has been progress.  In 1974, two women Senators contributed to the debate on that first piece of employment equality legislation. One of them, Mary Robinson, is today President of Ireland and the other Evelyn Owens is Chairman of the Labour Court.  Twenty years ago both of these important offices would have been clearly categorised as men's jobs.  Attitudes in Ireland have progressed but substantial equality in employment for the vast majority of women remains an elusive goal.  There is need for continued vigilance by women, their representative organisations, employers and State agencies to ensure that acceptance of the principle of equality is matched by a real will to eliminate discrimination.</P>
    <P>I have taken steps to facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life through enactment of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995.  I have supported adoption of the directive on parental leave at EU level.  The transposition into Irish law of this directive can be expected to greatly ease the child rearing burden for many new working parents. Allied to these developments, facilities for childcare support for working parents have been promoted through a pilot scheme for disadvantaged areas funded by my Department.  The achievements of this scheme in its first two years, 1994-95, have recently been evaluated.  The results indicate that some 2,000 additional children benefited from the further childcare facilities funded under the project.  This is a significant step forward and one which I intend to take further.  As part of the Partnership 2000 agreement recently concluded with the social partners, the development of the childcare sector is especially profiled. I intend that my Department will play a central role in pursuing this issue.</P>
    <P>To broaden the decision making role of women, I have moved to ensure an increase in the number of women on State boards.  In 1992, only 15 per cent of positions on State boards were held by women.  In 1993, the Government, on my proposal, decided to work towards a target of a minimum 40 per cent representation level for women on State boards.  The most recent information is that women comprise almost 26 per cent of the total membership of State boards.</P>
    <P>In developing this Bill to cover the new discriminatory grounds, I have had regard to the individual rights based approach in existing gender employment equality legislation.  I have also taken note of UK racial equality legislation and the various approaches adopted to deal with discrimination in other EU member states, Australia and the United States.  The Australian model in particular has proved a fruitful source of inspiration.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the gender equality provisions in Part III of the Bill have been drawn so as to ensure concordance with the requirements of EU law.  The Bill transposes into Irish law the equal pay and equal treatment directives following <Col N="294" /> repeal in the Bill of the substantive provisions of the 1974 and 1977 equality Acts.  The Bill also meets Irish obligations with regard to equal pay under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome and builds on the substantial body of case law that has been handed down by the European Court of Justice in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I now wish to outline some of the main features of the Bill.  The text of the Bill falls into six Parts as follows.  Part I contains standard and technical provisions; Part II sets out the prohibited discriminatory grounds and establishes the scope of the Bill; Part III deals with discrimination on grounds of gender and gives effect to EU law in this area; Part IV deals with discrimination on grounds other than gender, namely marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community; Part V provides means of redress and compensation for persons who may have suffered discrimination; Part VI gives new powers to the equality authority which will replace the present Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill, comprising sections 1 to 5, provides for the powers to make orders and regulations under section 3, a provision in relation to expenses under section 4 and repeal of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the substantive provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, under section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains the necessary definitions. Some definitions which should be noted are the definition of advertisement which includes every form of advertisement whether in a newspaper or other publication, on television or radio or by display of a notice or by any other means; the definition of contract of employment which covers all employees in both the public and private sectors as well as workers employed through employment agencies &mdash; this broad definition of contract of employment is in line with that contained in recent labour legislation; the definition of disability which is broad enough to give protection from discrimination to all people with a disability; the definition of family status which encompasses both elder care and child care responsibilities; and the definition of remuneration which includes any consideration in cash or in kind which an employee receives, directly or indirectly from the employer in respect of employment.</P>
    <P>Pension rights are excluded from this provision and my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, will bring forward any legislation necessary to ensure discharge of our obligations under Article 119 of the Treaty of the European Community and the various equality directives, including the Equal Pay Directive.  I understand he will deal also with equal treatment in pensions on a wide range of other grounds in an amendment to the Pensions Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>Part II comprises sections 6 to 17 of the Bill. Section 6 sets out the grounds on which discrimination is prohibited in the Bill.  They are gender, <Col N="295" /> marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  The scope of the Bill is also established in this Part.  Section 8 outlaws discrimination in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment, training or experience, promotion or regrading or classification of posts.  Section 10 prohibits the publication or display of discriminatory job advertisements.</P>
    <P>Section 11 prohibits discrimination by employment agencies.  Section 12 prohibits discrimination by providers of vocational training. Section 13 prohibits discrimination by trades unions, employer organisations, professional bodies, trade associations and by any body which controls entry to or the carrying on of a profession, vocation or occupation.  The procurement or attempted procurement of discrimination is prohibited by section 14.  The extent of the liability of an employer or other person for actions of employees and other agents is set out in section 15.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in this Part include: the definition of like work in section 7; general exclusions from the provisions of the Bill where a person is unwilling, unsuitable or unable to perform the duties of the post in section 16 and where acts are done in compliance with statutory requirements in section 17; and, finally, the making null and void of provisions in collective agreements that are discriminatory in section 9.</P>
    <P>Part III comprising sections 18 to 27, deals with discrimination on gender grounds and gives effect to EU law in this area.  Sections 19 and 20 provide an entitlement to men and women to equal remuneration in respect of like work where both are employed by the same or an associated employer.  Discrimination in relation to other conditions of employment are prohibited in sections 21 and 22.  Section 23 contains a definition of sexual harassment and explicitly provides that it amounts to discrimination.</P>
    <P>Section 24 allows for positive action to eliminate the effects of past discrimination.  It is a broadly couched provision and may be interpreted to include all forms of positive action, subject only to any limitation imposed by European Court of Justice case law.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 to 27 allow exemptions from the principle of equal treatment.  These exemptions include: an exemption for the purposes of authenticity in entertainment; an exemption for certain jobs abroad; an exemption for special advantageous treatment of women in connection with pregnancy, maternity and adoption; and an exemption for personal services, such as the care of an elderly or incapacitated person.  Finally, there are limited exemptions for the Garda Síochána and the prison service for purposes related to privacy and decency; the control of violent individuals and riot situations; and for gender-based height requirements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Part IV, consisting of sections 28 to 37, prohibits discrimination on any of the following grounds; marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community. Sections 29 to 31 provide for equal pay for like work and for the prohibition of discrimination in relation to other conditions of employment. Section 32 outlaws harassment in employment on the basis of each of the discriminatory grounds set out in this Part.  Section 33 allows positive action in favour of people with disabilities, people above the age of 50 and members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Section 34 allows for the retention by employees of certain family and seniority related benefits that would otherwise be made unlawful under the Bill.  It allows for the continued fixing of retirement ages and for the phasing out of age related pay.  The section also permits the setting of a maximum recruitment age, on training related cost grounds, and for an exemption from the terms of the Bill where there is clear actuarial or other evidence of significantly increased costs for the employer.</P>
    <P>Section 35 is focused primarily to require an employer to make special provision for a person with a disability.  I amended this section and section 16 in the Dáil so as to make explicit in the Bill the concept of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo;. The amendments arise from concerns expressed to me by groups representing people with disabilities, and debate among Deputies on Committee Stage.  Section 36 allows for the continued application of residency, citizenship and Irish language proficiency requirements in the public service and establishes criteria for the setting of educational and other qualifications.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides exclusions from the principle of equal treatment.  They include: special provisions for religious, educational and medical institutions run by religious bodies; an exemption for the purposes of authenticity in entertainment; an exemption for jobs in circumstances abroad where, because of prevailing laws or customs, some categories of people could not reasonably be expected to operate effectively; an exemption for employment in a private household and an exemption for the security forces on the age and disability ground.</P>
    <P>Section 37(1) as presented to Dáil Éireann provided an exemption for religious, educational and medical institutions and gave rise to considerable controversy.  I replaced that provision by way of Government amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil.  The new provision represents the culmination of a long process of consultation which I undertook with a wide variety of interested parties, as well as extensive deliberations with colleagues and with the Attorney General.  The new provision represents a reasonable and measured balance between very different views on this most complex and sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Part V, consisting of sections 38 to 68, establishes the procedures for redressing discrimination. Sections 38 and 39 make provision for a Director of Equality Investigations and deal with certain definitional and related matters.  Sections 40 and 45 provide a right to information for all persons who may have been discriminated against and set out the consequences for an employer of failure to supply information.</P>
    <P>Sections 41, 43, 47 and 54 provide means of redress for a person who considers that she or he has been discriminated against, victimised or has not received equal remuneration.  The Bill provides a right of redress of first instance to the Director of Equality Investigations for every person who may have been discriminated against contrary to the terms of the Bill.  There is a right of appeal to the Labour Court against a decision of the director.  The determination of the Labour Court is final, save for an appeal on a point of law to the High Court.</P>
    <P>There are two exceptions to the general redress procedures.  One is that a dismissal case will fall to be dealt with by the Labour Court in the first instance, with a right of appeal to the Circuit Court.  The other exception is that in sex discrimination cases, an applicant may opt, instead of applying for redress to the director, to make a case to the Circuit Court.  The normal ceiling on awards in the Circuit Court has been waived in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 42 allows for binding mediation where the Director of Equality Investigations or the Labour Court considers that the dispute could be resolved in this way and the parties to the dispute do not object to it.  This provision will assist in the speedy and informal resolution of disputes in suitable cases.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the award of substantial compensation in well-founded cases.  Under section 46 the director or the Labour Court may order equal remuneration or equal treatment, as appropriate, from the date on which the case was referred.  In addition, the director or the court may order an employer to pay up to three years' arrears of remuneration or to order compensation for other acts of discrimination or victimisation of up to a maximum of 104 weeks' remuneration. In a case where the person concerned was not in receipt of remuneration, there is provision for an order for compensation up to a maximum of £10,000.  In a case involving the dismissal of an employee, the Labour Court may also order reinstatement or re-engagement of the employee if that is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>Arising from recent European Court of Justice case law I have provided, at section 44, means of redress without limit on the amount of compensation in gender equality cases.  A person who may have been discriminated against on this ground may opt to seek redress through the Circuit Court.  In such a case the only limit on the amount of compensation or arrears of remuneration which may be ordered is a six year time <Col N="298" /> limit on the backdating of any compensation or arrears of remuneration.  This limit on backdating is the maximum such limit enshrined in the generally applicable Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 to 57 allow a person who has been awarded compensation under the Bill to enforce the award through the Circuit Court if the employer fails to make payment within a specified period.  Sections 62 to 65 deal with offences under the Bill and with certain incidental provisions. Sections 58 to 61 give strong investigative powers to the Director of Equality Investigations and to the Labour Court to enter premises, to obtain relevant information through interview or otherwise, and to ensure the imposition of sanctions in the event of failure or refusal by persons to co-operate with an investigation.</P>
    <P>Under section 49, the Equality Authority is empowered to refer disputes to the Director of Equality Investigations.  The authority has the sole right to initiate proceedings in cases of discriminatory advertisements, including power to seek an injunction to prevent the filling of a job advertised in a discriminatory manner.  The authority may also refer a case to the director on behalf of an individual where it would not be reasonable to expect an individual to refer the case &mdash; for example, because of the complexity of the case or because of the individual's fear of victimisation.  The authority may also seek an injunction in respect of persistent discrimination.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 empower the authority, or a person affected by a collective agreement, to refer the agreement to the director or, on appeal, to the Labour Court where it is considered that the agreement contains a discriminatory term or does not provide for equal remuneration.  The purpose of a referral or appeal under these sections will be to identify which provisions, if any, of a collective agreement are null and void, and, where appropriate, to suggest how alternative provisions might be devised.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill, consisting of sections 69 to 73, is concerned with the authority.  Section 69 gives new powers to the authority to prepare codes of practice that will have statutory recognition. Sections 70 and 71 give a new statutory role to the authority to carry out equality reviews and devise action plans.  Sections 72 and 73 contain technical amendments to the provisions in the 1977 Act in relation to the authority.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the implementation of a comprehensive programme to advance equality through a broad range of actions.  The Employment Equality Bill is a central element in that programme and an essential step in the process towards the elimination of discrimination. Senators will have noted that some sections of the Bill are particularly complex and difficult.  I look forward to hearing their views and hope for a fruitful and constructive debate on what is, without doubt, a ground breaking legislative initiative. I commend the Bill to Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues in Fianna Fáil for allowing me to speak now.  This is not the appropriate time for words of valediction but it has not passed our notice that the Minister has announced his intention not to seek re-election. On behalf of all of us I wish him well in his retirement and thank him for his contribution to Irish politics.  As I always say on these occasions, we owe a debt of gratitude to people who put themselves forward to represent the public, for any party and in any role.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that I preface any criticism of this Bill by agreeing with the Minister that it is ground-breaking, progressive legislation which is a significant advance along the lines I and others have advocated and demanded for many years.  I will identify my problems with the legislation.  It is the nature of the legislative process that we tend to take as given that with which we agree and to focus on those issues which cause us problems, but I would not wish my criticisms of the Bill to be taken as anything other than criticisms of the sections in question.</P>
      <P>This is extremely important legislation and many people, including many whom I represent, will feel protected by it.  The Minister deals with the various grounds in a clearly understandable manner&mdash;they are defined, described and the areas they cover are outlined.  The grounds of discrimination covered are disability, gender orientation, religion, marital, family, age, race and membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>This last point is crucially important.  For many years I worked in support of the members of the travelling community and stood with them on picket lines outside hotels which refused to serve them.  That is a different area to employment equality but it springs from the same element of discrimination.  They now can seek to participate in and feel protected by the community.  The strength of any democracy can be measured in a number of ways, one of which is the way it deals with its minorities.  We can be justly proud of the way this Bill deals with one of our minorities.  The Minister and his advisers have done extraordinarily good work in piecing these provisions together and they will stand the test of time.  In the future people will speak of the legislation in the period leading up to 1977 in the same way they now speak of the legislation between 1973 and 1977, as a group of Acts covering areas of crucial importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible and I do not intend to cover every part of the Bill.  The Minister is aware of my reservations which I have raised with him on many occasions &mdash; we can almost address each other telepathically at this stage.  However, I am glad to be able to put it in its context.  The trade union movement has reservations about aspects <Col N="300" /> of the Bill but in general terms it welcomes it as being progressive The Minister has listened to our concerns and taken many of them on board.</P>
    <P>I will be returning to a number of issues on Committee Stage; I will signal them today and, given the time constraints, I will focus on just one. As with other legislation, I have difficulty with the more open access to the court system provided for in this Bill.  I can see the reasons for it, but the constant mention of the High Court and the Circuit Court bothers me.  Irish people are legally minded&mdash;there is no process of mediation, deliberation, determination or hearing they will leave untouched if they feel another avenue is available to them, and in the main that is a good thing.  However, many of them like to cut straight to the chase and bypass the intermediate stages to reach the pinnacle.  In many cases it will require huge legal expenditure to take some of these cases which will almost inevitably go to the Circuit Court or the High Court, depending on the areas dealt with in sections 41, 43, 45 and 54.  I want the Minister to look at that very carefully and I would like him to deal with this issue in some detail on Second Stage.  I am concerned about the need for those forms of access, the need for going from one point to another, why one can be skipped and so on.  I am aware that some of it relates to other legislation and that some of it relates to the principles of natural justice but I would like to have that element fleshed out.</P>
    <P>I will be putting down an amendment to the section which deals with sexual harassment. Again, we are back to the issue of how we define a reasonable person.  Who is this mythical reasonable person?  That it is a well established concept in law, nonetheless it seems to be coming from the wrong perspective as far as the victim of harassment is concerned.  I feel that in making the determination, it should come from the point of view of the person who is the victim, or who feels themselves to be the victim.  There are many occasions in life when people will say &ldquo;I didn't actually intend to cause you any hurt or offence&rdquo; which sounds like a reasonable response to a hurtful act.  Many of us have learned that how one intended one's remarks bears very little relevance to how they are perceived.  It is how they are received that should determine what is important. Those of us who cause others hurt in normal social interaction or in the course of argument will know that it is no use arguing afterwards that we had never intended to cause hurt.  The fact is that the hurt has been caused and it is from that point we should proceed.</P>
    <P>This Bill appears to be saying the intention of the harasser is more important than the feelings of the victim.  Perhaps the Minister will argue against that but that is how I perceive it.  I am trying to put it in a context here to which I will ask the Minister to respond.  On that basis, I am considering an amendment for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> Section 40(3) refers to access to information. Some of my colleagues in a number of unions feel that the plea of confidentiality could be used to prevent the disclosure of information.  Information which a person describes as confidential is not available to another person who might be trying to prove that somebody was being discriminated against.  For example, if A and B are in similar types of employment and B is taking the case that he or she is being discriminated against on one of the grounds outlined in the Bill and B seeks certain information about A's job in order to put together a case, but the information is not provided on the grounds that it is confidential information, then B may be left without the vital evidence to win an equality case.  I think that is a worsening of the present position and I would like to hear the Minister's views.  I have spoken to a number of people who have concerns about that.  Some trade union general secretaries to whom I have spoken, particularly in the civil service unions, have indicated that they also think it is a worsening of the current position.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is worried about the approach on sexual harassment and I would like the Minister to take another look at it.</P>
    <P>There were elements of section 16(4) of the Bill, as initiated, which caused a lot of concern.  I welcome the Minister's amendment to that section to make it more satisfactory to everybody. Everybody is trying to achieve the same purpose and it was important that we were able to come to some agreement on that issue.</P>
    <P>The issue of greatest concern to me is section 37(1) of the Bill.  I have to contextualize this section in terms of the broader society.  I hold a view, which is backed up by any close examination of any society in the world, that in the same way as there is a liberalising tendency at one end of society, there is a move towards fundamentalism at the other.  Most things in society are symmetrical. My worry about section 37 is that, if I look ahead 15 years when there are no longer sufficient religious and clerical people of certain faiths to run schools, the schools will be turned over to fundamentalists who will try to determine what is the ethos.  This will create havoc.</P>
    <P>I saw one element of that recently in Dublin where a very fundamentalist approach to a school on the northside of the city effectively allowed a person to take control of the school and to introduce an extraordinary religious approach with which even Irish law was not able to deal.  The school is attended by only four or five children, most of the parents having withdrawn their children. It is by giving this kind of unbridled rein to people to determine religious ethos that problems will arise.  I believe we are now endowing religious institutions because we have reached a stage where, for teachers in a school or nurses and doctors in hospitals, we are effectively saying that the institutions will be able to take a certain course of action against somebody who is <Col N="302" /> undermining the ethos of that institution.  Everybody agrees with that.</P>
    <P>What will happen in six months' time in a Catholic school in rural Ireland if two divorced teachers have entered into a new relationship with each other, one might be teaching the First Communion class and one might be teaching the confirmation class and somebody might decide that this is unacceptable to the ethos of the school?  My problem with section 37 as written is that somebody could say that having a teacher who is acting or living a life which is in total contradiction to the beliefs of the religious institution is effectively undermining the institution.  If they make that point, as they will and it has already been made in many places, it will be very difficult for any structure, be it the director of the courts or the constituent parts of the courts, to say otherwise.  They might not like it but who is to decide the religious ethos?  Who is to decide what is an undermining influence?  There might be a homosexual teacher in a school and if a religious institution does not accept that as being natural in the order of things, they may want that person out.  I think this is what will happen.  People can use whatever approach they wish.</P>
    <P>The answer that has been given to me by bishops, churches and institutions is that this would not happen, that they would not be so intolerant and would not hold that viewpoint.  I do not expect churches or national organisations to act in this way but this legislation is as available to parish priests in remote corners of Ireland as it is to religious institutions.  These decisions will not be made in Rome or in bishops' palaces; they will be made in the back room of a presbytery.  I do not think it is possible to stop such action.</P>
    <P>I do not think that churches will abuse this legislation; I have never said or thought so. However, I do think it will be used against teachers in a way that was never contemplated by the Minister and which the Minister would never support.  In my former arguments on this legislation, I gave an example of a person who was sacked in the late 1930s from his job in a Waterford school because he did not comply with the religious ethos of the school.  I pointed out the this man finally found a job for the rest of his career and made a great contribution to education in Ireland because he was lucky enough to be taken on by a Jewish school.  The Minister cut the ground from under me, however, by telling me that the man in question was his teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My worry is that that kind of openness will happen again.  Where do we stop? The Minister has inserted into section 37(1) the provison that a religious institution can give priority to a co-religionist.  Reasonable people would not argue with that, but I want to take this a little further.  We will now employ people who can in some way contribute to the religious ethos <Col N="303" /> of the school because that is the only reason for appointing a co-religionist.</P>
      <P>We also have a rule in the book which says that in primary schools religion must imbue and inform every subject on the curriculum.  At what stage does teaching become proselytising?  At what stage will teachers be judged on whether children are learning their faith at school?  I have a nightmare that in three or four years time someone will do a survey to find out how many people know the Ten Commandments or the words of the Our Father.  They will blame teachers, not parents.</P>
      <P>Section 37 of the Bill demands more of teachers as role models than parents.  While we will not stop parents from sending their children to a school if they happen to be in a second relationship or one that is different from the norm, there is a question over whether teachers should not have a higher standard.  I am worried about the fall-out from that.  We are almost asking teachers to move into an area in their professional lives which is very close to proselytisation, yet we are asking them to attain a standard in their private lives which is not demanded of parents or anyone else in society.  I think that is wrong and I am concerned about it.</P>
      <P>I know it is not the Minister's intention to create such a situation but that will be net effect of it.  Much of the debate in the media on the controversial section 37 has been misinformed, and the arguments of those who want to retain it have been somewhat hysterical.</P>
      <P>Having heard all sides of the argument the Minister is in an ideal position to ensure that the real concerns of churches, teachers and parents can be dealt with in legislation.  I would ask the following points to be taken into consideration.  I see that Senator Lydon is writing furiously but I would ask him to listen carefully to what I have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lydon and I differ on many of these kinds of issues.  It is not beyond our ingenuity, however, to compose a formula of words which will enshrine in legislation the protection of ethos, the right of teachers to a private life, the right of parents to select the ethos of their choice for the education of their children, and appropriate employment opportunities and protection for workers, whether they be teachers, nurses, doctors or others in religious institutions.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister did not take on board the fact that institutions run for religious purposes are different from those owned and run by religious institutions for other reasons.  A seminary for training priests is different to a religious institution which runs a school, but that distinction has not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From reading my mail I know that the Bill as published is a source of fear and terror among decent teachers and nurses.  Some 95 per cent of <Col N="304" /> this Bill is superb, progressive, constructive, necessary and protective, but section 37(1) is an unnecessary and unwarranted intrustion into the area of religious belief and practice.  It will cause us problems.  In putting forward this case I am representing more the views of people who actively practise their religion than any other group.  They are people who feel their religion will be threatened by fundamentalists.  I may have views on church and state but this is not the agenda here.  I hope the Minister will take these issues on board on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I would like to express my good wishes to the Minister on his forthcoming retirement.  Like Senator O'Toole, I thank him for the contribution he has made to political life, especially in the area of law reform over the past five years.  I have dealt with this area closely in my role as spokesperson on law reform.  I have been impressed by the Minister's work and even sometimes by his bravery.  The contribution he has made in this area of Government responsibility has been second to none.  I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
      <P>Today, once more, we can see the Minister's commitment to the work of reform and equality. This most important Bill complements and develops the legislation introduced between 1972 and 1977; it began in 1972 with the Equal Pay Act and continued with the Equality Act of 1977.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House introduces legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment on the grounds of gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  It deals with employment from vocational training to access to employment, and employment conditions generally which include training, work experience and promotion.</P>
      <P>A radical alteration has taken place in our society over the past 20 years since the previous Minister for Labour, Deputy Michael O'Leary, then Leader of the Labour Party, introduced the relevant Bills between 1973 and 1977.  As members of the European Union we have a European identity and must respond to the codes of equality that prevail in Europe.  Equality stands as a right on its own.  It is a fundamental civil right which must be defended by the State and extended to all areas of society, especially employment.</P>
      <P>When I started work some 30 years ago&mdash; I was in my teens at the time &mdash; the work environment was much different from today's.  It was mainly male orientated with women sharing office jobs and some secretarial positions in the Civil Service.  Men were the breadwinners while women were housewives.  Similarly, in many positions, including those in State bodies, when women married they were obliged to resign their jobs.  I got married in the mid-1970s and my wife had to retire from her job because, as a married women, she was not entitled to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> Those who suffered disability had little opportunity to obtain work at the time but the traveling community had more opportunity then than it has now.  The travelling community has changed quite a lot in that its members are not as close to the settled community as they were in the past. At that time travellers had a role in society, using skills required by the settled community.  They helped farmers, for example, with harvesting and other tasks.  There was a closer relationship and more understanding and acceptance of travellers. That has changed dramatically in the intervening years to the point where there is now a greater divergence between the travelling and settled communities.</P>
    <P>I feel comfortable saying that because I represent the town of Rathkeale which has demonstarted the tolerance, understanding and mutual respect which prevails between both communities there. There are tensions, of course, but I wish to highlight what can be done in this area.  For example, last Friday in Rathkeale the county manger gave keys to 12 travellers to house them in the town. Everybody in the community was pleased with this.  I am not boasting about it because that is how it should be.  However, life has changed for travellers and they now experience more discrimination than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Discrimination continues to exist in the workplace. People with disabilities do not have a fair opportunity to involve themselves in employment and to earn a living.  The situation has improved but a recent survey showed that many semi-State companies, health boards and county councils do not respond adequately to their obligation to employ people with disabilities.  If the State does not respond and show leadership in this regard, no employment equality legislation will persuade other employers to do so.  State bodies must give leadership by employing people who are members of minority communities and people with disabilities. Yesterday the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights heard representatives from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. They highlighted the discrimination against people with disabilities which exists in many areas of employment.  That must change because there is no reason for such discrimination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this legislation outlaws discrimination on the basis of age.  This is a prevalent form of discrimination.  I had experience of it when, at the age of 40 years and after occupying a relatively senior management position, I was made redundant.  Over a period of two years I discovered I was over the age limit considered acceptable for a similar position in another company even though I had many years of experience and a qualification.  People in their late 20s or early 30s were more acceptable than somebody of 40 years of age.  I had another problem which leads to discrimination, the fact that I was unemployed. <Col N="306" /> There is discrimination, especially in competitions for senior positions, against people who have been unemployed even for a short time. It seems to put a question over their ability, regardless of the circumstances in which they were made unemployed.  In my case the takeover of the company rendered the management team redundant.  Age and the fact of being unemployed appeared to be grounds for discrimination on the part of employers.  I congratulate the Minister for tackling this issue.</P>
    <P>There is also discrimination against the long-term unemployed.  They have greater difficulty in securing employment, as the Minister pointed out earlier, despite their qualifications, abilities and experience than those who are in employment or who are recently unemployed.  The workplace is changing dramatically.  Few people are guaranteed a job for life.  That is only possible in the Civil Service but even that sector is changing. Most people will change jobs and careers between three and six times in the course of their working lives.  The Minister referred to a study in Tallaght which found that one out of three people who were long-term unemployed and over the age of 45 years could expect to get a job.  People who are aged over 45 years and are over two years unemployed have only one chance in ten of being re-employed.  These are stark statistics which highlight the problem of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Employers are entitled to recruit the best qualified people for a vacancy.  That is the criterion every employer must use.  However, employers must realise that sex, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, age or race are not barriers to ability, performance, motivation or the contribution people can make to an enterprise.  If anything, such characteristics could be an advantage. People who have experienced difficulties in life, such as people with disabilities, tend to be more motivated to make success of their lives and to contribute and be part of the success of an enterprise and the employment in which they are engaged.  To consider such characteristics as barriers to employment is a waste of human resources and a severe injustice to the people concerned.  We must have pluralist, open and progressive policies in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Equality is a fundamental human right.  Individuals have a basic right to seek and secure gainful employment and to advance in that employment without discrimination because of their personal conditions.  It is 23 years since the introduction of equal pay legislation, yet in Ireland the average hourly earnings of women who work in manufacturing industry are only 74 per cent of those earned by their male counterparts.  When all sectors are considered, women's earnings are only 80 per cent of men's earnings.  Studies have found that half of the 20 per cent difference can be attributed to factors such as skill, working hours, length of service and experience.  One must conclude, <Col N="307" /> therefore, that the remaining discrepancy of 10 per cent is the result of discrimination.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging and welcome that both sides in industry, employers and trade unions, in the public and private sectors support the principle of employment equality.  Acceptance of the principle of equality must be matched by a real will to eliminate discrimination.  The number of women in key decision making roles in public and private organisations is conspicuously low. Women are under-represented at board level in major manufacturing and industrial concerns and on the boards of State and financial institutions. I commend the Government for making a concerted effort to redress this issue.  It is difficult but the Government has indicated is wish that boards should have a minimum representation of 40 per cent of either gender.  As a result of discrimination over the years, it is difficult to achieve that quota.  Women, having been discriminated against at various levels, are not often available at the top to apply for such posts.</P>
    <P>There is now a will at senior level to promote women and nominate them to boards, but they have not gained the requisite experience and skills because of discrimination.  We must endeavour at all times to overcome that problem and to identify women with skills &mdash; there is no doubt they are there&mdash;who can contribute to boards of enterprise and State institutions.  Men occupy the majority of management and professional supervisory positions.  Women are still largely responsible for routine clerical work and the support services.  They also tend to be in low paid sectors of the economy, such as the clothing, assembly and service sectors.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the role of the European Union in ensuring employment equality and equality in general.  Progress made in this area in the past 20 years or so has been almost entirely due to the directives imposed on us by the EU. Little or no equality legislation has been introduced on our own initiative.  Where would women be without EU directives?  Women must thank the EU for the improvement, protection and enhancement of their employment opportunities and status in their work.  The Government should take more initiatives in this area.  We must give credit to the EU that employment equality has been bred, nurtured and imposed on us.  The equality culture has gradually become part of Irish politics.  Gender balancing and gender proofing must continue.  Positive discrimination must be applied if we are not willing of our own accord to recognise the rights of women and minorities. We might not yet be ready to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister has changed the law, but it is also important to change attitudes.  There has been a considerable increase in the number of women in the workforce and they now account for 37 per cent of those at work.  Many are employed in low paid and part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Last year, the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, of which I am proud to be a member, completed a study on women in local administration management.  While legislation has opened the gates to the workplace for many women, there is still a huge barrier to promotion. The results of the comprehensive study by the committee are revealing.  It confirms that, although more women than men are employed in local administration, there is no female city or county manager out of a total of 37 such managers and no female assistant city or county manager out of a total of 27.  There are two female county secretaries out of a total of 26, one female finance officer out of a total of 23 and no female principal officer.  The report was published in 1996 and gives a clear indication of women's lack of progress at senior management level in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The report also refers to the absence of women on interview boards which is a crucial issue.  It showed that women from middle management were not on any of the interview boards.  Interview boards must include people employed at the level of the position advertised.  It can be concluded from the study that the Local Appointments Commission, which sets up the interview boards, has a serious problem.  Women are not appointed to the positions of county secretary, finance officer, assistant county manager and county manager and cannot, therefore, represent these positions on interview boards.  Most men would be conscious of discrimination and would ensure it did not occur but there is an inherent discrimination if women are not represented on interview boards.  I am not referring to the outcome of their deliberations but to the fact that they do not have women on them, although we would very foolish to say that it does not at times influence the outcome.</P>
    <P>I am also a member of the Mid-Western Health Board.  A study was carried out on the board and it gave a dismal account of the success of women as far as promotion is concerned.  They fail to obtain promotion within the higher levels of health boards.  The board of which I am a member recently discussed the position of nurses and the difficulties they experience.  All the six or seven programme managers at that meeting were men.  The Mid-Western Health Board is fairly typical in that it has no female programme manager, yet the nursing profession, which is at least 90 per cent female, contributes more as a group than anyone else to the health service.  This has been discussed in recent weeks, yet no nurses are programme managers and none of them have any say in deciding future policy or how hospitals should develop.</P>
    <P>Although we have changed the law, which I welcome, there must be a change in attitude and in the structure to ensure that women, people with disabilities, the travelling communities and smaller, but vital, minority groups are not discriminated <Col N="309" /> against.  We must also ensure that people are not discriminated against on religious or racial grounds.  I hope we do not discriminate on religious grounds as much as we do on others. It is important to identify these areas.  I highlighted areas of the public service, such as the local authorities and health boards, because these must give leadership to private industry and employers in ensuring discrimination does not occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his retirement.  I do not always philosophically agree with him, but I believe him to be a good, honourable and moral man who has contributed significantly to Irish political life.  I wish him a long, happy and peaceful retirement.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed.  It is important and well intentioned.  It was difficult to introduce because of the constitutional issues it raised, the opposing parties concerned with it, the difficulties surrounding section 37, etc.  However, the Minister has done a very good job and has formulated the legislation in a way which has appeased the opposing factions as much as is humanly possible. I wish to comment on a few aspects.  I do not believe in speaking too long on a Bill when it is a good one.  If it is good, it should be passed and, if not, it should be argued about.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that discrimination on the grounds of age shall not be construed where one of the people involved is under 18 or over 65. This is a difficult issue because, if it relates more to brawn than brain, the age limit of 65 may be aspirational more than anything else.  However, if it is the opposite, relating more to brain than brawn, then 65 is too young.  Recent studies in the United States have shown that people over 65 are just as capable of working as younger people.  Our brains begin to deteriorate after the age of 16 but the diminution in intellectual potential and capacity is very small.  People well into their 80s have amazing brains.  It even applies to some High Court and Supreme Court judges.  I suppose some figure must be applied, but perhaps the Minister might examine this and we could discuss it at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that employment equality legislation is an essential tool to help redress disadvantage. It is but one tool.  This reminds me of the words John Hume uses continually, that we need a change in the hearts and minds of people rather than legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned that women earn less than men.  This is true.  I work in a hospital and nurses' salaries, compared with those of their colleagues, are ridiculously low.  I am not making a political point but merely stating that nurses do a tremendous amount of work and effectively run hospitals.  However, if they make a pay claim, everyone thinks they earn too much whereas consultants, who do not work as hard as them, are paid salaries two to five times those of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> As Senator Neville said, there is still tremendous discrimination against women.  I became aware of this after serving two terms on the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  The Minister said that the participation rate for women in the labour market has increased from 32.9 per cent to 38.5 per cent in the last five years.  However, most of these are in low paid and part-time jobs. Discrimination against women is not as bad as it was but it still exists.  It is a mind-set; the belief that a woman cannot do a job as well as a man, and it is not true.  There used to be terrible discrimination. When my wife worked for the Civil Service before we were married there was a rule that one could have three illegitimate children before one had to retire.  What kind of mind made up such a rule?  Why three children?  We have moved on since then due, in part, to the efforts of the Minister and legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Mary Robinson and Evelyn Owens, former Members of the Seanad. One now hears men ask &ldquo;Who will be the next President?  Who will she be?&rdquo;  I hope it might be Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    <P>Section 37 created much argument which I hope will cease.  Senator O'Toole has reservations about this section and he said that, as things become more liberal, they become more fundamental on the far side.  This may be true but it is only when things become ultra liberal that one fears a rise of fascism.  The Minister has tried to strike a balance in this regard and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>People speak of this Bill as if it only related to education.  This is not true.  The Bill encompasses medical, educational and religious spheres.  I work for the hospital order of St. John of God which has 42,000 employees in many countries. We employ Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, people of no faith, heterosexuals and homosexuals. Each employee signs an ethics clause but we never have to sack anyone because that clause binds them to very little.  St. John of God employs people who are married, single, living together, separated and divorced.  A person's marital status does not affect their work.</P>
    <P>One can include too many checks and balances. Senator O'Toole has to make these points because of his position.  Yesterday he told me he would like to see the church out of education.  He did not say which church, but that is not fair because the religious have done good work in that area.  I would like to strengthen the Bill because of my outlook but the Minister has done a good job.</P>
    <P>Any group should be able to form an exclusive club based on sex, race or creed and be granted a licence.  The Minister disagrees but I do not feel strongly about this.  This legislation is necessary. We have had too much discrimination and it is difficult to overcome this without legislation. Legislation will not eradicate discrimination; what is needed is a change of attitude.  I am fortunate <Col N="311" /> to work in a tolerant organisation which has never fired anyone for their creed, marital status or sexual orientation and yet provides a service. That is the model that educationalists should follow. I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnGallagher" hpid="Ms Gallagher Ms Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Ms Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As Labour Party spokesperson on equality and law reform I have sat before the Minister, Deputy Taylor many times and, while I do not give praise where it is not warranted, I have praised him on each occasion.  He has introduced legislation which has brought about much social reform from divorce legislation to occupier's liability legislation, all of which have impacted on many people.  I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
      <P>This Bill is both radical and comprehensive. Equality legislation has always been forced on this country by EU membership and even then it only dealt with employment equality between the sexes.  It is 20 years since we passed the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and it is time that was updated and expanded.  This was not an easy task for the Minister and I congratulate him and his staff on introducing such comprehensive and complicated legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is complicated by necessity however, it is too legalistic.  Although I am a legislator and a solicitor I found the Bill difficult to read and to follow.  This may be the nature of the subject but, for example, the definition of &ldquo;victimisation&rdquo; in section 39(2) is too complicated and detailed.</P>
      <P>Section 5, which deals with the repeals and consequential amendments, is messy.  The Minister may argue that every word in the Bill is essential but I found it difficult.  It is not user friendly legislation, however, that is a small fault if the Bill achieves its objectives.</P>
      <P>Is it necessary to define every word in such detail?  Perhaps I am being too simplistic but the manner in which disability is defined may exclude someone with peculiar circumstances.  Is this the best way to proceed?  Was it not possible to include a blanket ban on discrimination in employment no matter on what it is based?  Did we have to detail the headings to such an extent? Would the Minister elaborate on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to detract from the essential thrust of the Bill.  It is welcome and is comprehensive in extending the protection of our laws to outlaw discrimination on the grounds not just of gender but also marital and family status, sexual orientation, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  It also fills an extremely important gap in employment protection as it deals with discrimination which often did not actually occur in an interview.  It deals with access to employment, vocational training and working conditions generally.  It also recognises the huge changes in our society and work systems and updates our laws to cater for the <Col N="312" /> reality of work today.  In that sense it is essential legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the grounds on which discrimination is prohibited&mdash;gender, martial status, age, etc.  This is not to be taken for granted and is a radical measure.  For the first time advertisements which require applicants to be under 40 years of age will be unlawful.  For the first time someone with a disability will be able to challenge the basis on which they were not selected following what they saw as a successful interview.  For the first time a single mother will have redress when she knows she did not get a job because she is a single mother.  This is marvellous in terms of the problems so many have suffered in the past.</P>
    <P>Why are trade union activism or political affiliations not included as grounds for discrimination in the Bill?  I know of an employer, who in his ardent support of a political party, refuses to employ anybody outside of that party, except perhaps party supporters' sons and daughters, in the safe belief they are of the same persuasion. People who have been involved in work issues as shop stewards in their previous place of employment are seen as troublemakers by their prospective employers.  There is no doubt they are discriminated against.  Those grounds should be included in this legislation.  The inclusion of the ground of political affiliation is essential if we are to ratify the ILO Convention No. 111 on discrimination in employment.  I would welcome the Minister's explanation as to why those areas of discrimination are not included.</P>
    <P>I welcome that protection against sexual harassment is given a statutory basis for the first time.  The fact that the onus of proof rests with the employer to ensure that he or she took all steps as are reasonably practicable to prevent the occurrence of harassment makes it possible for many to take serious action to stop this disturbing behaviour.  Senator O'Toole raised the definition of sexual harassment and what is considered reasonable.  That is relatively well dealt with in terms of the legal understanding of what is reasonable.  The Minister has followed the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights in their report on the impact of European equality legislation on women's affairs in Ireland which was published last July.  The Minister has done the committee proud in following that recommendation.  I hope it is workable because it is an area which needed to be tackled on a legislative basis.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the scope of the Bill in outlawing discrimination in promotion, regrading and classification.  How many women have been passed over for promotion so many times that they have lost heart?  I know a very good teacher in the vocational education committee sector who has been working for many years.  She has been overlooked time and time again by a strangely comprised interview board.  We both believe it is because she speaks her mind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> However, no matter how much this and other legislation provides for equality in employment, we still have a long way to go.  This is not theoretical legislation stating what is already in place.  We cannot afford to clap ourselves on the back. Unfortunately, this legislation is badly needed because discrimination in employment is still widespread.  Women still earn substantially less than men.  I do not want to argue about whether the figures are 70, 74 or 80 per cent of what men earn for equivalent work.  Statistics will never deal with how discrimination is tackled where money is handed under the counter.  How is discrimination tackled where women are mostly in part-time work?  I know of mushroom pickers in Monaghan whose employer tells them who will or will not be registered for tax purposes.  They do not get holiday leave or maternity leave.  If they get pregnant, it is tough, they are out of work.  There are so many areas that still need to be tackled in a real way.  Women are still discriminated against, not only in the vertical area of promotion but also horizontally.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Women's Rights, of which I am a member, produced a report on management of local administration.  It was clear from our research that women were the typists of local authorities but found it difficult to move up the grades.  There are no female county managers or assistant county managers and only two in 26 county secretaries are female.  There is only one female financial officer and one female senior administrative officer.  It is worth repeating this because it smacks of discrimination.  I know of one county manager who has just one senior female member of staff to deal with.  He refers to her as the &ldquo;pair of tits&rdquo;.  With that attitude it is no wonder that women find it difficult to move up the ranks because they have so much else to put up with.</P>
    <P>There are many female teachers but why so few female principals?  I listened with interest to Senator O'Toole on the teaching profession. However, once again, it is a male secretary of the union who represents so many female teachers.  I am not saying he does not do a very good job, as he does.  There is something wrong with a system which does not allow women to move up through the ranks.  There are many female nurses.</P>

      <P>Yet few of them actually have a say in nursing policy and the hospitals in which they work.  Unions must also address this question. We rely on them to tackle areas of discrimination in terms of gender equality, yet so many of them are men.  These questions must be asked and it is time everyone took responsibility for <Col N="314" /> working towards achieving equality in employment.</P>
      <P>Another report we looked at was one in relation to obstacles preventing women from reaching upper management.  It was interesting to note that there were no women in the senior echelons of the financial institutions in this country. It is little wonder that entrepreneurial women find it difficult to obtain loans from their bank managers with that kind of hierarchy in place.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the Minister has done all he can do in terms of legislation under his remit.  He has tackled discrimination; but the obligation rests with employers and trade unions to work towards the development of social justice, of which equality is the fundamental part.  Equal access to work and training is vital.  The requirement of claiming dole and social welfare in order to register with FÁS is an obvious case of discrimination and prevents women from gaining access to FÁS training courses.  When job applicants' success depends so much on experience, it is vital to promote training and work experience for women and all other categories of people covered by this legislation.  There must be guaranteed access to training, work experience and apprenticeships, through positive discrimination if necessary.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has tackled discrimination as far as the legislation provides, who will tackle an employer who employs a man instead of woman because of the hassle caused when a woman worker is pregnant?  Who will tackle the employer who advertises and interviews in a seemingly fair fashion but rules out in his head the employment of a man he suspects to be gay or a woman with a stutter, although they may be the best person for the job?  Who will tackle the various forms of latent discrimination which still exist?  A great deal has been achieved but it seems that while employers avoid blatant idscrimination, latent discrimination is still ramplant and is harder to tackle.</P>
      <P>We still need paternity leave and child care provisions.  It is only when there is adequate child care and regulations for child care training, with provision for access to child care for women living and working in rural areas, that women will be facilitated in entering the workplace.  We still need more flexible work systems such as flexitime, job sharing, home working and teleworking. These must be encouraged and facilitated.  Labour protection legislation must apply to those people because, too often, loopholes in the law meant it did not apply to those areas of work which allowed women to maintain a job while raising their families and exercise the choice to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need gender balanced interview boards. The problem in relation to the Local Appointments Commission seems bizarre.  We need more female policy makers and 50 per cent representation of women on State boards.  We also need more funds for the Employment Equality Agency <Col N="315" /> if it is to take on its vastly increased role under this legislation.</P>
    <P>We can do much more to educate people about the rights of every individual.  We cannot achieve equality until we tackle the discrimination which exists in people's minds and open them to the possibilities of what can be achieved by people in wheelchairs, women in the Defence Forces and the other areas about which they have mental barriers.  Gender equality does not exist in the workplace at present.  We cannot say we have equality until women are facilitated to achieve their full potential at work.  That is also the case for all those who suffer discrimination on any front.  As far as the legislation can tackle that big problem, the Minister has done a very good job. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I do not hear a band playing &ldquo;Oh, didn't he ramble&rdquo; at the end of my contribution because I am on the point of getting a nasty cold and I imagine I will be a little more discursive than usual, for which I apologise in advance.</P>
      <P>I wish to echo those Members who paid tribute to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and who greatly regret his eventual passing from the political scene, at least, in its most active form.  However, having benefited from a form of early retirement myself &mdash; I believe the Minister is proposing early, if not premature, retirement&mdash;I can hardly grudge him the pleasures and benefits which will flow from it.  He has graced the Oireachtas with the calm dignity and humanity of his response to some complex human issues.</P>
      <P>It is no surprise that the Minister has produced this legislation.  As my colleague, Senator O'Toole said, 95 per cent of the Bill is excellent. I regret the other 5 per cent but I understand the political pressures under which the Minister labours.  Those pressures do not come only from the Roman Catholic Church but clearly also from my church.  I recently attended a very dignified, gracious, upmarket party where I was lobbied by gaitered members of my community, meaning members of the House of Bishops.  I am afraid I lost a number of episcopal votes, if I ever had them, because I do not approve of religious discrimination, no matter what the source or which group it is proposed to promote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I am a little sad that the Minister has not been able to go as far as I would have liked him to.  He stated &ldquo;The Bill fulfils the Government's commitment to introduce broad-ranging legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment on the grounds of gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community&rdquo;.  That is exactly the kind of menu we want.  It is heartening to see the inclusion in that list of &ldquo;membership of the travelling community&rdquo; and &ldquo;sexual orientation&rdquo;, for <Col N="316" /> which I had to fight so many historical battles in this Chamber.  I am glad to say that, thanks to the wisdom of successive Governments and the maturity of the people, these necessary grounds are now automatically included.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill fulfils the Government's commitment to introduce legislation outlawing discrimination on those grounds except in the areas where it is most fundamentally necessary, such as where the churches control schools, hospitals and training colleges.  That is regrettable and needs to be looked at again.  In order to facilitate and help the Minister and to show goodwill, I have tabled a number of amendments which I hope will be taken on board, particularly on section 37 which purports to protect the religious ethos of a school.  However, there is no definition of &ldquo;religious ethos&rdquo;.  It is not protected in the Constitution, although freedom of religion is. When one takes into account that every major school, hospital and training institution is included, one has cause for worry.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, said for a number of reasons, including the mildness of his attack in certain respects.  I was astonished to hear him say that if there was discrimination it would be orchestrated from a back room in Ballydehob or a parochial house and not in the Vatican.  He would not accuse the Vatican but I will, because that is precisely from where it is orchestrated.</P>
    <P>Nobody who knows anything about the Congregation for the Promotion of the Faith, which used to be known as the Inquisition, and is presided over by Cardinal Ratzinger whose father was a policeman in Munich in the 1930s, which required certain special skills and sensitivities as the Minister will know, could doubt that.  Cardinal Ratzinger has actively promoted discrimination against people, specifically on the grounds of sexual orientation, in the notorious Hallowe'en pastoral.  Let us not pretend we can get off the hook by saying it is just some ignorant parish priest in the back of beyond&mdash;it is right at the core of what purports to be an ethical system.  I cannot regard the position of the Vatican on persons such as myself as ethical in any sense.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that good teachers could be fired on the grounds of sexual orientation, even under this legislation.  They will probably be more vulnerable if they are good teachers.  I was attacked when I was teaching in the college of the sacred and undivided Trinity, not on the grounds that I was a bad teacher, that my behaviour was immoral or that I was undermining the ethos of anything in any spectacular way, but because I was a good and popular teacher whose sexual orientation was widely known and, therefore, I could become a role model to persons whose sexual identity was vulnerable.</P>
    <P>The authorities did not give in to that pressure but if that is true in a third level institution such as Trinity College, how much more would it be <Col N="317" /> true in a national school where one may be subject to pressures in a rural community and where one is dealing with children, who are always seen as vulnerable and on whom it is assumed it might be possible to imprint a particular form of behaviour? Personally I believe that is highly unlikely because as far as I know, all my teachers were heterosexual, yet despite the brainwashing I have turned out as I have.  If it did not work in my circumstances I see no reason it should in others.</P>
    <P>There are 3,200 national schools, 3,000 of them under the direct control of the Roman Catholic ethos or Church.  The taxpayer pays for them, so they are not uniquely and absolutely the possession of the Roman Catholic Church.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 26 January 1997 Jim Duffy wrote:</P>
    <P>What purports to be a Catholic education system is an uneasy mix of State and Church education, with the State picking up most of the bills.</P>
    <P>This is an accurate summary.</P>
    <P>Section 37(1) has caused considerable concern to many people.  I have with me a selection of letters I received on the subject and I propose to quote from some of them.  They are not all opposed to this subsection.  One letter marginally supports it because of a fear that employment may be adversely affected.  This is an unusual view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can easily balance the Senator's supply of letters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I consider it important to put on the record the letters I have received.  I thought the Minister may have been subject to a campaign.  It is not unlikely that the receipt of letters in his Department was orchestrated.  This kind of thing has been known in the past.</P>
      <P>I will not read into the record the names of my correspondents, but they are from people who signed their names and provided me with their addresses.  The first states:</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill which specifically sets out to stamp out religious discrimination ends up legalising it.</P>
      <P>I am a parent of eight children, some of whom are just entering the workforce and I would be very worried if I felt they were open to victimisation under our legal system in their future employment.</P>
      <P>The second letter states:</P>
      <P>This clause would seem to confer draconian power about a school's power to dismiss a teacher whose ethos did not conform to the ethos of the Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>This proposal would seek to enshrine in law the opinion of nuns in New Ross who dismissed Eileen Flynn in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eileen Flynn is on record in recent weeks to the effect that she believes that it would still be possible <Col N="318" /> to dismiss her under the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We should not dismiss this notion too lightly with a grand, liberal overview.  When that case was in progress I remember speaking to friends of mine in the legal world who were involved and whom I assumed to be of a reasonably liberal point of view.  I was told not to worry too much about the case because the person with whom this teacher was living was of a republican background: it was all right to discriminate against people because their background was politically unacceptable.  That is a dangerous road to take because it vitiates the notion of freedom.  Freedom cannot be granted merely to those with whom one agrees.  One is only tested when one extends such courtesies and liberal principles to those with whom one strongly disagrees.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said he did not believe that those within Churches, etc., would discriminate and that only isolated individuals would engage in such activities.  To show that I am not just attacking the Roman Catholic Church, let me give an example to illustrate that this is not the case.  Within a mile of this House there is a suburban parish church in the choir of which I sang when I was a youth.  It had a fine young curate who was living with another young man.  The parish was aware of this except for the rector.  When he became aware of the situation the rector fired the young man with the connivance of the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, having told him that he either left the parish house, separated from his partner of seven years or was gone from his job.  In consequence, the relationship, which had been stable, broke up.  One of the young men went to London and formed an alliance with another clergyman who was a prison chaplain, became infected with the HIV virus and subsequently died.  The other partner went to California where he is still working with people affected with HIV and AIDS.  The job was subsequently advertised as being suitable for a married couple.  Let us not run away with the notion, therefore, that there is never discrimination or that it comes uniquely from the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>Another letter states:</P>
    <P>I am writing to express concern about sections of the proposed Employment Equality Bill.  If this Bill is passed as it stands at present it will give authorities in schools the legislative authority to discriminate against teachers who are (1) single parents, (2) divorced or (3) not practising their religion.</P>
    <P>If the Board of Managment or even parents claim that the behaviour of the above is contrary to the religious ethos of the school, they could face dismissal.  Teachers could also be refused promotion because their &ldquo;status&rdquo; offends their religious sensitivities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Another interesting letter deals with the question of divorce.  I am not sure that the position referred to by my correspondent is an accurate summation of the legal position, but it shows a high level of concern.  It states:</P>
    <P>I agree that teachers should uphold the ethos of the school in which they teach, and indeed teachers have been and still are upholding the ethos at Irish schools.</P>
    <P>However, I do not under any circumstances accept that a teacher's private life should be included in this Bill.  I am a teacher in a Catholic primary school.  I have been separated for 12 years and can expect to be divorced in the near future.  I have no need for divorce as I am a practising Catholic but I am sure the courts will grant a divorce to my husband who is in another relationship and has two children in that relationship.  This will put me in the position where my private life is outside the ethos of the Catholic Church, and will give a legal right, which may or may not be used, to those in authority to remove me from my employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is shaking his head.  As a distinguished practitioner of the law I am sure he knows what he is talking about.  However, this shows the level of concern of which one must be aware.  In an interesting letter, a member of the Church of Ireland, who is also a teacher, is happy with section 37(1)(a) because it gives the person a favourable position in terms of employment. However, the letter goes on to state:</P>
    <P>However, section 37(1)(b) gives rise to much concern and worry.  Who is to say what is &ldquo;reasonably necessary&rdquo; etc.?  [I have addressed this in one of my amendments] I believe a teacher's private life should be exactly that &mdash; private.  Section 37(1)(b) should be removed completely.</P>
    <P>This is probably politically unrealistic and for that reason I have suggested an amendment.  A letter signed by a group of people states:</P>
    <P>Equally disquieting to us is the exemption clause in the Employment Equality Bill.  It is our opinion that this clause erodes our civil rights as citizens of this Republic and we question its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>For various reasons, and having been supplied with excellent briefing material, I believe that last point is accurate.  There may be a question regarding the constitutionality of the Bill because of section 37(1).  There is no definition of &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; However, in a document entitled <i>Governance of Schools</i>, there is an attempt at a definition which apparently has been agreed between the Minister and the bishops.  The term &ldquo;denominational ethos&rdquo; is defined as being &ldquo;in accordance with the doctrines, moral teachings, traditions, practise and customs of the Church as defined by the <Col N="320" /> Church from time to time&rdquo;.  In one case, that of the Roman Catholic schools, the ethos is extended to more than compliance with denominational and ethical behaviour, where its states: &ldquo;The Catholic school promotes the formation of the pupil's in the Catholic faith&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There are a number of grounds under which the constitutionality of the Bill might be impugned.  For example, section 37 might be held to be repugnant to Article 44 in that it purports to recognise, in a novel way in law, different religious denominations.  The people by referendum removed the assertion of religious difference and superiority which recognised the special place of the Roman Catholic Church under the Constitution.  Second, it permits discrimination on the grounds of religion.  This affects up to 10 per cent of the people, which is illegal under article 44.2.1º and 3º of the Constitution, which states:</P>
    <P>1º Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
    <P>3º The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>The capacity to discriminate seems to be given to the churches under section 37 of the Bill and there seems to be a severe disability on potential employees who may be denied employment, or removed from employment, if their life is perceived as being in conflict with the ethos of the school.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that the ethos should not be undermined by the teaching methods or example of the teacher but the life of a teacher outside teaching hours should be, regarded as completely private and respected as such.  It is also questionable whether, by the operation of this exclusion, the State is, in effect, endowing particular religions by making moneys available to them in circumstances where they may be discriminating against persons.</P>
    <P>This Bill also seems to be in conflict with the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Part II, Article 2, enjoins each party to respect and ensure to all individuals the rights recognised in the present Covenant. without distinction of any kind, such as race colour, sex, language, etc.</P>
    <P>Another international ruling of particular significance is the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.  That was so actively promoted by the Irish delegation that it became known as the &ldquo;Irish Declaration&rdquo;. Article 2 states:</P>
    <P>No one shall be subject to discrimination by any State, institution, group of persons or person on the grounds of religion or belief.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> I will deal with this more extensively when the amendments are discussed.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Gallagher on the membership of a trade union.  I was contacted by a person who lost his job after his company was taken over because he was engaged in trade union activities.  He was compensated in a resulting court case but that is evidence that the Minister should include membership of a trade union as one of the grounds for protection of individuals.</P>
    <P>On the question of disability, an exclusively medical model of disability is used in the legislation and there is also an absence of any provision for an appropriate environment within which disabled people can be employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister, Deputy Taylor, has been replaced by the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald; I would like to acknowledge his distinguished public service and the debt the country owes him.  He has brought in much progressive legislation, for which he is to be thanked.  I wish him well in his retirement and perhaps now that he is less restrained he may accommodate amendments he would not otherwise have been able to accept.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this Bill.  It is welcome and necessary but it is also complex.  There is other legislation, going back to the 1977 Act, and perhaps it could all have been consolidated. However it is essential that minorities or those who are vulnerable should not be discriminated against, and should be inserted in law.  However, we may face the same problem with this legislation as we had with the Freedom of Information Bill, with which the Minister of State is familiar. It takes a lot to change a culture and while we rightly introduce provisions in law, there are parts of our society which will have difficulty in coming to terms with a law we hope will be implemented.</P>
      <P>The example that springs most readily to mind is that of Northern Ireland, where vigorous attempts have been made to ensure there is no discrimination on religious or political grounds. One wonders how successful they have been as it seems those who want to circumvent the law can readily do so.  Even those cases brought to court have not always been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill outlaws direct and indirect discrimination at work and in employment conditions on the grounds of gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community, which I welcome.  Amendments made in the Dáil improved the Bill, and further improvements could be made on Committee Stage here. Because the Bill tries to encompass everything, it may fall between several stools and disappoint some.  Reference has been made to the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the fact that parts of that Bill have been repealed or incorporated <Col N="322" /> in the current legislation.  Perhaps the Equal Status Bill will deal with other aspects of that but there is an argument to be made for consolidating this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of disability, which we will have to try to resolve on Committee Stage.  The general consensus of those involved in this area is that the definition of disability in the Bill is far too medical and there are alternative definitions which might be more appropriate.  I have received correspondence from KARE, the County Kildare Association of Parents and Friends of Handicapped People.  It states:</P>
    <P>It is my opinion and indeed the opinion of everybody I have spoken to within the disability movement, as well as that of the employer group IBEC and Congress that this definition is totally unsuitable and unworkable particularly in an employment setting.  I am particularly anxious that the definition used would be amended to a more functional definition of disability, and I am aware that a proposed alternative was sent to the Department which had the backing of Congress and IBEC.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned should this Bill be passed, with this medical definition of disability, it is likely to be used in further legislation that has been promised, and the overall situation would be disastrous in my opinion.</P>
    <P>Alternative definitions have been offered, such as:</P>
    <P>A person with a disability means an individual whose prospects of securing, retaining and advancing in employment are substantially reduced as a result of a duly recognised physical, sensory, psychological or mental impairment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That definition is taken from the ILO Convention No. 159 Vocational Rehabilitation &amp; Employment (Disabled Persons) 1983, which was ratified by the Government in 1996.</P>
    <P>There are two other possible definitions of which I am sure the Department is aware.  They are similar in tone and outline the view of experts in physical and mental disability that it is essential the definition is flexible enough to encompass the people within their care and with whom they work on a daily basis.  This issue will have to be examined very seriously on Committee Stage.  It is incumbent upon the State to ensure nothing discriminates against people who are vulnerable because of disability.  I do not believe this is the intention of the State or the Minister but it is incumbent upon us to produce a formula of words which deals with the particular and reasonable concerns raised.  The Bill has already been amended in the area of sexual orientation and under section 35 on the issue of reasonable accommodation which was of concern to those dealing with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> The Minister said discrimination is not a theoretical problem but that it is an unacceptable reality for too many people.  I agree.  He then mentioned discrimination on age grounds.  There is an increasing tendency to discriminate on the age grounds.  In my local authority people presenting themselves for certain jobs find that the age limits are quite low.  There are people who wish to retire early, and that is desirable if it is their wish.  However, there is no reason people who wish to be employed, and who are capable and physically able to be employed, should be discriminated against on the grounds of age. There are many precedents in industry to show that octogenarians can run companies very successfully. Talent and wisdom should be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised an important issue regarding discrimination on the grounds of political opinion or affiliation to a trade union.  This is covered by the 1977 legislation and I have personal grounds for knowing that.  When I was nominated to this House I had reason to consult the legislation.  Affiliation to a political party or trade union is not grounds for dismissal.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify this.  It is very important for democracy and our democratic institutions that people who have a particular political opinion or who are members of trade unions or other vocational or voluntary bodies should not be discriminated against.  Vigorous and open debate without anybody feeling intimidated is a healthy aspect of our democracy.</P>
    <P>Several Senators raised the issue of women in the workforce.  We all accept the fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work and that there should be no grounds for complaint in that area.  Women must not be excluded from the workforce.  On several occasions in the past some Senators have expressed the view that women's place is in the home.  I reject that view.  If people choose to remain in the home their choice should be facilitated.  However, if they choose to work in industry or services they should be able to do that.</P>
    <P>Discrimination can be very subtle.  It is difficult to conceal one's gender when going for interview. The person may not be asked whether they are married or single or of a particular religious persuasion or what their gender is, but the latter is self-evident.  It is easy to make decisions on the basis of what employers see before them.  It is a difficult area to legislate for and there is only so much that can be done.  However, if women want to enter the workforce they should be facilitated in doing so.  They should not be trapped in low paid employment as many of them are.</P>
    <P>Section 16(4) says: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as requiring an employer to recruit, retain in employment or promote an individual if the employer is aware, on the basis of a criminal conviction of the individual or other reliable <Col N="324" /> information, that the individual engages, or has a propensity to engage, in any form of sexual behaviour which is unlawful.&rdquo; What does &ldquo;other reliable information&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean that on the basis of some informant certain action can be taken?  I take exception to these words: it seems to be part of an informer's culture.  If people are convicted they should be dealt with.  I realise the absolute necessity of protecting children from paedophiles and people from sexual harassment.  However, more than hearsay is necessary.  Very strong evidence should be required which may not necessarily be a court conviction.  Busybodies cannot be allowed to ruin somebody's reputation and this phraseology might allow for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh said that section 23 was a step backwards from the trend in Irish jurisprudence. She is correct.  I am unsure how it should be phrased but we can examine that on Committee Stage.  Is the section in breach of the 1996 EU Directive?  Could it deter complainants from taking cases?  This would be highly undersirable.  The Bill needs improvement and we can amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 37 is one of the most contentious sections.  Legislation does not always have the expected effect.  There could be problems with this section.  Religious orders or minority religions operating schools or hospitals are entitled to have that poorly defined word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; reflected in the way their institutions are run.  There are implications for minorities and the majority religion here.  Some of the most distinguished second level schools are run by minority religions.  They should not be forced into employing people who do not reflect their ethos.  It is a sensitive and difficult area and the rights of individuals have to be safeguarded.  However, given the quality of education which some of these institutions provide, they have reasonable grounds for being concerned. I realise an amendment was made on Committee Stage in the Dáil and that we are close to reaching a consensus on the matter.</P>
    <P>We must reconcile two positions which were presented to me by people who wrote to me from a school in County Kildare.  They sought my support in amending the Bill when it was before the Dáil and said that while recognising the obligations of teachers in their daily school activities to support and not undermine the school ethos, we must recognise their entitlement to the same legislative protection against discrimination which the State provides for other workers.  I do not see an inconsistency between the two positions which can be readily reconciled.</P>
    <P>We had a lengthy debate in the House on the ethos of the Adelaide Hospital and how it would be protected in the transfer to Tallaght.  It is important that such an ethos is protected and perpetuated because it is a valuable part of our society.  In the case of minorities, in particular, it would be wrong if they were not able to survive, <Col N="325" /> flourish and maintain their ethos in circumstances where the majority of the population may reflect a different, although not markedly different, ethos.  There are different shades of ethos between the various religious denominations who all make a unique contribution.  Those matters may be reconciled on Committee Stage when we will seek to improve the Bill further.  While it has been improved by the Dáil, there is some way to go.  It is not the intention of the Progressive Democrats to oppose Second Stage.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I very much welcome this Bill.  Employment equality is the right of all and legislating for it is welcome.  I am glad the Minister said targets should be set by public bodies and private companies.  Without targets, it is difficult to know what difference, if any, the legislation has made.  Introducing legislation is one thing but changing people's circumstances is quite another.  If we are to properly monitor the legislation, it is essential that resources are provided and I hope the Employment Equality Agency will have sufficient resources to monitor the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important that those with disability have sufficient resources to highlight cases in which they believe they may have problems.  A number of members of the forum for people with disability have contacted me to say this is an area which worries them and have indicated that they will need resources to vindicate their rights.  I hope the Minister will provide sufficient resources to ensure the implementation of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Most of the important points have been covered.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights commissioned research on women in management in local administration and barriers to the participation of women in business and business creation.  That research was worthwhile because without factual information it is impossible to know from what base we are starting.  I compliment Deputy Mary Wallace, the chairman of the committee, and Deputy Theresa Ahearn, the previous chairman, on the forceful way in which they have looked at these areas and for ensuring good research was carried out so that we have factual information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rightly pointed out that previous legislation has helped women as regards employment. However, we must look at how far women have progressed in employment.  The research to which I alluded makes depressing reading.  Other Ministers have given factual information showing how women are not progressing into managerial positions in local administration, as one would expect, or doing as well as one would hope in employment in the public or private sectors.  Even in self-employment in the private sector, the majority of those who are employers are men and the majority of employees are women.  Women who start up businesses do not make a great <Col N="326" /> impact on the number of self-employed.  It is important to point out that women earn only 70 per cent of the average wage earned by men.  It is marginally worse than it was 20 years ago when the marriage bar was lifted and women were able to make a more positive contribution and avail of opportunities in the workforce.</P>
    <P>Areas mentioned where women have failed to make advances include the interview board.  It is a least 25 years since I was a member of the Irish Medical Organisation and promoted the idea of the need for women on interview boards where men and women were being interviewed.  Even from a psychological point of view, a man would think it extraordinary if he was interviewed by an entirely female board.  We must consider how women feel when they are interviewed by an entirely male board, which still happens in many interviews.  There has been some improvement over the years in women gaining promotion in the field of medicine.  Recent research by Dr. Fiona Bradley shows that the improvement is not that great.  Despite the fact that over 60 per cent of those entering medical schools are women and about 70 per cent of the top 10 per cent who qualify are women, there is still a tremendous under-representation of women at consultant level and as senior partners in general practice.  One can see the drop off over the years from intern level, where numbers are the same, to senior house officer level, where the decrease begins, to registration level, where the number of women is low, to consultant level where 15 per cent are women. The first woman consultant was appointed to the Rotunda Hospital, a maternity hospital, after 250 years in existence.  That was a momentous occasion for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have to; I would not like to take bets on it.  When we look at the changes in legislation on employment, we must also look at employment practices.  Anyone who rejoiced in the fact that the junior doctors accepted the deal offered to them by the Minister for Health must realise how desperate they were.  Junior doctors are to be rostered for a 65 hour week rather than 75 or 80 hours, which they work.  Some doctors were working 104 hours per week.  As we know, this is contrary to health and welfare legislation. While this is bad for doctors, what about the patients?  Junior doctors have also gratefully accepted the promise that they will not be rostered for more than 72 hours continuous duty which could be from 9 a.m. on Monday to 9 a.m. on Thursday.  We must pity the patients, whatever about the doctor who treats them late on Wednesday night or in the early hours of Thursday morning because most accidents at work happen when people are tired.  While welcoming the <Col N="327" /> legislation we should hope for some improvement in work practices.</P>
      <P>There is a definite emphasis in the contributions on women being able to work in order to fulfil their potential.  I am all in favour of that but the vast majority of women work for economic reasons &mdash; they badly need the money.  Many are still consigned to lower paid jobs.  I once read a fascinating report which stated that women were good at boring, repetitive work; perhaps they were good at it because they had to be.  Women are working in greater numbers not because of the increase in single parent families.  Many families are grateful that one parent can get work, others have decided that, in order to manage, both parents must work outside the home for a certain part of their lives.  We must recognise that although most people who are desirous of working are enthusiastic about fulfilling their potential, they also need the money.</P>
      <P>Working hours are now more flexible, which is helpful, but Senator Gallagher is right to stress the need for better child care.  We must also remember that many people who leave employment do so for elder care purposes.  I hope this Bill will help those who left work for a few months to look after an aged parent who could no longer manage but eventually stayed out of the workforce for up to ten years.  The ban on age discrimination will make it easier for them to re-enter the workforce.  Some people in their forties have to leave their job to mind an elderly relative because it is so difficult to get elder care, then they must try to re-enter the workforce in their fifties.  I hope this legislation helps those people because they give up their jobs for the most altruistic of reasons and we pay little regard to bringing them back into the workforce.  This is a welcome provision.</P>
      <P>As regards positive action and quotas, the Minister, this Government and its predecessor tried to ensure more women were involved in our decision making process by encouraging their election or appointment to boards.  It is extraordinary that 50 per cent of the country takes all the decisions, so I welcome what the Minister has aspired to in various legislation he has introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He rightly referred to the importance of European case law to our legislation.  Last year our Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, had to clarify the Kalanke ruling which caused some consternation and uncertainty as to the legitimacy of quotas and other forms of positive discrimination to promote the number of women in certain sections and levels of employment.  Follwing the European Court of Justice's ruling on the legality of the quota law in Bremen, it appeared that positive discrimination had to be regarded in a negative manner.  However, it was made clear that article 2 of Directive 76/207/EEC does not cover the type of quota system where women are automatically <Col N="328" /> given preference over men in the assignment of posts or in promotion &mdash; it is possible to discriminate positively but it must not be automatically assumed that a women will definitely be promoted in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Members of the women's rights committee of the European Parliament had differing views of the amendment proposed by the Commissioner. Some favoured it, others criticised it, but they recognised that unless there was an amendment many more men might take cases.  They felt that the European Court of Justice had failed to take the opportunity to promote gender quotas and it would have been possible to make them seem more acceptable.  One member of the committee, a Spanish legal expert, said it was a complex problem and the court should have considered it in greater depth.  We must recognise that all these areas have an international dimension and it is not only our domestic problems which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I had better refer to the notorious section 37. The Minister kindly met me along with some of my constituents so he knows it is not only members of the Roman Catholic community who are concerned about this legislation.  There is a difficult management/employee divide on the issue.  Senator Norris read into the record letters he had received and I have also received letters which caused me great concern.  People at local level are worried that this may be applied in an individual manner.  I am sure the Minister does not envisage that and I realise the difficulties he has had in shaping this part of the legislation.</P>
    <P>While the Constitution states that the parents are the primary educators of children, the State has given enormous power to those who run our schools.  A recent court case involved a mildly mentally handicapped boy in Cork who had behavioural problems.  He was refused admission to the only three suitable schools in Cork but the State was not in a position to decree that he be admitted to one of them.  The management of schools are in an incredibly powerful position so legislation which gives them greater power must be carefully examined.  I am sure the Minister has looked at this point but it is of great concern to many people employed within the school system.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that I have not been contacted by nurses about this point but that may be because they were anxious about their current dispute with the Minister for Health.  Nurses, especially those in training, may be in an even more vulnerable position that people in the school system.</P>
    <P>I was upset by a person in school management who told me that Northern Ireland's employment equality legislation does not apply to schools.  In view of the sectarianism in Northern Ireland which is so evident at present, it would be a great pity if we followed such legislation.  The further we steer clear from such measures the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> I am concerned by the letters I received &mdash; I will not divulge what was in them because they are in a similar vein to those quoted by Senator Norris.  Before the State was established, great care was taken about legislative provisions on religious discrimination.  For example, section 3 of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, forbade such discrimination completely.  Other Senators said there may be constitutional problems in this regard.  However, the President is a constitutional lawyer so we can rest assured that if she feels the provision should be referred to the Supreme Court, it will be.  Not having a constitutional legal background, I cannot comment.</P>
    <P>There also may be a problem regarding our international obligations.  The 1984 Irish declaration in the UN Convention, which was about freedom of religion, stated that any imbalance in employment regarding one's religion was to be considered intolerable.  It is odd then that we should be in any way countenancing it here.  I recognise the difficulties the Minister has had and I hope that some of them can be examined.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Lydon was jumping the gun slightly in his comments regarding clubs; I think that area is covered by the Equal Status Bill. While I welcome the fact that the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club now admits women as members, I never applied myself.  While I would not have formerly been in a position to apply on the grounds of gender, it is after all supposed to be a sporting club.  There did not seem to be any sporting criteria applied &mdash; for example, did one have to jump three feet or some such to qualify for membership?  Naturally, with my sporting background I feel there should have been some test of ability; so while I welcome the fact that they no longer discriminate on the grounds of gender, I think they should adopt some kind of criteria to assess sporting ability.  For example, they might require that somebody should be able to serve overarm as well as underarm or something to that effect.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and I regret very much the fact that he is going to retire from active politics.  However, in view of the contribution that he and his wife have made to politics in Ireland and to the Labour Party in particular, I think they are entitled to a rest.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes paid to Minister Taylor and I join in extending good wishes to him.  I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate on this important Bill.  Like all of the previous speakers, I support the principle objectives of the Bill which are to promote equality among employed persons and to outlaw all forms of discrimination in employment.  The Bill also prohibits harasment based on discrimination. This is to be welcomed as is the fact that the provisions of the Bill apply to both public and private sector employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> Gradually, over a number of years, many forms of direct discrimination in employment have disappeared or have been eliminated.  The same cannot be said to be the case as far as indirect discrimination is concerned.  Indirect discrimination is more difficult to eradicate because it is more difficult to substantiate.  Only time will tell whether the provisions of this Bill are sufficiently strong to eradicate even the most subtle forms of indirect discrimination.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was first published, the wording of section 37 became the main focus of attention. The original wording of 37(1) gave rise to considerable controversy and was strongly opposed, particularly by the various teacher unions.  The amended wording would appear to meet in a reasonable manner the concerns which were expressed by the various interested parties. However, I would like to be reassured in relation to the fears expressed by Senator O'Toole and others during the course of their Second Stage contributions and I look forward to these areas being explored in considerable detail on Committee Stage.  In many respects this is a very technical and complex Bill, but its general thrust is very much to be welcomed.  I am satisfied that in the years ahead many individuals will benefit from the provisions of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Minister Taylor on making the brave decision to retire.  I know he did not make it lightly, nor was it an easy decision considering the number of years he spent in politics. In the past, there was a tradition to erect statues to those who had served their country well.  I think the memorial that has been erected to Minister Taylor is the body of legislation he has managed to put through during his years in Government. He will look back on that, as the nation will, with greater satisfaction than any statue could give.</P>
      <P>I am going to concentrate on one particular aspect of this Bill, and that is prospective employees.  I welcome the legislation and the intention behind it.  It was almost this week four years ago when I had an amendment accepted on the Unfair Dismissal Bill about the concept of age.  I was pleased about that because the issue of age had not been considered before then.  I use the example to give an idea where I am coming from.  I believe we have to be fair and we must ensure that we do not discriminate against anyone. We have to assure our citizens that this is a nation that takes things like age into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I met an Irishman who is on the board of a company in America.  He said that at a meeting of the board somebody came up with an enterpreneurial idea.  He was delighted somebody gave the individual the freedom to employ 37 people to see if they could make the idea work. This gentleman could not believe the ease with which a board was willing to say: &ldquo;Let us have a go, let us open a new enterprise and employ 37 <Col N="331" /> people, hopefully it will work but if it does not, we have at least tried but if it does work it may be very successful.&rdquo; That attitude would be unthinkable in Irish terms; to think of recruiting 37 additional people would be such a huge decision that it would require months of consideration. My concern about the legislation we are enacting is that we are making it less attractive and more difficult for prospective employers to risk employing new people and each step we take, even with the most worthy motives, is making it less attractive.</P>
    <P>Over the last four years the US economy has generated more jobs and more enterprises than ever before, most of which are in small businesses whereas European employment is stagnating.  I worry that there is no balance and the reason employment in Europe &mdash; thankfully I am not talking about Ireland here &mdash; is stagnating may be due to the fact that we have been introducing so much legislation that it is becoming less and less attractive for smaller businesses, in particular, to take on new people.</P>
    <P>I own a reasonably large business and if we are going to take a decision to employ somebody, we have sufficient help and backup to do that. However, if you consider a one, two or three-person business which may be considering recruiting an additional person, they may proceed to interview somebody but if they do not have all their &ldquo;i's&rdquo; dotted and &ldquo;t's&rdquo; crossed they may make an error somewhere and it may be very tempting not to take the chance.</P>
    <P>I believe the jobs in the future will be created by thousands of small businesses as has happened in the United States.  The businesses employing fewer than ten people are the ones which are expanding and generating jobs.  I think there is a danger that we, in Ireland, are becoming legislatively inflexible for the most worthy reasons.  My concern is not about this legislation or those people currently in employment; I am worried about the prospective employee.  If somebody comes to an interview for a job in a small business the interviewer must be very careful.  If they put a foot wrong they could end up in court.  It is almost easier not to take somebody on.</P>
    <P>If I may give an example of somebody I know who was going for promotion.  Food safety is becoming very important as are standards of hygiene in food industry employees.  In America, for instance, you cannot work behind a meat counter, understandably, if you have a moustache or a beard.  A number of supermarket companies in America make it a condition of employment that prospective employees must not have any facial hair.  In one recent instance in Ireland an employee seeking promotion was asked if he was willing to remove his beard.  He did not get the job and later made a claim to a rights commissioner who found in his favour because the question of removing a beard could not have <Col N="332" /> been asked of a female.  While I am not trying to make a case of it, I am highlighting the difficult details which concern small employers who are thinking of expanding.  If such an employer decides to interview somebody for a job his lawyer may tell him to be very careful of every question he asks.  For instance, the lawyer might advise him not to ask a prospective employee if he is willing to remove a beard or moustache because he could find himself being sued if the person was not offered the job.</P>
    <P>No one will oppose the basis of this legislation and, in principle, there is no disagreement with it. However, I am concerned about the words &ldquo;prospective employee&rdquo;.  If an employer was going to interview someone for a job I am not sure the solution in this legislation will make it attractive enough to encourage an employer to take someone on.</P>
    <P>We will discuss section 37 again on Committee Stage.  I know we are talking about religious institutions, but the original wording was &ldquo;discrimination that is essential for the maintenance of the religious institution&rdquo;.  That has been changed and section 37(1)(b) now states:</P>
    <P>It takes action which is reasonable necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.</P>
    <P>I can understand the reason for the change but the term &ldquo;prospective employee&rdquo; makes it almost impossible.  How could a religious institution that wishes to protect its very ethos expect a prospective employee to undermine the religious ethos? I can understand how an employee could undermine the religious ethos but how could a prospective employer know or be able to estimate that a prospective employee would do so?</P>
    <P>I fear that the very steps that are being taken on Committee Stage in the Lower House have actually damaged the objective of the Bill.  I wonder to what extent we should take this into account when we come to consider that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned discrimination against women.  I wish to raise this point as I am a member of the board of Hume Street Hospital, which was established by charter of the King in 1916.  The hospital's charter states that of the 24 members of the board, 12 should be gentlemen drawn from the Catholic faith and 12 should be gentlemen from non-Catholic faiths.  That continued until recent years when the hospital sought to remove the word &ldquo;gentlemen&rdquo; from the charter. Originally it was thought that a Bill would have to be passed to change the charter but I understand the Department of Health has said it is possible to change the charter without such action.  They have been delayed in doing so for two years because the Department of Health argued that rather than just make one change, it would like to go through the whole charter to see <Col N="333" /> if anything else should be changed.  However, the Department does not have the manpower to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry will be pleased to know that Hume Street Hospital has a female chief executive, medical director and matron, as well as 24 male board members.  I use this opportunity to stir the Department into making the change requested by the board so that the hospital can be seen not to discriminate on those grounds.</P>
    <P>I have one more concern, which is the onus of proof.  I am not quite sure I understand from the legislation how the onus of proof occurs.  Let us say that two people go for a job which is given to candidate A rather than candidate B. Candidate B is upset and concerned.  He or she believes they have been discriminated against.  As regards the action that is taken at this stage, will the Minister explain whether the onus of proof is on the prospective employee who has been turned down? Or can the prospective employee say, &ldquo;I believe I have been discriminated against and the onus of proof is on the employer&rdquo;?  Perhaps the Minister could answer that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on taking the legislation through the House.  I encourage him to finish the task in the time he has left.  In doing so, he should take into account the wider and broader implications of each piece of legislation, particularly the one that makes it less attractive for potential employers to take on new employees.  If job creation is one of our challenges and targets, let us make sure we do not damage it while trying to achieve equality and an absence of discrimination in our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Lee</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally welcome the Bill which is going in the right direction.  On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will be responsive to amendments, not least to section 37 which has aroused so much misgiving in so many respects, even though it strives to respond in a constructive and compromising manner with the variety of concerns expressed.  I can imagine, however, that on Committee Stage there will be a protracted discussion on that section as well as on some others.  I hope to contribute to the discussion myself.</P>
      <P>In terms of the cohesion of this society it is important that the citizenry should feel the legislation is fair.  A sense of fairness is crucial to the co-operation by citizens in implementing legislation and in not feeling that they are somehow discriminated against, and that it is not begrudging legislation that may seem to favour others at their expense.  The balance between going in a desired direction and ensuring that there is a feeling in the citizenry at large that this legislation is fair is an important one to achieve.  The Minister has gone a long way towards achieving that in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the potential inhibiting effects of aspects of this legislation on <Col N="334" /> job creation.  Anything which inhibits job creation should be looked at very carefully from that perspective. Just as all legislation should be gender proofed, it should also be employment proofed and proofed against the criteria of what constitutes a successful and effective society.</P>
    <P>The Minister was careful in his phraseology in comparing the United States with Europe and the different track records in job creation as they appear in general statistics. The Minister said it may be a factor. It still seems to me, despite the claims made &mdash; far more stridently than Senator Quinn has made them &mdash; by a number of people in this regard, that the complexity of the employment creation situations in America and Europe is such that it is very difficult to know what weight one should give to the different factors.  While this is a nuisance factor, it is not one of the key factors &mdash; people I respect will disagree with me on this &mdash; in Europe's inferior record of job creation compared with the United States over the past 30 years.  There are so many other variables involved one might be in danger of exaggerating the impact of this variable if one were to linger unduly on it.  However, it deserves to be examined thoroughly on Committee Stage to find out what the best of our collective thinking on the matter might be.  I do not regard it as a crucial factor in the problem of job creation on this side of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill and I hope on Committee Stage we will have a constructive debate and a responsive Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the contribution the Minister has made to this country, the Oireachtas and to legislation which will remain on the Statute Book long after he has retired.</P>
      <P>This is a welcome but complex Bill.  I wish to mention one issue which might be covered by the Bill but whose importance was brought home to me as I listened to a radio programme a few days ago.  On that programme a lady described how her daughter had applied for a job.  Her application was not even acknowledged because, the lady believed, of the area of Dublin in which they lived.  She applied for another job but used the lady's son's address instead.  Not only was the girl called for an interview but she succeeded in getting the job.  The lady maintained that this geographical discrimination was widespread.  If a person is from a certain location they might be discriminated against in seeking a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought such discrimination had ceased years ago.  Towns in most parts of Ireland had poor and better off sections and the people living in the poor sections gradually became better off.  That cycle continues to this day.  Perhaps the Minister might look at this issue and deal with it by amendment to the Bill.  This discrimination has become more pronounced, as is obvious from the amount of coverage it receives on radio programmes. <Col N="335" /> I asked a number of people about it and they said it is widespread in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope to make further contributions on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  I also wish to express my appreciation and my wife's for their kind remarks.  I greatly valued the help I received in both Houses over many years and the friendships I have made on all sides.</P>
      <P>The vision of this and the previous Government has been the impetus for the development of this Bill.  It will provide protection from discrimination on a wide range of grounds.  In bringing forward this legislation it was necessary to address complex legal, social and economic considerations. In doing so the Government has adopted a sophisticated rights based model which has been tried and tested in the gender area over the last 23 years both in Ireland and Europe.</P>
      <P>The legislation covers a number of specified grounds, none of which, except the gender ground, has been covered before in Irish legislation. Senator Fitzgerald is right.  One could without difficulty add a further half dozen grounds or more.  One or two, such as trade union membership, political affiliation and one's address, were mentioned in the course of the debate.  However, let us make haste slowly.  This is a ground breaking measure.  It introduces eight new grounds for discrimination and that is a historic step forward.  I do not deny there is validity in including additional grounds and perhaps at a later date they will be included.  For the moment, however, we should apply ourselves to what we have.  The Bill covers a wide spectrum of bases for discrimination.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made an interesting point.  He said we should not do anything that would adversely affect employment prospects.  We all understand and agree with that statement.  One could envisage legislation that would be counter-productive in recruiting new people to employment. However, this legislation does not fall into that category.  It must be remembered that the kernel of this Bill is that a person should not be discriminated against on the grounds alone of, for example, being black.  If anything, this measure encourages good business and good productivity because it puts the emphasis when recruiting people to employment on not only a rights based anti-discrimination basis but on a good business basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill a person who is recruited into employment should be recruited on merit and not on whether their skin happens to be white or black, which by no means indicates the standard of what their work or contribution to the firm will be.  We are saying that criteria which are irrelevant to the job, such as the colour of the person's <Col N="336" /> skin or their religion, must not be taken into account.  Their merit for the job is a different matter. That is not dealt with in the legislation.  I was careful to provide in section 16 that before a person is entitled to be considered for employment, they must be capable of doing the job in the best possible manner.  We are not talking about merit; we are talking about not discriminating against a person on the ground alone of their physical characteristics or the way they were born, a matter over which none of us has control.</P>
    <P>The question of discrimination against a person on a health ground or on whether, for example, they have a beard is not covered by this legislation. That is a valid discrimination if there is a health problem or if another position arises as a result of the person's condition.  The legislation does not and is not intended to cover such a situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the onus of proof. The onus of proof, as always, will rest on the applicant.  An applicant who brings a claim before the equality officer would have to establish their claim and there is no proposal in the Bill to reverse that position.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the complexity of redress procedures.  He referred to use of the Circuit Court and made reference to the High Court. A careful study of the Bill will show that the emphasis has been to keep the redress procedures informal and fair.  As I indicated earlier, the redress procedure in this Bill is, in general, simple, informal and straightforward.  The claimant goes for redress in the first instance to the Director, has a right of appeal to the Labour Court and that court's decision is final.  However, in accordance with widespread practice, there is a right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law, which is the usual case stated procedure of almost universal application.  These procedures are not new and are fully in line with those laid down in the 1974 and 1977 Acts, which have worked well over the years.  There are no broad exceptions except the role of the Labour Court in dismissal cases which is in line with existing practice in equality law.  The legislation also maintains the treatment of dismissal cases under equality law in parallel with the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993.</P>
    <P>In providing redress at first instance to the Circuit Court in gender equality cases, I have been at pains to have regard to the points made by Senator O'Toole.  I took the course set down in the Bill on this point only after exhaustive consideration of all the options.  In any event, the only viable and legally acceptable approach involved the Circuit Court at first instance.  I emphasise to Senator O'Toole that the Circuit Court option in a gender case is an alternative to the general redress procedures provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise that the need for a means of redress which could allow for the making of an <Col N="337" /> award without a ceiling arises directly from our obligation to comply with the requirements of the European Court of Justice case law, in particular the Marshall case.  This case, which is the European law decision which binds us, provides that the tribunal hearing one of these cases must have the potential jurisdiction to give an unlimited award.  Our constitutional constraints, however, are such that it is not possible to give jurisdiction to a tribunal, such as an equality officer or the Labour Court, which could potentially give an unlimited award.  They require that only a court of justice established under the Constitution may do that.  There was no choice open to me in the gender context but to give a court jurisdiction and I did that by nominating the Circuit Court and giving it the potential to make an unlimited award, not because I wanted to, but because there was no choice following on the European Court of Justice decision in the Marshall case.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked for an explanation as to why confidential information could not be accessed under the Bill in the section dealing with the provision of information.  When this legislation was being prepared, strong representations were made to me that there was considerable scope for abuse of a provision which would allow unqualified access to confidential information about other individuals.  While there is some limitation of access to confidential information under the Bill for claimants or potential claimants, there is no such limitation when it comes to the right of the Director of Equality Investigations hearing a case.  Accordingly, all information can be taken into account when a decision is being made by the Director.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher and other Senators raised concerns to the effect that the definition of disability might not be broad enough to include some specific disability.  This is the first time this concern has been raised.  Other concerns about this definition have been that it does not focus on more recognisable disabilities.  I assure Senator Gallagher that the definition has been drafted to ensure the widest possible cover.  Too general a definition would leave it open to employers to contest that a person did not have a specific disability.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear comments from Senator Quinn and Senator Lydon on the question of the age discrimination provisions.  The rationale for the age limit of 65 is related to a number of concerns.  It is a common age for retirement on a compulsory basis in many employments.  With unemployment high, albeit reducing, I was concerned to ensure that this Bill had no unforeseen impact on the labour market by reversing existing normal retirement trends. This legislation is new and ground breaking.  In time, the issues raised by Senator Lydon and others will get more recognition.  As we move into <Col N="338" /> the next millennium, the population trends in Europe may force a change in attitudes and work practices in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I refer Senator Henry, Senator Norris, Senator O'Toole and Senator Lydon to section 37(1).  The text of this provision is the culmination of a long process of consultation which I undertook with a wide variety of interests as well as extensive deliberations with colleagues and the Attorney General.  The section represents a reasonable and measured balance between very different views on a most complex and sensitive issue.  The provision benefits considerably from submissions made by various interests in this area and demonstrates the Government's commitment to protecting the legitimate interests of all concerned. Specifically, this provision benefits considerably from the constructive submissions made both by teachers and the churches.  It is not a victory for one side over the other but rather represents the Government's best effort to find the right, reasonable balance which protects the legitimate interests of both.  In so far as it gives discretion and flexibility to denominational bodies, it does so to support the development of greater pluralism in Irish society and to afford due respect for the rights of minorities in this State.  However, this discretion is made subject to certain clear criterial and to adjudication on a case by case basis by an independent Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Lydon for expressing a clear and experience-based view on section 37(1).  I note the points made by Senator O'Toole and Senator Norris.  I understand that Senator Norris is kindly providing some Committee Stage amendments well in advance and I will examine them very carefully as well as any proposals Senator O'Toole may bring forward on Committee Stage and I look forward to that debate with Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry expressed concern about funding for the new equality authority.  I assure the Senator that I am committed to an effective and functioning authority and a sign of this commitment is the additional resources I have secured for the new authority in successive Estimates. Additional funding of £586,000 has been made available in 1997 for the expanded remit.  This represents more than a doubling of the resources available for existing functions in 1997 and could not be equated with any attempt to marginalise the authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis is correct in stating that political opinion is an outlawed ground for dismissal in the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977-93.  I cannot claim that the list in the Bill is exhaustive but I can claim it makes great strides in providing protection for a large number of categories, most of which have had no protection heretofore.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their helpful contributions and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister every peace and happiness on his retirement.  It is a sad day for the Labour Party that he has taken this step but I understand his reasons.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this question which calls for a new fire station for Buncrana. The Department of the Environment inspected the fire station in Buncrana in 1988 and the report of the inspector stated that it was a disgrace. Nine years later nothing has been done to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, on funding a new fire station in Milford, County Donegal, in his allocations for 1996.  Money is being provided for this station in this year's Estimates.  However, the situation in Buncrana is completely inadequate.</P>
      <P>The existing fire station is too small for the 13 personnel who work there.  There is only one bay for a fire tender, the officers have to share one toilet, one wash basin and one shower.  A number of years ago Donegal County Council had to provide a temporary shed for a second tender.</P>
      <P>On a recent inspection of the fire station, I noticed that the floor is falling in, the windows are rotting and there is damp everywhere.  There are no canteen facilities for the staff and no facilities for cleaning the equipment &mdash; the personnel were washing the fire engine at the side of the street.  This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Buncrana has two Fruit of the Loom factories at Ballymacarry and Shore Road and the Clubman Omega shirt factory and these two industries employ thousands of workers.  One shudders to think what might happen if there was a major emergency with the present equipment and facilities.</P>
      <P>Buncrana fire station is ill-equipped to deal with a major emergency.  Luckily, it has been able to call on the fire service in Derry and I thank them for the help they have provided during major fires all over Donegal.</P>
      <P>The situation is serious for the area and the personnel employed at the station.  Will the Minister give priority to Buncrana fire station in the allocation of money this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal has three priorities in relation to the fire service.  First, Milford fire station which has now been allocated funding; second, the <Col N="340" /> Buncrana station and I compliment those who are working there under very poor conditions and third, the regional headquarters for the fire service proposed for Letterkenny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his kind personal remarks.</P>
      <P>The need for a new fire station in Buncrana is accepted by the Department of the Environment. Approval in principle was issued to Donegal County Council some years ago for a new station in the town.  The next stage in the provision of new fire stations requires the local authority to prepare and submit detailed drawings and cost plans to the Department.  Further progress cannot be made until these details are submitted by Donegal County Council.  It is only when proposals have progressed to tender stage that the question of a specific allocation of funds arises. Since the Buncrana project has not yet reached this stage, the question of funding does not yet arise.</P>
      <P>Since the early 1980s, successive Governments have shown a strong commitment to capital investment in the fire service.  Capital investment in the period 1981-97, inclusive, amounted to over £86 million and this has resulted in major improvements, such as new and improved fire stations, training facilities and modern mobilisation and communications systems.  Donegal County Council has benefited from this significant investment, receiving almost £2 million for capital investment over that period.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that this Government has been able to maintain capital allocations for the fire service's capital programme at a high level.  Over £14 million will be spent in the period 1995-97 compared with a total of £12 million in the period 1992-94.</P>
      <P>I can assure Senator Maloney that the Department and the Minister are fully aware of the current needs in Donegal.  In fact, the county council's tender recommendation for the construction of a new fire station in Milford has recently been approved and work should commence on this project shortly.  The Senator may be assured that when detailed plans are submitted by the local authority for the Buncrana station they will be carefully examined and a decision will be made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not always agreed with what the Minister said but I wish him a very happy, prosperous and peaceful retirement.  He has served this State selflessly and with a great deal of conviction.  Some of that may have been misguided but it was always genuine.  I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in the Oireachtas are not always aware of what is going on in local areas and the powerlessness felt by local people.  Wicklow County <Col N="341" /> Council has twice voted against the opening of a dump in the Ballinagran/Coolbeg area but that does not seem to make any difference.  If elected councillors had any say they could decide where a dump was placed.  Despite the fact that Wicklow County Council has twice expressed its clear wishes that this dump should not be put in the Ballinagran/Poolbeg area, it appears to have gone through all the statutory procedures.  It is now before the Minister with a firm proposal from the county council officials, despite the democratic wishes of the councillors that the dump should not be placed there.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is clear.  As regards dumps, halting sites and unpopular placing of people or artificial structures, it is almost inevitable that council officials go for the point of least resistance &mdash; the area with the smallest population because that is where they will get the least trouble.  They come to the conclusion that a dump or halting site should go where they will not have as many demonstrations as somewhere else.  Every week at Wicklow County Council there is a picket outside by those affected by the dump.  It is not a big picket.  It is a crowd of people committed to opposition to this dump because it threatens their livelihoods and families but above all an area which is one of the most beautiful in County Wicklow.  It is a beautiful agricultural valley.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that one can get an environmental impact statement to say what one wants, depending on the terms of reference which one gives it.  One can get an EIS to decide somewhere is the best location.  I am not suggesting that this has necessarily been done in this case. There are many other locations in County Wicklow which have not been properly considered.</P>
    <P>This decision has been reached with indecent haste.  I spoke to the county council today who told me that the dump in Avoca is virtually full up and so this one is more urgent.  That does not mean this is the right decision.  It means they need a dump badly.  The reality is that this is the wrong decision which has been reached in haste because they need somewhere for refuse.</P>
    <P>This EIS has been before the Minister for a long time.  My guess is that the Minister will not make a decision on this matter this side of the election.  He knows well that one makes popular decisions in election year and puts off unpopular ones.  Whatever Government comes into power &mdash; I hope, with the greatest respect, that the Minister's party is not in that Government &mdash; will then make a decision after it has been elected.  We are waiting for the off, and after the off a decision will be made on Ballinagran.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know we are talking about people's livelihoods, future, children and a beautiful part of County Wicklow.  This is not an issue on which politics should be played.  This EIS has been sitting in front of the Minister for months.  Yet he is unable to make a decision and is paralysed.  It must be the easiest decision in the <Col N="342" /> world.  The Minister for the Environment passes this location on his way home every week when he goes through Arklow on his way to Wexford. He could drop in and see how unsuitable the location is.</P>
    <P>We need a decision in the interests of the people who live in Ballinagran/Poolbeg, not a delay in the interests of the politicians in Leinster House.  That is cruel, unfair, merciless and highly political.  The size of this proposed dump astounds me.  It is not just a 50 acre dump in a verdant valley but 300 acres &mdash; a buffer zone of 250 acres and 50 acres of dump.  It is 300 acres of destruction.  It is no coincidence that those brave people who fought against this at local and national level and in the Supreme Court have spent a great deal of their valuable time in Brussels, lobbying MEPs and the Commission about the way the Irish Government is behaving in a political way when their livelihood and future is at stake.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Ross for his kind comments on my impending retirement.  If I need any reinforcement in my decision to retire, it arises from the thought that Senator Ross's father and I were students together in college many years ago.</P>
      <P>Wicklow County Council applied to the Minister for the Environment on 9 February 1996 for certification of a proposed landfill facility at Ballinagran/Coolbeg/Kilcandra.  The application was made under Part IX of the Local Government (Planning and Development ) Regulations, 1994, which deals with the environmental impact assessment of certain local authority projects.  The county council also gave notice of the proposal, as required, to prescribed bodies and to the public and invited submission or observation to be made to the Minister for the Environment by 26 April 1996.</P>
      <P>Following initial consideration of the application and the submission made by interested bodies, the Minister decided that further information should be sought from the county council. The council were therefore requested on 11th July 1996 to furnish further specified information in relation to the effects on the environment of the proposed development.  An additional request of this kind was made on 28 August 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, following receipt of information from Wicklow County Council on 16 August 1996 and on 10 September 1996, decided that the further information received contained significant additional data in relation to the effects on the environment of the proposed development. Accordingly, Wicklow County Council were required to engage in fresh consultation on this further information.  The period for making new submissions extended until 17 October, 1996.  In all, nearly 400 persons or bodies made valid submissions <Col N="343" /> to the Minister, at the initial or later stage, in relation to the proposed development.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the Minister must act quasi-judicially in determining an environmental impact assessment.  He is statutorily limited to considering the contents of the environmental impact statement and further information presented by the local authority, as well as submissions and observation made in due time.  The Minister has not yet completed his consideration of this case.  I assure the House that the application is receiving full attention and that an announcement will be made as soon as possible. It would not be appropriate to make any further comment at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> I would like to inform the House, however, of the intention very shortly to make regulations under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to commence the system of licensing by the Environmental Pollution Agency of major waste disposal activities, including landfill sites.  Licensing will ensure that high environmental standards are applied to the development, operation and aftercare of such facilities.  The licensing system will apply immediately to new facilities and will be extended on a phased basis to apply also to existing facilities.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 February 1997.</P>
