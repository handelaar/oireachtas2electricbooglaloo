      <P>I have received the following message from the President:</P>
      <P>I, Mary Robinson, President of Ireland, do hereby inform you that, after consultation with the Council of State, I have referred the Bill entitled Employment Equality Bill, 1996, to the Supreme Court, pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution, for a decision on the question as to whether the said Bill or any provision or provisions thereof is or are repugnant to the Constitution or to any provision thereof.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to provide a jetty at Hollymount Shore and Spencer Harbour, Lough Allen, County Leitrim, as the existing floating jetties prevent cruiser traffic from accessing onshore services, denying the local community an opportunity of sharing in the economic benefits which have resulted from the reopening of the Lough Allen Canal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to consider granting the post of resource teacher to St. Joseph's boys school, Clondalkin.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to intervene in the fees and charges dispute appertaining to University College Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Manning of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The refusal of the Minister for Education to recognise, for incremental purposes, the teaching <Col N="1274" /> years of B.Ed. national school teachers at St. Michael's junior school, Ailesbury Road, Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Daly of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to make a statement regarding the provision of accommodation for primary school children in County Clare, and if she will give an up-to-date assessment in relation to Gaelscoil Mhicil Ciosog, Kilkee primary school, Kilmurry primary school and Tulla primary school.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Calnan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The refusal of the Minister for the Environment to provide funding for the Bandon bypass to alleviate severe traffic congestion in Bandon town.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney, Hayes, Finneran, Manning and Daly as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Mooney and Hayes and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  I regret I had to rule the matter raised by Senator Calnan out of order on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.  The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 32, motion 24.  Item 1 will be taken from the end of the Order of Business until 4 p.m. with a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.  With regard to item 2, the Litter Pollution Bill, 1996, I understand that Second Stage is near completion and if this Stage concludes, there will be a short sos followed by Committee Stage.  Item 24 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. What are the time allocations in respect of item 1?  My party's spokesperson has much to say on the Bill.  With regard to item 2, Second Stage is near completion and we are agreeable to take Committee Stage, provided there is a sos to allow for the submission of amendments.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Government has moved motion 24 for Private Members' Business.  Yesterday the Government accepted the Heritage and Cultural Events (Televisual Access Protection) Bill, 1997, when Second Stage was moved in Private Members' time in the Dáil.  On two occasions during Private Members' time in this House we asked the Minister to accept our position on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Leader kindly submitted the list of legislation the House will deal with over the coming weeks.  Is there anything to be added in the three weeks leading up to Thursday, 24 April?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the ongoing external debate it is crucial that the House debates European Monetary Union and related matters as soon as possible.  It is vital that Members inform themselves of the issues to enable them participate in the wider public debate.  I am concerned that, as European Monetary Union approaches, people will raise issues about which Members of this House and the other House are not fully informed.  While there is a consensus on the issue, with notable exceptions, a debate should proceed.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Government, in future negotiations at the appropriate level, to raise the fact that the House is opposed to and scandalised by the actions being taken by those acting in the name of our interests against ordinary working people on the other island?  It is disgraceful that people cannot go about their business; it is especially repugnant that the IRA should again participate in spoiling the fun and unity of families by effectively cancelling the Grand National last Saturday.  It is an event which brings families together.  Grandparents choose horses for their grandchildren and there is a sense of togetherness in families and communities.  Apart from the difficulties the incident has created for the bloodstock industry and the image of Ireland, we should make our position clear regarding the lunatics who claim to act in our name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's remarks about the incident at the weekend.  Even by the IRA's own perverted logic, I do not understand why it indulged in such an activity.  It was sheer stupidity.  It is a well founded tradition that sport is not involved in such matters.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, thousands of Irish people were at Aintree and I am sure they were upset and embarrassed by what occurred.  It had no logic whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Repeated calls have been made for a debate on European Monetary Union.  It is important to clear up the confusion which exists and to ensure that we have a coherent strategy.  I appreciate the Government's position has been outlined but other related issues need to be debated.  The current crisis in agriculture is related to the currency issue.  This needs to be discussed because it is more serious now than it was at the outset of the BSE problem.  There has been a huge reduction in cattle prices and dramatic cuts in export refunds.  There are difficulties with carcase classification and the disposal of dead animals. Another aspect is Ireland's access to live cattle markets in the Middle East and the necessary competition that will be created in the trade.  This matter is critical for many people and there is real hardship in agricultural circles at present.  This matter must be debated soon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator O'Toole and Senator Dardis in condemning the recent actions of the IRA in Britain, particularly in relation to the Grand National.  It was entirely counter-productive even in terms of its own interests.  British <Col N="1276" /> and Irish people were frightened and discommoded by the incident and it is difficult to understand the IRA's aim at this point.  In terms of its political viewpoint it is going the wrong way about achieving representation at talks after the British general election.  It is right to condemn its actions.  The House should also condemn the increase in bigoted actions by a small section of the population of Northern Ireland in relation to church buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and other Members who attended the funeral of a dear colleague in County Donegal.  I appreciated their presence and support on that sad occasion.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly called for a debate on the funding of local authorities.  The Minister had time to give an interview to RTÉ radio this morning and to give a broad description of what he is doing about the funding of local authorities.  I would go to Montrose if it meant Members were informed and could contribute to a debate.  It is unfortunate that, despite repeated appeals, the House has not discussed this issue this session. The Minister said this morning that he was giving local authorities £260 million of the money generated by motor taxation.  This might be sufficient in Dublin but it will not be enough to replace the asbestos pipes which carry water in County Donegal.  Every day some of these pipes burst and people do not know whether their health is being damaged as a result.  The Minister has spoken of people being unaware of the current situation but he is the only person who is not informed.  It is a tragedy.  I do not blame the Leader as the Minister has avoided an open discussion of this issue.</P>

      <P>A question to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader if I should raise this issue or will I be fobbed off?</P>
      <P>I join with colleagues in deploring the actions of the Provisional IRA over the weekend.  I listened to the vice-chairman of Sinn Féin, Mr. Pat Doherty, speak on Donegal Highland Radio about the economic neglect of Donegal and other Border counties.  Nobody has contributed more to the destruction of prosperity in Ireland than the Provisional IRA.  Ireland would flourish like no other country in Europe if they stopped their activities.  I condemn the stupid actions of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Government on yesterday's statement that polling for the election will be held on a Friday.  It is another example of how the Government is continuing its policy of considering the views of young people in making decisions.  This decision means that many young people living and working away from home will, for the first time, have the opportunity to exercise their franchise in their local areas.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment to undertake a publicity campaign to <Col N="1277" /> inform people that they can register to vote up to 14 days before the election.  Over 17 per cent of the population are not registered to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Mr. Gerry Adams, I am partial to the politics of condemnation and for that reason I am happy to join in the condemnation of recent events.  I do not feel as strongly as some colleagues for the following reasons: nobody was hurt and it is less easy to get excited about the cancellation of a sporting event during which nobody was hurt than a situation where life was lost.  Also, the IRA has scored a spectacular own goal, which does not distress me in the slightest.</P>
      <P>I also take an ungodly pleasure in the fact that the President has referred the Employment Equality Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. A number of Senators, including myself, pointed out this possibility and laid a foundation for the constitutional examination of that legislation.</P>
      <P>In the light of recent disclosures about telephone tapping, I ask the Leader to recommend a full inquiry to the Government.  It is not acceptable that a few journalists who managed to weasel out information about their own cases are able to protect their own situations with spectacular success.  If, as appears to be the case, a sizeable number of citizens have had their telephones illegally tapped, we ought to know the whole story.  The Leader should instigate a debate on the matter and pass the views of the House to the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>Finally, I draw the House's attention to the fact that the Independent benches have now swollen to their original size.  In the words of the Good Book, there is more joy in Heaven over one sinner who repents than over all the band of the righteous put together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in condemning the IRA atrocity.  One wonders whether citizens are able to interpret the EU directive on landfill waste, the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines and the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Sustainable Development to discover the policy on this question.  I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue.  Senator Norris referred to the changes and phone tapping in the early 1980s.  It speaks volumes that an investigative journalist will make a secret deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As my party's spokesperson on Northern Ireland, we condemn the IRA.  We do not try to get into its members' minds to discover whether an action is counter productive or an own goal &mdash; that is a matter for them. Although I join the condemnations we are not required to prove our bona fides on every occasion or to discover whether this was justifiable even from their perspective.  Actions of that kind are totally and utterly abhorrent to all of us. Fortunately, as Senator Norris said, no deaths or injuries were caused this time.  In case it is thought in Britain or elsewhere that if we do not <Col N="1278" /> formally condemn incidents in that jurisdiction they somehow have our tacit support, let it be known we condemn every action undertaken by that organisation and we do not have to justify our position by condemnations of each incident. I also join Senator O'Sullivan in condemning the abhorrent arson and destruction of places of worship, acknowledged by no organisation.  It casts shame on any element, at what we like to think of as an enlightened stage of civilisation.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned European Monetary Union related matters.  The current crisis in the beef industry is grave not just for farmers, producers or the meat industry but, because of the unique importance of that sector, for the economy. Now that the EU has paid its contribution arising from the revaluation of our green £, I call on the Minister for Finance &mdash; who is in the House to discuss other issues &mdash; to follow the example and precedent of other member states and make the matching contribution, especially because the beef and dairy sector is much more important to our economy than to the German, French or Dutch economies.  If he will not, will he explain how he can find £40 million for consultancies, programme managers and advisers but cannot find £25 million for our most important industry?  That question must be answered in the light of the crisis facing the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimTownsend" hpid="Mr. Townsend Mr. Townsend">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Townsend</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in calling for a debate on the crisis in the beef industry.  Because of the urgency of the matter we should hold it today. The crisis has been brought about through a series of events outside the control of farmers.  The most serious problems concern export refunds which are used as a mechanism to control the volume of beef exported to Third World countries. We are affected more than other countries because we export eight out of every ten animals produced.  This mechanism was part of the GATT agreement which was negotiated during the MacSharry era.  Taken with the green pound devaluation, it has proven an unmitigated disaster.</P>
      <P>Every time live exports are reduced the beef processing factories combine in a cartel to the detriment of farmers.  Irish farmers are paid 80p per pound for beef compared with 95p in Britain &mdash; where BSE is a major problem &mdash; and £1.07 in France.  Irish farmers are at a severe disadvantage and I call for an urgent debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for an immediate debate on the crisis in farming.  I endorse the call by Senator O'Kennedy for an immediate payment of matching funds towards the devaluation of the green £.  The price of beef has been reduced by 30p per lb over the last four years.  The crisis is not confined to beef; the milk and sheep sectors are also affected.  We attend meetings on a nightly basis in our constituencies to discuss the crisis.</P>
      <P>Government spokespersons seem to have a briefing document from their spin doctors telling them to refer to the GATT agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.  Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an immediate debate on the crisis in agriculture and to convey to the Minister our serious concern.</P>
      <P>The Ministers for Health and Finance have failed to honour an existing agreement regarding retired nurses subsequent to the settlement of the nurses dispute.  It is unprecedented for people with an existing agreement to be discriminated against.  I ask the Leader to raise this serious national concern with these Ministers.  Discrimination against retired people on the basis that they have no clout is an indictment of any Minister or Government.  There may be as many retired as there are practising nurses.  Some retired on voluntary schemes at the behest of Government and they should not be discriminated against.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on the funding of acute general hospitals.  I was aghast at the revelations in last Sunday's newspapers that it costs four times more to keep a bed in an acute hospital in Dublin than in the west.  This is damning information.  I am not saying that beds in Dublin are over funded but I am convinced that beds in hospitals in the west are underfunded to an extent that it must be practicably impossible to operate them. Roscommon General Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not debating that issue now.  Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to explain how Roscommon General Hospital and other hospitals in the west receive four times less funding than their Dublin counterparts? Roscommon General Hospital receives the least amount of funding from a list of 22 hospitals. We need a debate on the funding of beds in acute hospitals.  We should not have discrimination on a regional basis as currently happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's call for a debate on European Monetary Union.  We had a very good and healthy debate on this issue some months ago.  However, the currency rate has changed dramatically between Ireland and Britain over the past months.  There has been an 8 per cent swing which has huge implications for our joining European Monetary Union.  If we delay having a debate any longer, one of the most crucial decisions this State has to make will drift into a position where we will not have given it full attention.  I urge the Leader to find time in the immediate future for a debate on this issue. When the Irish £ was valued at 4 per cent more than sterling a few months ago, we heard of all the problems this created.  We do not seem to hear of the problems that are being created now because they concern consumers rather than manufacturers.  The inflation criterion is crucial in <Col N="1280" /> regard to European Monetary Union and I would not like us to drift any further without debating the issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice about mounted police?  I raised this matter on the Adjournment some months ago and the Minister, who was receptive to the concept, responded by saying she would seek information from the Garda Commissioner. I mention the issue because of the visibility of the mounted police at Aintree on Saturday last in relation to crowd control.  There is a great realisation of the benefits of having mounted police and the Minister recognised that. The acceptance of the need for mounted police would be a valuable step to take at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on agriculture.  Will the Leader draw the Minister's attention to the plight of small dairy farmers, especially in the west of Ireland, whose incomes have been very substantially reduced?  We now have an unprecedented level of small dairy producers clearing out their dairy herds.  The situation is critical and I support the call for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to take action in this regard.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment what proposals, if any, there are for new legislation in relation to the reorganisation of the training agency, FÁS? The Leader will be aware that a number of statements have appeared in the media recently about the proposals to change the legislation which established FÁS and the reorganisation of the training authority area.  There is quite an amount of concern as to what Government proposals are in this area.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Justice how many and whose telephones are being tapped at present?  Perhaps the Minister might lay the transcripts in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call to the Minister for the Environment to investigate the charge which has been made in the House this morning about the use of asbestos pipes.  It is an absolute disgrace if water is passing through asbestos pipes.  Ten years ago, asbestos was removed from car brake pads because of the danger of dust from the pads.  Asbestos has also been removed from insulation material.  If asbestos pipes are in use, it is a matter of public health that this be addressed urgently, irrespective of cost.  We need to ascertain whether a problem exists and if there is a single metre of asbestos pipe in use in this country. An investigation must take place and all asbestos pipes must be eliminated.  Dust from asbestos is the most&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the cost of a mobile telephone and explain the difference between East and Eircell?  One cannot walk a centimetre without being almost knocked down by somebody using a mobile telephone when driving, which is illegal, or go into a restaurant without being knocked down by somebody making a date.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to outline the cost of a mobile telephone?  One cannot buy a bag of chips without being offered a free mobile telephone.  It is time we knew the cost of such telephones.</P>
      <P>Last week RTÉ showed a programme on nongovernmental organisations, our aid organisations and money spent on aid.  We should debate the effectiveness of aid from this and other countries to the Third World to see if money is being wasted and if people are spending time in Third World countries for their own benefit, as was suggested in the television programme.  We should consider the response of APSO and debate the issue because we send considerable sums of money and personnel to Third World countries. We must ensure the money is used to the benefit of those who are supposed to be the recipients and not the donor country or the person giving their time.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure Europe plays its part in attempting to get the peace process in the Middle East back on track?  The Americans seem to have opted out of their responsibilities and Europe has a responsibility in this regard.  Yesterday, three Palestinians were killed in the West Bank.  The peace process, which was welcomed by Members, has virtually broken down and unless Europe plays a part in trying to re-establish a peace accord in the Middle East the situation will worsen.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government to ensure Europe plays a significant part in trying to get the peace process in the Middle East back on track?</P>

      <P>I join with colleagues who called for a debate on European Monetary Union, which would be appropriate at this time.  I was surprised by the recent announcement by the Germans, which seemed to be unilateral, that although they would not meet the 3 per cent criteria, they would be allowed to waive that requirement and join European Monetary Union. Is a two track system emerging &mdash; one for large powerful countries and another for the small weak ones?  That issue must form a major part of this essential debate.</P>
      <P>I raised the proposed march by members of the Garda Síochána on the Houses of the Oireachtas on two previous occasions and I will not apologise for doing so again today.  There have, however, been developments in that regard.  On the last occasion the Leader agreed that Garda pay should not form part of the debate on law and order in the run up to the general election.  Since this is a matter for this House, it is appropriate to raise it now.  It is bad for the Oireachtas and it sends a wrong signal to criminals who run rampant in this city if, on a specific day, gardaí do not arrest and charge them but marching on the Oireachtas because of a pay dispute.  The Minister for Justice must make an urgent statement to both Houses as to whether this march will take place, what is her attitude to it and if she will try to resolve the issue of Garda pay in advance of the general election.</P>

      <P>As Senator McGowan is aware, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, issued an open invitation over two years ago to participate in finding a more appropriate form of local government funding but the Opposition took to the hills because it was too thorny a subject. It is much easier to criticise the current form of funding if one does not have the responsibility of replacing it.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader agree that, since 1994, when one faced the Opposition and awaited incoming fire, it has been disconcerting to find it coming from one's own part of the battlefield?  I congratulate Senator Ross for removing that uncertainty from this side of the House so that when we face incoming fire, it will come from that direction.</P>

The Irish Farmers Association has held a series of meetings in my constituency and has been involved in a nationwide lobby so many colleagues <Col N="1283" /> will be familiar with this.  There is a crisis in the farming community and it would be remiss of us, whether from town or country, not to highlight it.  I heartily endorse the calls made because of the serious difficulties faced by our premier industry.  Some people in cities sit smugly on the sidelines and constantly berate the farming community.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago, I asked the Leader about Government policy on rural services, such as Garda stations and post offices.  It was specifically about one post office in Geevagh, County Sligo. I am pleased to inform the House that An Post announced yesterday it would advertise a permanent position of postmaster or postmistress in Geevagh.  I commend the local community for showing the way forward and I hope this will be motivation for other rural communities who feel their local services are threatened.</P>

      <P>Politicians do not have a direct input into the decision making process of semi-State bodies such as An Post.  In this case a combination of political and community action ensured the survival of an important local service in a small community in the west.  Does the Leader think it appropriate that we might in future debate the public accountability of semi-State bodies?  During successive Administrations in the past 20 years, the power originally vested in these Houses has been increasingly diminished and, where once the public, through its representatives, could seek accountability from companies funded by the taxpayer, it now can no longer do so because semi-State bodies operate autonomously.</P>

      <P>If we wish to be relevant as a House of the Oireachtas we should have talked about European Monetary Union many years ago.  It is a bit late to debate it now.  However, in the hope that there is still some sense of reason on the Government benches let us have such a debate. There does not seem to be as much reason as there was last week.</P>
      <P>I will not join the chorus of condemnation at the cancellation of the Grand National.  I am tired of condemnation.  I was in a bookie's shop in Gatwick Airport when the Grand National was cancelled. The things people said about the IRA and the Irish in general is not worth repeating on the Order of Business.  However, it is scary to hear the anti-Irish feeling provoked by such incidents.</P>
      <P>Our condemnations fall on deaf ears when they reach the people of Northern Ireland and England.  We need to take action.  At the same time we are condemning the IRA's actions we are playing footsie with Sinn Féin.  We need to stop condemning and start taking action.</P>

    <P>I welcome the announcement that the <i>Tour de</i><i>France</i> will start in Ireland next year.  This is a big boost for the tourism industry and I congratulate all concerned.  The last day we sat I asked the Leader if it was possible to have a debate on the communications proposals to create a super authority over the RTÉ Authority and the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  A debate on this matter would be useful in teasing out what <Col N="1285" /> the Minister thinks and we could also inform him of our views.</P>

      <P>It has been brought to my notice that a large amount of money may shortly be offered by an American institution for one of our gems of architectural heritage, the vestibule and facade of the old Abbey Theatre.  It is currently safely stored and I saw it during the week.  At the time of its demolition it was taken down and numbered by the then city architect, Daithí Hanley. I believe he is prepared to offer it to the State free of charge if a suitable site can be found, perhaps in the new museum.  Will the Leader bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who, being a theatre man, will perhaps take an interest in this project?</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ross on returning to where he belongs.  Similar to <i>Athanasius contra</i><i>mundum,</i> I have always thought &ldquo;Ross contra party system&rdquo;.  I do not think he ever fitted into the Fine Gael Party.  He is an independent voice and I am glad to hear him shouting already.  I hope he keeps it up.</P>
      <P>I condemn the burning of churches in the Six Counties.  On either side it is terrible that people should be reduced to burning places of worship. I also congratulate Bishop Boyce of Raphoe on the fearless enunciation of his Church's teaching. Both he and Bishop Mahaffy spoke clearly but were pilloried in the media to some extent, especially Bishop Boyce, because those in the media do not agree with him.  He was not afraid to enunciate what he believed without asking anyone to agree with him.  There should be more freedom and tolerance &mdash; the type of tolerance expected from someone like Senator Ross, who is a very tolerant man in these circumstances.</P>

There will be no amendment to the Private Members' motion this evening, but I cannot guarantee that the envisaged legislation will see the light of day during this Parliament.  I should have information tomorrow as to the programme of legislation for the coming months.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the debate on European Monetary Union.  The Minister of Finance has been here for the Order of Business and has heard what was said.  He has led this debate over the past number of years and I am sure he will be happy to have a debate in the coming weeks. Senator Quinn raised issues central to that debate and I will see if it can be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Members rightly condemned the IRA disruption of the Grand National last Saturday and the previous disruption of British motorways. I do not think I have to repeat the condemnation of the House.  It is important to accept the point made by Senator Lydon and other Senators on the condemnation of the burning of churches. There is something absolutely barbaric about the <Col N="1286" /> burning of churches of any denomination.  The television pictures make for shameful viewing. Obviously, all Members of the House condemn what is happening.  It is also only right for the House to condemn the murder of an innocent Catholic man last week, apparently by Loyalist paramilitaries.  It is important that our condemnation is even-handed.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and other Senators raised agriculture problems.  If we have time, we will have a debate on that.  I will convey the points made to the Minister.  Senator McGowan raised the funding of local authorities.  There was a debate on the funding of local authorities in the last session, which the Minister participated in.  It is item 20 on the Order Paper and the debate has not concluded. I will see if it can be continued.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten raised the important point of Friday polling.  There is a need for the provision of greater information on late registration to potential voters.  I will convey that point to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke in biblical terms about the return of the prodigal son to his benches. Whenever a prodigal son returns, a fatted calf has to be sacrificed; I wonder which fatted calf will be sacrificed in this case.  I wish to place on record my thanks to Senator Ross for his co-operation over the past number of years on these benches. He always treated the Whip and I with great directness and courtesy and was a very dependable member of this group.  I am not surprised he has gone back to a more congenial habitat.  I wish him well on his return to the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Sherlock raised the question of water charges.  A debate on that matter could be possible, although a great deal of light was cast on the issue this morning by Mr. Pat Cox, MEP, who seemed to seriously undermine some of the points made at yesterday's hastily convened press conference.</P>
    <P>Most of the other points raised were about agriculture.  Senator Finneran's point should be raised on the Adjournment.  Senator Quinn made a very interesting point about mounted police and I will ask the Minister for Justice if any progress has been made on that matter.  Senator Daly raised the question of the reorganisation of FÁS. I am not aware of any legislative proposals in that regard at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan's contribution was his usual <i>tour de force.</i>  I will send the text of what he said about mobile telephones to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and ask him for a reply because I am not capable of giving him a reply on that matter.  He raised other points about the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the peace process.  He will do everything he can in that regard.  We should have a debate on the effectiveness of relief aid.  I will make inquiries on whether asbestos is being used for pipes.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the question of State sponsored bodies, which are dealt with by an Oireachtas Joint Committee.  Senator Ross made the points he has made, and will continue to <Col N="1287" /> make, on Northern Ireland and European Monetary Union, which do not require any comment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy welcomed the Tour de France, as do we all.  I do not have any plans at the moment for a debate on the proposed super authority for RTÉ.  Senator Lydon raised a point about the Abbey Theatre which I will refer to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Before I deal with the Bill, I would like to intrude on the proceedings of the House, which I have witnessed for the last few minutes, in regard to the request for a debate on economic and monetary union.  I will be happy to facilitate this House if it wants to have a further discussion on the matter.</P>
      <P>I draw Members' attention to two matters. First, they should have received the recently published document setting out the Government's up-to-date position on the issue and the preparation which is taking place as we speak.  Second, there will be a launch on Monday, 17 April, outlining the next stage of preparation required for the process and for the conversion to the single currency.</P>
      <P>It might be useful if such a debate were to take place after 17 April.  I am in the hands of the House in relation to that matter, but from my point of view the more the discussion about the issue the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill forms an essential element of the strategic management initiative, SMI, which is itself the product of an ongoing process of administrative research, analysis and discussion both at political <Col N="1288" /> level and particularly within the public service itself.</P>
    <P>In moving this process forward, my central aim is to equip this country with the best possible structures and systems of public administration as we enter the new millennium.  The success of this process of public service change and development will impact on all citizens who depend on the public services, not just civil servants and Ministers. Moreover, I have moved quickly from the publication of the Bill to bring these legislative proposals before the Oireachtas because I believe that the issues which they address transcend partisan interests and go to the core of constitutional democracy.</P>
    <P>I have had the privilege of serving the citizens of this country in Government on a number of occasions during my political career.  Now, within this Government, I have been charged with the primary responsibility for bringing this Bill before the Seanad today.  In preparing these proposals I have tried as far as possible to think through and formulate the crucial sections of the Bill from a parliamentary perspective, because we, as parliamentarians in this House and in Dáil Éireann, collectively provide the basic principle on which is based the very idea of responsible public service.</P>
    <P>It is a fundamental principle of our democracy that those who organise and deliver services to the public, to the citizens of this country, are accountable to that public through us, the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This concept of the democratic responsibility and accountability of members of the Government to Parliament underpins all that we hope to achieve by means of this legislation.  The importance of this concept is reflected in section 3 which explicitly reaffirms that notwithstanding any assignment of functions in the Bill, a Minister is in charge of his or her Department of State.  The section further provides that members of the Government are responsible for the administration of their Departments as provided for in the Constitution and the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1995.  Put another way, this section reinforces the fundamental role of Dáil Éireann in calling Ministers to account publicly for the stewardship of their Departments.  There are no other institutions under the Constitution which exercise such power over the Executive authority with regard to actions carried out by, or in the name of, the elected Government.</P>
    <P>As in any open and free society the news media, whether television or the press, can observe, comment on and criticise any action of Government.  In recent years we have seen how effective judicial tribunals have been in exposing certain aspects of major issues of public interest and importance.  Moreover, the Freedom of Information Bill will bring a new dimension to openness and transparency in the government of this country.  Notwithstanding the importance of these factors in ensuring that government of the people is conducted for and in the interests of the <Col N="1289" /> people, there are no other constitutional mechanisms through which the Government and individual Ministers can be brought formally to account politically other than within the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Of course, the accountability of the Government to the Dáil has been a fundamental element of our democracy since the foundation of the State.  This is enshrined in the Constitution.  Yet while the theoretical basis of ministerial accountability continues, the growing complexity of modern government has changed the practical character of this accountability.  At first, Departments of State were relatively small close-knit organisations: a Minister could know personally all of his &mdash; it was almost invariably his in those days &mdash; higher civil servants and most, if not all, of the other officials in his Department.  Ronan Fanning's history of the Department of Finance points out that in 1924 the entire staff complement of the Department was fewer than 60 people.  If the approximately 60 people employed at the NTMA are included, that figure is close to 600 today, representing a tenfold increase in numbers.  This illustrates the extent of growth and change.  Thus the fact that, as now, a Department of State has no autonomous capacity to act and every action must in law be done in the name of the Minister, created little difficulties for the public service.</P>
    <P>The scale and variety of public services have increased exponentially since the 1920s and especially over the last quarter of a century. Think for a moment of how many demands on Ministers and officials arise directly or indirectly from our membership of the European Union. The range and extent of matters for which an individual Minister is now theoretically and legally accountable has become so vast as to make the process of accountability almost unreal.  All of us who serve in the Oireachtas, whether Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann, are aware of this fact. The notion that every Minister can even know about, let alone direct and manage every action, every day in his or her Department is absurd. This dichotomy between legal requirements and practical reality creates enormous difficulties for us in trying to do our jobs as parliamentarians. Issues of importance become personalised; personalities become more important than facts.  To allow the unreality of Parliament's role in this regard to endure would be a disservice to democracy and the integrity of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Public Service Management Bill addresses this crucial issue.  It does not in any sense remove the Minister from the process of accountability. Rather it amplifies and augments the structures of central government to ensure that the process of accountability is more focused and is, accordingly, made more realistic.  It does this by creating, for the first time in law, a statutory basis for the structures and arrangements of management within Departments of State and the other offices of central government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Arrangements for the better administration of central government may seem less than glamorous or even pedestrian.  It is not a topic which offers a visible payoff to any political practitioner &mdash; other than the distinguished Members of this House, including its Leader, whose other careers shape that interest &mdash; or a matter on which one would be willing to take political risks.  However, I cannot over-emphasise its importance.  Few would question the fact that the fundamental issues at stake &mdash; of authority, responsibility and accountability of Ministers of the Government and their officials &mdash; have thrust themselves forward repeatedly during the lifetime of the present Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to say that this Bill is the most important legislative provision affecting the administration of central government since the original Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924.  In that sense, the Bill is already a historic departure from previous approaches to public service reform.  Those who are familiar with earlier initiatives to reorganise the institutions and improve the performance of the public services in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s will recognise the same themes of structures and systems, efficiency and effectiveness, authority, responsibility and accountability, recurring throughout all aspects of the strategic management initiative as were addressed 20 or 30 years ago.  A key factor missing from those earlier, incomplete attempts at public service reform was a legislative dimension. A recognition of the importance of legislation and a willingness to bring forward the specific proposals contained in this Bill marks off the SMI as a qualitatively different process from the approach adopted during previous unsuccessful phases of administrative reform.</P>
    <P>Let us make no mistake about it.  There are those who do not wish reform to touch their official lives.  There are others who regard it as a passing fad, to be sat out until a Government changes, and there are those who have seen the coming and going of enthusiastic Ministers. Reluctant travellers along the road to reform need to be jolted out of their lethargy and complacency. We mean business, not just in Government but on all sides in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  That is the message that we as parliamentarians must convey to the wider public service system to ensure that once an Administration, or indeed a Minister, moves, the enthusiasm to complete the SMI will not be diminished.  Nothing would provide a greater disservice to the nation if we as parliamentarians were to allow that impression to gain currency. That is not to say that we cannot have substantially different points of view about the merits of the legislation or the mechanisms that are being put in place.  However, to convey an impression that the principle was the property of one group or party or collection of parties in either or both Houses would be counter-productive to the interests of all parties in both Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> The importance of the legislative dimension of the reform process has two aspects.  First, bringing the collective wisdom of the Oireachtas directly into the process of administrative reform and development creates certainty that action will be taken to carry forward this important process. Vesting this process in law gives the changes we want to see an impetus missing from earlier phases of reform.  The new law is not merely intended to fulfil a declaratory function, although this can in itself be an important factor.  The proposed legislation will empower the agents of change and development within the public services to achieve the lasting improvements we demand.</P>
    <P>The second crucial aspect of the legislative phases is that the Bill will provide a statutory basis for a new management structure in the Civil Service. The present arrangements for the administration of central government set out in the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, address the organisation of the public services at what might be called a &ldquo;macro level&rdquo;.  The existing legislation, based on the 1924 Act, is primarily concerned with the division of responsibility across the public services and the institutional arrangements to organise the various branches of administration.</P>
    <P>The Public Service Management Bill is primarily concerned with the micro level of administration &mdash; what happens within individual Departments of State and Offices and how the various tiers of administration relate to each other.  Much of this so-called ordinary business of the Civil Service is at present conducted on the basis of administrative arrangements rather than on a statutory basis.  The provisions of the Bill are designed to give this dimension of the process of governance a legal foundation which will knit into the existing macro framework and establish the new arrangements firmly within the body of administrative law.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of this legislative dimension, I have taken care to ensure that the specific proposals contained in the Bill meet, as far as possible, the precise needs of this phase of the SMI process.  To this end I was greatly assisted in preparing this Bill by the members of the advisory group established by the Government last year.  This group included the programme managers of the leaders of the three parties in Government, the senior legal assistant in the Office of the Attorney General and experts from my Department and other key areas of the Civil Service.  The recommendations of the advisory group were taken into account by the Government in approving the final form of the Bill, especially in relation to the core constitutional dimension of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In particular, great care was taken to preserve the right balance between the democratic accountability of the elected representatives of the people serving in Government and the achievement of the highest standards of administrative <Col N="1292" /> effectiveness and efficiency of officials.  I am satisfied that the proposals contained in the Bill fully respect the provisions of the Constitution in relation to the administration of Departments of State and the collective responsibility of members of the Government to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Within this constitutional context the various sections of the Bill give effect to the arrangements for the new management structure for the Civil Service which were described in detail in the White Paper, <i>Delivering Better Government,</i> published in May of last year.  The objective of this new management structure is clear.  Its purpose is to put in place a framework which will enhance the management, effectiveness and transparency of operations of Departments and Offices and increase the accountability of civil servants.</P>
    <P>You do not need to be an architect to know there are certain fundamental rules which must be observed in relation to any new structure. Rule number one is that the ground must be carefully prepared and a solid base laid.  The Public Service Management Bill is, in a real sense, the foundation in legislation for the new management structure in the Civil Service and for the organisational and administrative changes which will flow from this structure.  Moreover, the Bill opens the way for further significant legislative proposals in related areas.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another equally important architectural precept: you have to get the sequence of construction right.  When building a house you do not generally try to put the roof on until all the supporting walls are in place.  Some criticisms of this Bill suggest to me that certain commentators have yet to learn this basic lesson. Those who look for a grand redesign of all aspects of the public service in this legislation and criticise the supposed absence of more farreaching changes miss this fundamental point.  This Bill is presented not as a once and for all restructuring of the public services but, quite explicitly, as the first in a series of public management Bills, each of which will address specific phases of administrative reorganisation and development.</P>
    <P>A further principle of good architectural practice, equally applicable to public service management, is that you do not tear down the structures inherited from previous generations just for the sake of it.  In building anew, it is always wise to try to preserve, strengthen and extend whatever has served well in the past and stood the test of time.  One commentator was dismissive of the Public Service Management Bill because he could not find any provisions for the repeal of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  Let me put this as plainly as possible: the 1924 Act is not repealed because there is no need to repeal it.  Rather, the Public Service Management Bill amends the 1924 Act and builds onto the existing body of law the additional provisions needed to put in place the new management structure for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>There is one further analogy with architecture appropriate to this Bill: in designing a building a good architect would try to ensure that it is capable <Col N="1293" /> of providing all of the functions required of it, that it is accessible to and meets the needs of present and future users and that it is in sympathy with the environment within which it is constructed. The same principles apply to this legislation. The Bill will make it possible to put in place new arrangements for management within the institutions of central government.  It meets the needs of Irish citizens and the Irish economy and seeks to extend and strengthen the positive aspects of Irish public administration.  Quite emphatically, it is not intended to impose on this country a pattern of administration devised elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At least one commentator has proposed that we should have gone towards what was described as the New Zealand model of public service reform.  While I have respect for the choices made by the Governments of other countries, I do not believe that all of the reforms implemented in New Zealand are directly applicable here.  While we may have much to learn from the models of administration adopted by other countries, we must be careful to ensure that the appropriate changes are put in place so as to allow for the continuation of the strong economic performance, social progress and political stability enjoyed by this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to deal briefly with some of the specific provisions of the Public Service Management Bill.  Most of the definitions used in the Bill are either self-explanatory or are dealt with in the explanatory memorandum.  However, I would like to draw the House's attention in particular to the term &ldquo;outputs&rdquo; which is defined for the first time in legislation.  This concept, which is derived from both economics and organisation and management theory, is crucial to the way we address objectives, performance and results in the delivery of public services.  My intention is that the strategy statement provided for in section 5 should refer specifically to &ldquo;outputs&rdquo;.  This is needed, I believe, in order to ensure that the business of a Department of State is conceived in terms of the services actually provided to citizens.</P>
    <P>The more familiar, traditional approach to determining what the public services do is to describe particular services in terms of the resources absorbed in providing them.  In order to have this reference included in the Bill it was necessary to provide for a definition of &ldquo;outputs&rdquo; as those goods and services which a Department actually delivers to citizens who constitute its customers and clients as set out in the definitions section.</P>
    <P>My concerns in this regard again arise directly from the increased emphasis we want to give to realistic means of ensuring democratic accountability. Existing arrangements under the Comptroller and Auditor General Act allow public representatives, through the Committee of Public Accounts, to focus on the inputs side of public services.  Accounting officers appearing before the Public Accounts Committee are required to give a detailed account to the effect <Col N="1294" /> that public money has been spent for the purposes for which it was voted and that value for money is being obtained.  By building the concept of outputs into departmental strategy statements, which must be laid before the Oireachtas, I hope to ensure that a better balance of accountability is created.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5 and 9 of the Bill address the core issues of the assignment of authority, responsibility and accountability to Secretaries, the assignment of powers, duties and functions down through the various levels within Departments and Offices and the strategy statement.  The various functions for which Secretaries/Heads will be assigned authority and responsibility and the arrangements for assigning responsibilities down through the organisation, are set out in detail in the Bill and in the explanatory memorandum. The strategy statement is the single most important element in the overall framework. Each such statement must be prepared for each Department by its Secretary -now to be designated Secretary General.  This statement will set out the specific objectives, outputs and strategies, including use of resources, of the Department. Consistent with the provisions of the Constitutions and as provided for in section 3, the determination of policy and the allocation of resources will remain matters for Ministers and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General will be required to prepare and submit a strategy statement to his or her Minister at least every three years.  The Minister may then approve or amend it.  The approved statement must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within a specified time limit.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that strategy statements are unequivocally in the public domain.</P>
    <P>These strategy statements, which must be regularly updated and revised, provide the framework within which civil servants will carry out their duties and functions in the administration of central government.  By giving management and staff in all Departments and Offices a clear and consistent understanding of precisely what is expected of them in their jobs, it is my hope and expectation that greater initiative and endeavour will emerge at all levels and grades across the Civil Service.  In addition, provisions for laying strategy statements of every Department and Office before the Oireachtas will provide Members with a regular and complete declaration of the objectives and outputs comprising the business of the public services.  Most important of all, the general public will be given valid and accessible standards for judging levels of quality and performance in the delivery of the public services.</P>
    <P>One of the changes I am proposing in the Bill is the replacement of the title Secretary by that of Secretary General.  This change resulted from my personal observation of the hoops that a civil service chief of an Irish Department had to go through to explain his place in the existing scheme of things to counterparts from other <Col N="1295" /> administrations.  I was in Tokyo with the Secretary of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Mr. Kevin Bonner, for a meeting with the Japanese Minister for Industry and Trade.  The Secretary explained who he was to the interpreter and the interpreter thought he was the Minister's personal assistant.  When the Secretary explained that he was the permanent Secretary, the translation given by the interpreter provoked quizzical looks from the Japanese.  Permanent Secretary had been translated into Japanese as &ldquo;everlasting typist&rdquo;.  That experience confirmed my belief that titles in the public service are important.  They should be, as far as possible, self-explanatory and, given the continuing interaction of our officials with their European Union counterparts, comparable with internationally recognised nomenclature.  I regard this change as more than cosmetic.  It is my intention to follow it with changes in the archaic and somewhat mystifying titles which abound in the Civil Service to the confusion of the public and which in themselves give no clear indication to their holders of how their functions compare with responsibilities in other organisations.  It would logically follow that Assistant Secretaries would be retitled as Assistant Secretaries General and the grades immediately below them as Directors and Assistant Directors, but I intend to pursue with the Civil Service unions the question of appropriate titles accurately reflecting the position and responsibilities of their holders.  Their participation in that element of the restructuring is important.</P>
    <P>The creation of a high-performance, results-oriented Civil Service is central to the structure set out in <i>Delivering Better Government</i> which we published last year.  The day-to-day work programmes of staff in Departments of State at all levels needs to be underpinned by an effective performance management system across the Civil Service.  The Human Resource Working Group set up under the strategic management initiative has been given responsibility for the design and development of such a system which will fit the complex environment of a modern Civil Service. One of the leading consultants in the field, Hay MSL (Ireland) Limited, has been engaged to assist in this development.  There will be extensive consultation with management and staff at all stages of the design and development process.  I am anxious to move as fast as possible on this phase which I want to see fully completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will open up the organisation, role, functioning and operation of Departments of State to public scrutiny to a degree never seen before in the history of this State.</P>
    <P>Before moving on, I want to refer briefly to the assignment of responsibility in relation to appointments, performance, discipline, and dismissal of staff below the level of Principal or its equivalent, to Secretaries General and Heads of <Col N="1296" /> offices.  This represents a significant change compared with the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, and is a major new initiative in an area which will inevitably raise serious questions of human resource management and industrial relations.  Until appropriate amendments to the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, are made, this change will not be brought into effect.  My intention is to bring forward proposals in this regard in the near future which, together with the measures specified in section 4 of this Bill, will renew and update long standing systems of staff management in the Civil Service.  The purpose is to establish more realistic and commonsense arrangements which will win the acceptance of both management and staff.</P>
    <P>The changes will, of course, make significant demands on managers in the Civil Service and those over whom they will exercise authority.  In this regard, I again want to assure all civil servants that any arrangements made giving effect to these proposals will ensure that the principles of natural justice and constitutional justice are fully observed in each individual case.  There is no reason why employees should have any fears about the assignment of authority in respect of appointments, performance, discipline or dismissals to Secretaries General.  My purpose is to introduce a more rational and effective means of dealing with those rare occasions when a resort to the ultimate sanction of dismissal becomes necessary.  It is most certainly not my intention to diminish the rights of employees in law or in terms of natural justice.  These changes are intended to ensure that the exercise of authority in relation to these sensitive areas within the Civil Service is at least equivalent to the best practice in these matters whether in the public or private sectors.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in commending the Public Service Management Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct when he says this is a most important Bill.  It is extraordinary that the legislation on which our Civil Service is based is almost 75 years old and has largely been allowed to rest in place without change.</P>
      <P>The Devlin report recognised over 30 years ago that the growth of public administration and Government, new functions assigned to public service bodies, new ideas on administration, the increased complexity of modern life, changes in public attitudes to authority and in public demands, and changes in the general environment of public administration all combined to demand a radical approach to public service reform.  The Minister knows from days we spent in Government Buildings in 1994 that Fianna Fáil is at least as committed, enthusiastic and energetic as he is for reform in these areas.  In the document agreed by the two parties at that time, a very specific commitment was incorporated by my party leader to the issue of amending the concept of ministerial responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> Aspects of this Bill require explanation.  I did not prepare a script for this debate because I wanted to hear what the Minister had to say.  I commend him because his speech did touch on some of the areas that I am concerned about. However, the Minister skirted around a number of important issues and some of those issues are so fundamental that we may have to oppose the Bill.  Even if we do so, Fianna Fáil is as committed to reform as any party in the House.</P>
    <P>The Irish public service has worked reasonably well in the long period of its existence.  We celebrate its 75th anniversary this month.  It has served Governments loyally and impartially.  In the words of the Devlin report, it has tried to promote development, implement without reservation policies which public servants themselves do not always support and has always attracted more than its fair share of talent.  There are aspects of the public service which require radical change and reform.  The Public Service Organisation Review Group was appointed 30 years ago to carry out the most extensive review of public administration which the State had seen up to that point.  It found major weaknesses in the public service generally and the Civil Service specifically.</P>
    <P>It found fundamental weaknesses and confusion in structure as well as extraordinary weaknesses and overlapping in the organisation and management of the Civil Service.  It found catastrophic weaknesses in the area of personnel, arguing for the abolition of the professional and general service grading structure.  That has not happened and that structure will not be abolished by this Bill.  The Devlin report found that there were fundamental weaknesses in planning and that planning could not be identified as an activity in many Departments.  In spite of all that has happened in the last 30 years, planning is still a deficiency in many Departments.  That group also found fundamental weaknesses in the area of finance.</P>
    <P>However, the core recommendation of the Devlin report, which, as the Minister has accurately suggested, has been skirted around, concerns ministerial responsibility.  One reason why the Devlin report recommendations were never fully implemented and why the reforms achieved to date are substantially surface reforms is that the concept of ministerial responsibility lies at the core of our administrative system.  That concept was initiated when Queen Victoria was a young girl.  It has little if any relevance to a modern, democratic State.  This is a core issue; if we are to achieve reform and create a public service which is truly responsive to the needs of the people, we must grasp the nettle of ministerial responsibility. It has had a dead hand effect on public administration and made a profound impact on the organisational behaviour of our Civil Service since the foundation of the State.  The issue, therefore, demands a huge amount of political attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> Ministerial responsibility has produced a Civil Service which is excessively centralised.  Our civil administration at central government level is one of the most profoundly centralised in any developed OECD state.  It has been argued that we have decentralised in the last 25 years, but we have never had true decentralisation.  We have had a degree of de-concentration when branches of Civil Service Departments have been transferred, usually as a form of political largesse, to provincial towns.  That is welcome in so far as it means everything is not concentrated in Dublin, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking it is decentralisation.  Administrative decentralisation can only come about if the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, which produces centralisation, is first addressed.  We cannot have devolution or decentralisation without changing the statutory basis of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The second profound impact ministerial responsibility has had on public administration and the Civil Service is that it has produced a profoundly bureaucratic administration.  All the talent swallowed into it is concentrated on bureaucratic control, which is neither in the interest of the taxpayer nor, ultimately, of the public administrators.  The excessive level of bureaucracy in our public administration had produced an essentially sterile system which needs to be changed.  The talent, capacity and ability which undoubtedly exists in abundance in the Civil Service is destroyed by bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>From my years as a civil servant I remember the profound distaste within agencies for unleashing people with talent or initiative.  The Minister regaled us with an interesting anecdote and I will put another on the record.  As a young executive officer in the Department of Transport and Power, I took it upon myself to write to ten and 11 year old children, stating that the Minister was glad they had written to him but he was busy and had asked me to respond to their requests.  I was carpeted by a principal officer and an assistant principal officer, both of whom said I did not have the right to correspond with members of the public, albeit ten year olds.  That was an extraordinary event, but every civil servant can relate anecdotes showing that one is forced to compromise one's initiative and comply with bureaucratic rules which produce sterility.  Things have changed in the last 20 years, but not enough for my liking.</P>
    <P>The concept of ministerial responsibility has also produced a public service which is excessively secretive.  A lecturer in UCD once said that our Civil Service guards its most commonplace file as if it contained the last known copy of the formula for eternal youth.  It is a pity it would not share it with the rest of us.  Although, as the Minister knows, I am a solid supporter of the idea of a Freedom of Information Bill and introduced my own legislation in this House, I believe that as we enter the new millennium we will still be tainted with a profoundly secretive administrative <Col N="1299" /> system.  This secrecy does not serve the people, the public interest, the public service or politics. It is ingrained and has almost become a genetic part of the Civil Service, but it needs to be rooted out.  We must open up our Administration and show the people that it is above board, decent, honest and conducts its business in a way of which all taxpayers and citizens can be proud.</P>
    <P>Ministerial responsibility has also produced a public administration which is cloaked in anonymity. Civil servants are required not to have a view and to hide their personal beliefs.  In the 1960s it was regarded as almost revolutionary when the Secretary of the Department of Education was allowed by the Minister to travel the country explaining education policy.  Nothing could have made more sense.  Who knew more about changes in education than the Secretary of the Department proposing the changes?  Who was in a better position to listen to the concerns of teachers, parents and school managements than the civil servants preparing the changes? However, with few exceptions, we have not repeated that exercise.  This cloak of anonymity has stultified and prohibited healthy public discourse and the exchange of ideas.  Our Civil Service should be allowed engage in public debate, explain policies and listen to views.  This only happens in the secrecy of rooms where subcommittees or interest groups meet civil servants &mdash; it should happen in the open.</P>
    <P>Above all else, ministerial responsibility can, should and must be criticised for producing a Civil Service which is not client oriented.  Our Civil Service is of necessity focused on defending the Minister's interests at all times, although that is not because of the choice of our civil servants. Because the Minister is a corporation sole and is, in essence, the Department, the only view allowed to go abroad is that of the Minister.  It used to be joked that the epitaph of a good civil servant was: &ldquo;At last I am covered&rdquo;.  Civil servants do not need such an epitaph.  There is such an extraordinary wealth of intellectual talent and capacity that we must break the chains which bind that talent and allow it to be free.  If our Civil Service could be freed of the shackles of ministerial responsibility it would quickly evolve so that secrecy and anonymity would be things of the past; those civil servants most interested in their careers and in providing public service would see to that.  The Civil Service would also become more responsive to public needs and be capable of becoming client-oriented or user-friendly, to use the buzz word.</P>
    <P>For all the disadvantages of the concept of ministerial responsibility it remains central to democratic answerability.  However, that answerability has been seriously undermined by recent events. The English language was used to its fullest extent some months ago in the case regarding the movement of a judge from one court to another. To defend a current Minister, the concepts of ministerial responsibility and answerability were <Col N="1300" /> given interpretations which were novel, to say the least.</P>
    <P>I have fundamental concerns about the Bill, which I will address as they are laid out in the explanatory and financial memorandum.  The Bill will allow the executive sections of the Administration to be put in the same relationship to the core of the Department as some of our non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  That is what will be achieved when the provisions are put into effect.  I have no objection to this provided we do not replicate within the Civil Service the situation which often pertains in State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware, for example, of the profound difficulties people in the timber industry are having with Coillte.  The Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies made little impact on the situation when officials from Coillte came before it.  A balance has to be struck between answerability and freedom.  We should modify the concept of ministerial responsibility but if we remove it we must ensure the protection and enhancement of a citizen's right to appeal to the Oireachtas to seek redress for perceived wrongs.</P>
    <P>Our <i>ad hoc</i> approach to redefining the concept of ministerial responsibility over the past 60 years has resulted in many no-go areas.  We have created a situation where it is almost impossible to get answers to certain questions.  Section 3 says it is not the intention of the Bill to abolish answerability as provided for under existing legislation. I do not understand how this can be achieved.  If we give named civil servants autonomy to operate in specific areas of public administration we must remove their actions from the concept of ministerial responsibility.  Under the Bill the Minister will remain answerable to the Dáil for policy issues concerning commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and other areas specifically excluded from ministerial responsibility.  However, will the Minister remain answerable for issues of detail?  For example, will it still be possible to ask parliamentary questions about headage grants, social welfare payments or other issues of day to day detail?  In the past when we created exclusions from ministerial responsibility for good reason, we created areas which became difficult to control and question in points of detail.  Neither I nor my party oppose the concept of limiting ministerial responsibility but we are anxious to ensure that the benefits of ministerial responsibility, especially in safeguarding the public interest, are not withered away.</P>
    <P>The delegation of authority provided for in the Bill is satisfactory.  The Minister indicated that he had taken advice on the possible constitutional implications.  However, I doubt that this Bill fulfils the necessity of Government answerability to the Dáil.  Perhaps the Minister will elaborate on the constitutional implications of this issue.  They are not significant but under the Constitution the ultimate appeal and answerability on all issues must and should remain with Dáil Éireann.  We <Col N="1301" /> should not introduce legislation which would militate against that responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister will retain rights of power of direction under the Bill.  I do not understand how certain responsibilities can be delegated to the Civil Service while also giving the Minister the right to retain the power of direction.  This gives the Minister power without responsibility thus reversing the situation to date of civil servants having power without answerability.  We should not create a situation where Ministers can delegate responsibility but avoid answerability.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill of most concern to me and on which we may be challenging it concerns special advisers.  They have been the most pernicious innovation in public administration.  The concept of special advisers and programme managers has got out of hand.  I say that as somebody who once worked in a Minister's office.  We have more than enough talent within the permanent Civil Service to serve the Minister's interests and to defend the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the advisory group which produced the first drafts of this Bill incorporated programme managers and advisers to Ministers.  This explains the Bill from section 11. Special advisers have been the creatures of political patronage.  I could identify many cases where they are an outrageous assault on the taxpayer's pocket.  At best they have been in effective in terms of administration.  They have been effective in terms of politics but the taxpayer should not be forced to pay for people who are good at politics. At worst they have been venal and pernicious and have had a negative impact on political life.  The excessive growth of political programme managers and advisers on the public payroll is a real threat to the way democracy operates.  It breaches the concept of transparency which the Government espouses.  The hallmark of this Government will be the shadowy figures of political hacks who have been elevated to public administration as advisers.</P>
    <P>The enduring figure in the whole scandal of the BTSB is a ministerial Svengali standing on the steps of the Fours Courts phoning his Minister to say that the ex-Secretary of the Department did not hang him out to dry.  We do not need this level of political advisers and I am worried that they are being given statutory recognition.  Ministers need political advisers, especially in an era of Coalition Governments where it is necessary to have people from a political background to help solve cross-party differences which inevitably arise.  However, we are embarking on a dangerous path by giving these people statutory recognition.  When my own party returns to Government I will be suggesting a review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a few weeks.  This Bill was heralded as a significant reform and there are excellent elements in it, but there are also areas <Col N="1302" /> which need to be challenged.  For example, I would not like to see this Bill becoming an institutional basis for the endless appointment of more and more advisers.</P>
      <P>This Bill is, to a degree, trying to achieve a balancing act between taking power from Ministers and allowing them to retain ministerial discretion. That is a weakness in the Bill.  It creates a situation where Ministers can duck individual responsibility.  The Bill is also problematic in that the security of a Civil Service appointment is raised.  The Minister made the point, and I am sure he was sincere, that the new appointment arrangements for Civil Servants are not in any way intended to undermine the careers of civil servants.  People sometimes sneer at the security and permanency of the Civil Service but one of the great features of the appointment system is that it has created civil servants who are secure in the knowledge that when they serve the public and national interest, they are not subject to the whim of some politician or the whims of other individuals in a higher office than them.  We have to be very careful about changing that.  I was a civil servant and the fact that a civil servant had security, in so far as it effectively required a memorandum to Government to dismiss one, provided many people with a charter for &ldquo;feather bedding&rdquo; on the one hand but, on the other, it provided people with a sufficient degree of confidence in themselves to allow them to question and pressurise Ministers.  They were not always obliged to say &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo;.  There are good and bad points in this Bill.  I will be listening specifically to the responses on the issue of advisers and the impact of the Bill on democratic responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for coming into the House today and I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle.  Both have done a great deal of work on this Bill.  This very important legislation will make significant changes to our Civil Service over the coming years.  As Senator Roche said, it has good and bad points.  If we can take the value of all the good points in the Bill, we will have come a long way and I thank everybody responsible for bringing it to this stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>A further principle of good architectural practice, equally applicable to public service management, is that you do not tear down the structures inherited from previous generations just for the sake of it.  In building anew, it is always wise to try to preserve, strengthen and extend whatever has served well in the past and stood the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Bill will do that.  I also hope we will build on this Bill, the foundations of which were laid many years ago in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  The Minister goes on to say: &ldquo;in designing a building a good architect would try to ensure that it is capable of providing all of the <Col N="1303" /> functions required of it, that it is accessible to and meets the needs of present and future users and that it is in sympathy with the environment within which it is constructed&rdquo;.  If those fundamental principles are adhered to this Bill will be very effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill is all about accountability.  Anybody who is not performing in the public service and who is not carrying out their duties and responsibilities should be held accountable.  Everybody would agree with that.  In any business, if one does not perform, one will be held accountable. If people are not performing, that will be brought to the attention of their superiors who will take the necessary action.  The Bill provides for that. It is time such provisions were made and written into law.  Over the past years, various things happened within the public service and the public was crying out for somebody to be held accountable but in many instances, nobody was.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out a formal structure for the assignment of authority and accountability within the Civil Service in a clear and unambiguous manner.  It will ensure clarity in the roles and duties of individual civil servants in order that each person will know what is expected of them either in an individual capacity or as part of a team and will be able to assume responsibility for the results of their work.  The pace and volume of business transacted by Departments have increased enormously in recent years.  For the Civil Service to respond effectively, it is essential that we have in place systems to facilitate decision taking at all levels.  This legislation will also give a basis in law for assigning specific tasks among different Departments and Offices so as to improve the management of issues within cross-departmental boundaries.  The Bill is, therefore, a key element in advancing the overall strategic management process as set out in <i>Delivering Bet-</i><i>ter Government.</i></P>
    <P>Section 4(1) of the Bill seeks to ensure, among other things, that arrangements are in place to maximise efficiency in cross-departmental matters. This will be welcomed.  Over the years we have seen where one Department can effectively hold up the business of another.  Whatever steps can be taken under this legislation to ensure that transactions from one Department to another are carried out effectively and efficiently will be welcomed. One of the other functions contained in this section is to ensure that resources are used in a cost effective manner and that value for money is obtained.  The public is intent on getting value for money in the public service.  We have a great deal of work to ensure that value for money is obtained and the ways this Bill addresses that issue will be welcomed by the public.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that Secretaries/Heads shall have responsibility for the management of all matters relating to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissal of staff below the grade of principal or its <Col N="1304" /> equivalent.  This provision will hold people accountable and will put an onus on Civil Service employees to accept their responsibilities and carry out the duties which have been laid down for them.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill provides for Secretaries/Heads to appear before Oireachtas committees in relation to the strategy statement for their Department/Office.  This will make them accountable for the practical management of their Departments/Offices.  It also provides for other officers to attend at Oireachtas committees. Secretaries/Heads should appear before Oireachtas committees and subcommittees. Those who provide service to the public must ultimately be accountable to them.  The Civil Service can really only be held accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas or its committees.  I welcome this section.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act should be applied to senior management and senior staff in the Civil Service.</P>

    <Title>Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, 1997: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Accountability by the Government to the Dáil has been a fundamental element of our democracy since the foundation of the State and is enshrined in the Constitution.  However, while the theoretical basis of ministerial accountability continues, the growing complexity of modern government has changed the practical character of this accountability.  At first, Departments were relatively small close knit organisations and a Minister might have known personally his higher civil servants and most, if not all, other officers in the Department.  The present position shows how fast our public service is growing, how rapidly our country is expanding and how we are providing better services to the public.</P>
      <P>Looking at ministerial responsibilities, the range and extent of matters for which a Minister is theoretically and legally accountable have become so vast as to make the process of accountability almost unreal.  The notion that a Minister should know about, let alone direct and manage, every action in his Department is unrealistic.  The Minister said issues of importance become personalised and personalities become more important than facts, something we have seen in recent years.  This Bill addresses the majority of those issues and does not remove the Minister from the process of accountability but strengthens the Minister's hand and the structures of central government.  It ensures that the process of accountability is more focused and, accordingly, more realistic, and it creates for the first time a statutory basis for structures and management arrangements in Departments and other offices of central government.</P>
      <P>I hope the thinking behind this legislation will extend to local authorities, health boards, semi-State bodies and urban councils and that they will be put on a similar footing.  Senior management and grades in the local authorities and health boards should be more accountable.  While I acknowledge the majority of local authorities account annually to elected members, such legislation should cover these bodies also.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation, many of aspects of which can be recommended.  It builds on existing structures in the Civil Service.  I compliment the Civil Service, which has provided a valuable service and has carried out many important functions over the years.  This Bill will add to that and make the Civil Service more accountable, which is welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. F. Quinn Mr. F. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, who has been actively involved in the production of the Bill, to the House and the Minister for Finance's speech and his enthusiasm.  I warmly welcome the Bill and <Col N="1306" /> hope it makes its way through the legislative process before a general election is called.  This measure is long overdue and follows on from a series of failed attempts to reform the way our public service is run.  I have great hopes it will work this time.  The Minister explained this is not the final stage.  He used the analogy of an architect and architectural plans and said this is a foundation on which more work will be done in the coming years.</P>
      <P>There are three key words in the Bill on which I will focus.  The first word is &ldquo;management&rdquo;.  It is like a breath of fresh air to hear that word being used openly when speaking about the Civil Service.  For many years there was a refusal to use that word, and the mind set and practices in the Civil Service tended to reflect that.  The public service management school is known as the Institute of Public Administration and not public management.  Civil servants were administrators and not managers.</P>
      <P>From the simple refusal to acknowledge that the Civil Service needed management and not only administration, many bad practices followed. For example, nobody knew who was responsible for what or to what extent.  That situation suited many people who preferred to shelter behind ministerial responsibility.  Recently, we witnessed several examples of where the public service system broke down in terms of meeting its responsibilities to the State which established it.  I hope this Bill will reduce the possibility of such mistakes happening again.</P>
      <P>What is the point about management and administration?  One aspect concerns the devolution of power and the acceptance of responsibilities to the level of the organisation where the power and responsibilities are exercised most appropriately.  Another aspect is that of control. If one puts somebody in charge of a Department, it does not mean a great deal if one does not give him or her the power needed to do the job with which they have been entrusted.  Until now the Secretary of a Department has lacked certain key management controls over his or her staff.</P>
      <P>Another aspect concerns leadership.  Management is the art rather than the science of getting things done by people.  I attended a conference a number of years ago where the speaker asked us to write down in six words or less what the word management meant.  We had to work on it and we came up with words such as &ldquo;delegation&rdquo;, &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  He asked us to suppose that a Martian came to earth and asked us to explain the word.  Eventually, we came up with a definition -getting results through other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old fashioned way to manage was that one told people what to do and expected them to get on with it.  That has been the Civil Service way since the 1920s.  The modern way to manage is to lead people rather than to drive them.  That means leading by example.  It involves setting the tone of the organisation and promoting the values <Col N="1307" /> necessary to achieve the goals the organisation has set for itself.  It means openness to all who work in the organisation and offering them the opportunity to take a meaningful part in decision making.  People involved in management are aware of the importance of the leader of the organisation behaving in a manner that will set standards and examples which he or she expects to be followed.  These issues are encapsulated in the move from the word &ldquo;administration&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;management&rdquo;.  The Bill contains provisions which will make that move possible and that is the main reason why the Bill is welcome. I am enthusiastic about the use of the word &ldquo;management&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second key word in the Bill is &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;. The Bill imposes on every Department and office the requirement to develop a proper strategy. The Minister said the strategy statement is the most important element in the overall framework and I agree with him.  The use of strategy contrasts with the hand to mouth approach of the past 70 years, which was heavily reactive rather than proactive.  It sprang from the notion that the sole reason for the existence of the Civil Service was to administer the spending of Government money and to ensure that the money was well spent.  That was effectively done and, from that point of view, we had a strong and admirable Civil Service.</P>
    <P>However, we must recognise, as this Bill does, that the missions of Departments go far beyond that task.  Departments have long-term aims that have a great effect on the nation and these aims do not change radically when the Government changes.  That might sound like political heresy but it is true.  I see a Department as a huge ship which changes its pilot from time to time.  The pilot will make course corrections, adjust the speed and even set different priorities in terms of the ports visited on the way to the ship's destination. However, the long-term goals of the ship or Department tend to remain untouched over long periods of time.  This is a good rather than bad thing.</P>
    <P>It takes a long time to realise a major goal.  For too long we have inhibited proper strategic planning in Government by building the Civil Service on the fiction that each new Minister starts with a clean sheet.  It is a fiction that has allowed Departments to be run in the absence of a clear long-term strategy and the nation has suffered greatly as a result.  It creates a situation in which people tinker at the edges of problems rather than going to the heart of them.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult for people outside a Department to deal with the Department because they are unaware of its long-term strategy.  The difficulty in dealing with an organisation which has no long-term strategy is that one never knows which way it will jump next.  When one looks at how the State runs its business one sees a forest of <i>ad hoc</i> structures which grew up over time to tinker with <Col N="1308" /> a multiplicity of problems.  Incredibly, there are 150 bodies whose objectives are to tackle the problems of job creation and industrial development. That number is inflated by the number of local bodies, but it demonstrates the absence of a strategic approach.</P>
    <P>We need a strategic focus in the way we run Government, not just because we have large problems that will remain intractable if we only take a short term approach but because we are entering an era of greater change than we have experienced in the 75 years since the foundation of the State.  The information age, for example, creates a new environment.  If we do not prepare properly for the information age we will put at risk the progress we have made during the past 75 years.  We will certainly forfeit our chance of winning a share in the future potential of what is offered by that age.  The information age creates a new environment, not least in education, where the time span is so long that strategy becomes all important.  In recent legislation we have begun to see a recognition of that fact.</P>
    <P>The first and second words in the Bill that caught my attention were &ldquo;management&rdquo; and &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;.  The third word whose inclusion I welcome is &ldquo;customers&rdquo;.  For the first time Government is acknowledging that customers are a central element of the equation.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, has put particular emphasis on this word in the strategic management initiative and it is seeing greater use not only in the Civil Service but throughout State organisations. Customer service is a central element of the equation and everything the State does should revolve around it.  It is a change of profound significance. Once one starts thinking in terms of customers, wonderful things begin to happen. They are already happening.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed chairman of An Post about 18 years ago I visited one of the large sorting offices.  There was a union problem in the office and I was told the postmaster could not see me.  I asked to be allowed to join the group of people who had the problem and when I did so I commented that I had not heard the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; used even once.  The traditional words used were &ldquo;the public&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo;.  For the ten years I was involved in that organisation I set myself the challenge of having the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; used when referring to those who used the service.  I like to think we took steps in that direction, but none went as far as was necessary or as far as the Minister goes in this legislation. Most of the public's criticism of the Civil Service arises from the lack of a customer driven ethos. A customer driven management style could revolutionise the public service.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;management&rdquo;, &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; and &ldquo;customers&rdquo; mean and matter a great deal.  Up to now those words were out of place in the system. They did not fit in with how the Civil Service viewed itself or its role.  As a result it greatly <Col N="1309" /> restricted what could be done.  The mindset was to be reactive, as in administration, rather than proactive, as in management.  It was to be short term rather than long-term and to concentrate on tactics rather than long-term strategy, which was often ignored.  Customers were regarded as irrelevant to the job rather than as the central reason for the job.  Words, attitudes and practices form mindsets, and if we want the mindsets to change, we must change all three.  This Bill attacks the words and some of the practices.  Hopefully, it will also stimulate a change in attitudes.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic about the prospects for the strategic management initiative, the overall project which the Bill seeks to facilitate.  The need to change is now recognised at senior level in the Civil Service and young people at lower levels are hungry for that change.  There is now a will to bring about change.  The road will not be easy or quick but we have no option but to travel it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiation of the Bill in this House and I hope we can improve it during its passage.  I ask the Minister to think again about some of the terminology in the Bill.  Words are most important and some of the words used in the Bill are wrong.  My main concern is the new term we use for the position now known as Secretary of the Department.  I am delighted to see the removal of the word &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; and I appreciated the Minister's story about the translation of the words &ldquo;permanent secretary&rdquo; as &ldquo;everlasting typist&rdquo;.  I have had similar experiences with translators.  The term &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; is a relic from our colonial past which we inherited from the British.  It conjures a picture of a subservient, minor functionary bowing and scraping before the all-powerful Minister.  It does not convey the image of a proactive chief executive of a large and important organisation.  The United Nations has a Secretary General but that title does not help him either.  We do not go far enough by changing the title to Secretary General because the Secretary element with all its unfortunate connotations is retained and it makes the change appear too small to be more than just fiddling around.</P>
    <P>I propose the term &ldquo;director general&rdquo; be used as it has a more proactive and strategic management feel about it.  It is a term we are now familiar with in Ireland as organisations such as RTÉ have a director general and in the EU the top civil servants under each Commissioner are known as director general.  It is proposed in this Bill that the head of the Office of the Attorney General be known as a director general.  I would prefer to go the full distance and call, them chief executives because that is what they are and how they are best regarded.  However, it might not sound official enough, so I am happy to settle for director general.  Nonetheless, I know the Minister has the concept of chief executive in mind so why not use the title?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the convoluted sections attempting to deal with the situation where a <Col N="1310" /> Department has more than one Secretary.  As far as I know, this only applies to the Department of Finance, which has two Secretaries, of which only one is head of the Department.  That situation exists for historical and perhaps not very good reasons.  The manner in which this Bill deals with it is unacceptable.  The title &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; can be played around with, but not the titles &ldquo;director general&rdquo; or even &ldquo;secretary general&rdquo;, because they signify that the holder is head of an organisation. Two people in the one organisation cannot both be the head, so the titles must reflect the hierarchy of the organisation.  I have no problem with two people being of director general rank in one Department, but it is nonsense to give them both the same title.  This makes it more confusing, whereas the lines of command should be clarified and made less ambiguous.  I hope the Minister of State has second thoughts about this before Committee Stage.  If she does not, I will.</P>
    <P>I commend the general thrust of the Bill and wish it well.  I was impressed with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn's, architectural analogy that it is the first step in building this new framework. It is a strong foundation and one which we welcome and which the Civil Service will welcome now and in years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCalnan" hpid="Mr. Calnan Mr. Calnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calnan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, 1997.  Change for the sake of change is unnecessary, but it is needed here because the Ministers and Secretaries Acts date back to 1924.  Many changes have taken place since.  Members of this House are sent huge amounts of material in the form of booklets, papers, EU Directives, EU information, etc., so we nearly need two secretaries each to deal with it. The same pressure applies to Ministers and Secretaries. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, said that in the past a Minister would have known all his staff but it would be impossible today.  New situations need a change in legislation which is why this Bill is necessary and timely.</P>
      <P>Ministers are now greatly involved with the European Union so streamlining and changes in organisation are needed.  We no longer deal with what happens in Ireland but in Europe and the world as well.  The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill:</P>
      <P>.....introduces a statutory basis for the creation of a new management structure for the Civil Service.  The purpose is to enhance the management, effectiveness and transparency of operations of Departments and Offices and to put in place a mechanism for increased accountability of civil servants.</P>
      <P>Those lines are extremely important and should be carefully noted.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>At the same time the discretion of Ministers in charge of Departments of State for the administration of their Departments is virtually unchanged and the collective responsibility of the Government to Dáil Éireann is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> Those are three very important points.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change of name because, for example, one of our senior civil servants, a secretary, visiting Japan had his title translated into Japanese as &ldquo;everlasting typist&rdquo;.  Changes must be made and similar positions in other countries must be examined to avoid such confusion and to give the position an international flavour.</P>
    <P>The memorandum also states:</P>
    <P>.....specified tasks will be assigned to Secretaries General in accordance with various categories as set out in the Government's policy statement <i>Delivering Better Government.</i> The Secretary General will be given formal responsibility, under the Minister, for the day-to-day management of the Department.  This will involve implementing and monitoring policies and delivering the goods and services of the Department to its customers and clients. Other functions include giving advice to the Minister in relation to the wider concerns of his or her Department, making arrangements in relation to cross-departmental matters, examining and developing means to improve the provision of cost-effective services and ensuring that the Department's resources are used appropriately and with respect to value for money.  Subject to existing legislation, Secretaries General will have responsibility for appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal in relation to staff below the level of Principal.</P>
    <P>Clearly defining these items for the new Secretaries General is of paramount importance to allow them to give a good and effective service.</P>
    <P>I also note the Secretary General will be required to prepare and submit a strategy statement to his or her Minister every three years at least and the Minister may approve or amend it. What is important is that the approved statement must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within a specified time limit and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>This is only the first step and further ones must be taken to streamline the Civil Service.  It is important that responsibility for work done is taken in the appropriate place.  Furthermore, the establishment of autonomous State-sponsored bodies should not mean that when a question is asked or a discussion sought in either House of the Oireachtas, we are given the same reply of it being a matter for a semi-State body.  That is not proper in a democracy, because if a serious item is raised in either House someone should answer questions about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad the titles of positions will be changed because some of them are mystifying and out of date.  When special regulations were passed by county councils, the term &ldquo;servants of the county council&rdquo; was used for a long time and has only been dispensed with recently.  Titles such as that ought to be deleted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and fully support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to express my appreciation for the dedication, commitment and performance of the public service since the foundation of the State.  With few exceptions it has performed in an exemplary fashion. I was a Minister and Minister of State in eight Departments over 12 years and had a detailed knowledge of the workings of the public service. Words cannot express my experiences of personal loyalty, dedication and honesty from those I dealt with during 25 years in public life.  From the most junior grades to the highest levels I have found people who are committed to their work and conscious of their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>It is not the fault of the public service that we have allowed its procedures and management practices to remain in the Dark Ages.  Politicians, Governments and Members of both Houses must take responsibility if the public service worked in a bureaucratic and less than productive manner. Little has been done to reorganise it since the foundation of the State.  If modern systems had been introduced those working in the service would have responded positively.  We all share the blame for the shortcomings in the public service. However, we need to be careful when introducing this legislation that we are not creating further bureaucracy.  This legislation is being rushed through to enable the Government to say during the election campaign that it has modernised and streamlined the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the advantage which the Senator did not have of being a Minister and Minister of State in many Governments.  We had antiquated procedures in the public service.  It was the responsibility of Government to change these procedures.  Much of the delay and bureaucracy was due to procedures laid down during British rule.  We had 18th century procedures to deal with 20th century problems.</P>
      <P>This legislation can modernise and streamline the systems under which the public service operates. However, it is only part of an overall scheme which the Government has in mind.  Some of this was dropped because of technical difficulties.  The explanatory memorandum acknowledges that there are technicalities and other matters which need to be resolved.  As a result, part of the intended, initial legislation has been abandoned. Perhaps this will be introduced at a later stage by way of amendments.  There are gaps in the Bill to facilitate this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister outline the technical difficulties? It is unusual for a Minister to say before the conclusion of Second Stage that a Bill will be amended.  The amendments will be substantial.  If the full picture is not to be presented until Committee <Col N="1313" /> or Report Stage then it would be better to withdraw the Bill and wait until everything can be included.  This is why I believe this legislation is an election gimmick designed to convince the public that a major reorganisation of the public service is under way.  However, the major reorganisation is the setting up of the executives.  This is omitted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the opportunity to look carefully at the management and operation of the public service to see if we can set down a framework to allow it meet the challenges of modern communications systems, the information society and the provision of a good service to the public. We would be willing to assist the Minister and the Government if we were convinced that they were genuine about reform.  However, I do not think they are.  This is part of a bigger picture and only that which was agreed is being presented to us to create the impression that something is being done to reorganise the public service.</P>
    <P>The reason for this legislation is to put a statutory framework in place for special advisers. Special advisers have been spoken about for quite a while and we have seen the expansion of their role and activities, especially since the Labour Party entered Government.  I will not go into the criticism of the hiring and introduction of special advisers to Ministers.  Part of the reorganisation in this legislation is to enable the executive of the Civil Service to advise Ministers.  This is set down clearly in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a second set of special advisers whose qualifications are not set down in this legislation. The section which deals with them is short and says Ministers shall appoint special advisers. There is no indication as to whether these advisers require any expertise in the area of activity of the Department for which the Minister is responsible.  What is the purpose of setting down a statutory framework for special advisers unless we define the necessary qualifications clearly, whether it is experience, expertise, or knowledge of the Department concerned?</P>
    <P>I would have thought that in setting down a statutory framework for special advisers the Government would have availed of the opportunity to outline, perhaps in the Schedule to the Bill, some criteria for the selection of special advisers.  For instance, for the position of special adviser in the Department of the Environment, he or she should have experience in dealing with local authorities and some topical environmental issues such as water charges.  A special adviser in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should be familiar with related matters.</P>
    <P>Under the provision in this Bill for the appointment of special advisers, no qualifications or experience are mentioned, there are no details given as to whether the individual will be a public servant and whether pension rights apply.  The only specification is that the position of the adviser is terminated with the expiry of the Minister's term in office.  If that is the only criteria set <Col N="1314" /> down, what happens when there are five or six Ministers in a Department over a period of four or five years?  For instance, there were many Ministers in the Department of the Marine over a short period.  I set up the Department, John Wilson, the Tánaiste at the time was also Minister for the Marine, along with Deputy Andrews and Deputy Seán Barrett.  There were four Ministers for the Marine within four years.  How can anyone be of assistance in advising any Minister with that many changes?</P>
    <P>A set of guidelines for Ministers in appointing advisers should be included in this legislation.  As for any other people appointed to important positions, some qualifications should be necessary, rather than a Minister hiring a special adviser who has no knowledge, expertise or experience, when under this legislation he can seek advice from a new enhanced service.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be negative about this Bill.  I know from the way it has been put together that it has been taken from overall legislation which was discussed and designed to do a specific job. The acceptable parts which could be agreed were wrenched from that legislation and have been put together in this Bill in a haphazard and piecemeal manner.  Putting a framework like this in place does no service to the public service.  As the Minister indicated before the Second Stage discussion of the Bill even started, it is proposed to amend it.  This rarely happens.</P>
    <P>It is not my style to be negative about legislation which comes before the House.  On all occasions I endeavour to point out deficiencies and suggest remedies to improve legislation.  The Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill, is really the Public Service Management (No. 1) Bill, which was initially introduced in the Dáil and has now been brought back before the Seanad, which I do not object to.  This Bill is an extract from a broader document which set down fundamental changes in the Ministers and Secretaries Acts. These have been set aside to produce this bizarre legislation which is an election gimmick&mdash; nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to the Seanad.  I welcomed the Government's strategic management initiative document <i>Delivering Better Government</i> which was debated in detail in this House.  I thought it represented a step in the right direction.  My party made proposals around this time last year as to how the public service could be reformed.  They were different in tone and content to the Government's document, which nevertheless made a reasonable stab at the matter.  From that point of view, it was welcomed at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does this Bill fulfil the objectives set out in <i>Delivering Better Government?</i>  I do not think it does.  We all know about the centralised nature of our State, the need for change and the fact that technical development and technology has dramatically changed the way in which services must be delivered to the public.  This is accelerating <Col N="1315" /> rather than decelerating in pace.  I think it was Brendan Keenan of the <i>Irish Independent</i> who said that if the former British public servants who were resident in Dublin Castle came back from the great filing cabinet in the sky, they would fit well into the modern structure and <i>modus operandi</i> of the Civil Service.  If that is the case, it dramatically underlines the need for a radical overhaul.</P>
    <P>We need a system which is effective, efficient and rewards effort so that people with initiative in the system are promoted.  This Bill does not fulfil this requirement either.  We are faced with an optical illusion.  Nothing in the Bill will change matters.  It will achieve and do nothing.  Before I read the Bill in detail I thought that perhaps it could be a step in the right direction.  I am not even prepared to concede that, having read the Bill.  There are few specifics.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance was right when he said there is no need to repeal the Minister and Secretaries Act, 1924, and successive Acts.  There is nothing in the Bill which requires their repeal. The Minister said the Civil Service Regulations Act, 1956, would have to be amended.  It is extraordinary to read through the Bill and not find any substantive amendment to either the Ministers and Secretaries Act or the Civil Service Regulation Act.</P>
    <P>When we debated the Freedom of Information Bill, which is welcome legislation and part of the platform of the strategic management initiative, many of us made the point that, irrespective of what that legislation sought to achieve, if the culture of the public service and local authorities does not change dramatically and come to terms with the need to provide information to the public, even the laudatory provisions of that Bill will find it difficult to achieve a dramatic overhaul of the degree to which the public will be allowed know.  If that pervasive culture of secrecy does not change, the laudatory provisions of that Bill will find it very difficult to penetrate that edifice.</P>
    <P>That contrasts with my experience of the EU Commission which is much more open and from which it is much easier to acquire information. Senator O'Kennedy has more experience in that regard and I am interested to know if he agrees with that observation.  I suspect he does.</P>
    <P>I also bow to the fact that Members with Cabinet experience have contributed to the debate. They obviously have more experience and bring a different perspective to the debate.  Nevertheless, that does not prevent us from making legitimate criticisms of the Bill because, from our experience of dealing with the public service, we know where it could be improved.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have congratulated the public service and referred to how much we are indebted to it for the wonderful service it has given the State over the years.  I will not repeat that but, instead, take it as read that we owe our public servants a debt.  The vast majority of them <Col N="1316" /> have worked faithfully and patriotically for the good of the State and its citizens.</P>
    <P>However, where there are deficiencies in local authority staff, the elected public representatives are held accountable for some of those inadequacies and sometimes they have to pay a fairly high price.  That raises the question of the degree to which it is possible to implement discipline and to sort out staffing difficulties in these bodies.  It seems to be extraordinarily difficult to deal with some of those unsatisfactory situations and where they are dealt with, certainly at senior level, it seems to cost the State an extraordinary amount of taxpayers' money.  It appears that some people have been far more highly rewarded for impropriety than for doing their job well and effectively. That must be looked at very seriously because those who do their job well and effectively should be rewarded.</P>
    <P>The fundamental point is that State sector employees cannot be insulated from the gale which sweeps around the private sector in this modern, technological society and to which employees and executives in private companies and bodies are exposed.  We require an open and flexible system which the Bill does not deliver.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is significant:</P>
    <P>A Minister of the Government having charge of a Department shall, in accordance with the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 to 1995, be responsible for the performance of functions that are assigned to the Department pursuant to any of those Acts.</P>
    <P>That underlines my point about how the Ministers and Secretaries Acts remain intact because nothing in this Bill intrudes on any of that legislation. If this legislation were to be effective and good it would intrude on that legislation, require it to be amended and, possibly, repeal sections. The Minister said there was no need to repeal it, which there is not in the circumstances.  However, my contention is that if the Bill were effective, elements of the earlier legislation would have to be amended or repealed.</P>
    <P>There must be a degree to which the public service can be freed from the shackles and bureaucracy which stifle it.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of that task but I believe it is possible to address it with determination and radical thought.  I do not see any evidence of that in the Bill.  It can no longer be denied that the public service should be vulnerable to the influences of commercial realities.</P>
    <P>There must be an accountability which moves downwards through the system.  That does not mean the Secretary General of a Department should just tell an Oireachtas committee about the prepared statement, which appears to be all that will be required of the Secretary General. Section 4(1) (b) states that a duty of the Secretary General shall be &ldquo;preparing and submitting to the Minister of the Government a strategy statement in respect of the Department or Scheduled Office&rdquo;.  It further states that the Secretary General <Col N="1317" /> must appear before the relevant committee to explain that statement.</P>
    <P>There is far more than that at stake here.  My party proposed the creation of a State body which would be above the public service, to which Department Secretaries would report and which would be accountable to a committee of the Dáil. That should be looked at very closely.</P>
    <P>I referred to the ability to deal effectively with the very isolated cases of serious impropriety in the public service.  They must be dealt with in accordance with natural justice but not by the provision of the very large sums of money we have seen given to staff required to leave the service. If a public servant broke the law or was prosecuted and found guilty of fraud but not jailed, would he or she be automatically excluded from the public service?  I am not sure about that. I understand that almost all these cases are a matter for Government decision and take a long time to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which deals with the functions of a Secretary General, refers to &ldquo;managing the Department&rdquo;.  I would welcome the Secretary General managing the Department and being responsible for input and output.  The Secretary General would be given a certain amount of money and would be responsible for how it was spent.  That would separate the political and policy functions of the Department from the administrative functions.  Many activities in Departments, such as the disbursement of social welfare funds, could be devolved to agencies and the focus within the Department should then be on policy making.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a function of the Secretary General is the giving of advice to the Minister. It then addresses the role of advisers and proposes to put them on a statutory footing, which is extraordinary, especially when consideration is given to their proposed powers relative to those of the Secretary General.  Section 11(2) states:</P>
    <P>A Special Adviser to a Minister or to a Minister of State, as the case may be, shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  assist the Minister or the Minister of State, as the case may be, by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  providing advice,</P>
    <P>(ii)  monitoring, facilitating and securing the achievement of Government objectives that relate to the Department....</P>
    <P>Is this not the responsibility of the Minister?  I take exception to a Government importing special advisers in such a manner and granting them that type of power.  Will the next development be statutory provision for consultants, task forces, teams, etc?  The Bill should be confined to the public service, the way it delivers its functions and the manner in which it is effective and efficient.  I do not understand how the appointment of special advisers is a matter for statutory provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> The Bill asserts that the Secretary General will be entitled to manage a Department.  What will this entail other than the production of a strategy statement, which should not be the most important work, and giving effect to an outline of how specific elements of responsibilities are assigned to ensure that functions on behalf of the Minister are performed by an appropriate officer, etc?  Other than what is set out in the strategy statement, the Bill merely nods in the direction of the powers of the Secretary General.  Section 10 states that he or she will &ldquo;...appear before the committee in relation to any strategy statement that has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas...&rdquo; Are there to be no other reasons for appearing before a committee of the Houses?</P>
    <P>The Bill will be significantly amended because it is only a nod in the right direction.  The question of interdepartmental links and how one Department liaises with another must be spelt out in greater detail.  In addition, the question of boards of management must be looked at.  I understand that following a decision by Seán Lemass, weekly board of management meetings were established in the Department of Industry and Commerce whereby the Minister and senior civil servants considered the work of the Department. It was a good way to conduct business.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that powers be devolved downwards and that consideration be given to a code of ethics, an issue about which the public service unions are concerned.  There should be rewards for excellence of commitment.  When the SMI was debated I outlined some of my party's proposals for reform of the public service, which we published approximately one year ago and which I commend to the House.  Many of them could be incorporated into the legislation, which would significantly improve it.</P>
    <P>We must close the culture gap between the public and the private sectors.  We all wish to deliver a better service; I do not suggest that the Minister would wish to do other than that.  It is the objective of all in this House to make it more efficient, accountable, accessible and flexible.  My party will support any proposals in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is extraordinary legislation and the thrust of it is to be welcomed.  However, there are parts I do not understand and I will seek answers to a number of questions.  I welcome the fact that this issue is being addressed and that it is to be given a legislative base.  It is past time that we advanced beyond the 1924 Act.</P>
      <P>The question of dealing with delegation and vision is addressed in section 4.  Subsection (1) (f) states:</P>
      <P>ensuring that the resources of the Department or Scheduled Office are used in a manner that is in accordance with the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, with a view to enabling the matters referred to....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will make the Secretary General the accounting officer.  On almost a daily basis a Secretary <Col N="1319" /> of a Department encounters proposals from the Minister with which he or she does not agree and deems to be a misuse of public funds. For example, a Minister may wish to appoint a teacher to a school in his or her constituency, even though the school is not entitled to the appointment.  Who ultimately makes such decisions?</P>
    <P>Where a Minister decides to overrule a Secretary General by sanctioning the expenditure of money and a subsequent investigation, say by an Oireachtas committee, makes it clear that the money should not have been spent, who takes responsibility?  This is a crucial question because issues surrounding the allocation of resources are vital to building understanding and trust in the operation of a Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it clear that the Secretary General is to take direction from the Minister, which should be the position.  However, while serving the Minister he or she is also the accounting officer.  I fail to understand how he or she can be responsible for the finances of the Department when he or she could be overruled by the Minister when it comes to the allocation of these resources.  This issue must be clarified.</P>
    <P>I disagree with my colleague, Senator Dardis, in that I do not object to special advisers being covered by the legislation.  That is the most honest, open and transparent way to deal with the matter.  There was a case in the past where a special adviser, who apparently was appointed for the lifetime of the Government, was made permanent by the outgoing Minister in the interregnum. The Bill will ensure that does not happen in the future.  People will be reassured by that and respond positively to it.</P>
    <P>I spend much of my life working out the relationships between different groups in terms of who is in charge of what and who takes responsibility. When I wear my manager's hat, I insist that if people have responsibility, they must discharge it.  However, there is a conflict between the roles of the special adviser and the Secretary General. Under section 4(1) (a), the Secretary General is charged, among other things, with monitoring Government policies.  Under section 11(2) (a) (ii), the special adviser is responsible for monitoring the achievement of Government objectives.</P>
    <P>Two people will have the same job, and I learned a long time ago that does not work.  Who is the chief monitor?  Who is in charge?  That is a benign example, but I do not understand the relationship between the Minister's special adviser and the Secretary General of the Department. The Bill states the Secretary General is in charge of the day to day management of the Department and all that involves.  However, I do not understand what function or control the Secretary General will have over the special adviser. Will he or she have the same control over a special adviser as he or she will have over assistant principal officers or assistant directors in the Department?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> If the special adviser is directed to do something by the Secretary General, can the adviser tell the Secretary General that he or she is not their boss?  Is the Secretary General of the Department the special adviser's boss?  The fact that the special adviser is advising the Minister does not add to or take away from that point because many people advise others in different areas.  For example, officials in a Department are secretaries of various committees or commissions but they are still answerable to the Secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the secretary general of a Department will manage all matters pertaining to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissal of staff below the grade of principal officer or its equivalent in the Department or scheduled Office.  Does that extend to special advisers?  This should be made clear in the Bill because we need to know what it involves.  I want to ensure that special advisers are not a type of satellite state or independent republic within Departments.  This aspect is not clear and it should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter relates to the broad principle of how the Bill will affect this House.  I have repeatedly raised the need for the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas to have its own budget and responsibility for its destiny.  I am sure the Minister of State will correct me if my sequence of logic is incorrect but the Bill states that Ministers of Government includes, in relation to a scheduled officer specified in the Schedule, the person who holds the office.  The first reference in Part I of the Schedule is to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the person who holds a parallel position to a Minister is the Ceann Comhairle.  He will have the same control over the Houses of the Oireachtas as a Minister will have over a Department.</P>
    <P>This causes me concern.  What control will it give the Ceann Comhairle over the Seanad as a House of the Oireachtas in terms of its budget, operation and personnel?  A constitutional issue arises in this area which must be considered.  It is a matter of concern if the legislation gives the Ceann Comhairle management authority of some description over the operation of the Seanad in the same way as a Minister has over a Department. This needs to be addressed.  There should be a clear understanding that the discretion and autonomy of the Seanad as defined in the Constitution needs to be protected.</P>
    <P>If conflict arises between a Secretary General and a Minister, who has the final say about the spending of money, particularly if it is unacceptable to the Comptroller and Auditor General?  What is the relationship between ministerial advisers and the Secretary General?  Is the Secretary General the boss of political advisers or are they independent free spirits?  Given the Ceann Comhairle's position under the Bill, will he have authority over the operation of the Seanad?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify these matters.  I am sure other conundrums will <Col N="1321" /> arise but none of these aspects is insurmountable or reasons the Bill should fall.  However, they should be addressed and clarified.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4, which relates to the responsibility and accountability of Departments and Offices.  Apart from the aspects I mentioned, there is a good balance in terms of the relationship between the Minister and the Secretary General. It is obvious the Minister must take responsibility and this is a crucial point.  I hesitate to raise the example of the Blood Transfusion Service Board but in terms of advice, it appears the Minister of the day takes the best advice available and makes the correct decision.  It may be that he or she takes the best legal or economic advice but, having taken it, he or she must say they are the Minister and they want to include a political input or his or her own judgment.  The Bill makes that possible.  I am particularly encouraged by the provision which requires the Secretary of the Department to prepare and submit a strategy statement to the Minister.  I have had many rows with officials in the Department of Finance; I have castigated certain Departments for what I described as their lack of vision and on occasion I have said that there is a danger of senior departmental officials becoming visionless and missionless.  This strategy statement requires people to think at least for the medium term, to have vision and objectives and to assess the outcome of their strategies.  That is good management and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the secretary general, as the chief executive of the Department, should have responsibility for the appointment, discipline and dismissal of officials of the rank of principal officer or director down.  That is correct, and it is not before time that it became part of the responsibility of that office.  A reference to correct procedures, even if they are implied or understood, should be put into this section, especially after reading <i>Delivering Better Government</i> and listening to the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Appointments should be considered, especially the appointment of personal advisers.  We should recognise what the personal adviser does.  He or she understands the Minister's role and has probably worked with the Minister.  We should be open about this: it is a political appointment and should be dealt with properly.  The Minister and her advisers should look at the Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills with relation to how special advisers to Ministers are appointed. Those appointments must also be open, transparent and follow procedures.  If the same procedures are not to apply, that should be written into this Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal that it would be the duty of the secretary general to see, on behalf of the Minister, that particular tasks and responsibilities are performed by an appropriate officer of an appropriate grade or rank of the Department concerned is heartening.  This is important because, in my ten years in the House, no party, including the Minister of State's, has not condemned Ministers <Col N="1322" /> from the Opposition benches for blaming civil servants when matters go wrong.  My view is that if a person makes a mistake, it does not matter whether that person is a civil servant, Member of the Oireachtas, Minister, Ceann Comhairle or Cathaoirleach.  That person should take the responsibility for the mistake and should not hide from that responsibility.  It is better for people's understanding of their roles that they be given responsibilities they take seriously.</P>
    <P>My theory of management is that I would not appoint people who would not make mistakes.  I do not trust staff who do not make mistakes because they are not stretching themselves to their full potential.  This is not about finding people out but getting them to work to the limits of their potential.  It may not be appropriate to include this in the Bill, but the two most significant aspects of management are the recruitment of appropriate staff and the development of staff to their potential.  A major error in the Civil and public service is the appointment of people on the basis of what they have achieved rather than on the basis of their potential.</P>
    <P>The great trick of appointments is to select people on the basis of how they can develop.  If people were appointed on what they had achieved to date, they would be at their zenith before appointment and the best appointments would not be made.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unclear on the relationship between the secretary general, the accounting officer and the Minister.  Who decides where the money is spent if the Minister says yes and the secretary general says no?  Who is responsible if, at a later stage, a committee of the House or the Comptroller and Auditor General decides that the money was spent incorrectly?  The Minister's duties are clear, but the responsibilities are not as clear. What is the relationship between the special advisers to the Minister and the secretary general of the Department?  Are they part of the Department and answerable to the secretary general in matters of dismissal and discipline?  The Ceann Comhairle's office is now correctly nominated in the First Schedule as being parallel to a Minister. That gives him control of the Houses of the Oireachtas and there may be a constitutional point at issue here if the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil has certain controls over the operation of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I endorse without qualification the Minister's speech on introducing the legislation and I also endorse, if not entirely without qualification, the Bill's contents.  I query whether the actions measure up to the lofty and commendable statements.  Who could gainsay the Minister saying that these proposals transcend partisan interests and go to the core of constitutional democracy?  Any student of consti-The Government's purpose in introducing this new management structure and promoting proper roles for advisers and programme managers is to <Col N="1323" />&ldquo;transcend partisan interests in the interests of constitutional democracy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is an extraordinary statement with regard to the role of the programme managers, who are now concerned only with partisan interests.  Anyone in Leinster House will see those advisers and programme managers scurrying around with two priorities: the electoral success of the Minister for whom they work and the success of the Government on which they depend.  Nobody would accept that their role is wholly one of transcending partisan interests when that very role is partisan.  Lofty statements have been characteristic of this Government, from the beginning declarations of openness, transparency and accountability, and there is an apparent notion that if one says something often enough, people will accept that this is what is happening.  The opposite has been happening in many ways.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the very idea of responsible public service is to be responsible to the public, a statement with which I have no problem.  Has anyone listened to the public reaction?  Are they satisfied that the activities of the public service are responsible to them?  Have they any doubts on that front?  Do they accept that the only role of programme managers is to be responsible to them?  The Minister must think the people are extremely gullible.  They know that the managers, consultants and advisers which have been a feature of this Government are responsible only to the electoral interest of their particular Minister and the Government.  Is it suggested, in this readable script, that spending £34 million on consultants is being responsible to the public, that it serves them and no one else and has nothing to do with the partisan interests of Government? Does the Government think the people are so naive that they will swallow something simply because it has been stated as a lofty principle?  Of that £34 million my constituency colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, had the benefit of £12 million.  He would have authorised those payments.  Is it seriously suggested that this was first, foremost and exclusively a matter of responsibility to the public?  Does anyone think the people are that gullible?  When the performance is vastly different to the lofty statements and loudly proclaimed commitments, the programme managers and advisers scurry around the corridors of Leinster House, as they are doing at present, to prepare their Ministers for the best possible presentation in the forthcoming election. It may not be unreasonable or extraordinary, but to present it in another light is the ultimate in political hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste is mentioned in the Constitution. I served under a number of Tánaistí who held significant offices, whether in the capacity of Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Transport and Power, Minister for Finance, etc., and had private offices to enhance their role. However, for the first time in the history of the <Col N="1324" /> State this Government has a Tánaiste who was not satisfied with the extensive, sophisticated, professional services and back-up of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In his vigorous support for reform of the public service he introduced a new element, a separate Office of the Tánaiste. This cost the taxpayer well over £1.7 million last year and we are supposed to be grateful that it has been reduced to £1.3 million this year.  The Minister for Finance is also mentioned in the Constitution&mdash;I was one such Minister.  May a future Minister introduce a separate Office of the Minister for Finance, separate and distinct from the normal Department office?  May he or she add another layer and back-up group to look after his or her interests?</P>
    <P>These bland, lofty, high sounding commitments are exposed as hypocrisy when we see what is happening in our public service.  I have no trouble supporting the principles in the Minister's statement; but having regard to my experience of members of this Government, the Tánaiste in particular, I find it impossible to find a shred of credibility in this approach.  The Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen how effective judicial tribunals have been in exposing certain aspects of major issues of public interest and importance.</P>
    <P>Have we, indeed?  The Tánaiste, when in Opposition as Leader of the Labour Party, demanded that the beef tribunal have power to send for persons and papers.  As Minister for Agriculture and Food, I agreed to that demand and built it into the tribunal's terms of reference.  That same gentlemen, along with the other great proponent of openness, transparency and accountability, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, refused to disclose their sources and provide papers.  They may not have been the only Ministers to do so. Deputy Rabbitte referred to an anonymous banker who could not be found.  These same people wanted us to send for persons and papers, and after all that we are supposed to believe this speech.  The Tánaiste who demanded the power to call persons and papers and, as Leader of the Labour Party in this Government, expanded his office at great cost to the taxpayer, is the same person who failed and refused to act on his own demand.  Let us have some honesty and consistency in public life.</P>
    <P>This presentation is meant to be plausible and is full of high sounding principles.  The Minister who presented it in the House is one for whom I have regard, but this is not a matter of personal judgment.  In practice we see the opposite to this statement.  Let us give an example of what the programme managers are doing in Government &mdash;the Minister currently in the House knows this better than anyone.  In 1980, in my capacity as Minister for Finance, I introduced a budget.  Not one hint, whisper or vague signal of what was in my Budget Statement emerged beforehand.  The first anything was known about what it contained <Col N="1325" /> was when I spoke.  That was a great tribute to the public service.  I was so impressed that I asked the then Secretary of the Department to bring everyone responsible, from typists to advisors, to my office so that I could formally thank them.  I saw it as a recognition of their service.  The following day over 40 public servants came to my office.  In those days one could rely on the public service to behave confidentially, responsibly and with total commitment to the Minister.</P>

      <P>One certainly cannot &mdash;the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Finance, will acknowledge the change which has occurred as a result of the programme managers we are asked to build into this legislation in the interests of the public.  Was it not obvious that the last budget was known in all its detail because every programme manager and special adviser had only one interest, which was to promote the persona and image of his or her Minister?  The difference between the service we had and the service now is vast and the Minister for Finance will confirm this.</P>

      <P>That comment is typical of the snide remarks to be expected from this Government. The plethora and growth of programme managers and special advisers has undermined the status and confidentiality of the public service. I never had a PR adviser&mdash;the Minister might say that that was obvious.  We believed that our primary responsibility in Government was to promote the welfare of the public and not the image of the Minister.  The present Government have turned away from this concept, and yet Ministers have the gall to come to this House saying that all they are doing is serving the public.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that &ldquo;the notion that every Minister can even know about, let alone direct and manage, every action everyday in his or her Department is absurd&rdquo;.  I endorse that view.  Will somebody tell the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and the Minister for State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbittee, that this is the view of the Minister for Finance, because they attacked me day after day when I Minister for not knowing what every individual officer or vet in every single factory was doing.  This was the basis of their attack on a daily basis.  The ultimate hypocrisy is that now they realise that the basis of their attack was spurious, unfair and unreasonable.  If they check the Dáil Official Report they will find that the present Tánaiste has cost us more in terms of expenditure than anyone else and that, as Deputy Burke said in the Dáil yesterday, he still has not presented his bill&mdash;in which his brother will have a major input&mdash;for the beef tribunal of over £1 million, that he is waiting until the election is over, and we are asked to accept that this is above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> I believe in Government accountability, ministerial and collective responsibility and confidentiality. When in Government I not only believed in confidentiality, I practised it and never even hinted to journalists in corridors about confidential matters.  We hear about &ldquo;sources close to Government&rdquo; but it would have been a betrayal of the trust placed in me as a member of Government to try to improve my image at the expenses of others.  Unfortunately, that practice has long been discontinued.  There is now competition for sources of information rather than attributions.  I regret that that has happened and I hope it will be corrected, but not simply by statements like this.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the Dáil the Taoiseach said Ministers in the Government in which I served were responsible for causing problems by not being ready to disclose to the beef tribunal information it required.  I was ready to disclose everything I was asked.  Unlike the Tánaiste, we cannot be criticised for not co-operating.  It is not a breach of confidentiality to say what was not decided or discussed by Government because that does not come under the heading of collective confidentiality. I am saying that the Government of which Deputy Ray Burke and I were members, never decided to introduce what some people call a management policy for the beef industry confining export credit to two companies.  Saying this is not a breach of confidentiality and I am happy to say this now in support of what Deputy Ray Burke said in the Dáil yesterday.  We will not be accused by the Taoiseach of concealing information when we were ready to say what we did not do, which was presented to the tribunal as being of importance.  Perhaps the tribunal was frustrated in that we were not allowed to answer honestly and openly what did happen.</P>
    <P>Confidentiality and collective responsibility, bedrock principles of the Constitution, should be restored to the Civil Service thereby ensuring a happy and healthy relationship with our public servants.  Every day we fail to do this we drag the public service into the political mire with us.  Let us look hard at our Constitution and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no reference to management. As an ex-Minister for Finance I know the problem of traditional linkages in the public service which result in a proliferation of inflationary wage claims.  This problem, which involves considerable sums of public expenditure, should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I endorse the idea of mobility within the public service.  I served in more Departments than anyone&mdash;Education, Transport and Power, Agriculture, Labour, Finance and Foreign Affairs. Nobody has a similar record.  Mobility is essential within the public service.  One regards the Minister for Finance and his Department as the chief custodian and everybody else has to be watched, guarded, controlled and regulated.  Going around the country I hear Government candidates saying that the Department of Finance is responsible for <Col N="1327" /> not providing, for example, matching funds for the green £ adjustments rather than the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is a strange concept of public service management. Mobility within the service is essential. Each Department needs to have a much better understanding of the function and role of other Departments rather than a selective, suspicious or guarded notion of other Departments.  No Department should think that it, and it alone, is the custodian of rectitude in the public service.  I was privileged to serve in some senior Departments and I would greatly encourage mobility within the service so that the people in the Department of Justice would not think they are the only ones who can deal with the security of the State, people in the Department of Finance would not think they are the only ones who are responsible and prudent, people in the Department of Foreign Affairs would not think they are the only ones who are enlightened, informed and sensitive, and people in the Department of Agriculture would not think they are the only ones who can look after the interests of our basic economy. Mobility, to which the Minister makes no reference, is an essential ingredient in good public service management.  I commend the principle in the Minister's statement but I do not accept the practice.</P>

      <P>I have not had the opportunity of devoting the degree of attention to this Bill I wished to as it comes in the same week as the Committee Stage of the Universities Bill.  That Bill is a matter closer to my heart than this one.</P>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill and I welcome the Minister's acknowledgment in his speech of the unreality of Parliament's role in terms of its relationship with the public service. Every Member of the Oireachtas knows that the constitutional relationship, in terms of hiding the bleak and brutal realities of the influence of the Oireachtas on the bulk of legislation, is a cosmetic one.  There is a lovely phrase in the Minister's speech which refers to &ldquo;bringing the collective wisdom of the Oireachtas into the process of administrative reform&rdquo;.  I have my doubts as to how many civil servants consider wisdom as emanating from the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There is a sad paragraph&mdash;I am not saying it is an inaccurate one&mdash;in the Minister's speech which reads:</P>
      <P>Let us make no mistake about it.  There are those who do not wish reform to touch their official lives.  There are others who regard it as a passing fad...  Reluctant travellers along the road to reform need to be jolted out of their lethargy and complacency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very sad comment to have to make on parts of the public service 75 years into independence. It is fair to say that the recruitment process, which followed very carefully thought out lines, succeeded by and large in attracting high quality candidates into the Civil Service and carried <Col N="1328" /> out its part of the task reasonably effectively. That must mean that a significant number of people were recruited into the Civil Service without their potential being realised once they were in it.  One has to ask why this is so.  If what the Minister says is correct&mdash;I am not in a position to challenge him on it, nor would I want to&mdash; then it is a sad commentary on the quality of personnel management.  Given that it is accepted that there is enormous potential within the Civil Service, the question arises as to how one succeeds in releasing and optimising that potential.  Does this Bill achieve the objective of releasing latent energy in the public service and will it go further to energise those members of the service who are, apparently, lethargic and complacent at present? Will it allow those who are not lethargic or complacent to fly higher without being dragged down by those who are?  I do not know the answer to that question.  I would like to think it will, because anything which brings the constitutional situation closer to reality would hopefully result in improved performance.  I can see how the Bill might achieve that and I can also see where it might fall down.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the concept of outputs, however repellent the term itself may be, into the criteria for assessing performance.  The Minister is correct in saying that inputs and service, which were not designated in any specific way, constituted the public and self image of what comprised a good Civil Service performance.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the issue of providing policy advice, which is the highest function one associated with senior civil servants.  That seems to take a subordinate role in the Bill or seems not be highlighted in the way it should be.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see some rationale in the Minister's speech for the use of the term &ldquo;secretary general&rdquo;. This is another piece of verbal inflation to bring us into line with our European colleagues.  Perhaps the Minister is correct in saying that the term has more than a cosmetic significance, I hope it has.  I do not like to think that we would do something simply because it is the norm elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Whereas the secretary general and other officials are responsible for providing policy advice, special advisers simply provide advice. The word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; has been dropped.  There is no upper limit on the number of special advisers who may wish to contribute their individual or collective wisdom to Government Departments.  It would be interesting to know how many special advisers it is envisaged to have for particular Departments at particular times.  Special advisers are to monitor, facilitate and secure the achievement of Government objectives.  They are going to have to have considerably different skills for monitoring in addition to the political skills upon which their appointments will be based.  While their terms and conditions of employment will be such as will be determined by the Minister for Finance, it seems to me that no particular recruitment criteria are applied to special advisers. There are certain standards required for entry <Col N="1329" /> into the normal Civil Service but this seems to be left completely open in regard to the qualifications of special advisers.  Perhaps this is a good thing.  I am not suggesting one has to have a particular set of qualifications to be an effective special adviser, but it would be nice to have some sort of description provided as to what the requirements for the job are.  The Minister's speech is strikingly vague on the special adviser section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to strategy, the secretary general must prepare a strategy statement.  Who can be opposed to strategy?  At present, every institution in the country is producing a strategy statement. I suspect that many of us are so busy writing strategy statements that we have very little time to get on with the work on which we are producing the statements.  I am not opposed to strategy statements in principle but I would like to see mechanisms of co-operation and co-ordination with other Departments or agencies to be specifically required in strategy statements.  We have a huge problem in regard to the fragmentation of decision making.  That cannot be helped in certain respects.  Increasingly, State organisations do not correspond to the type of problems which arise. Problems do not slot easily into the pigeon holes, which are the designated Departments of State.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms for securing sustained co-ordination and co-operation should be among the main issues we should address in terms of public administration.  While there are interdepartmental committees and a host of mechanisms in place, we need, as integral part of any strategic management for the public service, a statement or strategy on how co-operation can be optimised between Departments on an ongoing basis rather than on a type of bush fire basis or by setting up an <i>ad hoc</i> task force, although they naturally have a part to play.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to cross departmental matters and the assignment of responsibility in that regard, which is welcome.  The mechanisms and implications of that need to be teased out and thought through in a more sustained and systematic way.  Many of the problems which fall between Departments, or even between different sections in the same Department, are borderline ones where the key quality of decision making must be improved.  The Civil Service performs extremely well, although it must work in inherited problem areas.  In terms of adapting to change, it is a rather different matter.  In so far as structures can help adapt to change, that is where the focus should be in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Responsibilities should change rapidly.  How much are incentives and salary structures changing? What is proper remuneration for senior civil servants?  If civil servants are to take on more explicit responsibility, how will they be recompensed? One may say that if they take blame where it is due, they should be given praise where it is due.  It is, however, human nature for politicians to want to take the praise.  There is a <Col N="1330" /> danger that civil servants will be left to take the blame and politicians and others will siphon off praise where possible.  How will civil servants be compensated for these extra responsibilities? Senior civil servants doing their job properly are grossly under-remunerated while those doing their job badly are probably grossly over-remunerated, but then most of us who do our jobs badly are grossly remunerated anyway.  I echo Senator O'Toole's concern, if his understanding of the Bill is correct.  His concern would be a serious matter for this House and would have to be looked at closely on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Most of what I wanted to say has already been said.  This Bill will not result in the most important legislative changes since the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  It will give extra status to some in the Civil Service and will make them more accountable than heretofore.  In recent years the Civil Service has contributed greatly to the development of the State.  This country is now referred to as the Celtic Tiger as a result of the success which has been achieved by the State.  That would not have been possible without a dedicated public service.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the image of the civil servant has changed dramatically.  People with certain leaving certificate results entered lower grades of the Civil Service and moved up the scale.  Regardless of whether they were good at their job, they were promoted.  Thankfully, that has changed in recent years and civil servants must perform their duties like those in other sectors.  The image of Flann O'Brien and the Scotch House and civil servants leaving with nobody knowing where they had gone has disappeared.  They were badly paid and in jobs for which they were not suited.  The situation has changed and this Bill addresses those issues.</P>
      <P>Changing titles will make no difference to what happens in the Civil Service and the Minister was naive when the suggested senior civil servants abroad are called chief executives officers or secretaries general.  That is no reason to change the title of a Department head from Secretary to secretary general and Assistant Secretary to assistant secretary general.  In the past when changes in titles took place there was an increase in pay. Changing a title will not change people's attitudes and create a more efficient Civil Service than that in the past.</P>
      <P>Today people entering the Civil Service are specialists and I hope they continue to work in the service for the good of the public.  I agree civil servants must be adaptable and that we must remove anonymity in the Civil Service.  We must ensure the public has access to an open Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like other speakers, am a little worried about the role given to people, whether we call them spin doctors, managers or otherwise, brought in by Ministers on short term contracts.  The Bill does not specify how these people will be <Col N="1331" /> recruited other than to say the Minister has the right to choose them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In every other sector of the public service people must have certain expertise before being appointed.  This Bill enshrines the idea of temporary contract public servants whom the Minister may appoint.  The reason for such appointments is not spelled out other than to say the Minister may appoint such people and is responsible.  There is no criteria other than the fact they may be friends of the Minister.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not deliver better government.  I am not sure the reason for its introduction other than to change titles.  While the Bill does nothing to attract people from the private sector into the public sector, I hope it will help public servants to assist the public.  I hope amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage stating the manner in which short-term contract staff may be brought in by Ministers.  Everybody is dismayed at the cost of such workers.  In addition, they might be employed by one Minister and, if his or her portfolio is changed, he or she will bring them with him or her to the other Department.  That will do nothing for continuity in a Department in terms of expertise.  Perhaps the Minister of State will address this problem, as the public has grave reservations about it.  She should also outline any other criterion for appointing temporary public servants other than that they should be friends of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome.  It not the most important Bill ever brought before the House, even if the Minister claimed it was the most important legislative provision affecting the administration of central government since the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  He is free to believe that, but it will not change anything.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their considered contributions on this legislation.  It is the most important legislation affecting central administration since the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  I do not claim it is the most important legislation ever brought before the House but, in terms of legislation which affects administration, it is and I support the Minister, Deputy Quinn's, assertion to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Roche surprised me with the vehemence of his attack on the special adviser system and his characterisation of it as a pernicious development.  I do not agree with him and neither, in practice, does his political party. Special advisers have been part of the administrative landscape for some time under Governments of all persuasions and they have performed a useful role.  My party, perhaps more than any, was opposed to the concept of special advisers and programme managers, which was introduced by a Fianna Fáil led Government.  However, we <Col N="1332" /> have come to understand how important these people can be in an Administration, so we are not playing politics with the issue.  It might have suited us to be consistent in our message but we have come to accept the Fianna Fáil view.  I am amazed to hear Fianna Fáil Senators criticising a concept which they initiated some time ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will concentrate on the sections to which Senator Roche took exception. The section relating to special advisers provides that the Government may do, at the request of a Minister, what is currently done by Ministers themselves through the use of unestablished appointments under the Civil Service Acts.  It specifies the duties of those appointed and excludes them from exercising functions assigned to others under the Bill or functions assigned to Ministers under any other Act.  It avoids confusion about their accountability for tasks assigned to them.  They are accountable to the relevant Minister or Minister of State and they do not, as would be the case without this provision, fall within the category of staff who will derive their functions from the secretary-general or head of an office and be accountable to him or her.  A number of Senators in addition to Senator Roche wondered if they would be accountable to the secretary-general.  They will not.</P>
      <P>The section does not put an obligation on the Government to make such appointments and it does not preclude the appointment to such posts of serving civil servants, as was the case under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the past and as is currently the case with the programme manager in the Department of Social Welfare.  The section should not give Senator Roche and other Senators who queried it grounds for concern.  I can allay the Senator's fears that it was a stroke pulled by the programme managers in the Minister's advisory group.  It was not.  There is no compulsion in the section and its presence does not mean that future Governments will have to appoint special advisers and programme managers. It simply regularises the <i>de facto</i> position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Roche that ministerial responsibility has been a constraint on public service reform.  Whether it should have been so is questionable.  Considerable time has elapsed since Senator Roche escaped from what was the Department of Economic Planning and Development and it is even longer since he left the former Department of Transport.  Things have changed for the better and are still changing.  He was correct in identifying the crucial importance of the concept of ministerial responsibility.  He identified a number of its malign consequences which include giving the Civil Service an excessively centralised structure, an overly bureaucratic system, an oppressively secretive culture, an impenetrable anonymity and ways of doing business which are not adequately client oriented.  I agree; <Col N="1333" /> I could have written the same list.  The purpose of the strategic management initiative, which was formally launched under a Taoiseach from the Senator's party, is to address these issues.</P>
    <P>The objective of the new management structure provided for in this Bill is to raise performance, increase efficiency and deliver better quality services to citizens.  However, the legislation is only one part of this ongoing process.  Issues of performance management, quality services and best practice in human resource management cannot be dealt with fully simply by changing the law.  This Bill is not the last word on this issue.  It provides the foundation for the new structures and empowers agents of change within the public service.  It should be seen as a first step towards making accountability more real, developing better management practices and giving the taxpaying public a better deal from the public service.</P>
    <P>Senator Roche expressed concern about the centralisation of administration.  The Government has appointed the devolution commission to examine specific functions of central Government which could be considered for devolution to regional or local authorities.  The culture of secrecy is being dismantled through the enactment of the freedom of information legislation and the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995, Report Stage on which will be held in the Dáil next week.  The impact of the new management structure provided for in the Public Service Management (No. 2) Bill will amplify the benefits of these legislative changes and add to the increasing openness of this Government.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to provide Ministers with a charter for opting out of responsibility.  I can give Senator Roche the assurance he sought about the constitutionality of the Bill in this regard.  The Minister will remain legally responsible for everything done by or within his or her Department. The Bill prescribes the elements of the operation of a Department which must by statute involve the Minister.  The Minister, either as the holder of a portfolio or as a member of the governing collective in Cabinet, will determine policy, approve or amend the strategy statement prepared by the secretary-general at regular intervals, have the authority to amend its amendment and or require its amendment in light of changing circumstances, have the power to give a direction in writing to a secretary-general and retain authority for performance and discipline of senior staff at his or her Department.  On each of these issues the Minister will legitimately and personally be answerable to the Oireachtas.  A strategy statement cannot be presented to the Oireachtas without the Minister's approval.  If a strategy goes wrong there is no hiding place for the Minister.  If it is not properly adjusted to changing circumstances, he or she must intervene.  If action is taken or not taken where needed on foot of a ministerial direction, the Minister can be called to account.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> In practice it will take time for Deputies and Senators to evolve their response to the new structures and how they will operate the machanisms of accountability within the Houses of the Oireachtas, such as parliamentary questions or committee debates.  The relationship between the answering of parliamentary questions with the changed areas of responsibility was mentioned by several Senators.</P>
    <P>Senators Burke and Calnan and others made excellent contributions.  I cannot emphasise enough that this is the first legislative step in a wider process.  We have targeted the Civil Service as the first institution where we will apply a new management system.  We have given it priority because other Government services link into various Departments.  As the impact of change is felt in Departments, the process of extending it to the health service and the local authorities, as Senator Burke proposed, will get underway accordingly.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to the Minister for Finance's reference to possible amendments. Only one part of the Bill may be left aside.  Our intention was to provide a short section to allow for the establishment by Government order of executive bodies to take on executive tasks of Government.  The model we had in mind was that provided for local government and health boards in the Corporate Bodies Act for these areas.  Our legal advice is that this broad brush approach, covering everything from prisons to ordnance survey, could encounter constitutional difficulties. Rather than delay the other mainline provisions in the Bill, we decided to proceed with them alone.  If the Attorney General's Office finds a solution before Committee Stage, we will deal with it by amendment.  If not, we will deal with it on our return to Government in the series of Bills arising from the strategic management initiative.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis said this Bill does not meet the scheme set out in <i>Delivering Better Government.</i>  I only partly agree with him because it is one of a mosaic of measures, some statutory and in preparation, others being progressed with administratively at present.  It does not stand alone.  It sets out a basic framework which, if enacted, accelerates the culture shift now taking place within the Civil Service.  Senator Dardis cited another measure, the Freedom of Information Bill, which is also part of that mosaic. He commented, as did Senator Roche, on our high level of centralisation.  We recognised that problem shortly after coming into Government and established a commission on devolution to tackle the problem in a root and branch way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also complained about the Ministers and Secretaries Acts not being repealed. These Acts, relating to the powers of Ministers, do little more than replicate fundamental obligations on Ministers deriving from the Constitution <Col N="1335" /> which specify that they be in charge of Departments.  If Senator Dardis favours repeal, he must go the hard road of constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole, in his broad contribution, asked whether the secretary general would have authority over programme managers and special advisers.  They will not.  The Ceann Comhairle similarly cannot have authority over the operation of Seanad Éireann.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the Schedule.  The Ceann Comhairle is specified in it because most staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas are joint staff and the Ceann Comhairle is the appointing authority under the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, 1959.  The accounting officer for the Houses of the Oireachtas is the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn identified the three words used in this Bill as &ldquo;management&rdquo;, &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo;.  It comes as no surprise that a person intimately concerned with the management of a large organisation, who must continually develop commercial strategies to meet intense competition and who has a justified reputation for putting the customer first, should see these core issues so clearly.  These are the words in the Bill which stand out for him.  It is no accident that these terms appear in the context of this Bill.  The philosophy which drives my determination to organise an effective process of public service reform is encapsulated in these three terms, to which I add &ldquo;action&rdquo;.  The Government's determination to make progress on these fundamental issues is exemplified by our action in bringing these proposals before the House today.  I share Senator Quinn's enthusiasm for what these three terms imply.  I am determined to see that the changes they promise in the business of the public service comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy's contribution was a single transferable rant and I wonder what it had to do with the Bill.  Given the charged atmosphere, I understand his position on it.  He mentioned that the link between public service groups should be addressed.  Legislation is not the solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole made an important point in referring to section 4(1)(f) on the responsibility of the secretary general for value for money.  The provision in the Bill parallels the obligations imposed on Secretaries by the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1993, concerning regularity of expenditure and value for money.  Where a Secretary regards some expenditure as not conforming to his or her obligations, he or she so indicates to the Minister and will undertake it only on specific written direction from the Minister and the Secretary is entitled to disclose the written direction to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole suggested that dismissals should be carried out in line with procedures.  The Bill links this new power to the Civil Service Regulations Act, which is being revised.  All disciplinary <Col N="1336" /> matters, including dismissals, are dealt with under law as enunciated by the courts and principles of natural justice.  Any change made will retain these characteristics.  On the same issue, Senator Dardis may be assured that the changes we propose should allow issues of breaches of the law or fraud by civil servants, on which Governments have always taken a rigorous line, to be dealt with more expeditiously than at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis suggested that a secretary general has little input under the Bill, which suggests he thinks that preparing and implementing strategy statements is a minor activity.  One of the complaints made against the Civil Service in the past has been its failure to plan ahead, to be proactive and to anticipate.  The strategy statement provision compels secretaries general to do this. I see it as a matter of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>Senator Lee expressed the hope that high fliers in the Civil Service will be supported by the arrangements provided for in this Bill.  He referred to people whose potential was not realised.  I am tempted to remind the Senator in a jocose way of Sir Humphrey Appleby's comment that high fliers are just low fliers held aloft by occasional gusts of wind.  Bearing in mind the spirit in which he made his remarks, I respond by saying our proposal is designed to provide a new series of arrangement which releases the energy and potential of civil servants and channels it into the betterment of society.  I agree with Senator Lee on the importance of policy advice.  It has always been regarded as the holy grail of top civil servants.  However, we spend vast resources on staff and service delivery and it is essential to ensure that this function is accorded a balancing importance in any statement of a secretary general's functions.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  It has been a wide-ranging debate on what the Minister for Finance and I consider to be the most important legislation to impact on the administration of governance since the 1924 Act.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Legislation such as this makes an enormous difference to the public. It is difficult for people to see the effect of much of the legislation passed.  However, people will soon see the effect of a Bill such as this on the landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the Bill is that it places responsibility on the individual, the community, business and the organisers of <Col N="1337" /> large events to control litter.  We all share the responsibility for the condition of our cities and countryside.  Controlling litter is not just the responsibility of corporations and county councils.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of recycling waste. However, it is depressing that there has been so much talk and so little action.  I hope that the pious intentions in the Bill become concrete proposals and that action is taken once the Bill is enacted.  Apart from a small area in south County Dublin, there is virtually no kerbside recycling in this country.  There are no facilities for the separation of household waste.  We need to address this urgently.</P>
    <P>The separation of household waste has reached a quite sophisticated stage in other countries.  We have not made any effort in this direction on a community or municipal basis.  Individuals can make an effort by returning bottles, cans and clothes to banks.  However, everything depends on the individual bringing their waste to the bank. This requires transport.  Local authorities need to become involved in the separation of household waste.</P>
    <P>In Italy, waste is so carefully separated that there are special boxes into which people place leftover tablets.  This removes dangerous tablets from circulation.  Waste has been separated for a long time in America.  We think that because we have a small population and a large country, we can continue to treat household waste as in the past.</P>
    <P>The separation of waste does not only apply to households.  We must ask businesses to take more responsibility for their handling of waste.  Some of this waste is toxic and there must be penalties for those who do not abide by regulations.</P>
    <P>I visited a country town where the method of disposing of used tyres was to throw them in the river.  This was most unsatisfactory for the salmon industry.  This crude method of handling waste from small industries has led to the pollution of rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>County councils were largely at fault for the pollution of rivers and lakes.  However, the Environmental Protection Agency report has highlighted the problem of agricultural waste.  I recently heard it said that agriculture is suspected of causing water pollution.  It is no longer suspected of causing pollution; the Environmental Protection Agency report has shown it to be an important contributing factor.</P>
    <P>Industry must also take some of the blame for pollution.  Small factories incorrectly dispose of liquid and solid waste.  Large factories tend to make more of an effort to handle waste properly. We cannot allow a situation where a small factory is opened to provide employment, only to find that it is destroying the tourism industry in the area by polluting rivers or emitting fumes.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the amount of packaging used by the retail trade.  This creates an enormous amount of waste.  Has the time come for us to begin to enforce regulations?  This occurs in Germany <Col N="1338" /> where packaging has reduced greatly in the past few years.  Packages which end up in the household must be returned to the retailer and from there to the wholesaler and the manufacturer to be reused.  There is an increase in the amount of packaging used in food and domestic products.  The opposite should be the case and we need to see what can be done to reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at our performance in Leinster House.  We have increased the use of recycled paper but not by enough.  If we do not give a lead no one else will.  Amendments are now printed on both sides of the paper.  While the Minister may need to have his speech typed on one side only, his words of wisdom would be just as good if they appeared on both sides.  We have the facilities for photocopying on both sides of the paper.  This would reduce by half our use of paper, producing significant savings.</P>
    <P>Another <i>bête noire</i> of mine is the abundance of enormous brown paper envelopes we receive every day which cost about 30p and could be used again.  A spontaneous effort has been made by some members of staff in the House to reuse envelopes.  We ought to make this policy.  It is important not just from the point of view of the huge amount of waste produced but also the cost of the envelopes which are not reused.  When I suggested they be reused I was told it would be demeaning to public representatives if a reused envelope was sent to them.  I doubt if there is anyone in either House who would object to an increase in efficiency.  Perhaps the Minister could raise this matter.</P>
    <P>We will have to consider disposing of the amount of waste produced in the best possible manner.  If we separate waste in a better manner &mdash; and an enormous amount of household waste can be disposed of anaerobically &mdash; we will then only have to deal with more permanent waste. We must stop talking about landfills.  We do not dispose of waste in landfills in this country.  We dispose of waste on perfectly good land which needs no filling in whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We create dumps along with the hazards of leechate going into the ground.  I do not care what type of plastic binliners are put under these dumps &mdash; leechate will come through.  The water table will also be disturbed and polluted.  The Environmental Protection Agency study on water found the quality is deteriorating every year.  We constantly talk about water charges.  I wish we talked about water quality for a change instead of producing dumps.  We should forget they are landfills &mdash; they are not.  The valley in Wicklow does not need to be filled in, it is another dump which will result in vermin, odour and dust which will create a great public nuisance.</P>
    <P>There is a certain enthusiasm about turning waste into energy and the other alternative which has been put forward is the proposed incinerator. I have been told not to call it an incinerator but rather an &ldquo;energy producing efficient unit&rdquo;.  This is good, but there are problems with incinerators <Col N="1339" /> also, although I am not sure that those with dumps are not worse.  However, with incinerators there is the problem of air pollution and dioxins. Modern technology can deal with these in a slightly better manner, but they are extremely hazardous.  An incinerator has the advantage of reducing the bulk of waste enormously.  We could also produce the glass flint bricks also produced in Denmark and England which take up an infinitesimal amount of space compared to that taken up by putting unsorted rubbish in a dump.</P>
    <P>It is good that there are fines, but they must be enforced.  The polluter must pay.  It was appalling to go to town following the St. Patrick's Day Parade and to see the canal, river, streets and even the front of the Rotunda Hospital full of rubbish. It was incredible.  The corporation were out quickly and I saw someone trying to clean up.  As a man was trying to sweep up, another man threw a carton of chips behind him.  Until we do something about this attitude, we are in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>A huge amount of rubbish was dumped outside the corporation dump during the refuse collection industrial dispute in south County Dublin last year.  One television shot showed heaps of domestic rubbish, in the middle of which were four cow's heads and a used fridge freezer.  Is it legal to dump cow's heads on the road?  There must surely be some regulation to prevent this?  Whatever about the fridge freezer, the cow's heads struck me as not the sort of rubbish to be collected by refuse collectors.  Someone took advantage of the dispute to get rid of these heads.  Perhaps it was the same person who dumped the freezer and brought a new one to put the rest of the cows in.  This was an example of how little thought is put into disposing of waste from our homes and businesses, which we leave the corporation to deal with.  We have to make more of an effort.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister for introducing it.  The Bill is important and takes steps not taken before.  It goes a step beyond the idea of &ldquo;Don't litter&rdquo;.  It requires certain operations, citizens and outlets to be proactive.  The impact of littering on the image of a country is not widely understood.  This image is crucial when people arrive in our cities and, more importantly than ever, in our towns and villages. Cities are beginning to deal with the issue of litter, but unfortunately there are villages and towns who have not seen the importance of making a proper impact on tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our anti-litter policy will be successful not when we stop people from dropping litter on the ground but when we get them to pick it up.  There are more people who will stop their children and tell them to pick up bags they have thrown on the ground.  This is what is required.  As a teacher, I know that we find it more difficult in terms of <Col N="1340" /> authority to make children more conscious of litter.</P>
    <P>There has been discussion recently about zero tolerance and most of the proposals have been daft.  Like all proposals, the first premise was a good one: that if people understand and are responsible about the small thing they will also understand the big things.  A child who will not throw litter on the ground or will not leave litter on the beach will hardly break windows or become a delinquent.  There is a connection between this and respect for one's place.  Good citizenship begins with respect for one's place, which begins with keeping it tidy and clean.  Littering is important in the concept of citizenship and how we see our place and value it.</P>
    <P>There is a need to continue litter policy further. There is much discussion at the moment about green politics and whether we are green enough. Much energy has been expended and wasted talking about ridiculous matters which are not that important.  Paper is a replaceable source of energy.  We can cut, plant and replace trees.  It is a continuous resource; it is no different from cutting grass or wheat.  It is cut one year and grown again the next year.  That is different from carbon energy which takes millions of years to replace.</P>
    <P>However, there are other issues, such as plastic bags.  All wrappings should be biodegradable. The Government which gets rid of plastic wrapping &mdash; in other words, ensures we remove non biodegradable material from our environment &mdash; will have taken a huge step forward.  People remember that Dublin is now some free, which was an important move forward.</P>
    <P>When I moved to a country area in north Dublin a local person was involved in vegetables supply. He was running a small business which he had developed and did not realise that plastic covering is non biodegradable.  For a couple of years he ploughed any unsold vegetables returned by supermarkets into the ground in one of his back fields with the wrapping intact.  He did not realise what he was doing.  Fifteen years later, they are still trying to clear that field of plastic bags.  I am not raising that to criticise the man &mdash; he did not realise the plastic would not rot.  We need to, first, educate people about that and, second, ensure that all wrappings are biodegradable. We are a consumerist society.  We will not stop people consuming but we need to control and direct their methods of consumption.  We can do that in various ways, one of which is to deal with wrappings.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to litter management plans for local authorities.  In other countries it is the norm for streets and beaches to be cleaned during the early morning and at weekends.  There is not enough of that in this country.  This Bill might make clear to local authorities their responsibility in this regard.  As part of the litter management plan outlined in the Bill, they should be required to look after their beaches and streets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> I also welcome the responsibility which this Bill places on the owners of vehicles, particularly trucks, skips and mobile outlets.  This is new, will come as a shock to some people and will require public education.  Money should be spent on advertising to make people aware they are required to do this.</P>
    <P>Section 16(9) lists every conceivable kind of premises which can be required by a local authority to be responsible for the land around them or the footpath in front of them, as appropriate. That is very important.  I spoke to the owners of a shop on a main street, which also contained a couple of take-away outlets, in a busy provincial town in the mid-west two months ago.  He brushed the street outside his shop every morning, as did the shop owner next door.  However, the next three shops did not do that.</P>
    <P>We must either say that the local authority has to do it or that everybody is in charge of their own piece of the footpath.  I prefer the second option.  Too many of the actions of our local authorities have been to disable people.  People should be responsible for their area, should be required to look after it and should take pride in so doing. There should be no space for people who are not prepared to contribute to keeping their environment clean and acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be welcomed at all levels.  Local authorities are entitled to say the Government should be aware of the short supply of resources for local authorities which have to implement the Bill.  This must be tied in with the funding of local authorities, which is being discussed in another place at the moment.  It is important legislation. We are trying to sell a clean, green island where people can feel healthy and can come for cleaner air, sweeter water and fresher seas.  This Bill is a good step in that direction and the Department and the Minister are to be complimented.  The draftsmen have done an excellent job and I recommend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  I am glad Senators have expressed strong views on the problem of litter.  I agree we must tackle the problem aggressively.  Firm and vigorous action is required.  This is not an easy challenge but we are determined to take it on.  It is well established that the public feels more strongly about litter than any other environmental problem and is now demanding that something be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has responded positively to these concerns through the action against litter initiative, one of the principal objectives of which is to improve local authority performance in the prevention and control of litter, as well as taking better enforcement action against offenders.  The Bill facilitates this and contains provisions that meet the concerns raised by Senators.  It puts in place a wide-ranging legislative framework for action against litter.  It spells out clearly what occupiers of properly must do to keep their <Col N="1342" /> properties free of litter.  It sets out the powers and duties of local authorities for preventing and controlling litter.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised by Senators, to which I would like to respond.  Some Senators, including Senator Daly, referred to the issue of enforcement.  The need to improve powers and performance in relation to litter enforcement is one of the driving forces of this Bill.  Under section 25(5) the courts will be required to order that fines for litter offences must be paid to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a local authority will also be entitled to ask the court to award the local authority the cost of investigating, detecting and prosecuting offences.  This is set down in section 25(4), which provides that, except where there are special and substantial reasons for not doing so, the court must order a convicted person to pay the local authority's costs.</P>
    <P>Apart from a local authority benefiting financially from the proceeds of fines and costs, which up to now accrued to the Exchequer, this approach follows the polluter pays principle, which is one of the basic principles underpinning environmental legislation.  I assure Senator Daly that local authorities will have the benefit of the proceeds of fines and costs to put towards litter control programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly asked when section 10 would come into operation so that litter management plans could be prepared and implemented.  I assure the Senator there will be no delay in bringing all of the sections of the Bill into force very quickly after it is passed.  In fact, already 40 authorities have completed litter abatement plans, which they are now implementing.</P>
    <P>Senators Daly and Norris raised queries in relation to public roads.  I assure Senator Daly that depositing litter from a car on a motorway is covered by the Bill in the same way as other roads are.  Senator Norries asked why section 6 limits the responsibility of occupiers to those within speed limit areas.  This is intended to define a special responsibility for those in urban areas.  Section 7 places a general responsibility on local authorities in relation to public roads.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly asked for clarification on whether the financial provisional of £400,000 in the Vote of the Department of the Environment would be allocated to local authorities to promote this initiative.  I should explain that the purpose of this provisions is to meet the cost of promoting public awareness and education on a national basis by the Department of the Environment.  It is not intended to make special grants available to local authorities from this modest provision.  Promoting public awareness of the issue can be more effectively done on a national basis by the Department on a cost effective basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran referred to the involvement of the gardaí in issuing on-the-spot fines.  It is not suggested that the gardaí take over this function. which will still be the primary responsibility of litter wardens.  However, it is worthwhile for <Col N="1343" /> gardaí to have this power because many are deployed on our streets and the treat of a garda being capable of issuing a fine should serve to deter people from littering.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran also referred to the success of a tidy schools competition run by Roscommon County Council, of which I am glad to hear. Other local authorities are also involved in promoting schools competitions.  It is something I would encourage for all local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senators Daly and Norris referred to the creation of litter as a result of domestic and commercial refuse being put out too soon for collection and being badly presented.  Local authorities have a power under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to adopt by-laws to regulate the presentation of waste for collection.  Under these it is possible for a local authority to insist that refuse is not put out for collection until the morning of the collection.  If the presentation of waste and refuse is causing a litter problem, I would encourage local authorities to make by-laws to regulate matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Cashin referred to the recovery and recycling of farm plastics.  The use of stretch wrap for silage bales has brought about major improvements for farmers, especially with regard to production and the convenience of handling of silage. Unfortunately, however, there is a downside.  We have become too familiar with the sight of the used wrapping from these bales littering the countryside.  Recently details were given by the Minister for the Environment of a new scheme which will implement arrangements whereby waste plastics will be collected free of charge from farmers which will then be sent for recycling.  The new scheme will be governed by statutory regulations which have been published in draft form.  It is expected that they will come into effect shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle, Senator Lanigan and other Senators raised the issue of plastic bags.  New policy measures are already under way to deal with packaging waste.  Regulations imposing obligations on businesses to deal with such waste will be published shortly.  A voluntary industry led scheme, REPAK, was launched last year to deal with the co-ordination and financing of recovering and recycling packaging waste.  The new regulations will give strong support to the efforts of REPAK.</P>
    <P>It would be premature at the stage to impose charges on plastic shopping bags until the effectiveness of these other actions can be assessed. The introduction of such measures could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in a voluntary industry-led scheme.  The Waste Management Act, 1996, already provides the Minister for the Environment with the power to introduce measures such as charging for plastic shopping bags but it is considered premature to consider this option at this stage.  We should first see how we get on with the industry-led voluntary initiatives in tackling these problems.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the damaging effects <Col N="1344" /> of litter on our tourism industry.  Among the strengths which characterise Irish tourism is our clean physical environment.  Overseas visitors come to Ireland to see the place, mix with the people and enjoy the pace of life.  Bord Fáilte's surveys confirm these findings but they also confirm that many overseas visitors are taken aback by the widespread presence of litter.  They fail to understand how we can allow the outstanding beauty of our countryside to be degraded by indiscriminate dumping and litter.</P>
    <P>The quality of the Irish tourism product has improved enormously over the years in terms of accommodation and food.  However, one of the most frequest complaints now made by visitors relates to litter.  If people take the time and trouble to write about litter we must assume that they are also telling friends about it.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves that in 1996 the number of overseas visitors to Ireland grew to 4.6 million.  Revenue from tourism generates nearly £1.5 billion and provides employment for over 100,000 people.  The action against litter initiative recognises the importance of tourism as one of the key industries in Ireland.  This perception is being increasingly understood by local authorities because tourism is now relevant to every part of the country, with each part vying with each other to attract visitors.</P>
    <P>Again I thank all who contributed to the debate and I look forward to the Bill being passed by the Seanad.  It represents a major step forward in updating and modernising our legislation on litter.  It is an important part of a coherent strategy underpinning the action against litter initiative which is concerned with improving local authority performance, including more effective enforcement against offenders, reforming litter legislation, promoting public awareness and developing partnerships to combat litter.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to tackling the widespread and persistent problem of litter.  Local authorities recognise the need to redouble efforts and under this Bill they will be equipped with stronger and more effective statutory powers.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that penalties will be imposed on local authorities which do not prepare plans or take this matter seriously.  As the Minister of State is aware, there is some concern that, because local authorities have major responsibility in this area, they may fail to honour their own commitments.

A sum of £5,000 could be easily inserted in the Bill but, as the Minister of State said, I am not sure it is necessary.

      <P>In page 25, paragraph (a), line 43, to delete &ldquo;the municipal fund&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a special separate municipal fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make sure there is a separate fund dealing with litter rather than having payments going to the general municipal or local authority funds.  There is a provision for diverting fines imposed by breaches in the litter laws into the municipal or local authority funds.  There should be a separate litter fund supplemented by the money collected by way of fines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are unnecessary and do not achieve what the Senator wants.  This amendment would oblige local authorities to ringfence the money received in fines and penalties. Local authorities are already spending approximately £20 million a year on the control of litter.  If money was ringfenced local authorities would feel they could only spend what was designated for the control of litter and the money taken in would be the only money spent on this. That would not achieve the Senator's aim; this was the response given when this matter was raised in the Dáil debate on this Bill.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's point but the opposite argument could also be made.  We do not want money coming in through fines for litter offences used for public lighting.  If the Minister of State can give an assurance that that will not happen, I will not press the amendment. If a local authority got £50,000 or £100,000 in litter fines, I could not condone it being spent filling potholes.</P>

      <P>The money that will be taken in fines and penalties will be a drop in the ocean compared to what is being spent already.

The Senator should withdraw his amendment and we can discuss it again on Report Stage if he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to bring in legislation declaring our coastline and territorial waters a nuclear free zone.</P>
      <P>Ireland has always highlighted the menace of nuclear energy and the necessity of taking every reasonable measure to protect our population and environment.  Ireland has always maintained a position of concern regarding the control of nuclear energy, especially the shipment of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  The increasing amount of hazardous waste is affecting human health and the environment and there are grave concerns about its shipment.</P>
      <P>The major concern relates mostly to the UK nuclear industry, the volumes of waste materials accumulating and the apparent co-operation between the French, Japanese and British nuclear authorities regarding the disposal of waste and its shipment between these countries.  There are also fears about the expansion of reprocessing facilities in the UK and over the damage being done by discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea. There is growing alarm over the dangers arising from Sellafield and the failure of reasonable success in persuading the British authorities to deal with these problems.  Coastal communities, fishermen and their families and people who use our beaches are seriously concerned and alarmed at the deteriorating situation.</P>
      <P>In the past Ireland has fought strenuously at the IMO and its various committees for the necessity to put in place stricter measures to control the shipment of nuclear waste.  The Minister of State will be aware that Irish representatives at the Maritime Safety and the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the IMO have consistently put forward proposals to have strict safety standards for ships and containers involved in this activity; constant tracking of cargo movements at sea and notification by member states of movement of ships adjacent to the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the movement of radioactive materials between France and Japan and the serious concern which traffic between the United Kingdom, France and Japan is causing. There is an increased risk to the marine environment. Even though container ships used in transporting these materials have been specially designed and assurances have been given to the Government that this traffic is not moving through Irish territorial waters, there is a growing fear that an accident or collision could take place with devastating consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the Law of the Séa Convention confers the right of innocent passage through territorial seas on all ships, there is growing alarm that the articles in the convention should be amended and strengthened.  I know the Minister will avail of this opportunity to inform the House of the up-to-date position regarding the new proposed directive to deal with this matter at the <Col N="1352" /> European Council and to which he referred earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil demands Government action to secure an exclusive nuclear free zone and to undertake the necessary legal and other actions to secure this.  The public are seeking an indication from the Government of its intention to seek amendments to the articles of the Law of the Sea Convention in order that rights conferred on ships to travel through our territorial waters are balanced so that we can prevent ships carrying nuclear waste from doing so.  There is a risk of accidents, collisions and of ships departing from set routes.  There is a real danger that the shipment of nuclear materials will result in a catastrophe and we must take firm action to ensure that every protection is put in place to safeguard the population and the environment.  Through determined action at the European Council and at the IMO Convention we must ensure that we put a strict code of practice in place that will safeguard our position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this motion.  I agree with Senator Daly that we must be aware of the substances which are being carried in our waters.  I am sure the Government share our concern.  Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, vessels have the right of innocent passage through our territorial waters once they are operating in compliance with international regulations.  This right is specifically stated to apply to nuclear vessels. This convention, which was ratified by Ireland in 1995, represents the prevailing international law which, under the terms of our Constitution, we must abide by.  Therefore, Ireland presumably cannot prohibit vessels carrying nuclear materials from our territorial waters.  We seem to be tied into agreements but we must be aware, as Senators Daly said, of what is travelling through our jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Harbours Act, 1996, provides some protection; it provides us with a mechanism to control traffic carrying radioactive materials into Irish ports.  In accordance with the provisions of that Act, the harbour master of a harbour may only permit the entry into a harbour of radioactive material with the consent of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Such materials include medical, industrial and research materials and are subject to licensing by the regulatory service of the RPII, which is the competent authority in relation to such matters.  We are covered to a degree in relation to our harbours.  I agree with Senator Daly that we must be vigilant in this matter and the Government should take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal of this motion as it affords me the opportunity to come before the House and inform Senators of <Col N="1353" /> the Government's strong commitment to a non-nuclear strategy both nationally and internationally. The House should be aware that since coming into office we have maintained consistent opposition to nuclear proliferation and have taken effective action on a number of fronts to deal with the problem of hazardous nuclear waste being transhipped both in our immediate area and on a global basis.  Because of its nature, radioactivity does not recognise international boundaries, as was brought home to us all forcefully in the aftermath of the unfortunate accident at Chernobyl some years ago.  It is not therefore sufficient to attempt to take preventative action at domestic level only, and so efforts at achieving proper security against the effects of nuclear accidents of whatever kind must be made at a regional and international level.</P>
      <P>As the motion refers specifically to the coastline and our territorial waters, it is important at the outset that I should set out the context in terms of our international obligations.  Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982&mdash;UNCLOS&mdash;vessels have the right of innocent passage through our territorial waters once they are operating in compliance with international regulations.  The right of innocent passage applies to nuclear vessels.  However, the Convention does give coastal states the right to confine such vessels to particular sea lanes and to comply with traffic separation schemes.  In addition, foreign nuclear powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances are required to carry documents and to observe special precautionary measures established for such ships by international agreements.  It is well known in international shipping circles that Ireland is anti-nuclear and that we do not wish nuclear ships to transit our waters.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Harbours Act, 1996, effectively prohibits the entry of nuclear vessels to our ports.  In accordance with the provisions of that Act, which were brought into operation on 3 March, 1997 in relation to port companies and harbour authorities, the harbour master of a harbour may only permit the entry into a harbour of radioactive material, within the meaning of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, with the consent of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  Such materials include medical, industrial and research materials and are subject to licensing by the regulatory service of the RPII which is the competent authority in relation to such matters.</P>
      <P>The Harbours Act, 1996, also prohibits the following from entering a harbour:</P>
      <P>(a)  a nuclear powered ship, vehicle or conveyance;</P>
      <P>(b)  a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying any nuclear weapons;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  a ship, vehicle or other conveyance that is carrying nuclear material (within the meaning of section 2 of the Radiological Protection <Col N="1354" /> Act, 1991) or ores or other substances destined for the production of nuclear materials i.e. fissile material, material to be used in the production of nuclear fuel or nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>These provisions apply to commercial vessels. With regard to ships of the naval service of a State, this provision will only apply with the prior consent of the Government.  This is because Article 29.4.1 of the Constitution, which relates to the conduct of foreign relations, provides that the decision whether to ban a foreign state-owned ship from entering a harbour is one for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea has been used for the shipment of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium to and from Sellafield for several years.  The transport of such materials through the Irish Sea, a narrow semi-enclosed sea with densely populated areas in its environs, poses a threat to the safety of people living in these areas and to the marine environment generally.  The implications of an accident or collision need no spelling out to this House.</P>
    <P>Concerns of small island developing states and other coastal states world wide, with regard to the transportation of nuclear materials between Japan, the UK and France led to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation &mdash; IMO &mdash; Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships&mdash;INF Code.</P>
    <P>In ongoing discussions at international level on the INF Code the Department has consistently argued for the following additional requirements to be put in place: the INF Code to be made mandatory; the design of cargo containers and flasks to be evaluated taking into consideration the specific hazards associated with marine transportation; a notification structure to be put in place whereby coastal states would be informed of the passage of INF cargoes past our coast; a liability regime to be established to deal specifically with marine transportation of INF materials.</P>
    <P>At the 1995 IMO Assembly in London I secured agreement from representatives of the 152 countries in the IMO to adopt Ireland's resolution seeking to have the INF code strengthened. The resolution instructs the IMO's Maritime Safety Committee and Marine Environment Protection Committee &mdash; MEPC &mdash; to examine the deficiencies in the code and to report back to the next assembly of the IMO in November this year. An active lobbying campaign was launched by the Department of the Marine and we have succeeded in obtaining much support for our position. Indeed, senior officials from the Department are currently meeting with IMO countries in London. At an EU working group meeting last month Ireland received the support of member states for its request to have the INF code strengthened. The indications are that EU member states will support Ireland at the IMO.</P>
    <P>On 13 September 1995 an EU Directive &mdash; HAZMAT &mdash;concerning reporting arrangements for vessels bound for, or leaving, Community <Col N="1355" /> ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods came into force.  During Ireland's EU Presidency, we secured political agreement from EU Ministers to expand the definition of &ldquo;dangerous goods&rdquo; to include substances coming under the INF code.  This will have the effect of requiring states to report vessels carrying nuclear materials bound for, or leaving, Community ports.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, we are pursuing all avenues to ensure that Ireland's coastline and territorial waters are protected from the possible impacts of nuclear industry.  Following strong representations by Ireland, we have succeeded in having the disposal of radioactive material prohibited within the waters covered by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic.  This prohibition has been given domestic effect by way of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The 1996 White Paper on foreign policy commits the Government to ensuring that the &ldquo;environmental, health and safety issues associated with the nuclear industry are effectively addressed&rdquo; in all relevant fora.  To this end, the Government is actively pursuing a series of actions to address and resolve these issues and has availed of all opportunities to raise its concerns on nuclear matters at bilateral, EU and wider international level, including within the International Atomic Energy Agency &mdash; IAEA &mdash; and the OECD.</P>
    <P>There is a serious and continuing threat posed to the health and safety of the Irish public and Ireland's environment by nuclear facilities at Sellafield, including radioactive waste storage arrangements and aging nuclear reactors in Europe and Britain.  Government strategy to deal with these threats is being co-ordinated and directed by a special ministerial committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea with the result that nuclear matters are receiving an unprecedented level of Government attention.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to taking legal action against Sellafield provided a sustainable case founded on scientific evidence can be established. The review of options in this regard is ongoing and involves the Attorney General's Office, the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, Environment, Health and the Marine as well as the RPII.</P>
    <P>As regards possible avenues for legal action, particular attention is being given to the provisions of the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic.  Under OSPAR, contracting parties are required to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate pollution and to take the necessary measures to protect the marine environment against the adverse effects of human activities so as to safeguard human health and conserve marine ecosystems.</P>
    <P>The new OSPAR convention is regarded as offering a firmer legal structure within which to mount any complaints against Sellafield, although <Col N="1356" /> the need to secure scientific evidence to substantiate alleged breaches of obligations remains.  Relevant scientific reports and research studies are being appraised in conjunction with the examination of applicable law and possible sources of additional evidence are being pursued.  As part of this process, attention is being given to the adequacy of the present monitoring programmes of the RPII and to the possible need for further public health effect related studies.</P>
    <P>The Government viewed with particular concern the Nirex proposal for the construction of a rock characterisation facility near Sellafield which it regarded as a first step, entailing a significant financial pre-commitment, to an eventual underground structure for the permanent storage of UK and foreign radioactive waste.  Opposition to the proposal entailed contacts with Cumbria County Council in relation to the initial planning application from Nirex, bilateral contacts at ministerial and official levels, meetings with the British Ambassador and presentation of the Government's case to the public inquiry established by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment into the appeal lodged by Nirex following the refusal of its planning application.</P>
    <P>The Government also availed of a further period allowed for submissions to the UK authorities on relevant scientific evidence which subsequently became available.  Opposition to the proposal was based on the Government's concerns about the proximity of the waste storage facility to the Irish Sea, uncertainties surrounding the geological and hydrogeological nature of the area and the likelihood of leakage affecting the Irish Sea as well as questions regarding the compatibility of the proposal with UK commitments under EU and international law.  The determined manner in which the Government expressed its opposition and pursued the matter was instrumental in the recent decision by the UK authorities to reject the Nirex proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government has availed of every opportunity, including discussions between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, EU Council of Environment Ministers meetings and through representations to the UK authorities directly responsible, to call for the earliest possible phasing out of aging Magnox nuclear reactors in the interests of public safety and environmental protection. High level diplomatic approaches have been made to the Governments of countries which have, or which are contemplating signing, reprocessing agreements with the Thorp facility at Sellafield for the purpose of highlighting the Government's concerns and opposition to the plant.</P>
    <P>EU involvement in relation to nuclear matters is based on the Euratom Treaty.  The possibility of a review and update of the treaty so as to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects has received attention.  To this end the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Department of Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the other Departments <Col N="1357" /> represented on the ministerial committee, prepared a discussion document for consideration at the intergovernmental conference in the context of the further enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>The Ministerial committee has also overseen initiatives in other areas to counter the environmental and public health risks associated with nuclear activities, including requests to the OSPAR Commission and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD to undertake a thorough technical review and assessment of both reprocessing and non-reprocessing options for spent nuclear fuel management, as well as their impacts on radioactive discharges to the marine environment and work is proceeding on these matters; presentation of a proposal to the OSPAR Commission seeking measures to tackle discharges of the radioactive isotopes technetium-99 from Sellafield which are leading to increased concentrations of the substance in sea water, seaweed and lobster, particularly close to the discharge point off the Cumbria coast; Ireland's ratification of the Nuclear Safety Convention in 1996 and the active promotion by Ireland of a new Global Convention on Radioactive Waste Management. A diplomatic conference will take place this year to adopt te convention.</P>
    <P>In November 1996 the Government decided to offer State financial assistance and other support to the County Louth residents, known as STAD, taking court action against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  The assistance will apply to specific items of scientific investigation, research and other work relevant to the case.  The Government also decided to seek agreement for the removal of the State as a defendant from the action being pursued by the residents.</P>
    <P>By way of further support to the STAD action, extensive information on documentation held by the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications, Environment, Health and Marine and the RPII has been made available.  The Government has also offered medical and statistical expertise to assist the Louth residents with the interpretation of health related data.</P>
    <P>The environmental and public health threats posed by unsafe nuclear installations in central and eastern Europe have also been recognised. The Minister for the Environment supported the declaration issued by the ECE Ministerial Conference, Environment for Europe, held in Sofia, Bulgaria, in October 1995, which, <i>inter alia,</i> reaffirmed Ministers' commitment to phase out such installations.  In implementing these measures emphasis is to be placed on the development of new and renewable sources of energy and the enhancement of energy efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Government is totally committed to protecting its territorial seas from the potential effects of radioactivity.  We must operate within the parameters of international law.  In that connection, we seek to strengthen the international environmental, health and safety regulations associated with the nuclear industry through every possible fora, that is, through bilateral contacts <Col N="1358" /> with the UK, through the EU, through regional conventions and through the United Nations.  I assure the House the Government is totally opposed to the nuclear industry and will continue to do all in its power to ensure it is regulated to the strictest of standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for outlining in detail the Government's position. Whatever differences we may have, it is clear this Government has taken a strong stand on this issue when possible.  Nonetheless, the introduction of legislation would be a move forward.  I am not sure how we would implement it or how we would police and monitor the situation.  However, this is an issue on which we should be united and in recent years parties have adopted a unified approach.</P>
      <P>Nothing is as important as protecting our environment, and I do not say that in a soft or green way.  Such issues should not be thought of as the concern of one political group &mdash; they are the responsibility of all public representatives.  For many years we have lived with the effects of the extraordinary incident at Chernobyl.  We face further catastrophes in the future and people are concerned.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this issue on previous occasions, the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, spoke about the impact of an accident in Sellafield on this country.  We would go out of business if a Chernobyl type accident took place in Sellafield. Sellafield is a mere 100 miles from Ireland whereas Chernobyl is 2,000 miles away.  Generations of people in Europe are still paying the price for the carelessness at Chernobyl.  That disaster was not an accident but was caused by extreme negligence.  One cannot know if there is negligence in Sellafield.  Its public relations personnel would lead us to believe it is the safest place on earth but we know enough to know that we cannot rely on them.  We have seen evidence of mistakes occurring in Sellafield and only the wrong combination of human error and technical breakdown is required for this country to be put out of business.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the issues raised by the Minister of State and to his description of the initiatives taken by this Government.  I do not disagree with any of them.  During the last European elections people argued that Irish Members of the European Parliament had not taken a strong enough stance on this issue.  As far as I am aware, all Irish Members of the European Parliament have taken an extraordinarily strong and effective stance on it.  That is true of both the current and previous groups of MEPs.  We have taken the fight on this issue to Cumbria and we have argued about it on Irish and British soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also crucially important that the Government decided to support the people in County Louth who have taken legal action against British Nuclear Fuels.  It was persuaded to do so by the <Col N="1359" /> last debate on this matter in the Seanad when it was clear the vote would yield a certain result.  It was one of the more positive results of discussions in the Seanad during the past six months.  The Government moved quickly to support those people.  That was good and positive action and the Government is to be complimented on it.  It was reassuring for ordinary people to see that the issue is being taken seriously.</P>
    <P>We must fight the dangers of radiation, Sellafield and the nuclear industry with legislation at home and by seeking directives and proper safety standards from Europe.  We must use global diplomatic initiatives to ensure there is global understanding of the problem.  We should also carry out a public information campaign in Britain.  The British people are not significantly different from the Irish but they are not as aware of the dangers of Sellafield, even though they are as much at risk as we are.  We should be prepared to spend money to make the British people aware of the danger they are creating for themselves and for us.  There is great public demand for the Government to use bilateral contact with other European countries to ensure our position is understood and that pressure is put on the nuclear industry to shut up shop.</P>
    <P>This issue should and must unite politicians and parties.  It is not a &ldquo;green&rdquo; issue.  It is far too important to be left to people in green wellingtons and tweeds.  It must be dealt with by using the highest levels of political authority and commitment. The danger of radiation will affect generations yet unborn.  It is our legacy to our children and their children.  This generation must take a stand and close down this menace 100 miles across the sea.  This issue is as significant as any other issue that might come before us.  Much time is wasted and much energy expended worrying about recycling paper.  That is about as important as cutting the lawn.  Trees can be cut, planted, regrown and cut again in cycles.  One mistake in Sellafield and we will have to leave this Island and try to find an untainted part of the world in which to live, if we are still alive and not atomised by the menace.  I support the motion.</P>

I alighted from an airplane from New York a few hours ago and my brain is probably suspended halfway across the Atlantic.  I was not aware the motion was being taken this evening as I spent most of the afternoon at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  However, although I am not adequately prepared, I feel so strongly about the motion I feel obliged to add my voice to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate Fianna Fáil on putting down the motion but it is a pity only one Fianna Fáil Senator made an extensive contribution.  If the party took the motion as seriously as it should, more of its Senators would have spoken.  Only Senator Daly <Col N="1360" /> spoke and the motion was seconded in a technical fashion.  That is a pity because many members of Fianna Fáil take this issue seriously.  I wish they were present tonight because people reading the Official Report might take the view that the Seanad did not take the nuclear danger seriously.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people of Ireland take it seriously.  Sometimes they even joke about it.  I love prawns and I continue to eat them.  Some time ago, when eating with a friend, I ordered prawns.  &ldquo;You are not going to eat them are you?&rdquo;  she asked.  I said I was because I love prawns.  &ldquo;Those things&rdquo;, she said, &ldquo;they glow in the dark and if you put your finger on one and stick your elbow into a pane of glass you will get an X-ray&rdquo;.  This was her folksy way of indicating that people are genuinely concerned about foods from the Irish Sea.  I am not a scientist and I do not know if it is true that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in the world.  It probably is, but I cannot quote a becquerel level to substantiate the assertion.  There is certainly serious concern in the minds of the public about it.</P>
    <P>That concern partly arises from the public relations exercises of Nirex and British Nuclear Fuels.  Nobody any longer believes a word they say and one is particularly concerned when one discovers there are persistent leaks of radioactive material which we are reassured are not of a significant level and pose no threat to health.  We are no longer prepared to accept these bland assurances.  Should not British Nuclear Fuels and Nirex be concerned at the continuing accidents and leaks, even if they are of a comparatively minor nature?</P>
    <P>I was glad the local authority in Cumbria refused to grant planning permission and a licence for the development of the storage cavern and laboratory facilities in which Nirex intended to further process this dangerous material.  Significantly, the scientific community, including scientists from within the nuclear establishment, registered its concern.  Certain information was leaked from the nuclear science establishment to sabotage the case because that community was so concerned.  That concern is not surprising.</P>
    <P>Chernobyl was mentioned.  We are familiar with the trite phrases, significant though they are, that radiation is not a respecter of national boundaries, and Chernobyl was a classic example of that.  We also know radioactive materials take a long time to become safe.  Many have lives of hundreds if not thousands of years.  This causes many people considerable concern.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister stated that &ldquo;In addition foreign nuclear powered ships and ships carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances are required to carry documents and to observe specials precautionary measures established for such ships by international agreements&rdquo;. I am not sure if this, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982, had much impact in the 1980s.  I remember raising the issue in the House because the United States naval authorities had a policy whereby they <Col N="1361" /> would neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear reactors on their ships.  I wonder if, with the passage of the Harbours Act, 1996, the American naval authorities will be required to discard that policy.  Perhaps the Minister will give some information on that.  I would not like to think American nuclear warheads or reactors could come into our territorial waters unbeknown to the Government, something which was the case during the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to other significant problems: ageing nuclear reactors in Europe and Britain, problems with the Magnox reactor, etc. Chernobyl reared its ugly head again.  The worrying aspect, apart from the possibly defective design of the reactor, is that it was almost inevitable it would have problems, not just because of the nature of its construction but because of the political system within which it operates.  It is my understanding of the electrical industry in the former Soviet Union that commands were given from on high for so many kilowatts to be generated. This was the requirement and whatever had to be done was done to achieve this volume of energy output.  There was no question of safety regulations.  That is significant and it continues to this day.  It is interesting and a little unsettling that certain Governments of the states which comprised the former Soviet Union are using these defective reactors as bargaining instruments to acquire additional funding.</P>
    <P>I am glad the local authority in Cumbria refused Nirex a licence, especially since it was apparently intended to draw this dangerous material from all over the world to reprocess it at Sellafield.  I congratulate the Government for supporting the people in STAD and I hope the action taken will have a continuing impact on this dangerous and troubling area.  I hope the Minister will let the House know if the situation regarding American nuclear submarines and warships has been altered by the passage of recent legislation or whether it remains as it was in the 1980s, when it was previously discussed in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Government for accepting the motion and express my appreciation for the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, for his comprehensive and detailed assessment of the situation and of the action taken by the Government to come to grips with this difficult and thorny issue.  As the Minister of State is aware, there is mounting concern about the issue, especially in view of the ageing condition of most nuclear plants.  An alarming situation is developing regarding some of the discarded nuclear ships, especially those from the former Soviet Union.  There has also been an international outcry about the condition of some of the nuclear installations in central and eastern Europe.  Overall, the Government and the people are faced with a menacing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> Perhaps the most menacing is in the United Kingdom with movement of materials in and out of Sellafield.  While the matter has been discussed at some length and I do not wish to cover it again and while I appreciate the Minister of State's analysis, it is still necessary for him to indicate how the terms of the motion which has been accepted can be put in place.  The Irish delegation at the IMO Convention has possibly undertaken to improve the position.  However, I have not received any indication from the Minister of State as to how we might deal with the statutory framework needed to give effect to the motion.</P>
    <P>All we can do at this stage is to be vigilant about the developing situation and to examine ways and means by which we can strengthen the Irish position.  The Minister of State knows we were instrumental in having amendments made to the Harbours Act, 1996, which gave limited protection to the coastal harbour areas in our jurisdiction.  The main fear is of the risk of collision, accident or mishap in the movement of these containers in the Irish Sea.  While the custom-made 100 tonne container is transported on a specially designed UK registered ship whose design precautions ensure the avoidance of any kind of accident, nevertheless anxiety and fear is created by the risk and danger involved.  In so far as we on this side of the House can be of assistance to the Minister of State and the Government in whatever actions they take to deal with this situation, they can be assured of our wholehearted co-operation in any legislation or regulation they put in place to strengthen opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this question and I acknowledge his continuing commitment to ongoing developments on the waterways of the Upper Shannon.  We both traversed the area I am referring to when the Minister graciously visited Drumshanbo to unveil a plaque commemorating the reopening of the Lough Allen Canal after decades of disuse.</P>
      <P>The reopening of the canal last April has been of significant benefit to those in the immediate area of Drumshanbo and throughout the Lough Allen Canal region from Carrick-on-Shannon up to Lough Allen.  However, a number of communities around Ballinaglara and Drumkeerin, which border the lake on the eastern and northern shores, feel excluded from this economic boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> The Office of Public Works has located two floating jetties on Lough Allen near Hollymount Shore and Spencer Harbour.  The lake is seven miles long and three miles wide.  The difficulty is that once one embarks on an odyssey through the most beautiful of the three Shannon lakes one cannot explore its equally attractive shoreline, or the communities I am referring, to as the jetties are located 40 yards offshore.</P>
    <P>This has created some local angst.  Prior to the Minister coming into office, the Office of Public Works indicated that it was prepared to acquire property on the lake shore at Spencer Harbour and Hollymount Shore.  No progress has been made on either case.  Within the last week a group of investors purchased property on the lake shore on the Ballinaglara side not far from the floating jetty.  A planning application will go before the local authority shortly for the construction of a ten-bedroom hotel including 12 chalets.  This will be a significant economic boost to the area.</P>
    <P>At the opening of the Blackrock Lock the Minister stated that he hoped that the reopening of the canal would lead to this type of investment. However, this hotel project will be undermined if the floating jetties remain without a land link. Firm commitments have been given regarding this development, the property has been acquired and a civil engineer has been engaged to draw up plans which will shortly be presented to the local authority.</P>
    <P>In the light of this development I am anxious to clarify the Office of Public Works's plans for the provision of two landed jetties.  Neither the Minister nor his Department would wish to create any obstacles to inshore development by the private sector.  We have been pillorying the Minister and successive Governments in search of European money.  This is an instance where private individuals are prepared to invest their money and we should give them every possible assistance.  Any obstacle which stands in the way of this project should be removed.  This development must eliminate any doubt that the provision of landed jetties would be value for money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to what the Senator had to say and I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond.  As the House will be aware, my Department is fully committed to the development of the inland waterways of this island.  The Government, with the assistance of the European Union through the Regional Development Fund, has provided over £22 million for the waterways development programme in the period 1994-9.  Before dealing specifically with the subject of this debate I would like to inform the House of the current status of the waterways programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the Grand Canal has been substantially upgraded and the improvement work on the Barrow is proceeding.  Works on the Royal Canal are also continuing with a view to having it <Col N="1364" /> opened to the Shannon by the year 2000.  At present it has been rewatered for over 90 per cent of its length.  Even though it is not yet open to navigation, it is widely used for fishing, walking and canoeing.</P>
    <P>We have retained consultants to design the seven bridges between Mullingar and the Shannon and plan to commence construction on the largest of these at Mullingar in the autumn.  When these bridges have been constructed a major section of the linked waterway network will have been put in place.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware of the attractions of the Shannon.  It is our premier waterway and has been a major tourist attraction since the sixties. The boat hire market continues to expand each year.  At the end of January there were 2,675 registered boats on the Shannon navigation.  Five hundred and twenty five of these are hire cruisers which bring over 50,000 boating tourists to the waterways.  To help the development of this resource we are continuing to invest in new destinations and enhanced facilities along the Shannon. This year we are extending the navigation through a new canal towards Boyle, County Roscommon, along the River Suck to Ballinasloe, County Galway, and carrying out major developments in Limerick city in conjunction with Shannon Development and Limerick Corporation. We are achieving a better result by co-operating with these organisations.  We also intend to commence the planning stage for a number of new facilities along the Shannon, including Ballyleague, Shannonbridge and Grange.</P>
    <P>Outside the connected network we also have projects starting in the Tralee Ship Canal and Galway's Eglinton Canal this year, which again will add to the tourism attractions in both locations.</P>
    <P>In 1994 the connection between the Shannon and Lough Erne was reopened.  Formerly known as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, this waterway was renamed the Shannon-Erne waterway as it linked the two best known waterways on this island.  The growth in the traffic through this waterway has exceeded all expectations and there were times last summer when it was running at practically full capacity.</P>
    <P>The area through which it flows has benefited from the increased tourist revenues and I must pay compliments to the local people who are so enthusiastic about the waterway and whose attitude have guaranteed its success to date and in the future.  The completion of the Shannon-Erne allowed the connected network to be expanded further and visitors can now travel from Dublin to New Ross, Limerick and Enniskillen by water. When the Royal Canal has been completed the last major unnavigable section in the interconnected network will be the Ulster Canal.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to undertake a full scale feasibility study, in conjunction with the rivers agency of the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, which will endeavour to identify <Col N="1365" /> solutions to the many difficulties involved in the restoration of this canal.  The feasibility study will include a cost benefit analysis and an environmental impact assessment of the project. At present a number of shortlisted consortia are preparing their tenders and the contract should be awarded early in the summer.</P>
    <P>Early last year I had the pleasure of joining Senator Mooney at the reopening of the navigation to Lough Allen and I am pleased to report that 754 cruisers visited the lake in its first season. The waterways service of my Department carried out major dredging works at the entrance to the lake to open the navigation channel.  The lock and service blocks at Drumshanbo are, without doubt, some of the best facilities available anywhere on our inland waterways and are a credit to the craftsmen and local specialist firms who were engaged in its construction.</P>
    <P>The lock between the lake and the canal is of special interest as the water level in the canal downstream varies very little during the year while the lake level can vary by over three metres.  As a result the lake level varies from well above the canal level to well below it and so a double lock had to be constructed.  This lock is in fact equivalent to two separate locks &mdash; one set of gates is used when the lake levels are high and the other set when the lake levels fall below the canal level.  The Senator will be also be aware that the waterways service spent over £1.5 million on restoring this navigation.</P>
    <P>At the outset it was decided to provide safe haven moorings at two locations.  The locations referred to by the Senator were selected and floating moorings provided purely as places of refuge for boats in bad weather as the lake is quite long and there were no sheltered locations where boats could tie up in difficult conditions.  It was not envisaged at that time that these refuges would be linked to the shore in the short term. However, the waterways service has now recognised that the linking of the refuge at Spencer Harbour to the land would be useful and there have been discussions with a local landowner with a view to obtaining access to the shore and purchasing the necessary property.  This location is the most sheltered location for boats and is therefore the ideal location to link to the shore.  Following agreement on the land purchase my Department will then have to carry out site investigations to ascertain the ground conditions between the refuge and the land.  In the construction of the original refuge near Spencer Harbour the ground conditions were very bad and very deep piles had to be used to anchor the floating pontoons.</P>
    <P>As regards the second location, the waterways service will be examining locations for access to the lands on the northern side of the lake.  It is unclear at present if linking the refuge at the location referred to as Cleighranmore on the Shannon navigation charts is the best solution. One or two other locations will also be examined before a final decision is made.  In the spirit in <Col N="1366" /> which Senator Mooney raised this matter, his request will be examined by my officials to see what is the best solution.</P>
    <P>However, it is unlikely this second facility will be provided under the current programme, but I assure the Senator we will continue to examine locations on Lough Allen with a view to providing further land access.  I intend to maximise the drawdown on spending on waterways.  Rather than embark on a project to which cannot be finished, if I think the delay is long or interminable I will move it to other projects which have been evaluated, hence there is merit to our evaluating the maximum number of options.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I welcome the clear inference in the Senator's motion that the ongoing work of the waterways service is of economic benefit to the local community.  In recent years my Department has invested heavily in the North Shannon region, and in County Leitrim in particular, and I welcome this opportunity to put on record my Department's commitment to the continuing development of the Shannon navigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his gracious reply and for the specific indications he gave.  I assume that he will convey the information I provided about the proposed development on the northern shore to the Department and that they would accelerate the programme. This was not to be a priority until this new development.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's remarks about the Ulster Canal, I returned today from a meeting of the Central Border Network in Armagh.  One of its priorities is the development of the Ulster Canal.  I am sure the news conveyed by the Minister will be warmly welcomed by tourism and economic interests on both sides of the Border.  I wish him well with that project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and apologise that he has to take this matter this evening &mdash; my request on behalf of St. Joseph's senior boys' school in Clondalkin for the re-employment of a resource teacher taken from the school in 1993-4.  The school believes the projected enrolment figures warrants the reinstatment of the post in the Department's schedule of appointments for the school.</P>
      <P>The specialised provision was originally introduced on an experimental basis in the school year 1992-3 and was organised in the best tradition of the &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; initiative.  Over the years, it has evolved into a well-structured, enriching and integral element of the school's development. Unfortunately, due to fluctuations in enrolments, one of the permanent teachers is due to go back on the panel.  As a result, the resource teacher will be obliged to return to full time classroom duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> I am aware the Minister is conscious of the need for more resource teachers throughout the education system and the vital role they play, particularly in modern urban areas where deprivation can have brutal consequences on primary education.  The resource teacher programme which has been in place has three component parts.  First, a successful remedial programme has been put in place to ensure that children falling behind in basic skills such as numeracy and literacy are given special attention through the resource teacher.  Second, the school has innovatively developed a whole school support unit through the resource teacher, where children who have severe psychological difficulties and their parents can work with teachers and school management to overcome the problem.  Finally, the school had successfully established a counselling service.</P>
    <P>A presentation has been submitted to the Department by the school, and it is one of the most detailed I have ever read.  I look forward to a positive response from the Department of Education.  The number of schools who are looking for this service throughout the schools system is obviously more than the number of teachers we can afford to supply.  This is a difficult area and many of the negative images of urban Dublin we have seen on our television sets and heard on our radios over the past week would cease if more specific resources were put into schools of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great care to what Senator Hayes said.  I understand there is no record in the Department of Education of an application from St. Joseph's boys' school for a resource teaching post.  However, the Senator referred to a presentation made to the Department in March so obviously these contradictory facts can be reconciled.  It may be, for example, that the presentation was related to needs but not a specific application for a post of this type &mdash; I am not in a position to know that.</P>
      <P>I am not saying this to defeat any of the points made by the Senator but rather in the hope that it will be sorted out.  If the Senator can arrange for the details of the special needs of the children attending the school in question, including assessment reports, to be supplied to the Department, the matter will be considered.  Perhaps if the comprehensive presentation made in March could be sent to the appropriate section the matter could be addressed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education, that a range of support services are provided for pupils with special educational needs attending ordinary national <Col N="1368" /> schools.  In some cases, the services of a remedial teacher are sufficient, while in other cases the support of a visiting or resource teacher may be the appropriate response.  There are currently 1,188 remedial teachers in place at primary level and it is estimated that 87 per cent of pupils enrolled in primary schools have access to a remedial service.  Resources must be committed to this part of the education system because many of the problems which arise later could be eliminated if they were addressed at this early stage.</P>
    <P>A more recent innovation aimed at further supporting special needs children on an integrated basis is the introduction of the resource teacher model.  The resource teacher caters for pupils with more serious learning difficulties and disabilities, who require regular periods of sustained teacher input.</P>
    <P>The resource teacher can be attached to an individual school or group of schools, depending on the level of assessed need of the pupils concerned. This service is an alternative to the visiting teacher service, which is also targeted at supporting children with disabilities in ordinary national schools.  The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in addressing the needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary classes.</P>
    <P>An additional ten resource teacher posts were sanctioned for national schools in the 1996-7 school year, bringing the total number of resource teachers now in place to 46; 33 of these are shared posts.  These posts now serve a total of 178 national schools.  Ten of the posts are based in schools in Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Senator's attention to the fact that the number of resource teachers has increased from seven, when the current Minister for Education took up office, to 46 at present. This is a substantial improvement in the level of such support by any measure.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the needs of all national schools, including the particular needs of St. Joseph's boys' school, Clondalkin, will be given every consideration when the Minister for Education is next in a position to make further allocations of resource teacher posts.  She has my support in seeking resources for this urgent work. I hope the information to which I have referred will be useful in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is obviously a degree of confusion concerning the request on behalf of the school for a resource teacher.
